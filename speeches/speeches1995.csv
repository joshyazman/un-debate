"1",25,"AFG",50,1995,"On the eve of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  therepresentatives of the world’s nations are gathered herewith hearts full of hope for a better future  as well as forthe cause of the peace and prosperity of mankind  in anatmosphere of great enthusiasm and animation.The Afghan nation  in spite of the immensedifficulties it has encountered  shares that optimism withmany of the nations represented here  as well asconfidence in its ability to overcome those challenges.War and conflict always bring with them miseriesand devastation. The last 17 years have taught ourchildren only to differentiate the various sounds of guns rockets  tanks and mortars  rather than teaching themliteracy or providing them with basic nutrition  securityand peace of mind.We turn to this world family  as an institutiondedicated to the cause of humanity  the self-determinationof nations  human rights and democracy  to pronounce6itself opposed to the forces aiming to create a bloodbath inan already devastated Afghanistan.When I return to my homeland — the home of 1.7million martyr graves  tens of millions of unexploded land-mines  2 million disabled people  hundreds of thousands oforphans and widows — I am expected to be carryinganswers as to why this world  which claims to becommitted to human rights and justice  has remained aspectator of the sufferings of Afghans  brought about byforeign interference. Why  in spite of the complete peace security and tranquillity prevailing in the capital for manymonths past  have the United Nations offices unjustifiablyabandoned us by remaining outside?Our people find it astonishing that in an era of suchdeveloped mass communication  which leaves no distancebetween different corners of the globe  the apparentlyinsurmountable difficulties — in particular  the actualcauses of the continuing imposed war — are notunderstood. I am confident that there are people whoclearly see the factors contributing to the continuation ofthe conflict. There are forces that insist on seeing ourpolitical system subordinated to their political and economicdesigns and policies. This is the actual source of theconflict.The crisis in Afghanistan is often perceived as asubject of academic studies. Some call this a civil war in asociety that they consider “fragmented”. Others look at it asthe scene of a contest  a struggle for power. Yet others tryto find the roots of the conflict in the ethnic and tribalcomposition of the country. The truth is far more clear:whatever it is  it is not a civil war; nor is it a tribal orethnic conflict; it is an imposed war.We have learned from history that our existencedepends on our unity. We  like many other nations  want tolive in peace and security  as well as benefit from economicdevelopment  welfare and democracy  which will beavailable only in peaceful circumstances. We want to livein peace with our neighbours and to engage in good-neighbourly relations. We leave it up to the astute observersof the United Nations and the impartial analysts of theworld community to judge the efficacy of the UnitedNations in alleviating the sufferings in Afghanistan.The year 1995 opened with good omens forAfghanistan. The country witnessed positive changestowards peace and political stability. Following the removalof the sources of danger from the southern part of thecapital  the people of Kabul found a moment of peace afteryears of being rocketed indiscriminately. Every day sincemid-March an average of about 3 500 refugeesreturned home — mostly to the capital — according tothe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR). Prices fell sharply. Goods andservices became plentiful in the markets. The Governmentreopened 156 schools for girls and boys  and theuniversities reopened in an atmosphere of security andpeace.Official delegations from the United States Switzerland  Germany  France  the United Kingdom  theRepublic of Korea  the Islamic Republic of Iran  Pakistan Saudi Arabia  Turkey  Tajikistan  the Russian Federation Uzbekistan  the People’s Republic of China and theSudan  as well as many international organizations andothers  came to Kabul. High-ranking Afghan delegationsalso travelled abroad.The Islamic State of Afghanistan even won anopportunity to take steps towards peace and regionalsecurity. Among the Tajikistan peace mediators  ProfessorBurhan-ud-din Rabbani  the President of the Islamic Stateof Afghanistan  accomplished the most. We rememberthat his peace initiative conduced to unprecedented andpositive changes regarding the civil strife in Tajikistan.Kabul city  for the first time  hosted direct talks betweenHis Excellency Imam Ali Rakhmanov  the President ofTajikistan  and Sayed Abdullah Nouri  the leader of theIslamic Revival Movement  representing all the Tajikopposition. In a historic press conference the two leadersembraced each other and agreed on a longer-term cease-fire.Confidence-building measures were taken on thebasis of domestic endeavours between Afghanistan andthe opposition. The Islamic State of Afghanistan  with theaim of putting an end to all problems in the country presented to the United Nations a peace plan  on most ofwhose items there emerged  for the first time  a sense ofagreement among all sides. The plan pledged to the nationthe convening of a Grand National Assembly — LoyaJirga  as we call it — within a year. The Islamic State ofAfghanistan  while leaving to the United Nations SpecialMission the question of the creation of an appropriatemechanism for the convening of the Grand NationalAssembly  promised to agree to the participation of theopposition groups in the current Supreme State Counciland in the present one-year-term transitional Governmentuntil the convening of the Grand National Assembly.7As a result of these proposals the people of ourcountry and of the region felt more optimistic about thereturn of peace to Afghanistan. However  those needlesslyafraid of an independent  stable and self-reliant Afghanistansought to change the course of events to coincide with theirown interests. They once again used the made-up Talibangroup — whose actual identity and character and thesources of whose funding and arming are yet to be madeknown to most of the members in this Hall — equippedwith arms  light and heavy  from across the border of ourcountry and with air power. Ironically enough  they recentlychose to target the west of Afghanistan  which  accordingto earlier statements of Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri head of the United Nation Special Mission to Afghanistan was the best model of healthy administration  order stability and people’s welfare.Intent on exposing the Islamic State to instability military intelligence services across the border tried hard tounite the opponents of the State under a single command.They boosted the Taliban mercenaries with their ownfrontier militia. Thousands of those being trained acrossAfghan borders launched attacks against the Shindand airbase and a number of other western provinces of thecountry  including Herat  as a result of which the peacefulcity of Herat was on 5 September turned into a place ofoccupation  chaos and insecurity. A great number ofcivilians lost their lives. Tens of thousands were forced toleave their houses. The bands of the so-called Taliban  orreligious students  began their rule by closing schools forgirls and the universities  as well as banning women fromworking in offices or teaching in schools. They have evenforbidden the use of televisions and videos  and all movietheatres are closed down in the areas under theiroccupation.As the so-called Taliban are said to have the capabilityof jeopardizing any viable peace process in the country  Ideem it necessary to register some basic facts about thismysterious movement.In Islamic countries there are many religious schoolsor “Madrasas” where several subjects related to Islam aretaught. The purpose of these schools is to prepare Muslimyouth for religious service to their countrymen. In no“Madrasa” in the world is the subject of modern warfare such as the use of artillery and rockets  or the flying ofwarplanes  taught. That is the work of military academies.The only modern items the Taliban mercenaries areaware of are advanced armaments. As for their links withthe outside  the most pertinent and very important questionis: if their numbers are about 30 000  as they claim  andeach of them would require $100 for daily and militaryexpenses  who is paying the more than $88 million amonth for their expenses?As for logistical support  for instance  it is calculatedthat in order for the Taliban to keep their transportvehicles  tanks and other armoured vehicles running theyneed more than 15 000 gallons of fuel each day. That isseparate from almost the same amount of fuel that theyrequire as reserve. Again  who is providing them withsuch huge logistical support?The Taliban have no single leader. They claim tohave a Central Council in Kandahar. However  noplatform or political agenda has been made known yet.The declarations of their many leaders are not consistent.On 20 September one of their leaders  Mullah Mishr  toldPeter Greste  a correspondent of the Reuters news agency that the problem of Afghanistan could only be solvedthrough war.The Islamic State of Afghanistan expressed theintense indignation of its people and Government in itsletters of 5 September 1995 (S/1995/767) and 14September 1995 (S/1995/795) addressed to the Secretary-General  calling for immediate measures to end the stateof occupation in western Afghanistan. We specificallyrequested the United Nations to send a fact-findingmission to the western part of the country to investigateand assess the reality of the state of occupation. That isthe responsibility of the Security Council.The resistance of our people together with the forcesof the Islamic State of Afghanistan  against themercenaries and foreign militia  has been furtherstrengthened. As a result  the Province of Ghowr  east ofHerat  once occupied  has been liberated. The foreignarmed intervention  however  reached a new dimension.The bands of mercenaries were reinforced west of Kabulto attack the capital  the plan of attack being engineeredand guided from abroad.We strongly demand that the United Nations SpecialMission break its silence regarding those mercenaries andanswer the relevant questions  including whether this bandis a threat to peace. This is particularly pertinent becausethe Special Mission once considered the Taliban to be apositive factor for peace. Is it not time for the SpecialMission to find out the intentions of the Taliban inrelation to General Assembly resolutions on Afghanistan?Events have proved that the United Nations SpecialMission encountered many difficulties and challenges owing to the lack of an adequate capability to carry out themandate entrusted to it by General Assembly resolutions48/208 and 49/140. To enhance the capabilities of theSpecial Mission  the Islamic State of Afghanistan submitsthe following five-point proposal.First  the necessity to reinforce the Mission requiresthe formation of a contact group on Afghanistan to speedup the peace process. The contact group on Afghanistanshould be composed of one representative of the UnitedNations Special Mission; one representative of theSecretary-General of the Organization of the IslamicConference  which is already active in the peace process inAfghanistan; one representative from among the memberStates of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  butnot a country directly involved; one representative fromamong the members of the European Union; and onerepresentative from among the members of the Non-Aligned Movement.Secondly  the contact group would promote the peaceprocess in Afghanistan by focusing its endeavours in thelight of information  evidence and documents provided tothe Special Mission pertaining to the violation of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.Thirdly  the contact group on Afghanistan wouldsearch for ways and means to end foreign intervention andinterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  and makeeffective and appropriate recommendations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the Security Council.Fourthly  the various proposed programmes to bringpeace to Afghanistan should be studied by the contactgroup in consultation with the involved Afghan parties.These endeavours would have the following objectives:Creation of a commission for the convening of theGrand National Assembly  or “Loya Jirga”; thiscommission would also have the mandate to draft theConstitution  to include a firm disposition guaranteeingdemocracy and human rights for the futureAfghanistan.Convening of the Grand National Assembly  or “LoyaJirga”  within one year.Election of the future leader of Afghanistan for asubsequent fixed term of office.Adoption of the Constitution.Formation of the first parliament from among themembers of the Grand National Assembly  whichcould represent the administrative units of thecountry on the basis of their proportion ofpopulation.Fifthly  the contact group on Afghanistan wouldimmediately approach all Afghan groups and invite themto participate in the Supreme State Council andGovernment  until the formation of the Grand NationalAssembly  or “Loya Jirga”.The contact group on Afghanistan would also playa crucial role in the reconstruction of the country  asrequired by General Assembly resolution 49/140  adoptedon 20 December 1994.We consider that proposal  which has already beensubmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to be a secure and short path towards peace  nationalrapprochement and stability  through the cessation ofhostilities.To those who refuse to accept the one-year lapse oftime for that peace process  insisting on an unconditionaland immediate transfer of power  we say that a period ofone year is not long in the life of a nation. Had therebeen an agreement a year ago for the transfer of powerand for the consolidation of the political process  wewould by now have been in the process of transferringpower.We solemnly ask the General Assembly to take thisproposal into consideration when discussing the agendaitem on Afghanistan during this historic fiftieth session.Having said this  we would like to state — for thosewho insist on the need for a military solution to theproblem — that the Islamic State of Afghanistan  whilewilling to transfer power to a legitimate and lawfulauthority  has the capacity and capability to respond to theterrorist acts of mercenaries linked to foreign quarters.Afghanistan would not allow any circles toundermine the process of the peaceful transfer of powerand the normal political process that is to be implementedunder the supervision of the United Nations and the9Organization of the Islamic Conference. Those cliques ofoutsiders who are recruiting  training  arming  and providingfinancial assistance to the mercenaries — as well asreinforcing them with their own militia — and using suchreactionary groups to destabilize a moderate Islamic systemwhich believes in democracy and human rights  are wrongin their assessments and calculations. Such foreign circlesmay think that after the usurpation of power by the Talibanall will go well for them. In fact  they will add a furtherproblem  especially by bringing onto the scene a factionwhich has no factual presence on Afghanistan’s politicalscene. These circles should be aware that the peace andsecurity in the capital  the actual relative peace and stabilityin the country and in the region  would be jeopardized bysuch an erroneous miscalculation. The same error was madeby the former Soviet Union in 1979.For the record  we would like to emphasize that thosewho ignite a fire in our country will burn themselves. Itwould then be too late to return to the peaceful politicalprocess on which we are now trying to embark.The statement made by His Excellency the ForeignMinister of Pakistan on 27 September 1995 before thisAssembly pertaining to the relation between Afghanistanand Pakistan was itself a clear illustration of hisGovernment’s unfriendly intentions towards my country.The assertions of His Excellency the Foreign Minister ofPakistan  as contained in his statement  need to beresponded to for the sake of the record.First  the Pakistani Foreign Minister was trying toconfuse our friends and to divert the attention of worldpublic opinion from his country’s own acts of blatantinterference in Afghanistan and from the invasion by itsmilitia in assisting the so-called Taliban in WesternAfghanistan to the tragic incident in the Pakistani Embassyat Kabul.In this regard the following explanations are necessary.I express  on behalf of His Excellency the President and theGovernment and the people of Afghanistan  profound regretabout the very sad and grievous incident that occurred inthe Embassy of Pakistan at Kabul on 6 September 1995.This message has also been forwarded by an official noteof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan to theForeign Ministry of Pakistan. Furthermore  I have conveyedtwo messages by telephone from Kabul to His ExcellencyMr. Najmuddin Sheikh  Foreign Secretary of Pakistan.The tragic incident contradicts the traditionalhospitality of the Afghan people. While we express ourgrief at the incident  which we consider unjustifiable  atthe same time we say that some aspects of the eventshave been overlooked by the Foreign Minister ofPakistan  whose Government tried to use different forumsfor political gains through a distortion of the facts.Allow me  for the sake of the record  to point outthe sequence of incidents as they occurred. On 6September 1995  on the morrow of the occupation ofHerat City by the so-called Taliban mercenaries  with thehelp of foreign militias  the people of Kabul held apeaceful demonstration. Tens of thousands of peacefuldemonstrators gathered outside the compound of theEmbassy of Pakistan at Kabul chanting anti-Pakistanislogans. The staff of the Embassy  contrary to allrecognized principles of international law  used a firearmfrom inside the Embassy premises against the peacefuldemonstrators. This caused the death of one of thestudents  a student by the name of Badruddin Muslim  aneleventh grader in the Naderia High School of Kabul.This highly unjustifiable and provocative act of theEmbassy staff incited the fury of the demonstrators  whoin the beginning were non-violent and peaceful  gatheredonly to express their deep resentment at the occupation ofpart of their country.It is noteworthy that the security forces of theGovernment were already active in the early morning having observed the spontaneous gathering of people indifferent parts of Kabul city. The security forces formedtwo security belts around the Embassy premises.However  the death of the young demonstrator caused asudden reaction and  unfortunately  the crowd got out ofcontrol. The security forces tried their utmost to preventthe upsurge of violence and to protect the Embassy andits staff. Regrettably  despite the losses suffered by thesecurity forces  five of whose personnel were killed whileprotecting the Embassy  they did not succeed inpreventing this tragic event. Mr. Ejaz Ali  the ThirdSecretary of the Pakistani Embassy at Kabul  a witness tothe event  acknowledged in an interview at Islamabadairport on 7 September 1995 that the security forces ofthe Afghan Government exerted efforts to avert the tragichappening.We declare from this rostrum that the Afghan nationnever had recourse to terrorism  even during the longyears of resistance against the invasion of their country bythe former Soviet Union. That fact clearly shows that despite heavy sacrifices by the Afghan nation  it neverhad recourse to terrorist acts against any consulate orembassy of the former Soviet Union.10Secondly  in his statement the Foreign Minister ofPakistan referred nine times to the Islamic State ofAfghanistan as the “Kabul regime” or the “Rabbaniregime”. We do not intend to reciprocate with similar unfairlanguage because of our sincerity and commitment tofriendship towards Pakistan.Thirdly  it is ironic to witness His Excellency theForeign Minister of Pakistan prescribing the type  natureand characteristics of a government that he would like tosee in Afghanistan. My delegation  however  reciprocatesthe sense of good will and brotherhood he expressedregarding our two nations. Moreover  we recall withappreciation the strong sense of brotherhood and Islamicsolidarity by which the fraternal nation of Pakistan extendedits support to the just struggle  the Jihad of the Afghannation  against the invading forces of the former SovietUnion. We trust that our Pakistani brothers are also fullyaware of the sacrifices we made when Afghanistan servedas a shield for the protection of Pakistan territories againstthe most important mobilization of an army since the warin Viet Nam.However  our complaint is addressed  not to the nationof Pakistan  but against the manifest interferences ofPakistani authorities  especially the Inter-ServiceIntelligence (ISI)  which is the Pakistani militaryintelligence. Sometimes the explanations of the PakistaniGovernment  which claims to remain impartial  seem to bejustified owing to the fact that the Pakistani civilianadministration is not capable of containing the operations ofthe ISI  a powerful military-intelligence body which hasemerged as a State within the State.Secondly  we wonder which of the internationallyaccepted norms and principles governing relations betweennations justify the Pakistani desire to prescribe the type andcharacteristics of government for a sovereign andindependent neighbour. Could there be any clearer exampleof Pakistani interference in our internal affairs?The Foreign Minister of Pakistan has repeatedlyclaimed that Pakistan is not interfering in the internalaffairs of Afghanistan. Let us leave aside all evidencepertaining to the aggression of the Pakistani frontier militiaon Afghan territory  as set out in the documents of theSecurity Council that we have submitted  as well as thecomments and statements of independent internationalreporters and scholarly analysts on Afghanistan identifyingand highlighting the interference of Pakistani militaryintelligence in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as the onlysource of the present-day conflict in Afghanistan. We needonly refer to internationally recognized newspapers: TheWashington Times  in its issue of 24 September 1995  TheTimes of London  26 September 1995  and The CanberraTimes  11 September 1995.Both The Washington Times and The Times ofLondon quote Ambassador Mestiri’s comments regardingthe so-called Taliban and Pakistan’s involvement insupporting them.The Times of London of Tuesday  26 September1995  under the headline “Student army gives notice ofattack on Kabul”  states “Mahmoud Mestiri  who heads the United Nationspeace efforts in Afghanistan  said he was convincedPakistan was behind the Taliban group”.The Washington Times of 24 September 1995  in anarticle entitled “Pakistan aid to rebels has Kabul talkingwar”  states “Even the United Nations special envoy toAfghanistan is suspicious ... The power of Talibanis mysterious'  envoy Mahmoud Mestiri said. Ithink they are getting money and help  maybe fromPakistan'.”The same article  written by Ian Stewart of the AssociatedPress  contains a description of a Taliban fighter:“One of a new breed of noble fighter inAfghanistan  the dust-caked 19-year-old is armedwith a Kalashnikov and the writings of the MuslimProphet Mohammed and trained  he says  inPakistan”.In his statement  the Foreign Minister of Pakistancannot conceal the true intention of his Government withrespect to Afghanistan. He inadvertently uncovers theintention:“provocation will not deter us from our steadfastpath of neutrality towards the Afghan people and theunity of Afghanistan or from non-interference inAfghanistan’s internal affairs  nor will it affect ourabiding friendship and brotherhood with the Afghannation”. (Official Records of the General Assembly Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings  8th meeting p. 22)11However  subsequently the Foreign Minister of Pakistannegates the spirit of the above by saying “In the meantime  we would like to assure the peopleof Afghanistan that we shall stand by them in theirhour of trial. We shall not abandon them.” (ibid.)I am certain that the words “we shall stand by them in theirhour of trial” will raise a question in the minds of theMembers of the Assembly: what could Pakistan’s intentionbe in making such a statement?The former Soviet Union’s aggression in Afghanistanis long over. Our nation would like our neighbours and theworld to assist us in our endeavours towards nationalreconciliation and peace.Moreover  His Excellency the Foreign Minister ofPakistan promises that they will not abandon the Afghans.The Assembly should realize that this amounts to assuringthe opposition of the Afghan Government that Pakistan willcontinue interfering in Afghanistan’s affairs in their favouruntil the Islamic State is destabilized and a proxyGovernment obedient to the will of Pakistan’s Governmentis brought to power.The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan has castinto doubt the legitimacy and legality of the AfghanGovernment and the territory governed by it. We call onHis Excellency the Foreign Minister of Pakistan to allowany impartial observer to visit the north-western agenciesand find out if the central Government of Pakistan has anyadministrative authority over them. Is it not a fact that theproduction of firearms has continued  as an ongoingtraditional trade  ever since the establishment of Pakistan?Where is heroin  the most dangerous enemy of humanity produced and refined? John F. Burns of The New YorkTimes wrote “Top army officers have been accused in the past ofconniving with drug lords  to the extent of runningheroin shipments to Karachi aboard army-ownedtrucks”. (“Heroin scourges million Pakistanis”  TheNew York Times  5 April 1995  Section A  p. 12)The Islamic State of Afghanistan and Pakistan willboth be losers if they try to confront each other. The onlyway leading towards securing both countries’ highestinterests is to re-establish  broaden and consolidate theirmutual brotherly relations on the basis of equality of States respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereigntyand the right of each to determine its own future.President Rabbani is a strong believer in theperpetual necessity for both countries to establish ties offraternity and cooperation. Both countries  and the entireregion of Asia where they live side by side  will gainthrough Afghan-Pakistani friendship.While the international community is deployingefforts to prevent conflicts and wars  the peace andsecurity of individuals and of human communities areunder the threat of an undeclared and inhumane warwaged by the world’s terrorists. This year the world haswitnessed terrible terrorist acts  such as the tragedies inOklahoma City  Paris and Tokyo  in which many innocentcivilians lost their lives.Prosperity and the welfare of the human beingcannot be secured without tranquillity and peace of mind.If the international community does not take drasticmeasures to eradicate terrorism  people in differentregions of the world will continue to live in fear andunder the menace of terrorist acts. Islam teaches theprinciple of the rights of innocents to live in safety anddignity. The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers thatthere is a great need for the signing of an internationaltreaty ensuring meaningful cooperation between States  inthe form of a convention to combat terrorism.Afghanistan  as one of the early Members of theUnited Nations  contributed to the drafting  discussion andadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand participated in the drafting of both Covenants ofHuman Rights. We once again reaffirm our deepcommitment to these international instruments.The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers respectfor human rights one of its fundamental objectives.During the year under consideration  however  the humanrights of a number of Afghan citizens in the country  aswell as international humanitarian law  have unfortunately  been violated as a result of the continuedterror perpetrated by the so-called Taliban. The Talibanmercenaries’ closing of schools for girls and deprivingwomen of their right to work has been a major violationof human rights. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has theconviction that taking appropriate and effectiveinternational measures towards putting an end to foreigninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan wouldserve as a major step towards the realization of humanrights in the country.As far as the issue of women’s rights in Afghanistanis concerned  as brought to the attention of Mr. Paik  the12new United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rightsin Afghanistan  during his recent trip to Kabul  suchconcerns do not seem to be appropriate in the case of acountry where 383 women army officers  ranking from theposition of Lieutenant-General to lower positions  defendtheir people and country; where women are serving aspilots in the Army  as well as parachutists; and wherewomen are representing their country at Afghanistandiplomatic missions and are serving in various branches ofthe Administration. Women’s rights are guaranteed in thepresently enforced laws and regulations governing the lifeof our nation.I turn now to the question of land-mines. For the firsttime  an international meeting was held in Geneva on mineclearance. This meeting further enhanced internationalawareness of different dimensions of the land-mine crisisand contributed to strengthening international cooperation.It is an alarming fact that every year  while 100 000 land-mines are removed  more than 2 million land-mines arelaid. An estimated 30 people are killed by land-mines  andas many as 60 are maimed  every single day. The slowpace of demining operations is another major concern to benoted. According to the International Committee of the RedCross (ICRC)  at the current pace of the mine-removalprocess  it will take 1 100 years to get rid of existing mines- and the laying of mines continues in different regions ofthe world.As we already stated in the Geneva meeting on mineclearance  only the adoption of a convention which wouldban the production  sale and stockpiling of all varieties ofland-mines  and especially a sincere commitment on thepart of mine-producing countries to such an instrument would serve effectively to put an end to this problem.Afghanistan  a war-stricken country  where the largestnumber of land-mines have been laid  needs furtherassistance from the international community. This assistancewould further help the cause of the repatriation of refugeesand the revitalization of agricultural activities all over thecountry.The Islamic State of Afghanistan expresses its seriousconcern at the acts of aggression and genocide that continueto be committed against the people of the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina. Effective measures should betaken to put an end  once and for all  to this tragic crisis.Srebrenica and Zepa must be restored as safe areas and thesiege of Sarajevo must be ended. The International Tribunalon war crimes in the former Yugoslavia should bring tojustice those Serbian civil and military individuals whoperpetrated crimes of war and genocide  and crimes againsthumanity. Afghanistan has repeatedly maintained the viewthat the arms embargo against the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina is not applicable de jure. The right of thevictim to self-defence has to be respected and restored.I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to oneof the great threats to the life  health and well-being ofpresent and future generations. This man-made plague isnarcotic drugs  and its production  sale and smuggling.The expansion of the poppy fields in my country Afghanistan  as one of the legacies of war  is unfortunate.Statistics show that the cultivation of poppy increasedduring 1994  as compared to 1993. This is in spite of theallocation of about $25 million  which the internationalcommunity spent in Afghanistan through non-governmental organizations. The Islamic State ofAfghanistan cannot agree to the procedure through whichthe assistance was channeled. Perhaps an evaluation isneeded to correct the procedure. The Islamic State ofAfghanistan declares its sincere readiness to cooperateeffectively with regional and international organizations.We are working for the preparation of a master plan toeffectively combat narcotic drugs on the regional andinternational levels. We have invited Mr. Giacomelli  theExecutive Director of the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme  to visit Afghanistan and speedup the drawing up of such a master plan.We have had critical episodes in our life  but wehave a vision of a peaceful and stable Afghanistan; anAfghanistan which it is hoped this Assembly will renderfree of foreign interference in its internal affairs; anAfghanistan where our people come to be blessed withbrotherhood and understanding  national conciliation andunity; a country to which its 3 million refugees will havereturned with confidence and assurance  and where ourintellectuals  as a source of hope  will dedicate their vastenergy and experience and their scientific and physicalpotential to the cause of rebuilding their country; acountry that will once again serve as a major factor in thestrengthening of regional peace and stability; a countrythat will be actively involved in the common efforts ofthis world family in combating extremism  adhering to apositive and dynamic impartial and non-aligned policy and firmly participating in combating terrorism and drugabuse. Such a vision takes its source from the heart of ournation.Our expectation of the world community is that itassist us in achieving these goals. The objectives of thereconstruction and economic development of Afghanistancannot be achieved without economic assistance from13industrialized nations and other countries that are able tofurnish such assistance. Afghanistan has enormouseconomic capabilities. During the time the former SovietUnion thought of our country as its strategic backyard  theworld’s major corporations were prevented from becominginvolved in the exploration of Afghanistan’s naturalresources and wealth. At the threshold of Afghanistan’sreconstruction and rehabilitation  possibilities exist for theexploration of our natural wealth  such as natural gas  oil copper  iron  precious stones and even uranium.Afghanistan can become a major producer and exporter offruit. Once the crisis is over  Afghanistan will emerge asone of the most attractive sites for private investment.Afghanistan  a land-locked country  is now vitally importantat the heart of Asia  connecting Central Asia to the southand the Middle East as a historical transit route.From this rostrum  we invite the industrializedcountries  as well as private sectors  to benefit from theenormous investment opportunities in our country. In thiscontext  the Islamic State of Afghanistan warmly welcomesdelegations determined to conduct relevant studies  as it isexpecting a number of potential investors in the comingmonth. This move would itself contribute towards thefurther strengthening of stability and an early return ofpeace to Afghanistan."
"2",64,"AGO",50,1995,"Permit me atthe outset  Sir  on behalf of the Government of theRepublic of Angola and of my entire delegation that isaccompanying me  to express my satisfaction at yourelection to the presidency of this session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. We are convinced thatyour excellent personal qualities and the diplomatic skillyou have accumulated will guarantee the success of theconduct of the work of this significant session. Yourelection is also well-deserved recognition of the importantcontribution which your country has made to thepromotion of peace and international security. I assureyou  at this stage  of the cooperation of my delegation.We commit ourselves to doing everything to support thisarduous but honourable task with humility and a sense ofresponsibility.I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressingmy appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. AmaraEssy  for the dedication and interest with which he carriedout the activities of the Assembly during his mandate.Similarly  I address my remarks to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has tenaciously doneeverything  to find the very best solutions for theproblems afflicting humanity  pledging to provide ourOrganization with the dynamism needed to face futurechallenges.The fiftieth session of the General Assembly  whichcoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding ofthe United Nations  provides us with an opportunity toengage in profound reflection on the extent to which wehave moved forward towards the realization of its maingoals  inter alia  preservation of international peace andsecurity  promotion and protection of human rights  andeconomic and social development  with a view to lookingmore optimistically and more boldly at the challengeswhich lie ahead on the eve of the twenty-first century.In fact  although the changes that took place in thewake of the cold war led to a certain easing ininternational relations and promoted  as never before democratic values  the international situation neverthelesshas continued to deteriorate in recent times in thepolitical  economic  social and financial spheres. Conflictsof all sorts proliferate  affecting principally the countriesof the so-called third world and creating a climate ofuncertainty as to the future of humankind.As we approach the twenty-first century  we facenew and greater challenges that will necessitate joint 12concerted action by the Members of the United Nations.This will require a new democratic structure in internationalrelations  in the broadest sense.More than ever before  we need to think about theobjectives and role of the United Nations  as set out in theCharter  and focus on that task.The process of restructuring the United Nations shouldlead the Organization to an arrangement that reflects thenew challenges we face in the world at this time and thatwould allow for the broad participation of its Members. Weare convinced that the present structure of the UnitedNations — and in particular that of the Security Council —does not meet the present needs of post-cold-warinternational relations. Apart from the restructuringundertaken in the agencies that coordinate economic andsocial development worldwide  priority should be given tothe restructuring of the Security Council  whosecomposition continues to be a reflection of the cold war.The enlargement of the Council should take place withrespect to the categories of permanent and non-permanentmembers alike. This will require taking into considerationthe need for geographic balance.We are also in favour of restructuring the methods ofwork of the United Nations so as to make them moretransparent.Furthermore  it is important to guarantee theeffectiveness of the mechanisms and means of ensuringimplementation of the decisions of United Nations organs.In recent years  the General Assembly has adoptednumerous resolutions  and important global strategies havebeen defined in various forums under the aegis of theUnited Nations  aimed at solving problems afflicting allhumankind. These problems range from the livingconditions of children  the environment  human rights population problems and social development to  morerecently  the issue of the situation of women  dealt with atthe Beijing Conference.The time has come to take action. The unsatisfactoryfunctioning of some of the mechanisms for monitoring theapplication of decisions and the weak commitment of Stateshave been the root cause of the failure to carry out many ofthese recommendations.The world socio-economic situation continues todeteriorate  particularly in the so-called developingcountries  where many economies are on the verge ofcollapse.Public assistance for development has sunk todeplorable levels. United Nations agencies involved indevelopment have seen their budgets severely affected bythe financial crisis  resulting in cuts in numerousprogrammes that were destined to help raise developmentindicators in various countries. To give just one example the annual report of the Secretary-General indicates thatthe United Nations Development Programme experienceda reduction of $1.4 billion in the period 1992-1996.Structural adjustment programmes undertaken invarious countries have not produced the desired results leading to reductions in national funds in the social field.These negative factors are cumulative  and added to themis the heavy burden of external debt  whose service aloneconsumes a large part of the gross national product ofdebtor countries.Africa’s capacity to repay debt has been negativelyaffected not only by weak economic structures inheritedfrom the past  but also by natural disasters and internalarmed conflicts. In view of this situation  it is necessaryto adopt measures that are more just and less prejudicial so that debtor countries can pay their external debtwithout hindering their development or requiring furthersacrifices on the part of the poorest segments of theirpopulations.The principal international financial institutionsshould grant more favourable credit to developingcountries  so that the remedies applied to their respectiveeconomies will not lead to a deterioration of the health ofthose economies.The present international economic order does notfavour the economies of the so-called third world. It isthus necessary to have a more just international economicorder  without protectionist measures that impedeinternational business relations and create discriminationagainst developing countries  the majority of whichbecome sources of raw materials and inexpensive labourand importers of manufactured goods.The strengthening of south-south cooperation andregional economic integration will  as we see it  be anadequate response to this trend. Countries of the southernregion of Africa  to which Angola belongs  have provideda good example of regional integration  both economicand political  by forming the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC). Given the prospectsfor total political stability in the region and its economicpotential  the region may well transform itself into an13important development zone. In the same way we value thejoint regional integration between members of the Zone ofPeace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic  of whichAngola is also a member.In successive resolutions the General Assembly hasrecommended that priority be given to our continent interms of aid for development  because it is the region of theworld that has most suffered the tragic effects ofcolonialism. But reality shows a significant drop inresources available for development. This aggravates theprecarious economic situation of African countries that haveno capital and no technology  which increases poverty andmakes them susceptible to serious internal conflict.If  as we have just indicated  it is true that we arewitnessing  nearly everywhere  some proliferation ofregional conflicts that put peace and international securityat risk  it is also true that in Africa these conflicts havereached a level of great danger. Not only is the dimensionof such conflicts a source of concern but so is their nature.Its markedly ethnic  racial or religious character is beingused to justify intentions which place at risk the unity andterritorial integrity of several nations.The inadmissible genocide that occurred in Rwandaseriously damaged the values of human dignity andtolerance. Above all  it demonstrated the need for theinternational community to seek new ways and means toeliminate the focal points of conflict and to guaranteeprotection for civilian populations  the people who are theprimary victims of internal conflicts.In Burundi we are concerned about the deterioratinginternal situation. In this connection the internationalcommunity  and the United Nations in particular  shouldshoulder their responsibilities in order to help avoid therepetition in that country of earlier events by supporting byevery means available the efforts carried out by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) mission with a viewto fostering peace and stability.In Somalia the continuing fratricidal war that is tearingthat society apart is threatening the very existence andintegrity of the country. The international community  andthe United Nations in particular  cannot and should not failto shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis the people ofSomalia.We pay tribute to Liberia for the recent developmentsin that country  thanks to the recent Abuja peace agreementbetween the warring parties. We hope that this agreementwill finally bring lasting peace to the Liberian people.Concerning Western Sahara  we join our voice to thevoice of the international community in urging theinterested parties to observe the United Nations peaceplan.Despite its own internal difficulties  the Governmentof the Republic of Angola is doing its utmost to supportOAU efforts within the framework of Africanmechanisms of prevention  management and resolution ofconflicts. In that context we did not hesitate to make acontribution to a resolution of the crisis faced by thepeople of the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe afterthe coup d’état of 15 August. As the Assembly will beaware  Angolan mediation helped to restore democraticinstitutions and constitutional order in that country. Wehave acted on behalf of the historic solidarity which linksour two peoples in a common struggle for democraticliberties and respect for the law of constitutionalinstitutions.Thanks to the support provided by the internationalcommunity  particularly the Portuguese-speakingcountries  along with the European Union  France andPortugal in particular  and of course the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  we were able  in a short period oftime  to get an agreement between the parties on 22August last.The conflict in the countries of the formerYugoslavia is one of the most complex conflicts seen inEurope since the end of the cold war. The Government ofAngola is concerned about this conflict. We support thecurrent peace initiatives and hope that the meetingbetween the parties involved and the mediators will leadto concrete results  to the satisfaction of the peoples ofthe region.The situation in the Middle East has been marked bysome important and significant developments since thesigning of the agreement between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of thenormalization of bilateral relations among countries of theregion.Such advances are quite encouraging. We areconfident of a final end to the Arab-Israeli conflict if wecontinue to see political will  a constructive spirit andflexibility demonstrated on all sides. Angola has alwaysdefended the right to self-determination of the people of14Palestine and the restitution of the occupied Arab territories.We here reiterate our support for the peace process that isunder way and express our opposition to acts of violenceintended to call into question the continuation of thisprocess.The question of East Timor continues to prick theconscience of the international community. It is necessaryto ensure that the people of East Timor enjoy the legitimateright freely to choose its own destiny and that this berecognized. In this regard the United Nations has animportant responsibility  which it cannot escape.We are particularly encouraged by the opening of adialogue between Portugal and Indonesia. But there will bepositive results only if the interests and options of thepeople of the Territory are borne in mind during the searchfor a just and acceptable solution.Angola shares with the people of East Timor acommon past of struggle against Portuguese colonialism.We will continue to give our utmost to the search for a justand acceptable solution.By sustaining an economic  commercial and financialembargo against Cuba for more than 30 years the UnitedStates of America has created a paradox within the realityof our times. The embargo is a set-back to internationalefforts to eliminate the last relics of the cold war. Angolatherefore reiterates its opposition to this unilateral measure whose extraterritorial impact is in violation of internationalnorms of free trade and international law.Practice shows that constructive dialogue is the bestsolution for resolving differences  similar to that whichoccurred in reaching a solution to the problem of migrationbetween the two countries. We think that it is up to thepeople of Cuba freely to decide their own destiny.Obviously  I cannot refrain from making reference tothe situation in my own country  which will be of interestto many here. As is known  after long years of war Angolafinally found the path to peace  starting with the signatureof the Lusaka Protocol and the initial steps taken toimplement its provisions. It is an agreement thatcomplements the fundamental structure of the peace processestablished by the Bicesse Accords  which were signed withthe mediation of the Government of Portugal.Since the signature of the Lusaka document in 1991and the cease-fire agreed to in November last year  thesituation in our country has evolved significantly  despitesome negative aspects and obstacles that I shall mentionshortly. Major offensive military actions have stopped leading to the free movement of people and goods inmany areas of the country under Government control. Weare now seeing the return of thousands of displacedcitizens to their areas of origin.In the political area  a direct dialogue has begunbetween the Government and UNITA  between HisExcellency the President of Angola and Mr. Savimbi.This has facilitated the resolution of many problemsrelated to the implementation of the Accords that werenot resolved at Lusaka.In addition  the Government has taken importantsteps to strengthen the climate of mutual trust and tomake reconciliation possible. Within this context  theGovernment supported a legislative initiative to modifythe Constitution to accommodate the leader of UNITA asone of the two Vice-Presidents of the Republic. Thatsignificant political gesture  along with the futureintegration of UNITA members in a government ofnational unity  will create conditions for Angolans toenjoy a definitive and lasting peace in a climate oftolerance  free from hatreds or resentment.Despite those efforts  which my Government viewsas positive  we continue to be concerned by the excessivedelays in the implementation of the peace process  whosemost serious issue is the quartering and demobilization ofUNITA forces  which has not yet been implemented as itshould have been under the Lusaka Accords. This delayhas resulted in some serious recent problems andincidents in some regions of the country. Such incidentsdo not at this time pose a serious threat to peace  but theyare capable of creating dangerous focal points of tensionthat call into question the trust that is needed for fullimplementation of the Peace Accords.My Government would like to take this opportunityto express its gratitude for the work done by the UnitedNations Observer Mission in Angola. It has by and largeassured respect for the provisions of the Peace Accordsand has involved the presence of many countriesrepresented here. We believe that the completedeployment of peace-keeping infantry units will make itpossible better to control the implementation of thecommitments made in Lusaka.The post-conflict phase in Angola will require urgentmeasures of a special economic and social nature in orderto move the country rapidly out of the state of crisis  to15rebuild its productive and social infrastructures and toprevent a return to war  measures which must guarantee thesocial reintegration of thousands of military personnel  ofwhom some 150 000 are to be demobilized  and the returnof refugees and internally displaced persons who arereturning to their areas of origin.As I speak  a meeting is being held in Brusselsbetween my country and the European Community to comeup with an overall plan for national reconciliation. Fromthis rostrum we should like to express our thanks to allcountries that have assisted us and to all the United Nationsagencies that have made it possible to organize thisimportant meeting  the first round table meeting in Brussels.My Government has entered in earnest on to the task ofachieving national reconciliation in our country. As we saidearlier  a community rehabilitation programme has beencreated  in collaboration with the United Nations  to thisend. It has a budget of $700 million that will be open to alldonor countries in Brussels with a view  inter alia  torestoring in the shortest possible time basic productionactivity in the 18 provinces of the country.We are aware that the rapid recovery of the Angolaneconomy will depend largely on our success inimplementing this programme and achieving peace andharmony in our country. It is an economy that saw its grossnational product and per capita income decrease by one halfas a consequence of war. Thus  we would like once againto request the international community to continue to lendassistance to Angola in order to achieve complete peace andreconciliation among all Angolans. We hope that canbecome a reality."
"3",111,"ALB",50,1995,"It gives me special pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Diogo Frietas do Amaral of Portugal onhis election as President of the General Assembly at itsfiftieth session. I take this opportunity to extend to him mybest wishes for success in the deliberations of thisimportant gathering  and I assure him of the fullcollaboration of the delegation of Albania.I also congratulate Mr. do Amaral’s predecessor  Mr.Amara Essy  on the excellent way he conducted the workof the last session of the General Assembly.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali I wish to express my highest regard for his unfailingendeavours to provide the Organization with ever moreeffective leadership.My warmest greetings go to the Republic of Palau  thenewest State Member of the United Nations.Since March 1992 — the time of the final break withthe Communist regime — Albania has made tremendousprogress in its democratic processes. The building up andstrengthening of political pluralism  the rule of law respect for human rights in general and for those ofminorities in particular  as well as the transition from acentralized to a market economy  constitute the maindirections in which Albanian society is moving. Thecountry is sustainably engaged in speedy economic reformsupported by a whole new set of laws  and the results ofintensive transformation are very tangible.Certainly reform is not painless. In this regard  theGovernment is paying special and particular attention toimprovement of the living conditions of some socialgroups that are more vulnerable to economic reform. Iwish  on behalf of the Albanian Government  to availmyself of the occasion to express gratitude to the donorcountries  the European Member States  the United Statesand the countries of the Organization of the IslamicConference  as well as to international agencies such asthe United Nations Development Programme  the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund  for thevaluable assistance provided to Albania.In its efforts to eliminate the consequences of fatallong isolation  Albania is convincingly engaged in anopen policy and has firmly abided by one of the majorobjectives that the Government set out in itsprogramme — the integration of the country into Europe which implies the building of a Western-style society adherence to its institutions and active participation inEuropean life.Our growing cooperation with the European Union which we hope will in due course lead to the opening ofnegotiations on and the conclusion of the Europeagreement  is a process that enjoys the backing of allpolitical parties and all strata of the population. With aview to achieving full integration  we attach specialimportance to cooperation with the Euro-Atlanticstructures  primarily the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO). Albania is the first country of theregion to have formally requested membership of NATO and it is engaged in active cooperation within thePartnership for Peace. In this spirit of close cooperation Albania has offered action facilities to NATO  and it willcontinue to do so in the future  convinced that this willbenefit peace and security in the Balkans.To this end  and desirous of demonstrating in apractical way its commitment to peace and security Albania has set up its first Albanian military unit toparticipate in the peace-keeping and humanitarian23operations of the United Nations and will soon put this atthe disposal of the Organization.The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade’s ambitionto create a “Greater Serbia” — inspired by the philosophyof national chauvinism  the policy of “ethnic cleansing” andthe forceful changing of borders — lies at the centre of thepresent-day Balkan crisis  concentrated in the formerYugoslavia. Identification of the causes and culprits of thecrisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina now makes it easier forthe Balkan States and the international community at largeto make realistic assessments of the situation in all theterritories of the former Yugoslavia and to seek adequateapproaches for solution.It is a fact that the international community and itsmain actors have been present at all stages in dealing withthe conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately however  it has to be admitted that  despite the action takenso far  they have not always been consistent. For thatreason  efficiency has for a long time left much to bedesired.The many resolutions of the United Nations and of theInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia  theactivities of the Contact Group  the projects offered and theplans suggested have not yet yielded the desired results.Nevertheless  we think that the United Nations peace forcedeserves special praise for the humanitarian assistance ithas provided to the innocent civilian population. A specialtribute should be paid to the soldiers  officers  diplomatsand journalists who lost their lives in the line of duty.Following recent developments  it appears that thesituation in the crisis areas is more balanced  politically andmilitarily  and that it offers real possibilities for solution.However  it is still very complex  and there is still the riskof a spill-over of the conflict to other areas — a widelyheld view. In the face of this situation  we appreciate thefact that  on the initiative of the United States of America the international community is reviewing its stand on thisconflict  including insistence on thorough implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions adopted pursuant to ChapterVII of the United Nations Charter. These provide forcontinuation of the sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs andSerbia and Montenegro  as well as the stepping up ofdiplomatic activity  backed by the use of NATO militaryintervention when necessary.The Republic of Albania is deeply concerned about thegrave situation in Kosova. The Serbian military and policeregime that has been installed in Kosova  with theelimination of the autonomy that this federal unit of theformer Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia enjoyed is continuing widespread terror against the Albanianpopulation. The brutality of the Serbian police is evidentevery day and in every part of Kosova. The apartheidpolicy and practices pursued by the Serbs against theAlbanians have led to the compulsory exodus of hundredsof thousands of Albanians  mainly youngsters  to differentcountries of the world. Part of this systematic terror arethe endless killings  the ransacking and the plottedpolitical trials against the Albanians of Kosova.As if this extremely tense and eruptive situationwere not enough  the Belgrade authorities are nowsending to Kosova  as colonists  the Serb refugees fromCroatia and Bosnia. This grave provocation  under theguise of humanism for Serb refugees  is in reality part ofthe old plan of the Belgrade authorities to carry out“ethnic cleansing” in Kosova  which is inhabited to theextent of 95 per cent by Albanians  and forcefully changeits ethnic-demographic composition.The consequences of what Belgrade is doing toattain the “Greater Serbia” ambition are already commonknowledge and have been internationally witnessed inBosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. We appeal to theinternational community and to concerned humanitarianorganizations not to be duped by the intentions ofBelgrade and not to assist it to settle the Serb refugees inKosova — an activity that falls short of being a simplehumanitarian action.We also call upon the international community notto ignore the extremely important issue of Kosova. TheBelgrade authorities have clearly challenged GeneralAssembly resolution 49/204  the resolutions of theCommission on Human Rights in Geneva and thedecisions of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe on Kosova. If Serbia is not putunder international pressure to refrain from its policy ofconfrontation in Kosova  it will not be long beforeanother tragedy with unpredictable consequencesexplodes. The Kosova Albanian leaders have miraculouslymanaged to avoid it so far through their peacefulresistance  but the question immediately arises: How longwill they be able to do so?The Republic of Albania holds that the UnitedNations  the major Powers and NATO should anticipateand take adequate measures in order to prevent a conflictin Kosova: demilitarize its territory; protect human and24national rights of Albanians there; put an end to ethniccleansing and Serb colonization; reopen the institutions ofKosova; create a climate of dialogue between Albaniansand Serbs in Kosova  and between Pristina and Belgrade;open and continue dialogue in the presence of a third party.Albania is of the view  and insists  that the Kosovaissue be included in the agenda for discussion and solutionof the problem of the former Yugoslavia. In the meantime the lifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegroshould be subject to the strict condition that there should bea complete and lasting solution of the Kosova issue. Thereis more than one problem to tackle and solve in Kosova;they all need to be addressed properly and not overlooked.When we see today the progress in solving theconstitutional status of the entities in Bosnia  which wehope will be just and equitable and will satisfy all parties we have reason to hope and believe that the internationalcommunity will proceed in the right direction to solve thequestion of Kosova as well. The world is right in thinkingthat  in so doing  we are respecting one of the fundamentalprinciples of the Charter  especially the right of peoples toself-determination. The application of double standards willundoubtedly generate future conflicts.In order for the Balkans to be an area of peace stability and prosperity  it is necessary to bring war to anend  to bring the perpetrators of the Bosnian tragedy beforethe Court and to punish them  to demilitarize over-armedStates and areas  to reconstruct what was damaged by war to settle the Kosova issue and to thaw the already frozenbilateral relations. Internal democratization of all States  thecreation of the democratic space where Albanians live inthe Balkans  as repeatedly stated by the President of theRepublic  Sali Berisha  constitute a most positive responseto any international initiative for peace and stability in theBalkans. Furthermore  transition to broad programmes ofinter-Balkan and Euro-Balkan cooperation is also anabsolute requirement for development and for fullintegration of the Balkans into developed and civilizedEurope.In the coming December  Albania will celebrate thefortieth anniversary of its membership in the UnitedNations. Over all these years the Republic of Albania hasdemonstrated its commitment to the purposes and principlesof the Charter. While the region is living through aprofound and complex crisis  Albania is testifying that it isa factor of peace and stability. It has never provokedconflicts or tensions between States and has repeatedlyasserted its firm stand against the forceful alteration ofinternationally recognized borders. This is demonstratedfirst in its policy towards its neighbours.I am glad to declare that bilateral relations withGreece have improved following a period of tension lastyear. Dialogue and good will  which Albania has alwaysfavoured  have prevailed  and today the two countries aretaking concrete steps in the direction of extending deepening and speeding up cooperation in fields ofmutual benefit.It is worth mentioning here that we are glad to seethat the international community  in general  recognize thegreat improvement in the rights of the Greek minority inAlbania in the last three years. The AlbanianGovernment has consistently demonstrated its willingnessto ensure full respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedom for all the citizens  including members of theGreek minority  and its commitment to do so. We havealways emphasized that the Greek minority in Albaniaconstitutes a bridge of friendship and we are glad that thisis not our view alone. There is no political reasonwhatsoever that could hinder this since the realization ofrights stems from our political will and from the veryessence of Albanian society.As to the right of education in one’s mother tongue in addition to the measures already taken by theGovernment to apply international standards and fulfil itsinternational commitments  such as the CopenhagenDeclaration and Programme of Action  the nationallegislation on education  in particular the law on privateschools — which entered into force a few months ago —has resolved this question.Albania maintains good relations with the formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and supports the fullintegration of this Republic into international institutions.However  we encourage it to take concrete steps toimprove the situation of the Albanians there and to ensurefull respect for their human and national rights  includingthe right to education in their mother tongue. This is allthe more so because of our conviction that equalitybetween citizens of any nationality leads to the integrationof that country and that integration is to the benefit of allthe citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia and of stability in the region.Albania does not hold a prejudiced view in itsrelations with Serbia and Montenegro  either. However  itshould be said that their improvement is dependent on therenunciation of violence against and suppression of the25Albanians in Kosova. Though Italy is across the sea  mycountry has considered  and considers  Italy a neighbouringcountry of great importance for bilateral relations and forthe developments in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.Our relations with this country are built on an ancienttradition and are characterized by very positivedevelopments in all fields.Albania attaches great importance to the work with aview to the reform of the Security Council. Albania is theonly country from the Eastern European Group  except thenewly created countries in the region  that has never servedin the Security Council in its course of 40 years’membership in the Organization. We believe that theMember States  by giving Albania the first chance to sit inthe Security Council  will offer encouragement and supportto the good will of the small States for active participationin multilateral cooperation in the service of internationalpeace and security  and will show that it will not take longfor our fruitful discussions on the reform of the SecurityCouncil to be implemented. I would like to assure you thatthe election of Albania to the Security Council will be acontribution to peace and security in the troubled region ofthe Balkans as well.In conclusion  I would like to express Albania’ssupport for the United Nations  its desire to strengthen theOrganization and its role in safeguarding international peaceand promoting and supporting democracy  development andwell-being."
"4",134,"AND",50,1995,"It is only right to begin by thanking theoutgoing President  Minister Amara Essy  who has done somuch for our Organization during the past year  and bycongratulating the incoming President  Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral. On behalf of the people and the Government ofAndorra  I wish him every success and good fortune in hisimportant task. I have no doubt that this distinguishedpersonality from the Iberian peninsula  for whom I havegreat respect and fraternal esteem  will take the helm of thisAssembly with a firm hand.For the last 50 years Heads of State  Heads ofGovernment  Ministers and Ambassadors have been comingbefore this General Assembly of the United Nations to setout  with hope and with passion  their desire for worldpeace and the development of our planet. Year after yeardignitaries from all corners of the globe have met in NewYork to reiterate the ideals conceived in San Francisco fivedecades ago. It is thus an honour and a privilege for me todo the same today  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of thePrincipality of Andorra  a very old and very small nation a State that is the fruit of 700 years of peace andindependence.The celebration of anniversaries allows people topause briefly to look back on their past  to reflect  to drawconclusions and to try to better prepare their future. Fiftyyears after the horrors of the Second World War  “We thepeoples of the United Nations” now have the task ofreaffirming the importance of our Organization byconsolidating its founding principles and giving impetus tothe reform of the United Nations so as to make it a modern efficient instrument for the new international order that hasarisen since the end of the cold war.The founding principles of the United Nations couldbe summed up as follows: equality of States  tolerance  thepeaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion ofdevelopment.The principle of the equality of States is dear to allsmall States. The preamble to the Charter of the UnitedNations refers to all nations  large and small. In theGeneral Assembly each State has one vote.A sovereign State is not only a group — whateverits size — of people; it is a history  a language  the willof a people  a sense of independence — in a word  acommunity of human beings. Some States  like ours Andorra  have only 60 000 inhabitants. Others have morethan a billion. But all have the right to speak and vote atthe United Nations. And  just as peace comes into beingwhen the powerful respect the small  the rule of lawbecomes reality in international affairs when all aretreated as equals and when parties can solve theirdifferences at the negotiating table  not on the field ofdevastation that results from the use of force.Last year  the Head of Government of Andorrastressed from this very rostrum that by their very nature small States intrinsically and essentially maintain thevalues of respect for diversity and of peacefulcoexistence. To create a world balanced by the rule oflaw in a world of instincts  exchanges must be based onthe principle of equality between States.Nevertheless  the principle of equality should not bereduced to the formula “one State  one vote”. Theprinciple of equality springs from the desire to understandthe other  to allow diversity and to exchange differentvisions of humankind and society. The principle ofequality derives from the concept of tolerance. In thisInternational Year of Tolerance  we must be particularlyaware of the central position of this idea. The UnitedNations cannot exist without tolerance. It would surely beabsurd to meet in this Assembly if all that were to comeout of it was the prevention and outlawing of the opinionsof others. Though it is sometimes considered less heroicthan force  diplomacy is the supreme instrument we havein this forum  an instrument for respect andunderstanding.We in Andorra have resorted to diplomacy fromhistorical necessity from very early times; these 700 yearsof peace of which we are so proud are probably theresult. We have also had to be tolerant and to respectothers because  during the numerous conflicts that haveshaken the European continent over the centuries  wehave sheltered on our territory those in search of asylum from whichever side they came. We have learned  Irepeat  of necessity  being weak and humble like all smallStates  how to differ without imposing ourselves.14Let us give tolerance the importance it deserves as afounding principle of the United Nations. But tolerancedoes not mean laissez faire. Just as John Stuart Mill set thelimits of individual freedom at the point at which thatfreedom infringed on the liberty of others  tolerance islimited only by intolerance. The United Nations has thepower to say “no” to those States and peoples who do notrespect the religious  political  moral and artistic convictionsof others; “no” to those States and peoples who do notrespect minorities  be they national or of any other kind and their languages  which are an essential element ofcultural transmission; “no”  above all  when repression isaccompanied by the use of force and by cruelty  torture andother unspeakable acts. That is why  since joining theUnited Nations  my country has attached such importanceto the Third Committee of the General Assembly and toquestions of human rights. Last year  Andorra took anactive part in the debate on capital punishment  applyingthe constitutional ideas approved by its people  which loveslife and believes in it.The United Nations was not built in a vacuum ofvalues — quite the contrary. When  in June 1945  the rightwords were being sought in San Francisco for the UnitedNations Charter  those that were found were based on avery clear vision of the dignity of the human being with auniversal vocation. The Universal Declaration of HumanRights  adopted by the United Nations on 10 December1948  made clear once and for all what was  is and will beacceptable and desirable  and what is not  in order that theinalienable dignity of every human being should berespected and the limits of tolerance demarcated bydefining what we consider to be intolerable.For instance  we find intolerable the ethnic andreligious intolerance that leads to disasters like those whichthe horror-struck international community has been obligedto witness in the territories that were once part ofYugoslavia. To face up to these challenges  the UnitedNations has made a considerable effort in recent years tocarry out large-scale operations to keep the peace. TheSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  informed uson 3 January this year in his supplement to “An Agenda forPeace” of the considerable increase in the deployment ofmilitary personnel since 1988. On 31 January of that year 9 570 “blue helmets” were engaged in peace-keepingoperations; as at 16 December last year  there were 73 393.The near non-use of the veto in the Security Councilsince the end of the cold war has encouraged this growth indeployment. Very often  unfortunately  we hear so muchtalk of the failures of United Nations operations that weforget to mention the successes. When we now celebratethe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization  we shouldproclaim it aloud: the role of the United Nations has beenessential  and the results are highly positive. Let us notask the United Nations to do what the Organizationcannot do  and has no vocation to do  making it the targetof criticisms better levelled at the paralysis of MemberStates. The United Nations is and will be what theMember States wish it to be  neither more nor less  andwithout miracles.The complexity of the conflicts now afflicting theworld  as the Secretary-General has on several occasionspointed out  lies in the fact that most of them are conflictswithin the borders of States  or former States. This makesthem more complicated than the conflicts we wereaccustomed to during the years of the cold war  mainlybecause in many cases the target for destruction is thecivilian population  and secondly because the task of thehumanitarian organizations and the soldiers sent to keepthe peace is not respected by the parties to the conflict which consider them as abetting the enemy.The action for peace taken by the United Nations  anOrganization founded on the ruins of a ferocious war must be constant. It is our imperative duty to eliminatewar and to cut off conflicts at the root. We all know therecommendations listed by the Secretary-General in his“An Agenda for Peace”  so I shall not repeat them. ButI will underline the importance in the opinion of myGovernment of preventive diplomacy. Precisely becauseAndorra came into being as a result of a peace agreementsigned in 1278  which made our territory completelyneutral and which called for the destruction of all castlesand warlike fortifications  we can well understand thepossibility of stopping conflicts in time by means ofpeace agreements that neutralize the power to harm of thecontenders by removing both parties’ access toarmaments.But the United Nations and we  its Members  musthave the courage to act when the first signs of a conflictlead us to suspect its existence. The world today needs aninternational authority to facilitate dialogue  to suggestcompromises acceptable to the parties to the conflict —above all  when the conflict is in its initial stages — andto confirm the agreements reached by negotiation. TheUnited Nations has demonstrated that it is such aninstitution  and it would be unjust not to recognize thisgreat merit during this anniversary. Let us imagine aworld without the United Nations  where forcepredominated over law  where there were no standard15universal values for which to strive  where the humancommunity  which is capable of the highest and most nobleacts  fell into a vortex of egoism  war and destruction. TheUnited Nations is not optional in this world ofinterdependent States  but indispensable.Please allow me at this stage to evaluate the relevanceof Andorra’s modern development in this regard. As I havesaid  Andorra is a land of peace  welcome and friendship.During the more than 700 years of its existence with itsown national identity  particularly in this century  whenwars have shaken our neighbour States and Europe Andorra has been a place of refuge  of asylum and ofpeaceful coexistence. It is precisely now  when 50 yearshave passed since the founding of the United Nations as aresult of the events of that tragic phase in human history and when we must still regret that irrationality is sowingdeath and cruelty in many places throughout the world  thatwe would like to recall  humbly  but with a firmnessinformed by the realities of our history  the deep andsincere conviction that Andorra can bring to the world.There can be no difficulty in peaceful coexistence if thereis good will and understanding. There can be noinfringement of tolerance if there is respect for people andideas. In a word  magnanimity and indulgence will alwaysbe more effective than ignominy and opprobrium.From Andorra we proclaim peace; we call for it and if necessary  we demand it as a universal possession that noone has the right to change or to violate. When there isserious aggression against nature and the environment when materialism and speculation seek to obliteratehumanism and sensitivity  when the hypocrisy of interestsovercomes the reality of ideals  a generous-spirited commoneffort must be made to find the path of peace andcoexistence.The Andorran Constitution enshrines respect for andthe promotion of freedom  equality  justice and tolerance and the defence of human rights and individual dignity.With that background  we forcefully insist before theGeneral Assembly that the primary purpose of mankind isto achieve peace  without reservation and without ulteriormotive. None of us here can be satisfied with the resultsuntil one day we can announce the great news that peacereigns on Earth. The near-universality of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the spirit of whichAndorra has always respected  is a positive example of thatcommon task. It thus gives me pleasure today to announcethat the Government of Andorra has submitted the Treatyto its Parliament for ratification.Peace must be promoted. By every possible means especially through education  we must spread the wordeverywhere that only tolerance  common sense understanding  good will  solidarity  respect for culturaldiversity with its intellectual and spiritual stimulation variety and the struggle for social progress andbrotherhood can lead to peace and can provide pride anddignity to all human beings while eliminatingintransigence and racial  religious  social and politicalhatred  which are at the root of all conflicts betweenpeoples and civilizations.There must be an end to the horrors and atrocities ofthe wars that continue to take place in our civilized worldamid alarming indifference. These threats affect us all; wemust find the means to prevent violence against societyand against individuals. It is not enough to cry out incompassion or frustration  or to make the excuse that weare the victims of modern times  as Anthony Burgess putit in his novel A Clockwork Orange. There must bedetermination if we are to be able to say that we all havea future. There must be serious  unhesitating commitmenton the part of those bearing the heaviest responsibility particularly with respect to the economic consequences which are in fact predominant in causing certainscandalous situations and in keeping them alive. We mustact with morality if we are to be able to face repeatedaggression against human rights. It would be wonderfulif we could all make an unstinting effort to emerge fromthe shadows and if  with one voice  we could set up themachinery that would make peace triumph forever  andcould understand — in the words of François Mitterrand former President of the French Republic and thereforeformer Co-Prince of Andorra — that “awareness ofinjustice is not enough to combat injustice”.As we strive towards peace let us always rememberthat we can never reach the development goals set byMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his “An Agenda forDevelopment” without reducing the warlike and militaryactivities of the poorest countries. Let us face the facts:development makes for peace  but without peace  withouteliminating unnecessary spending on military equipment without agreement among Governments that rightlydemand a better future for their citizens  there will be nodevelopment.But this must not mean a relaxation of thedevelopment efforts that Member States and theOrganization itself have always promoted. Day after dayin the field  the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF)  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and16Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World HealthOrganization (WHO) carry out work that is far tooimportant not to enjoy our sincere support. I take thisopportunity to announce that during my stay in New YorkI signed  on behalf of the Government of Andorra  theConvention on the Rights of the Child  which reflects mycountry’s recognition of the cause promoted by that greattext. Men and women like the late James Grant — who atUNICEF carried out such tasks and contributed to the well-being of so many children throughout the world —demonstrate the productive vitality of the United Nations.We in Andorra are much concerned with questions ofdevelopment. Despite our modest means and small territory we feel solidarity with victims of malnutrition  hunger sickness and the lack of educational opportunities. Ourforeign policy at the United Nations has been oriented inthat direction. Last March  the Andorran Head ofGovernment brought to Copenhagen a message ofsolidarity  and declared that poverty was not inevitable.Andorra is a small State; we are therefore convinced that apart from the importance of large programmes and theirinevitable macro-amplitudes  social development is a moreaccessible goal when it is approached on a small scale  atthe level of the community or indeed of the family.Hence  the Declaration of the World Summit forSocial Development includes a commitment proposed byAndorra  which we shall invoke in our work in theAssembly’s Main Committees. This commitment urges usto“Acknowledge and encourage the contribution ofpeople of all age groups as equally and vitallyimportant for the building of a harmonious society and foster dialogue between generations in all parts ofsociety”. (A/CONF.166/9  para. 29  commitment 4 (h))Human beings  happily  are living longer  and theirnumbers are growing. We must find new ways to guaranteethe balance of the social contract between generations  andmake social integration — one of the pillars ofdevelopment — work. To that end  we need to devotespecial attention to the problems of unemployment and thesocial integration of young people  particularly this year aswe mark the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year.I have instructed our Permanent Representative to theUnited Nations to devote time and resources to initiating adialogue with his counterparts on the question of youth.We have recently seen how three great conferences —those of Cairo  Copenhagen and Beijing — focused theattention of the international community. Cairo addressedproblems of population  Copenhagen those of poverty andsocial development  and Beijing the question of women.It is vital that the conclusions of these high-level meetingsnot become a dead letter; all Member States must assesstheir results and consider their concrete applications  bothat home and throughout the world. But Cairo Copenhagen and Beijing must not overshadow othersimilar conferences. I am thinking of Rio de Janeiro andits impact on environmental policy. A country of thePyrenees  like Andorra  cannot shirk its environmentalresponsibilities; that is why the office of Andorra’sSecretary-General for the environment has drawn upvaluable initiatives to protect our ecosystem  our flora andfauna  our waters and the air we breathe.In this statement I have tried to recall the foundingprinciples that inspire the United Nations  and the greatthemes on which the General Assembly will reflect overthe coming decades. Clearly  not everything has beenperfect during the past 50 years; there have beensituations where we Member States have not beeneffective enough. Every day  we hear about hunger disease and lack of access to education  which affect thepoor more often than the rich. But now  on thisanniversary  let us take comfort from the work that hasbeen achieved. As I said before  let us consider what theworld would be without the United Nations.None the less  on the eve of the third millennium when interdependence among the Earth’s peoples isstronger than ever  we need the United Nations to beincreasingly nimble and flexible  able to processinformation quickly and to react rapidly to any crisis.Many reforms are needed: reform of the Security Council now under debate  and that of the Economic and SocialCouncil  which may take place in the future  will not bethe last. We also need more effective methods forallocating resources and for evaluating the needs of eachdepartment to avoid duplication of labour. The Secretary-General has mentioned this on several occasions  and Ihave no doubt that  given good will  we shall succeed.The Principality of Andorra — in the words of ourHead of Government — is a very old nation and a veryyoung State. We are a newcomer to the UnitedNations — the 184th Member. Nevertheless  it is to theUnited Nations that we have set up our first diplomaticmission. Our first Permanent Representative  who duringthe next two years will be in charge of opening ourMission and starting its activities  presented hiscredentials to the Secretary-General just over a week ago.17With the humility of a newcomer  but with the joy andenergy of the convinced  we are making progress in ourtask of participating in the work of the Organization.I should like  on behalf of the people and Governmentof Andorra  to affirm our support for the United Nations.We wish it long life and much success in its struggle fortolerance  peace and development  for the benefit of theworld and of generations to come. And we express ourhope that humankind will guard those values that will allowus all to face the challenges of the future — love brotherhood and friendship.Let me end this statement by quoting Robert Kennedy:(spoke in English)“It is from numberless diverse acts of courageand belief that human history is shaped. Each time aman stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lotof others  or strikes out against injustice  he sendsforth a tiny ripple of hope  and  crossing each otherfrom a million different centres of energy and daring those ripples build a current that can sweep down themightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”"
"5",179,"ARE",50,1995,"On behalf of the delegation of the UnitedArab Emirates  it gives me great pleasure to extend mysincere congratulations to the President on his election tothe presidency of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. This demonstrates the esteem the internationalcommunity holds for the President and his friendly country.We wish him every success and good fortune. We alsowish to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor His Excellency Amara Essy  the Foreign Minister ofCôte d’Ivoire  who presided over the last session withwisdom and competence.I should like to seize this opportunity to express anewour confidence in the strenuous efforts made by Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  to enhancethe role of our Organization in today’s world.This session coincides with the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations.This is an important political event in the history of thisOrganization  particularly in light of the rapid changes thathave taken place in international relations. These changeshave contributed  in varying degrees  to the achievement ofsome progress with regard to a number of issues that relateto disarmament  economic and social development  and tothe containment of some regional conflicts.In spite of this  our international community remainsfar from the desired world peace. New challenges haveemerged and have entailed suffering  extermination expulsion and famine to thousands of people. These  inturn  have affected international life as they have impactedon the economic  political and social situation in the world.Such a situation  of course  does not measure up tothe expectations the new regional and internationalchanges gave rise to when they followed on the heels ofeach other. The hope of witnessing the emergence of anew world order that would favour development  peace growth and justice has not yet taken a concrete shape thatwould affect the future of mankind. The emergence ofsuch an order requires a wider framework of regional andinternational cooperation which would work in favour offinding peaceful solutions to world problems. Suchsolutions should aim at elaborating a comprehensiveapproach designed to promote and enhance human economic and social development  encourage harmony tolerance and communal solidarity  ensure respect for thecustoms  traditions and religious beliefs of eachcommunity and country  in addition to combatingterrorism and its manifestations  combating drugtrafficking  and strengthening the role of the UnitedNations in the areas of peace-keeping  conflict preventionand the mitigation of the human suffering of manypeoples of the world  especially in the developing world.We believe that the establishment of such a world orderrequires a stronger political will and a much widerframework of regional and international cooperation inorder for it to be compatible with the thrust of the newinternational changes.The stability and security of States and thesettlement of disputes have become high priorities oftoday’s world. To achieve stability and security  newpractices are needed. Such practices should be based onthe provisions of international law and the principles ofthe Charter  especially the principles of sovereignty regional peace  non-interference in internal affairs ofStates  the settlement of disputes and conflicts by peacefulmeans and the promotion of relations of good-neighbourliness.On this basis  the United Arab Emirates reaffirms itsposition which calls for direct bilateral and unconditionalnegotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran to put anend to its military occupation  which has lasted since1971  of the three Arab islands of Greater Tunb  LesserTunb and Abu Moussa  as those islands form anindivisible part of the territorial sovereignty of the UnitedArab Emirates. If this is feasible  my country renews itsinitiative  announced at the last session  which calls forreferring the dispute to the International Court of Justice in view of the fact that the Court is the international bodyentrusted with the settlement of disputes and that manycountries  including Iran  have had recourse to it inseeking to settle similar disputes.11Our peace initiatives have received support fromsisterly countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council  theLeague of Arab States and other friendly  peace-lovingnations  since what is at stake here is one of our legalsovereign rights. In spite of this peaceful approach  theIslamic Republic of Iran not only rejects those initiativesbut also imposes a policy of fait accompli by military force.It has adopted a set of illegal measures with the aim ofentrenching its occupation. Those measures conflict  notonly with the principles of peaceful coexistence and good-neighbourliness  but also with the provisions of the Charterof the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Charterof the United Nations and the principles of internationallaw.Over the past decade  the Arabian Gulf regionwitnessed a number of conflicts and wars that resulted indevastation and loss in terms of human  material andenvironmental resources. It would have been wiser tobenefit from such resources by striving for economic andsocial integration and sustainable development in theinterests of the region’s peoples who enjoy common bandsof history and religion and have common interests.The question of building confidence between thecountries of the region has become one of the mostsignificant and focal issues for the Governments of thecountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Over the pastfew years  those Governments have spared no effort intrying to ease the suffering caused to their peoples by pastevents whose consequences have demonstrated that the useor threat of force by certain parties will never lead to theachievements of their aim of changing the immutablehistorical and geographical realities of the region. On thecontrary  the use or threat of force creates new crises anddisputes that threaten international and regional peace andsecurity. It is our belief that the best way of avoiding sucha situation is to opt for dialogue  bilateral and multilateralnegotiations  confidence-building measures and to complywith international legality.In this context  we welcome all peaceful efforts andinitiatives aimed at the demarcation of boundaries betweenthe sisterly countries of the region. While we wish to puton record our firm position regarding the need to safeguardthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq  the need toease the suffering of the Iraqi people and not to interfere inits internal affairs  we call upon the Iraqi Government tomeet all its international obligations set out in relevantSecurity Council resolutions  especially those relating to therelease of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees and the nationalsof other countries  as well as the return of Kuwaitiproperty still in its possession.The United Arab Emirates welcomes the progressmade in the negotiations between the Palestinians andIsraelis  which led to the Declaration of Principles andcomplementary agreements  the latest being the agreementon the second phase of expanded self-rule in the WestBank. Implementation by the Israeli Government of thoseagreements would be an important and essential steptowards enabling the Palestinian people to exercise itsright to self-determination and to the creation of itsindependent State on its national soil  like any otherpeople in the world.In the same context  we are of the view that theachievement of a just  comprehensive and permanentpeace in the Middle East is contingent on making tangibleprogress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. This willrequire a greater international effort  especially on the partof the two sponsors of the peace process  to encouragethe Israeli Government to comply with its undertakingsand obligations in the context of the principle of “land forpeace” and of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) 338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  which stipulate complete andunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the occupiedArab and Palestinian territories  including the holy city ofAl-Quds  the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon.The maintenance of international peace and securityis a collective international responsibility that requires theexistence of political will  a new approach and theadoption of transparency  instead of the application ofdouble standards  if the declared intentions in the field ofdisarmament and the elimination of weapons of massdestruction are to be translated into concrete realities. Inthis field  it behoves the international community to takefirmer steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclearweapons and the possibility of their use in any region ofthe world.Proceeding from the importance we attach to theachievement of common security  we announce that on 25September 1995  the Government of the United ArabEmirates completed the legal procedures for acceding tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.This is in conformity with our position which calls for thecreation of zones that are free from all weapons of massdestruction  especially in the Middle East. This is a goalthat cannot be achieved so long as Israel continues torefuse to submit to the system of international monitoringand safeguards or to accede to the Treaty on the12Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  a posture thatweakens the credibility of the Treaty.In spite of regional and international efforts to rescueSomalia from its plight  conflicts between the disputingfactions continue. We therefore call on those factions to endthe bloodshed  to renounce conflict and to work towards asettlement that would restore Somalia’s national unity security and stability.After more than three years of crimes of murder destruction and “ethnic cleansing” that have continued to becommitted by the Serbian forces against the people of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  a new turning-pointhas emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiationsthat have led to a preliminary agreement on thefundamental principles for a comprehensive settlementbased on the decisions of international legality.The United Arab Emirates  which has continued to callupon the parties  since the outbreak of the conflict especially on the Serbian side  to resort to peaceful dialogueinstead of military force  today renews its support for allthe efforts undertaken by the international community especially the Contact Groups of the Organization of theIslamic Conference  the European Union and the UnitedStates of America  to solve this crisis peacefully and toguarantee respect for the territorial sovereignty of Bosniaand Herzegovina. At the same time  we stress the need  inaccordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the UnitedNations  to lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia andHerzegovina  in order to prevent the repetition of the actsof aggression  massacre and “ethnic cleansing” that theSerbian forces have perpetrated against Bosnian civilians particularly Muslims.In spite of the positive situations which the changes ineconomic and social situations at the national  regional andinternational levels gave rise to over the past few years  thedeveloping countries have continued to suffer from hunger poverty and an aggravated debt burden  side by side withthe decline in the prices of primary commodities  and theinequitable measures that the developed countries continueto apply as part of their economic and trade policies andthat contribute to widening further the economic and socialgap between them on the one hand and the developingcountries on the other. In view of this situation responsibility for the resumption of dialogue between thecountries of the North and the South rests with theinternational community  in order for it to serve equally theinterests of the developed and the developing countriesalike.In the midst of the celebrations on the occasion ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  the UnitedArab Emirates supports the international call forevaluation  reform and development in the structures ofthe United Nations  especially with regard to increasingthe membership of the Security Council and ensuring thetransparency and equitable geographical representationneeded if the Organization is to face up to the greatchallenges  whether at the level of consolidatinginternational peace and security or at the level ofpromoting economic and social development.We should like also to emphasize the need forcooperation between the United Nations and regionalorganizations with a view to creating a wider frameworkof coordination and consultation  and with the aim ofreaching joint peaceful solutions to current conflicts basedon international law  with a view to strengthening securityand stability and promoting development.In conclusion  we hope that these aspirations willhelp shape and strengthen the commitment of all States tothe principles of the Charter and the provisions ofinternational law and will form a framework for therenewed unification of the power and determination ofthis Organization  which over the last fifty years hasremained a symbol of hope in the ability of humanity tofree itself from the scourges of war  hunger and diseaseand to live in lasting peace and security."
"6",226,"ARG",50,1995,"Our presence here at the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly holds a very special meaning. On thisoccasion  we are not gathered here simply to reenact theannual ritual of exchanging views and official nationalpositions on the principal problems that encumber theinternational agenda. These first 50 years during whichthe Organization has carried out its noble task have beenmarked by successes and disappointments.23As President Menem said in this very forum a yearago  the real situation in the world today offers a balanceof light and shadow in which encouraging signs ofconvergence exist alongside other signs that seem to pointto the persistence of injustice and disagreement. The searchfor a delicate balance of peace and security withdevelopment and social justice is the goal which we mustconstantly pursue. This search must be translated intoconcrete facts which demonstrate on this anniversary through the actions of each and every Member State  theextent to which we have faithfully respected the spirit andthe letter of the Charter.At this historic moment  my country has chosenactively to involve itself in the resolution of seriousinternational crises through the concerted action of theUnited Nations.The tragic situation in the Balkans has foundArgentina present in solidarity  through its troops  in searchof a space for dialogue and understanding after five yearsof blood and fire. Today we are witnessing the rebirth ofhope  starting with the recent Geneva agreements and thosethat were signed yesterday. We hope that the peoples of thenew republics of the Balkans can  once and for all  beginlife again in peace after such enormous suffering  so muchviolence and so many unnecessary deaths.The Middle East has suffered the attacks ofextremism; yet the peace process initiated in 1993 forgesahead. On behalf of the people and the Government ofArgentina  I pay a tribute to the leaders of Israel and thePalestinian people  who  despite provocations and thelegitimate grievances of those who suffer  have managed tofix their eyes on the future and continue the task ofconcluding agreements on each of the points that comprisethe complex agenda for peace in the Middle East.We cannot forget our African brothers and sisters  whohave been affected by situations in which political strugglesand the survival of the least fortunate are combined in amost dramatic fashion. It is precisely in those situations thatwe must reaffirm our contribution and our solidarity because we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering anddeprivation of so many human beings without neglectingthe commitments dictated to us by the Charter and imposedupon us by human solidarity. To the extent of our ability we maintain our participation in the solution of suchproblems as those of Western Sahara  Mozambique andAngola  a neighbour country of ours in the South Atlanticwith which we will cooperate actively in the United NationsAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).The case of Haiti warrants my particularconsideration  since it deals with an issue that directlyaffects our region of Latin America and the Caribbean.Today  I would like to express the ArgentineGovernment’s great pleasure at the successful process thatculminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution940 (1994). Only through that resolution could theGovernment legitimately elected by the Haitian people bereestablished — a Government which  with movingendurance and commitment  is restoring institutionalnormalcy and again moving ahead on the road toeconomic development.Argentina is proud of its character as a LatinAmerican nation. In just a few days  we will have thehigh honour of hosting the Fifth Ibero-American Summit at which all the nations of our region  together with theirrespective mother countries  all linked by a commonhistory and culture  will set an inspiring example ofdialogue and cooperation in the search for solutionsadapted to our present reality. It is precisely this realityand the prospects we envisage for it that make us lookwith optimism to a Latin American future based ondemocracy  peace and integration.The Argentine commitment to peace was recentlydemonstrated once again through the active exercise ofthe role mandated to us  together with Brazil  Chile andthe United States of America  as guarantors of the 1942Rio Protocol  in an effort to bring the peoples of Ecuadorand Peru together once and for all.Building upon political and economic stability ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designedthat contribute to consolidating the opening of oureconomies  the transparency of our markets  and thegrowth of commercial exchange with other regions — inshort  the creation of the conditions necessary to secure abetter future for our peoples.In our case  we have made the Southern ConeCommon Market (Mercosur) a priority in our foreignpolicy  with the understanding not only that itsstrengthening will boost our economy and those of itsmember countries  but also  and most especially  that it isthanks to this open approach that the men and women ofour country and our region can come together today in anatmosphere of economic growth after so many years ofdisillusionment and frustration.24In Argentina  we place special emphasis on thefollowing principles: good governance; the struggle againstcorruption; discipline in fiscal matters; accountability in themanagement of public finances; respect for human rights;legal equality for foreign investments; and full authority forinstitutions within the rule of law. These are the principlesthat form the framework designed to give a greater boost toeconomic activity as a necessary motor for the well-beingof the Argentina people.This framework of recovery and harmony within LatinAmerica  however  raises important issues which remainunresolved.In the South Atlantic  the dispute concerningsovereignty over the Malvinas  South Georgia and SouthSandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime spaces hasnot yet been resolved. We will not cite yet again thenumerous resolutions in which the General Assembly andthe decolonization Committee have categorically andrepeatedly stated their position on this matter. Let mesimply recall that all of these include a clear and directappeal to the two countries involved — Argentina and theUnited Kingdom — to reach a negotiated settlement of thisdispute. This appeal from the Assembly remains unheeded despite the willingness we have constantly shown and theexcellent relations that bind our two countries. This makesthe issue even more baffling.In spite of this  we maintain a cooperative effort withregard to the exploitation of fishing resources in the area inan attempt to protect the biomass and at the same timeensure that significant economic activity continues.With regard to oil  given the non-renewable characterof the resources and the existence of a consolidatedinternational doctrine which proscribes the unilateralexploitation of disputed resources  we are reaching atemporary understanding that allows us to engage in furtherexploration and exploitation while avoiding the creation ofnew sources of tension which might discourage initiativesfrom the private sector.This very morning we and the United KingdomSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Malcolm Rifkind  signed a joint declaration which willallow us to move forward together in this spirit.With respect to the inhabitants of the islands  I repeatour determination to guarantee total respect for their way oflife  their culture  habits and institutions.The dispute over the Malvinas Islands will notdisappear as if by magic. The peaceful recovery of theexercise of full sovereignty over all the territories indispute and the surrounding waters  and respect for theway of life of the islands’ inhabitants  are today part ofArgentina’s Constitution  on which there was consensusacross the entire political spectrum of my country. Onlyrational dialogue  without any a priori conditions fromeither party  will permit us to make progress towards thefinal implementation of the resolutions of the Assemblyand of the Decolonization Committee.At the end of this year Argentina will conclude itsterm as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.In our two years as a member we have witnessednumerous situations that have required an immediateresponse on the part of the Council. Responding to thesesituations has not been an easy task  and at times theserious problems that have given rise to them have failedto receive full attention. Nevertheless  the Council’sresponse has confirmed on each occasion its character asthe central and indispensable instrument for themaintenance of international peace and security.Our commitment to the work of the Council has notbeen limited to its discussions; it has extended toArgentina’s contribution to peace-keeping operations  thelargest in our region. Our presence in the formerYugoslavia  in Cyprus  Mozambique  Haiti and Kuwait —to name but a few operations — is tangible proof of ourconcrete  and not just rhetorical  contribution tointernational peace and cooperation.In recent days much has been said about the processof reform of the Security Council. If anything has beenproved by the extended deliberations of the ad hoc Open-ended Working Group established for this purpose  it isthe extreme difficulty of finding a formula  acceptable toeveryone  that does not introduce imbalances into theregion.In our delegation’s view  the fundamental task in thisrespect is to protect and improve the efficiency andexpeditiousness of the Council. In order to achieve this a careful  limited increase in the membership would be inorder  should there be the necessary consensus. Thisincrease could be supplemented with a new procedureaimed at achieving a greater representativeness  which  bymeans of rotation mechanisms  would enable several ofthe most interested countries of different regions  as wellas those which stand to wait many years before joining25the Council  to take part more regularly in its deliberations.We believe that those countries which are legitimatelyinterested in taking part in the daily construction of a stableand peaceful world order could fulfil their aspirations inthis way.Moreover  further changes in the procedure of theCouncil should be introduced in order to increase itstransparency and strengthen the process of dialogue andexchange of information. Over the past two years we haveactively promoted such progress  being convinced that thecontribution of the international community to the solutionof its crises would be facilitated if all its members hadmore criteria and information on which to base theirdecisions.This matter is of undeniable importance  since theSecurity Council is the body ultimately entrusted with themaintenance of international peace and security. Thisrequires that we proceed with the utmost care  searchingrelentlessly for consensus.This year has been marked by the positive contributionto international peace made here in New York  when the179 States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  decided to extend itunconditionally and indefinitely. We are concerned aboutthe ongoing nuclear-test programmes. Therefore  we lookforward to the prompt conclusion of the comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty  without exceptions or permissiblethresholds. Likewise  we hope that the Conference onDisarmament will address without delay the negotiation ofa convention banning the production of fissionable material.It is encouraging to note the increased awareness ofwhat the Secretary-General has rightly called the“international humanitarian crisis” of anti-personnel mines.We trust that the 1981 Convention on inhumane weaponswill be strengthened as a result of the meeting to be held inVienna in the next few days.For our part  in addition tosupporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject  wehave declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production and with regard to a case which affects us directly — themines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islandsin 1982 — we have offered our cooperation and financialhelp to the United Kingdom for their removal  which isproceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of theUnited States.Apart from the struggle for the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  new challenges to peace andstability  including international terrorism  have emerged.Today no one can feel safe from the action of groupswhich are international in structure and very often rely onthe active or passive support of certain States. Almostevery day gruesome attacks reflect the reality of this newthreat  which calls for a determined and unequivocalresponse by the international community.We have drawn this issue to the attention of theSecurity Council  and we are confident that as a resulturgent action at the national  regional and internationallevels will be taken to promote legislative harmonizationand cooperation in the judicial  police and evenintelligence spheres  in order to halt this insidiousmanifestation of terror.However  the pressing challenges requiringinternational action are not restricted to the domain ofsecurity. Emergency assistance activities and thesubsequent stage of rehabilitation for developmentconstitute a priority task for the United Nations. For thisreason  in 1994 we proposed the “White Helmets”initiative  which aims to deliver assistance in cases ofextreme urgency and to mobilize resources for specificinstances of extreme poverty. We are pleased to note thatthe initiative was adopted by consensus in resolution49/139 B  with the formidable support of 67 co-sponsors.In the future we will further define details of theinitiative  which has already been implemented in verysuccessful pilot projects in our region. We hope to extendthis initiative to other parts of the world where evengreater need is experienced.From a historical perspective  50 years may not bemany  but they are not insignificant in the life of aninternational organization that every day has to addressnumerous and complex issues. Today we find the UnitedNations committed to the solution of international criseswhich affect international peace and security  a far cryfrom the marginalization of the Organization during thecold war. The United Nations is actively involved inadvances on great social issues by means of internationalconferences such as those of Vienna  on human rights;Cairo  on population; Copenhagen  on social matters; andBeijing  on women.These meetings reflect the new and vigorous stagereached by multilateralism  which elicits universallyaccepted responses to the great currents of sustainablehuman development  and acts in strict conformity with theprovisions of the Charter  under which the promotion ofhuman welfare  development and dignity are harmonious26and mutually complementary priorities. We remain activelycommitted to work to achieve these priorities in theframework of the United Nations  thus renewing thecommitment of 1945  towards which the current reformprocess will make a substantive contribution  with the samefaith we had then  nourished by decades of cooperation.The year 1995 is not only the year that marks the halfcentury of the United Nations. Two years ago the GeneralAssembly  in its resolution 48/126  declared 1995 theUnited Nations Year for Tolerance. It occurs to me that theforefathers of the United Nations must have had the idea oftolerance deeply etched in their minds when they set thefoundations of this unique endeavour.International reality reminds us how often we forgettolerance  how often we reject  proscribe or ignore othersfor what they are  think  say or do  or simply for existing.May this anniversary be a timely occasion to remember theneed to reaffirm in our minds  in the education of ourchildren and in our acts  tolerance  and  with it  the cultureof peace."
"7",251,"ARM",50,1995,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly. Given your talentand experience  I am confident that you will guide thissession to the successful completion of the noble missionentrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.I should also like to express my appreciation andthanks to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy  for his outstanding leadership in accomplishing thetasks of the last session.I should like to take this opportunity to extend mywarm welcome and congratulations to the Republic of Palauon its admission to the United Nations during the past year.Further  I wish to express Armenia’s gratitude to theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the vision with which he has guided theOrganization  and for his tireless activity in redefining therole of the United Nations in this changing world.After its declaration of independence in 1991 Armenia began implementing radical economic andpolitical reforms to create a healthy market economy anda truly democratic society. In addition to severe economicand social problems resulting from the extraordinarychanges buffeting the country  the transition process inArmenia has been exacerbated by the collapse oftraditional economic and trade arrangements  instability inthe region  the transport and energy blockade imposed byneighbouring Azerbaijan  the devastation caused by themassive earthquake of 1988  the conflict betweenNagorny Karabakh and Azerbaijan and the presence of360 000 refugees.Despite such serious economic and socialcircumstances  economic reforms have been continuedand even expanded over the last year. From the point ofview of current economic trends  1994 was exceptional.The programme of socio-economic development wasaimed at halting economic decline  reducing inflation andcreating conditions for the revitalization of the economy.Although the problems specifically related to thetransition remain  the measures taken not only have haltedthe recession but also have provided a measure ofeconomic growth.Indeed  in 1994 Armenia became the first formerSoviet Republic to record economic growth. A tight creditpolicy has forced down the inflation rate from 30 per centa month last year to 1 per cent in August. The currency the Dram  is now one of the strongest in the region. Sincemid-1994 a macroeconomic stabilization programme hasbeen under way.We have maintained a policy of fiscal and monetaryresponsibility to encourage the development of the privatesector. We are also undertaking a mass privatizationprogramme to transfer nearly all State-owned enterprisesto private ownership. We believe that the private sectorwill be the engine of growth in Armenia and an importantsource of employment opportunity. We welcome theparticipation of foreign investors in this process withoutrestriction  and we have a completely open foreign tradepolicy.20Of course implementation of our economic policy hasbeen hampered by the situation in the energy sector  whichremains critical. Therefore  the only viable  effective short-term solution to Armenia’s energy crisis is the restarting ofthe Metsamor Nuclear Power plant  which is under way.Armenia  like other States in transition  is in theprocess of emerging from economic crisis and of laying thefoundations for economic and social development. WhileStates have the primary responsibility to achieve social andeconomic development  they cannot do so alone. They needthe substantial support and encouragement of theinternational community. Multilateral and bilateral donorsshould coordinate their financing and planning proceduresto improve the impact of their activity toward theachievement of the objectives of social developmentprogrammes of countries with economies in transition.Given its universal membership and the unique andcomprehensive mandate reflected in its Charter  the UnitedNations has a vital role to play in the development process particularly in ensuring the implementation of developmentcommitments in an integrated fashion. Hence  itsrelationship with the specialized agencies  funds  regionalorganizations and commissions  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the World Trade Organization should beanalysed with a view to enhancing effective action andcoordination between them in the economic  social andrelated fields.The commitment to the transformation of the centrallyplanned economy to a market economy is seen by theGovernment of Armenia as an integral part of the transitionto a democratic State. In turn  a free-market economy willflourish in a stable democracy which promotes andunderpins economic development. The success of ademocracy requires informed and civil discourse andrespect for the rule of law and for the democratic process including the expression of the public view through freeand fair elections.Last July  Armenia held its first democraticparliamentary elections since its declared independence.Simultaneously  Armenians voted in a constitutionalreferendum on the first democratic institution in the historyof Armenia. The Constitution was adopted and the liberaldemocratic forces gained an overwhelming majority in thenew parliament  now renamed the National Assembly.International and local observers reported that the electionsran smoothly and were held in a free atmosphere. I shouldlike to take this opportunity to express my Government’sdeep appreciation for the monitoring activities of the UnitedNations observers in the parliamentary elections and theconstitutional referendum.The convincing victory of the liberal democraticforces has guaranteed the continuation of the political andsocio-economic policies pursued thus far by theGovernment  based on a clear programme and anachievable plan of development. The adoption of theConstitution is a decisive factor in the maintenance of thestability of Armenian statehood  as well as the legalguarantee for the development of a civic society and amarket economy.Development and human rights are interrelated andmutually reinforcing. There can be no genuine long-termdevelopment without respect for the full spectrum of therights of individuals. Armenia strongly supports theefforts of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  Mr. Ayala Lasso. Member States mustcontinue working toward better coordination within theHuman Rights Centre and consolidation of human rightsfunctions within the United Nations system. The UnitedNations should give priority to monitoring and prevention.Armenia considers self-determination in its multitudeof manifestations to be an inalienable human right. Theconflict between the people of Nagorno Karabakh  whoare striving for self-determination  and the AzerbaijaniGovernment  which refuses to address the rights of thepeople of Nagorno Karabakh  continues to concern theGovernment of Armenia. The peaceful resolution of theconflict remains Armenia’s top foreign policy priority.Despite the maintenance of the cease-fire sinceMay 1994  the conflict continues to threaten peace stability and security in our region. The lack of anyserious breakthrough in negotiations during this respite the uncertainties surrounding the political process and thereluctance of the international community to seize theopportunity to act firmly and decisively make the 15-month-long cease-fire highly fragile. Indeed  the longerthe cease-fire exists without any major developments  themore likely the resumption of military activity in the nearfuture will become.Since the last session of the General Assembly important developments have taken place in the politicalprocess. Visible progress was made at the Summitmeeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE) held in Budapest in December 1994 when an agreement was reached at the highest levels tocombine the mediation efforts of the OSCE and Russia 21and create a co-chairmanship to guide the peace process.The Summit also expressed readiness to establish amultinational OSCE peace-keeping operation to consolidatethe existing cease-fire  make the peace process irreversibleand open the way for the Minsk Conference.Today  under Russian and Finn co-chairmanship  andwith the participation of nine Minsk Group member States the OSCE is actively pursuing the peace process throughintensive negotiations. While these efforts have certainlyyielded results  a demonstration of political will by theparties to the conflict and an added commitment by theinternational community are needed if a seriousbreakthrough is to be achieved.As part of the step-by-step approach to the resolutionof the conflict  the signing of the political agreement iscritical for the consolidation of the cease-fire and for theoverall settlement of the conflict. This political agreement which is currently  during the Minsk Group negotiations being discussed by the parties to the conflict  stipulates thedeployment of the OSCE peace-keeping forces  the returnof the occupied territories  the lifting of all blockades andthe return of refugees.The successful conclusion of this agreement dependsmainly on a provision that provides local  regional andinternational security guarantees that will ensure thephysical existence of the people of Nagorno Karabakh  andeliminate the possibility of the resumption of militaryactivities. Such guarantees  along with standard securitymeasures — deployment of OSCE peace-keepers demilitarization of all evacuated territory  and so on —must also address Nagorno Karabakh’s legitimate need  asan indispensable security element  of a corridor linking theenclave with the outside world.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionposes a grave threat to both global and regional securityand stability. At the 1995 Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the States partiesundertook an in-depth and earnest review of theimplementation of the Treaty and reached a decision for theTreaty to continue in force indefinitely. My delegationwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate itssatisfaction with this historic outcome. Armenia attachesgreat importance to the early conclusion of acomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty — and no later than1996.In recent years the United Nations has convened aseries of global conferences. The important process ofinternational gatherings has continued this year. TheWorld Summit for Social Development brought togethermany strands that had previously been pursued separately.For the first time in history there was a politicalacknowledgment that the eradication of poverty must bethe first priority of any society.Within each of the United Nations globalconferences  the advancement of women has been a majorconcern  and we have witnessed a number of considerablegains on women’s issues. The Fourth Conference onWomen  which has just concluded in Beijing  bothreaffirms the commitments toward the advancement ofwomen made in the previous conferences and builds upontheir achievements.The Platform of Action agreed upon at the BeijingConference will lead to the creation of new machinerythat will help countries integrate women’s issues intonational policy-making.Virtually all Member States of the United Nationsfavour an increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil reflecting the radical changes in the world andthe increase in the Organization’s overall membership.However  an increase in membership should not diminishthe Council’s efficiency. Meanwhile  the Security Councilmust continue working to improve its openness transparency and communication with non-members. TheCouncil should also be able to respond to emergingthreats and disputes before their escalation into armedconflict.There is a direct link between peace and security  onthe one hand  and economic and social development  onthe other. Therefore  radical reform of the Economic andSocial Council is imperative. As a first step  strengtheningof the Council’s policy-setting role and coordinationcapability in operational activities for development isrequired. Together with improved coordination of UnitedNations organizations and agencies devoted to economicand social progress  a strengthened Economic and SocialCouncil could better assist the Security Council andadvise it of potential emergencies arising out of economicand social conditions.The issue of financial resources is fundamental. IfMember States wish to have an effective worldOrganization to meet global challenges  they must paytheir assessments  as they are legally committed to do.22We are not indifferent to the financial situation of theUnited Nations  and I would like to assure the Assemblythat my country will do its best to fulfil its obligations.However  the current assessment formulas no longer fullyreflect global economic and political realities. The High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situationof the United Nations was established by the Assembly inpart in response to the necessity for revision of theassessment structure. The aim of a comprehensive financialreform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale reflective of Members’ real capacity to pay  automaticallyadaptable to changed national circumstances and givingconsideration to the needs of countries with low per capitaincomes.Let me conclude by wishing the General Assemblyevery success in the demanding work it faces during thissession  and by pledging Armenia’s most active andefficient cooperation with the delegations of other States asyou  Sir  preside over our deliberations."
"8",284,"ATG",50,1995,"Forty-five yearsago  in 1950  a destructive hurricane battered my islandcountry. It destroyed our small homes  levelled oursugar-cane fields  left death and destruction in its path andmade Antigua and Barbuda a destitute colony. It was thevery worst hurricane that Antigua and Barbuda had everexperienced. Several hurricanes were to strike us after1950  including Hurricane Hugo in 1989.Thirty-five days ago  however  Hurricane Luis visitedits fury on my small island developing State. For more than48 hours  its mighty gusts blew the roofs from thousands ofhomes  schools  churches  government buildings  hotels. Itssustained winds  exceeding 160 miles per hour  uprootedmany of Antigua and Barbuda’s old trees  decapitatedthousands of stately palms  and deposited the leaves andbroken limbs of our evergreen trees everywhere. Theswollen sea sent surf and sand swirling into the lobbies andbeachfront rooms of our hotels — the source of ournational income. Sheets of rain  carried relentlessly by thewinds of Hurricane Luis  made everything wet andeveryone weary. Our electricity and telephone systems weredestroyed when thousands of poles succumbed to the furyof its winds  snapping cables and smashing equipment asthey fell to the earth. Our fishermen lost their boats  ourfarmers lost their fields  and our people lost some of ourcourage. Nature appeared to have declared war on us.When the ferocious winds of Hurricane Luis subsided  48hours after landfall  the verdant  lush  tropical vegetationthat had drawn millions to our shores over the years haddisappeared; our islands were a mere caricature of theirprevious glory. The engine of our economy has stalled;tourism  the source of Antigua and Barbuda’s income  hasbeen severely compromised and we may not be able torestart the industry for several weeks. Fishermen andfarmers  storekeepers and hotel workers are now withoutincomes; thousands are jobless. The threat of creepingpoverty hangs over a people that  14 years ago  at the endof 150 years of colonialism  had started to enjoy animproved standard of living  higher than ever recorded inour 350-year modern history. Forty-eight hours afterHurricane Luis had traversed the Caribbean  thevulnerability of small island States was again mademanifest. Dominica  Guadeloupe  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Maarten  Anguilla and Montserrat all suffered a fatesimilar to Antigua and Barbuda’s. Coming on the heels ofLuis  Hurricane Marilyn would batter the island of SaintThomas. Small island States and territories  thriving androbust on one day  were paralysed and incapacitatedwithin 48 hours.Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes areto trample through our region each year; yet climateexperts have given us notice that the phenomenon knownas global warming will generate a greater number of“extreme weather events”  more ferocious and monstrousin each succeeding year. Hurricane Luis was 700 mileswide; its wind gusts reached almost 200 miles per hour;and its sustained winds exceeded 160 miles per hour. Itwas unique in its size and devilish in its fury.There may never be sufficient evidence to link theglobal warming phenomenon to any single hurricane; butthe pattern is evident. I draw the Assembly’s attention toa study entitled “Confronting Climate Change”  publishedby the Cambridge University Press. In it we read:“If global temperatures continue to rise inaccordance with current predictions  increases in thenumber and severity of storms  floods  droughts  andother short-term weather extremes may be one of theearliest observed and most dramatic effects.”8Carbon dioxide emissions  caused by the burning ofpetroleum  coal  wood and gas  since the start of theindustrial revolution in Western Europe 200 years ago  havebegun to warm the planet and to place the survival of smallislands in jeopardy.Three years ago  at the Earth Summit in Rio  Brazil the nations of the world had their representatives sign theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.I read from the Convention:“The ultimate objective of this Convention andany related legal instruments that the Conference ofthe Parties may adopt is to achieve ... stabilization ofgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at alevel that would prevent dangerous [man-made]interference with the climate system.” (article 2)Earlier this year  the nations of the world met inBerlin  Germany  to consider a proposal matching thisobjective and linked to this Convention; it was put forwardby 41 vulnerable small island States. Many industrializedcountries  guilty of emitting into our Earth’s atmospherebillions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhousegases  would not then agree to any reduction in these gases.We cannot stand idly by  experience the deadly effects ofglobal warming  and be satisfied with promises. Harmfulproduction  wasteful consumption and dangerous disposalpatterns continue to characterize the behaviour of the largestindustrialized States. They sow the wind; small islandStates reap the whirlwind. In the South Pacific  wheredefenceless small island States predominate  another largeindustrialized State chooses to explode several nuclearbombs  euphemistically called “nuclear devices”. Weremain opposed to the testing of all nuclear weapons. Ifthose bombs are as harmless and as safe as that Stateclaims  then why not test them on its own soil? The samedisregard for the weak and small States holds for thetransboundary movement of hazardous wastes  especiallyshipments of nuclear wastes through the Caribbean Sea. Weare dreadfully afraid of an accident and equally fearful ofthe impact of news of an accident on our development.We have done much of what is required of us toensure that our development proceeds apace and with fewsetbacks. Evidence of our intelligent use of our meagreresource base is captured in the annual HumanDevelopment Report published by the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP). For example  myCaribbean country shares a common currency with fiveother small island States and one territory. We call it theEastern Caribbean dollar. Its value has remained unchangedsince 1976. For almost two decades  self-discipline andprobity have been the hallmark of the Eastern CaribbeanCentral Bank.Hurricane Luis has severely disabled four of theseven economies which share the currency — Dominica Saint Kitts and Nevis  Montserrat  and Antigua andBarbuda. And unfair attempts by Central Americanbanana producers to eliminate the English-speakingCaribbean’s 3 per cent of the world market share threatento undo the other three economies — those of Grenada Saint Lucia  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. TheEastern Caribbean dollar (EC$) can only remain stable ifour economies earn foreign exchange. Unfair trade  justlike hurricanes  can devastate our vulnerable small islandStates’ economies and make the earning of foreignexchange impossible.We share a currency  and we share a university. TheUniversity of the West Indies is soon to celebrate itsfiftieth year of continued existence  having graduated anoverwhelming number of professionals from the 17 Statesand territories of the English-speaking Caribbean whichcall it their own. This year my Government provided 73scholarships to the most deserving youth in Antigua andBarbuda  with amounts ranging from $EC 54 000 to$10 000 each. We intend to build the national capacity toensure that sustainable human development is more thana wish.We share a currency  we share a university  we sharea judiciary. The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals hasdemonstrated that justice and cost-effectiveness can betwin handmaids of small island States. Eight of us alsocombine our national defence forces to form a RegionalSecurity System (RSS). Though small by any standard we have succeeded in increasing our defencesexponentially  while containing defence costssignificantly. The recent invasion of the Comoros Islandsby a mercenary band which took its President hostage andseized power there serves as a reminder of the securityconstraints facing small island States.Our efforts at regional collaboration extend beyonda common currency  a university  a judiciary and adefence force. You have recently pronounced  Sir  on thesuccess of “interlocking  regional building blocks” inEurope. Thirty years ago  before many of our Caribbeancountries were independent and free  we commenced thatprocess by creating  in 1965  the Caribbean Free TradeAgreement (Carita). Carita has metamorphosed into theCaribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom) 9and earlier this year the Association of Caribbean States(ACS) was formed by all the States and territories whichshare the Caribbean Sea. More than 200 million peopleform this new market. Antigua and Barbuda has done muchof what is required of it to achieve sustainabledevelopment. The results of our many and varied effortscannot bear fruit if  year after year  hurricanes destroy thatwhich we have created. We look to the United Nations tohelp in persuading the industrialized countries to adopt theToronto targets  as a first step in our common effort toensure the survival of this planet which we all share.We have faith in the United Nations because theimage of the United Nations in my country and region ispositive and good. When a volcano threatened to erupt onthe neighbouring island of Montserrat and my countryoffered safe refuge to half of that island’s population  theUnited Nations Resident Representative in Barbados led aUnited Nations team of experts to Antigua; they came todetermine how the United Nations could assist. Followingthe devastation wrought by Hurricane Luis  the UnitedNations Development Programme Barbados country office the Department of Humanitarian Affairs  the World HealthOrganization and several other United Nations agencies andbodies quickly launched an international appeal to help usreconstruct. The most distinguished citizen of Antigua andBarbuda  His Excellency the Governor-General  was alsoquick to agree to be the Chairman of the UN 50 NationalCommittee. This willingness serves as a measure of thehigh regard in which the United Nations is held.My small island State can also boast that it has paidits contribution to the United Nations in full; we owe noarrears  despite the burden which membership dues andpeace-keeping operations impose on our limited resources.We can only encourage the wealthy and the powerful topay their obligations. For us the United Nations is morethan a symbol; more  too  than an instrument for the narrownational interests of Antigua and Barbuda. For us  theUnited Nations is the guarantor of international law  anagent for international peace and security  a catalyst fordevelopment and prosperity.The Secretary-General has noted that the greatestthreats to peace are adverse social and economic conditionswithin States and among States. As a consequence  duringthe past three years the international community hasconvened six global conferences to plot the course ofhuman history in the coming century and beyond.Collectively  the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  the World Conference onHuman Rights  the First Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  the World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women collectivelycreate a multifaceted framework of action; this will becompleted by the Second United Nations Conference onHuman Settlements (Habitat II)  in 1996. Theseconferences act as a guide to Member States as they seekto address the challenges inherent in the interrelated areasof peace and development.States must now seek to implement the severalProgrammes of Action. We are particularly gratified bythe extent to which the last two conferences build on thepositions which we took at the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates. In particular  my delegation would wish toemphasize the importance of empowering women. Theinclusion of women in the councils of the Government ofAntigua and Barbuda  and at senior levels in the publicservice and the private sector  gives credence to theearnestness of our commitment to the advancement ofwomen. Without the full and equal participation ofwomen  sustainable development cannot be achieved.In congratulating you on your election to your highoffice  Mr. President  my country is very cognizant of therole which Vasco da Gama played in bringing distantworlds together. Today we find in you the same foresightand imagination displayed by your most well-knowncitizen. These qualities are necessary for leading thishistoric fiftieth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. We congratulate Foreign Minister Mr. AmaraEssy  the President of the forty-ninth session  on hissterling stewardship of this Organization.At several junctures in its 50-year history  thepurpose and goals of this United Nations have beenredefined. In 1945  following the end of the SecondWorld War  the United Nations was created as a policyinstrument of the victorious Powers to prevent furtherlarge-scale destruction and massive loss of life. For morethan a decade the United Nations was focused onpreventing a third world war.In 1957 a little country in Africa twisted the tail ofits colonial master  and Kwame Nkrumah emerged fromjail in Ghana to lead his country and to redefine thepurpose of this United Nations. When the United Nationswas created in 1945  colonialism defined the relationsbetween the powerful and the weak  between Europe andmuch of Asia and Africa. The adoption of resolution101514 (XV) in 1960 turned the United Nations into a policyinstrument to end colonialism.For more than a decade after 1960 the focus of theUnited Nations was to destroy colonialism and apartheid.My small island nation did not even enter into theconsciousness of the founders in 1945. We are thebeneficiaries of the struggle to end colonialism. Thepresence here of small island States is mere happenstance since few expected that there could be any such creation asa micro-State  seated in this Hall as an equal of themightiest and the largest States. In that regard  we wouldwish to welcome the island State of Palau to membershipin this Organization.But by 1970 the United Nations had begun to addressinequities in international trade and development  and thesearch for a more just international economic orderdisplaced the concerns of 1945. In the 1970s  also  the coldwar exploded. Regional wars in southern Africa  CentralAmerica and the Middle East were fuelled by the twosuper-Powers. By the end of the 1980s the constraintsimposed by the cold war and the demands on our resourcesfor peace-keeping made the United Nations a much morecomplicated instrument than it had ever been.Today our United Nations must struggle with theunfinished business of earlier decades. Small island States in the 1990s  aware that their very existence is at stake have tried to make the United Nations focus on theenvironment and development  especially climate change.If we fail in this quest  this civilization will destroy us and in the process  destroy itself. Island States are much like thecanary in the coal mine; we are the messengers  signallingthe danger to the rest of the world.Having suffered through Hurricane Hugo andHurricane Luis  we thank the many Governments institutions and people who have come to our rescue. Thepeople of Antigua and Barbuda are aware of thevulnerability of small islands. We know our history and weknow the role played by small States in shaping the present.My Prime Minister  the Honourable Lester Bryant Bird  hasapplauded the people of Antigua and Barbuda for theirresilience and indomitable will in the face of adversity. Ifwe can endure 200 years of chattel slavery  and 150 yearsof brutal colonialism  then surely we can recover from twonights of a horrible hurricane  he has said. We believe thatsmall island States at this United Nations can also shape thenext five decades in human history. We are here for thatpurpose  and we intend to succeed."
"9",331,"AUS",50,1995,"I congratulate Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of thissession of the General Assembly. His election is a tributeboth to him and to Portugal  and Australia will work withhim to ensure that this historic fiftieth session is asmemorable as it could possibly be.I join in warmly welcoming  as the 185th MemberState of the United Nations  our fellow South Pacific Forummember Palau.If we are to effectively prepare for our future we mustfirst be able to clearly see our past. If we are to see wherewe must go  we must know where we have been: we mustbe conscious of our failures  but we should be proud of oursuccesses.The structure of today’s world community — ofsovereign  self-determined  independent States workingtogether on the basis of equality in a framework ofinternational law — simply did not exist before the Charterof the United Nations came into being. There wereimaginings of it in the minds of many for a very long time and we saw emerge between the two world wars a paleapproximation of it with the League of Nations. But it wasat that special moment in San Francisco  50 years ago  thattoday’s concept of a community of nations was first trulyborn. And that concept has passed the test of 50 years oflife.Gifted though the authors of the Charter were  theywould I think be awed to see how very much their visionof a globalized world has now been answered  andexceeded. Today’s world is one world  a world in which noindividuals and no States can aspire to solve all theirproblems or fulfil all their dreams alone. The ideas of SanFrancisco have entered into the unconscious of people allover the world. Those who refuse to acknowledge theglobal character of our world  or who recoil from it andretreat into unilateralism or  worse  isolationism  havesimply not understood the new dynamics that are at work.Ours is an age in which we are called to more  not less cooperation — and to ever more  and more responsible sharing of our common destiny.The ideas of San Francisco have assumed manyconcrete forms  which have deepened and expanded overthe last five decades. States now habitually  virtuallyautomatically  conduct their relations with each other onthe basis of the United Nations Charter. We have addedcontinually to the corpus of international law andagreements made pursuant to the Charter  in ways thathave touched every aspect of modern life. We have builtinstitutions that have sought to deliver to the peoples ofthe world their most basic needs — for peace andsecurity  for economic well-being  and for dignity andliberty.It was natural that following a devastating world warand the hideous brutality which accompanied it  theCharter would have at its heart the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. So far  anyway  we havepassed the test of ensuring that the world would neveragain be subjected to global conflict. The United Nationshas been  of course  deeply challenged in the maintenanceof peace  from the very beginning and ever since. Thereare areas in which its attempts to maintain and restorepeace have been flawed  and where the United Nationshas faltered. But for all that has gone wrong in places likeBosnia and Somalia and Rwanda we should not forget thesuccesses  like those in El Salvador  Cambodia andMozambique. To go back a generation  no one shouldforget the role that was played by the Security Counciland the Secretary-General in that desperate month ofOctober 1962 when the hands of the clock were secondsbefore midnight and the world did face potential nuclearholocaust. And no one should forget the role that  forexample  the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty has playedin falsifying the almost universal prediction in the 1960sthat within two decades there would be 20 or more Statespossessing nuclear weapons.In development  in seeking to fulfil its commitmentto promote ""social progress and better standards of life""the United Nations has laboured hard  sometimes in verydifficult circumstances. The gap between developed anddeveloping countries remains unacceptably high; therehave been and continue to be difficulties with theavailability of resources for development assistance; andwe have to acknowledge the awful reality  according tothe World Bank  that 1.3 billion of our people still live inabsolute poverty. But in food and agriculture  inemployment and labour standards  in health  in educationand in building the infrastructure so vital to communitiesin the developing world — roads  bridges  watersystems — the United Nations and its agencies haveworked relentlessly in the service of the human family. Itis because of the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF) that today 80 per cent of the world’s childrenare immunized against six killer diseases. And this is just10one of hundreds of similar stories that the United Nationscan and should be telling.Basic to the United Nations concept of the worldcommunity was that it should operate under and foster thedevelopment of law  justice and human rights. Afundamental commitment of the United Nations is toestablish conditions under which justice may prevail international law will be respected and peace can be built.In fulfilment of this charge  the United Nations hasprovided the setting for the negotiation of over 300 majortreaties  including in such crucial fields as arms control transport  navigation and communications. This verypractical area of international cooperation has formed theframework of a globalized world.The Charter of the United Nations speaks not just ofsecuring better standards of life  but of those betterstandards being enjoyed “in larger freedom”. And thearticulation  development and implementation of humanrights standards across the whole spectrum of rights —economic  social and cultural as well as political andcivil — has been one of the most important andconstructive roles of the United Nations. One of the worstof all denials of personal and political freedom was thatimposed by apartheid. The triumph over that evil was aboveall a victory for those South Africans and their leaderswhose freedom and dignity apartheid had so long denied.But it would ignore the testimony of history not torecognize the importance of the role played by the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council in creating theconditions for that to occur.For the peoples of this world  no political right hasbeen more important than the right to self-determination.The achievements of the United Nations in this field aloneare testimony to the indispensable role it has played inhuman affairs  with hundreds of millions of people havingexercised their right to self-determination in these past 50years. It is the great movement of decolonization  as muchas the cold war and its aftermath  that defines the modernworld as we now know it  and which shapes the world’sagenda for the years that lie ahead.The United Nations of the future will need to be above all  an organization which works and speaks for allits Members  no matter how large or small  and whoselegitimacy is thus without question. It must be anorganization better oriented to performance  to delivery topeople of the things they need and have a right to expect.And it must be an organization which seeks to reintegrate and better coordinate  the implementation of the three basicobjectives of the United Nations so clearly articulated atSan Francisco 50 years ago: the objectives of peace —meeting the need for security; of development —meeting economic needs; and of human rights andjustice — meeting the need for individual and groupdignity and liberty.In the peace agenda  disarmament and arms controlcontinue to be of crucial importance  and a majorchallenge immediately ahead will be to maintain themomentum of multilateral disarmament andnon-proliferation efforts. The decision by the Review andExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to extend theTreaty indefinitely was  and remains — despite what hashappened since — the right decision. The work on acomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty must be brought toconclusion  as promised  in the first half of 1996. Wemust also begin as soon as possible negotiations on atreaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear-weapons purposes. A further helpful step  although moredifficult to achieve  would be a regime requiring all Statesto declare and account for their present stocks of fissilematerial. The basic objective in all of this is to movetowards the goal that is agreed by all — and it shouldnever be forgotten that it has been agreed by all —namely  that we will  ultimately  eliminate all nuclearweapons.It is in this context particularly that the decisions byFrance and China to continue nuclear testing are to be sostrongly deplored. The environmental consequences arebad enough of setting off an explosion more than fivetimes the size of that which destroyed Hiroshima — asFrance did yesterday on the fragile atoll of Fangataufa inAustralia’s Pacific neighbourhood. But the nuclear policyconsequences are even worse. This is not the time to bereinforcing nuclear stockpiles and asserting their ongoingdeterrent role: the world wants and needs to be moving inthe opposite direction.This is the time to be negotiating away thosestockpiles  and building verification systems of the kindwe did with the chemical weapons Convention — whichstill needs to be ratified to come into effect — and I urgethose States that have not yet acceded to that Conventionto do so urgently. This is not the time to be encouragingscepticism about the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty  asthe Chinese and French tests are doing. It is  rather  thetime for the nuclear Powers to be encouraging theuniversal observance of that Treaty in the way that theybest can: by showing that they themselves are absolutely11serious about moving to eliminate nuclear weapons fromthe face of the globe. The best way for them to do thatright now is for France and China to immediately end theirtesting programmes; for all the nuclear-weapon States tosign the nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties that now exist inthe South Pacific and elsewhere; and for those States tocommit themselves wholeheartedly to negotiating agenuinely comprehensive  zero-threshold comprehensivetest-ban treaty into place by the middle of next year.The past few turbulent years of United Nationsexperience on the ground in peace-keeping and peaceenforcement has underlined the need for it to improve theeffectiveness of its work in these important fields. Australiahas welcomed the Secretary-General’s further work in thisarea in his very lucid January 1995 “Supplement to AnAgenda for Peace'”. In our own contributions to the debateon these issues  we have argued for the clearest possiblethinking to be given to the achievability of objectives rightacross the whole spectrum of responses to securityproblems — from peace-building to peace maintenance topeace restoration to peace enforcement.We have consistently argued  and I make the pointagain very briefly today  that if the United Nations is to beable to meet effectively the security challenges of thepost-cold-war world it must begin to devote more resourcesto preventive strategies than to reactive strategies. It justmakes more sense to concentrate on prevention than onafter-the-event peace restoration  both for inter-Stateconflict and in the unhappily now far more common caseof intra-State conflict. Violent conflicts are always far moredifficult and costly to resolve than non-violent disputes  andfailed States are extremely difficult to piece back together.All that said  it has been encouraging to see theprogress made in recent days towards resolving the conflictin the former Yugoslavia  and in moving the Middle Eastpeace process a substantial new step forward. The UnitedNations should always be prepared to lend its support andencouragement to preventive diplomacy and to peacemakingefforts taking place outside the formal framework of theUnited Nations system  and it should remain particularlyalert to the opportunities envisaged in the Charter foradvancing the peace agenda through regional organizations.In the latter context we in the Asia-Pacific have been verypleased with the rapid evolution of the new Regional Forumof the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)over the last two years as a new vehicle for dialogue andtrust and confidence-building  in our own region.Particular attention has been given recently  as we allknow  to the question of improving the rapid reactioncapability of the United Nations  and I warmly commendthe work that has been done to clarify our thinking onthese issues by the Netherlands and Danish Governments and particularly in the major Canadian report  “Towardsa Rapid Reaction Capability for the United Nations”  justpresented to the Assembly. The very useful emphasis ofthe Canadian study is on the idea of improving the UnitedNations system’s capability at the centre first  particularlyin the area of operational planning  and therebyencouraging greater willingness by troop contributors togive practical and more urgent effect to stand-byarrangements. No organizational arrangements will eversubstitute for clear-eyed decision-making by the SecurityCouncil on the responses and mandates that areappropriate to particular situations  but the implementationof changes of this kind should make us much betterequipped as an international community to deal in futurewith situations like that in Rwanda  where last time ourresponse was so tragically inadequate.The security agenda tends to dominate most popularperceptions of the United Nations role  but we in theinternational community must never allow our attention tobe diverted from the demands of the development agenda now as pressing as ever. When historians hundreds ofyears hence look back at this last half century  the coldwar and its aftermath will not be the only greatinternational current to be remembered; it will be thegiant step of decolonization that looms at least as large.Decolonization led to the emergence of a worldeconomy which for many years has been seen as dividedprincipally into two categories  the developed and thedeveloping countries. But today  the picture is morecomplicated. Mainly for reasons of change in technologyand information systems  we do now live in a globaleconomy. No part of it is entirely separate from thewhole  and no one can act in that global economy in aneffective way  entirely alone. Because we live in that kindof economy a key part of our action to deal with theproblems of development must  accordingly  bemultilateral  and the key problem facing us  bothmultilaterally and in our bilateral  donor roles  is thatwithin the global economy the gap between rich and poorcountries  despite all efforts to resist this  has grown. Thefact that some 1.3 billion of the 5.7 billion people alivetoday live at an unacceptable level of poverty is morallyinsupportable  and dangerous.12The United Nations of the future must  as a matter ofthe most urgent priority  forge a new agenda fordevelopment and reshape its relevant institutions toimplement that agenda effectively. This is as important asany task it faces in the service of the human family and inrecreating itself as an institution fit for the twenty-firstcentury. The agenda is available for all to see. It has beenfully described in the six global conferences held by theUnited Nations in the past four years — the conferences onchildren  the environment  human rights  population  socialdevelopment  and now women. There have also beenimportant studies by the international financial institutionsand by academic institutions. We know now what we needto do. We must resolve  politically  to do it.In pursuing these various themes it is important however  for us not to lose sight of those geographicalregions where particular focus is still required  and wherethe United Nations role is more vital than ever. Africa’sinfluence and importance continues to be felt throughout theworld in every field of human activity and culture. Excitingpolitical developments  including the ending of apartheid have been accompanied by major new efforts to restructureand reform national economies. Those efforts demand thecontinued support of the international community  and inparticular the United Nations system. Other regions wherethe United Nations needs to play a particular role tofacilitate economic and social development are the CentralAsian republics  the Middle East  the Caribbean  and in anumber of areas in the Indian Ocean region.The Indian Ocean region is one where Australia  as anIndian Ocean country as well as an Asia-Pacific country has been promoting  with others in the region  bothgovernmental and non-governmental efforts to enhanceregional cooperation  particularly on economic and tradeissues. The success to date of the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council (APECC) in developing cooperativestrategies in the Asia-Pacific region to promote prosperityand stability  complementing the United Nations broaderwork for these goals at the international level  does offerone possible model for the countries of the Indian OceanRim to consider.The institutions of the United Nations relevant toeconomic and social development are urgently in need ofreform. The General Assembly has created the high-levelWorking Group needed for political consensus on this. Thatmust complete its work in this fiftieth anniversary year  andit must do so creatively  setting aside past vested interestsin the system. We must implement the development agendaof the future in a way which ensures a productive and fairplace in the global economy for all States.The complex and interlinked system of principles legal regimes and machinery that the United Nations hasestablished to promote human rights is one of its majorachievements. It must be built upon and strengthened recognizing always that the human rights whoseuniversality and indivisibility we assert are abouteconomic and social and cultural rights just as much asabout the civil and political rights on which the developedcountries tend to focus so much attention. Priority mustbe given to the major international human rightsinstruments and machinery and the committees whichmonitor their implementation. By this means we canprovide a frank  non-confrontational and constructivedialogue amongst States parties.The advisory services and technical-assistanceactivities of the United Nations can also play a role inpromoting the observance of human rights and theimplementation of democratic principles around the world.Programmes to help countries develop their own nationalinstitutions and systems to promote and protect humanrights will enhance their capacity to prevent violationsand  accordingly  make a direct contribution to humansecurity.It cannot be sufficiently emphasized enough that thepeace and development and human-rights agendas I havementioned are all interlinked. We need to avoid thecompartmentalization that occurred throughout the cold-war years  in which peace-and-security issues development issues and human-rights and justice issueswere isolated in completely different conceptual andinstitutional boxes. Any viable modern concept ofinternational peace  let alone peace within States  mustrecognize that peace and security and development areindissolubly bound up with each other. There can be nosustainable peace without development and nodevelopment without peace. And human rights  in thefullest sense  as I have described them  have to come intothe equation too. There is unlikely to be sustainable peacein any society if material needs are satisfied but needs fordignity and liberty are not.No agendas of substance  no matter how clear inconcept  how well-coordinated in principle they may be will mean anything to people if they are not able to beimplemented through effective organizational structuresand instruments. There has been widespread recognitionin recent years  as we all know  that the structure of the13United Nations that grew up during the past 50 years issimply not adequate to the tasks of the next.We now have an embarrassment of riches with respectto ideas and proposals for change to the United Nations.Just as it is urgent that we complete work on “An Agendafor Development” in this fiftieth year  it is equally urgentthat we complete the work of the high-level Working Groupon the reform of the United Nations system also within thisfiftieth year.The structural problem that it is probably the mosturgently necessary to resolve  if the credibility of the wholeUnited Nations system is to be maintained  is that of theSecurity Council. The debate on this subject has been longand detailed and is familiar to all of us. Australia’s definiteview is that it has been going on for long enough  and weare now at the time when action is required. Last year  wesubmitted some illustrative models on the basis of whichconsideration could be given to an expansion in themembership of the Council. Others have made very specificproposals. Again  in this field there is no lack of ideas.What we have to do now is move to the stage of forgingpolitical consensus on a new Security Council  which willbe effective  represent the whole membership of the UnitedNations and sensibly reflect the realities of today and thefuture  not those of 1945.There are many structural changes and personnelreforms that could and should be made within the UnitedNations system to improve its efficiency. But ultimately thequality of that system depends on what we are prepared topay for it.It is important to appreciate at the outset the order ofmagnitude of the sums we are talking about. The corefunctions of the United Nations  involving the Headquartersin New York  the Offices in Geneva  Vienna and Nairobi and the five regional Commissions  cost just US$ 1.2billion between them. To take just one comparison  lastyear the annual budget of just one Department in oneUnited States city  the New York Police Department exceeded that $1.2 billion by $600 million.The total number of personnel needed to run thoseUnited Nations core functions is around 10 700. Comparethe local administration of my own national capital Canberra — again  just one city in one of the 185 StatesMembers of the United Nations — which has some 22 000employees on the public payroll.The cost of United Nations peace operations lastyear  in Cyprus  Western Sahara  the former Yugoslaviaand 13 other locations  was $3.2 billion. That is less thanwhat it takes to run just three New York CityDepartments: the Police Department  the Fire Departmentand the Department of Correction.If we add to the core functions of the United Nationsall the related programmes and organs  including theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  theUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF)  the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the International DrugControl Programme (UNDCP)  we are still talking abouta total of around 33 000 people and a total budget including both assessed and voluntary contributions  of$6.3 billion. That sounds a lot — rather more than justfor the core functions — but it is not quite so much whenone considers  for example  that the annual globalturnover of just one international accounting firm  PriceWaterhouse  is around $4.5 billion.If we go further than that and add to the corefunctions and related programmes all the other specializedprogrammes and agencies of the entire United Nationsfamily — agencies such as the Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO)  the International LabourOrganization (ILO)  the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  theWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency  and put into the equation as wellthe Bretton Woods institutions — the World Bank groupand the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  whichbetween them employ nearly 10 000 people and spend $5billion annually — we are still talking about total UnitedNations-system personnel of just around 61 400 and atotal United Nations-system dollar cost of $18.2 billion.A total of 61 400 may sound like a lot of people and it is  but perhaps it is not so many when we considerthat more than this number — 65 000  in fact — areemployed by the three Disney theme parks in California Florida and France. Three times as many people sellMcDonald’s hamburgers around the world as work for theUnited Nations system. And $18.2 billion might be a lotof money  but just one major multinational corporation Dow Chemical  which happens also to have 61 000employees world wide  has an annual revenue in excessof $20 billion.14When we put the financial problems of the UnitedNations into this kind of perspective  as I think we ought todo more often  the solutions do not really look quite sohard. Surely  between us  with our combined defenceexpenditure alone of around $767 billion  the 185 MemberStates can find that kind of money. But  of course  theproblem of paying for the United Nations has now becomecritical because of the unwillingness or inability of so manyof the Member States  including the biggest of us all  topay their assessed contributions  notwithstanding that thecost of these for the major developed-country contributorsworks out at between $7 and $15 per head per year — theprice of no more than one or two movie tickets in this city.We have a short-term problem  which I believe canand should be solved within the United Nations system byallowing the United Nations to borrow from the WorldBank. But we also have a longer-term problem which frankly  does not look as though it is going to be solved however much we continue to work at adjusting assessmentscales  exhort Member States to pay up and remind them ofthe consequences under Article 19 of the Charter if theyfail to do so.So what are we to do about all this? In my judgement it is time to look again — this time very seriouslyindeed — at the options which exist for supplementingMember States’ contributions with external sources offinance. The practicability of collecting a levy on every oneof the $300 000 billion worth of foreign-exchangetransactions that now occur every year remains to be fullyassessed  but simple arithmetic tells us that if we strike arate of just .001 per cent for such a levy  which hardlyseems likely to have any significant economicconsequences  we could generate $3 billion in revenue.Moreover  we know that if we could impose a levy oninternational airline passengers of $10 for everyinternational sector flown  which would be very easilycollectible indeed  we could also raise $3 billion: nearly thewhole annual cost of United Nations peace operations.There are also other revenue options that  to a greateror lesser extent  have the same rational nexus with UnitedNations costs as these do  in that they involve transactionswhich are international  take place within a framework oflaw and cooperation provided by the United Nations andcan be harmed by a breakdown in international peace andsecurity — precisely the areas in which the United Nationshas a fundamental responsibility.But traditionally  a threshold objection of principle hasbeen mounted against any such talk. Member States  it hasbeen said  should themselves wholly own the UnitedNations system; if the Secretariat had direct access torevenue other than assessed contributions of MemberStates  who knows what adventures it might be inclinedto get up to. But ownership and control are totallyseparate issues. The United Nations operates on asovereign-equality principle  which means that  forexample  those six States which between them pay atpresent over 65 per cent of the United Nations regularbudget should under no circumstances have greaterauthority over how it is spent than the overwhelmingmajority of Members  each of which pays much lesserproportions of the total.Whatever the funding sources involved  the crucialquestion is surely how and by whom the money is spent.It is absolutely crucial that there be appropriate control offunds by Member States  with all the accountabilitymechanisms that implies. But that does not mean thatthose Member States should themselves have to provideall the funds in the first place.In talking about these issues to many of myministerial colleagues from a wide range of countries andacross all continents over the last few days  I have foundthe almost unanimous reaction that the present  and likelycontinuing  financial crisis of the United Nations demandsthat these issues be looked at again  without anyprejudgements of the questions of principle orpracticability involved.I would suggest accordingly that the time is right forthe Secretary-General to convene once again a high-leveladvisory group  like the Volcker-Ogata group establishedin 1992  with a mandate to think explicitly through whathas hitherto been more or less unthinkable: how to fundthe United Nations system in a way that reaches outbeyond the resources that Member States are prepared toput directly into it. Such a group could report to or workwith a committee of representatives of Member States —one in existence already  such as the High-Level WorkingGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations orone newly created for the purpose.A great deal of work has already been or is beingdone on many of these issues  and it should be possiblefor such a group to report within six months or so —certainly within a year. The parameters of the debate haveto be changed  and for that to happen we need anauthoritative new statement of the art of the possible.Here  as elsewhere  we have to move forward. Wehave to look to new ideas. We have to encourage15humankind’s ingenuity to search for better ways for Statesto deal with each other as relationships take new shape  asnew States emerge and as problems which could not havebeen conceived of a few years ago become the challengesof the day.We will fail to meet those challenges if we adheresolely to the ideas and dogma of the past. The UnitedNations was itself founded on a mixture of idealism andpragmatism. Both were essential to build a new world 50years ago  and in the past 50 years that idealism has notdisappeared. It was an important force in bringing about theend of the cold war  and  more than anything else  it wasidealism that lay behind the process of decolonization which so shifted the tectonic plates of history.To some idealism will always be the enemy ofpracticality. But to others it will always involve  more thananything else  the courage to take advantage of newopportunities  ensuring that at least some of today’s idealswill become tomorrow’s reality. Perhaps now  50 yearsbeyond San Francisco  we need to renew that idealism andwalk down some of those uncharted paths that idealistshave always been prepared to tread."
"10",378,"AUT",50,1995,"It is with greatpleasure that I congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at thisfiftieth session  at which we are commemorating thefounding of the United Nations half a century ago. Yourvast experience as a statesman and scholar is our assurancethat this session will be crowned with success.I wish to thank your distinguished predecessor  theForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire  whose untiring efforts tostimulate the reform process in our world Organizationdeserve special gratitude.Austria  a member of the European Union since 1January 1995  fully endorses the comprehensive statementmade on behalf of the Union by His Excellency Mr. JavierSolana Madariaga  the Spanish Foreign Minister.The Austrian Federal Government is stronglycommitted to the objectives of the United Nations Charterand to the work of the Organization. The United Nationshas traditionally been a priority of the Austrian foreignpolicy. Later this year  on 14 December  Austria willcelebrate the 40th birthday of its admission to membershipof the United Nations.Last June  our Parliament held a commemorativesession on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of thesigning of the United Nations Charter at San Francisco. Atthat meeting  all political parties represented in Parliamentpraised the achievements of the United Nations  expressedtheir appreciation of the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General in the quest for peace  justice and development and reaffirmed the commitment of Austria to a strong andvibrant United Nations.Austria’s strong commitment to the worldOrganization is reflected in Vienna’s role as one of theHeadquarters of the United Nations. The FederalGovernment and the City of Vienna lend maximum supportto the United Nations Office as well as to the UnitedNations agencies and programmes based in our capital.More than 36 000 Austrians have served as “bluehelmets” in United Nations peace-keeping operations some of them as force commanders. More than 30 of ourcountrymen have lost their lives in the service of peace.This dedication to peace-keeping led the FederalGovernment to organize the Vienna Seminar onPeacemaking and Peace-Keeping for the Next Century which was opened by the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations in March of this year. The report on thisConference was distributed this morning.My country also attaches particular importance tocivilian peace-keeping and sponsors a very successfultraining programme on civilian peace-keeping andpeace-building. At the city of Schlaining  this programmeprepares election observers  human rights observers andhumanitarian affairs officers for their difficult tasks.Concrete proposals for improving the civilian componentsof United Nations field missions were formulated at theInternational Conference on the Preparation of CivilianPersonnel of United Nations Field Missions. In addition Austria makes concerted efforts to support the UnitedNations preventive diplomacy capabilities. The AustrianGovernment will provide the Secretary-General with a listof personalities whose great experience will be at thedisposal of the United Nations.After the end of the cold war  new hopes werevested in the Security Council. The United Nations tookdecisive action in response to military aggression againsta sovereign State and undertook successful multipurposepeace-keeping missions to resolve several long-standingconflicts.At the same time  however  the internationalcommunity and the Security Council were called upon tohandle radically new situations. The United Nations hadto respond to these new types of conflict with itstraditional instruments: peace-keeping missions weredeployed to keep a non-existent peace. As we all know the United Nations missions in Somalia and in Bosnia andHerzegovina led to humiliation for the Organization andthe international community.With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina there is atlast some realistic hope that the renewed determination ofthe United Nations  combined with the decisive support ofNATO  may bring about a durable settlement and - aboveall - put an end to the plight of millions of innocent21victims  of whom the citizens of Sarajevo have become thesymbol. Terminating the barbaric siege of the Bosniancapital  which has lasted since the spring of 1992  carriesparticular significance.Austria fully supports the initiative undertaken by theUnited States  in the framework of the Contact Group  toreach a comprehensive peace agreement that will ensure theexistence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosniaand Herzegovina and the peaceful reintegration of EasternSlavonia. We welcome the agreement on Basic Principlesreached in New York earlier this week as an importantfurther step on the long and difficult road to peace.We remain deeply concerned about the fate ofhundreds of thousands of refugees. Austria attaches theutmost importance to the rights of all refugees anddisplaced persons to freely return to their homes  as alreadystated by the London Conference of August 1992.Let me equally stress how important it is for the futureof the region that all crimes be brought to light and theculprits punished. In this context  the War Crimes Tribunalset up in The Hague can play a crucial role.The efforts of the United Nations troops and theircommanders  who constantly risk their lives for the causeof peace  deserve our admiration. I should like also tohonour the memory of three of the main architects of theUnited States peace initiative who last August becamevictims of the siege of Sarajevo.During that same month  the Special Rapporteur of theUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights  Mr.Tadeusz Mazowiecki  resigned over what he called“the lack of consistency and courage displayed by theinternational community”.His relentless efforts in pointing out and documentingcrimes against humanity committed in the war have earnedhim our highest respect. We welcome the continuation ofthis important task under the eminent leadership of Ms.Rehn.A comprehensive settlement also needs to includesatisfactory solutions for minorities  not only in Croatia andBosnia and Herzegovina  but also in the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and in particular inKosovo  Vojvodina and Sanjak.The prospect of a well-coordinated contribution bythe world community to the reconstruction of thedevastated areas and to the relaunching of economicactivities could help in facilitating the prospects for peaceand its eventual consolidation.Furthermore  Austria believes that regional arms-control measures will be another decisive factor in theeffort to secure peace and should therefore be initiated asearly as possible.In the Middle East  long and arduous negotiationshave now led to an important breakthrough. We applaudas a major step towards final peace and cooperation in theregion yesterday’s signing of the agreement betweenIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) onthe transfer of authority.Today  the main threats to peace and security are nolonger predominantly attacks by one country againstanother sovereign State. We are faced with conflictsoriginating in ethnic tensions  authoritarian rule  economicdespair or migratory movements. Peace and security aretherefore threatened not only by violations of the code ofconduct among States  but increasingly by violations ofinternational standards on the relationship betweencitizens and their Governments and among differentgroups within countries. Our instruments for conflictresolution have to be adapted to these new circumstances.Part of this effort has to be an enhanced early-warning capacity of the United Nations. The earlier theUnited Nations can attempt to mediate  the more likelyare its missions to meet with success. By increasing thenumber of cases where preventive diplomacy can be usedsuccessfully — thus avoiding the need for military peace-keeping — an early-warning system would also be a greatinvestment.We also need to reinforce the capacity of the UnitedNations to assist Member States in their efforts toimprove democratic structures  including the holding offree and fair elections  the full observance of humanrights  the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms the strengthening of the rule of law  the fostering ofpopular participation and accountability of Governments and the development of a prosperous civil society.Furthermore  the capacity of the United Nations needs tobe strengthened in order to confront new threats to peaceand security  such as organized crime and illicittrafficking in drugs.22Austria has always been strongly committed todisarmament  arms control and non-proliferation. We trustthat the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) earlier this yearwill permit and encourage further substantial disarmamentmeasures  in particular the early conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty. We are confident thatnegotiations on the treaty will be concluded next year andthat the decision by one or more of the nuclear Powers toconduct additional nuclear-weapons tests — a decision thatcontinues to cause deep concern in Austria — will notdelay the conclusion of the negotiations.In this context  allow me to reiterate the invitation ofthe Austrian Federal Government to establish the futurecomprehensive test-ban treaty organization in Vienna  andto express my gratitude for the widespread support thisproposal has received and continues to receive.The human rights agenda has for many years beendominated by the quest to establish international standards culminating in the adoption of the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action. The recent Fourth World Conferenceon Women  held in Beijing  strongly reaffirmed the centralrole of these documents in the struggle for human rightsand their special significance in the context of the humanrights of women. Today  we have to concentrate on theimplementation of these standards. We must take allnecessary measures to fulfil our international human rightsobligations vis-à-vis our own peoples; we have to take afirm stand against human rights violations  wherever theyoccur; and we must assist Governments genuinelycommitted to improving the human rights situation in theircountries.The ever-more urgent question of minority rightsneeds to be an integral part of this agenda. In this context I should like to mention that Austria and Italy together havearrived at an autonomous solution concerning the Austrianminority in South Tyrol  Italy  which could inspire otherminorities and which is continuing to develop in a positiveand dynamic way.In order to implement the human rights agenda  wemust better integrate the United Nations human rightsprogrammes  under the leadership of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights  into the mainstream ofUnited Nations activities. Based on the lessons learned andexperiences acquired within the United Nations system  weshould further improve the instrument of on-site humanrights monitoring. We firmly believe in the need tostrengthen the United Nations programme of technicalassistance in the field of human rights and the technicalcooperation programme in the field of crime preventionand criminal justice.Austria also welcomes the great efforts the UnitedNations system has made to cope with humanitariancrises. As a country that has received Bosnian refugees —who number approximately one per cent of the totalAustrian population — Austria is particularly aware of thehuman dimensions of the refugee problem. Deliveringhumanitarian assistance  particularly in the field of majorman-made catastrophes  has become an importantchallenge. The well-being of millions of people  be theyin Rwanda  Somalia or Bosnia and Herzegovina  dependson this assistance and the selfless work of manyspecialized United Nations bodies and agencies  such asthe High Commissioner for Refugees  the World FoodProgramme  UNICEF and the Department forHumanitarian Affairs. Many people owe their verysurvival to these organizations’ activities. Through itscontributions to the European Community HumanitarianOffice (ECHO)  Austria shares in the support given tomultilateral humanitarian programmes by their biggestdonor  the European Union. My Government will do itsutmost to enhance direct Austrian contributions to UnitedNations programmes as part of our “burden sharing” inthe field of multilateral humanitarian assistance.Adapting the United Nations institutional structuresto today’s reality also requires reform of the SecurityCouncil. It needs to be enlarged by those Powers whoseinternational influence has increased over the last 50years. However  any enlargement of the Council mustneither compromise its efficiency nor the opportunities ofsmaller countries to be represented in the Council.In our intensive deliberations about the compositionand procedures of the Council  we must not lose sight ofits primary function. Security Council resolutions areeffective only if they gain political relevance outside thisbuilding and if parties to a conflict abide by them. IfSecurity Council resolutions are to facilitate politicalsolutions of international crises  they must reflect thepolitical will of Member States to implement them.Austria welcomes the reform efforts undertaken bythe Secretary-General in the area of management of theUnited Nations. We hope that these initiatives will befurther pursued. We are pleased to see that the Office ofInternal Oversight Services has become operational. Wesupport the strengthening of this Office in order to furtherenhance stringent control mechanisms and thus increase23Member States’ confidence that the Organization isefficiently managed.Above all  the United Nations has to be anorganization in which problem-solving on all issues isclosely monitored in an integrated manner. Coordinationand cooperation among international organizations such asthe United Nations  the World Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization(WTO) need to be increased.In its fiftieth year  the United Nations is sufferingfrom a chronic financial crisis that needs to be resolvedurgently. A comprehensive and thorough reform isnecessary. Member States must pay their assessedcontributions in full  on time and without conditions.Under the co-chairmanship of Austria  the High-levelOpen-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation ofthe United Nations has prepared the ground for agreementon comprehensive reform measures. A solution to thefinancial crisis will have to be based on the continuedrecognition of the special responsibility of the PermanentMembers of the Security Council  as well as on a scale ofassessment reflecting today’s economic realities.In the future  the United Nations system will needadditional financing mechanisms for the funding of globalpriorities. A number of proposals have already been made including minimal charges on foreign exchange transactionsand charges to be levied on international airline travel. Thepoint has been made that all these proposals requirein-depth consideration by competent bodies. Austriatherefore proposes that the General Assembly should decideon a comprehensive study to be undertaken by variouscomponents of the United Nations system in collaborationwith outside experts in order to advance the internationaldiscussion on charges or taxes pertaining to suchinternational transactions.Negotiations on the crucial issue of reform are underway. Reform is possible only if Member States are trulycommitted to the Organization  which is and remains theonly forum to address global issues. Let us use this historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly to commitourselves to decisive reform in order to make ourOrganization fit for the challenges of the next century."
"11",403,"AZE",50,1995,"Mr. President  my Foreign Minister has asked meto read out his statement on his behalf.“Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure tocongratulate you upon your election to the importantpost of President of this historic fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. I am confident that  under yourskilful leadership  the General Assembly will writeone more significant page in the chronicles of theUnited Nations. I should also like to express mygratitude to your distinguished predecessor  Mr.Amara Essy  for his valuable contribution to the workof the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.“I should like to express particular words ofgratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts to strengthenpeace on Earth.“We have gathered here on this fiftiethanniversary year of the existence of the UnitedNations  understanding as we do the tremendoussignificance of the role played by our Organizationin the world today. All progressive people welcomedthe end of the cold war  rightly believing that itwould lead to an easing of nuclear confrontation andan improvement of the political climate on theplanet. However  the dissolution of totalitariansystems entailed the emergence of bloody armedconflicts and hot spots around the world.“The world has witnessed with tremendousalarm the continuing military confrontations andtension in the republics of the former Yugoslavia Tajikistan and the Nagorny Karabakh region ofAzerbaijan.“For seven years now we have seen openaggression from the Republic of Armenia against theAzerbaijan Republic. Twenty per cent of Azerbaijanterritory has been under occupation by the armedforces of the Republic of Armenia. More than onemillion Azerbaijanis have been forcibly driven fromtheir homes. A serious hotbed of tension has beencreated in the region and threatens internationalpeace and security.“The Security Council has adopted fourresolutions on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict inwhich it called upon the aggressor to withdraw immediately and totally  from the occupiedterritories. However  the Republic of Armenia hascompletely ignored compliance with the resolutionsGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meetingand as a Member of the United Nations is  in effect refusing to follow the decisions of one of its majororgans.“Almost a year has elapsed since the adoption inBudapest by the Heads of State and Government members of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  of a decisionappointing the co-chairmen of the Minsk Conferenceon the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflictdesigned to ensure the signing of a major politicalagreement the realization of which should eliminate allthe consequences of the conflict. However  in this casethe Republic of Armenia is pursuing a policy ofputting forward obviously unacceptable conditions andattempting to impose provisions which would imposein advance a political status on the Nagorny Karabakhregion of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Here we arefaced with attempts to intimidate us with thepossibility of the undermining of the peace-keepingoperation in the region. It is  to say the least  unethicalto accuse the victim of aggression  of not beingwilling to compromise on the problem of theliberation of its occupied territories.“Azerbaijan  for its part  is continuouslydisplaying its readiness for constructive cooperationwith the mediators in order to bring about a peacefulsettlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict.“We have repeatedly expressed ourselves infavour of a multinational peace-keeping operation ofthe OSCE for the maintenance of peace on the borderbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia and in the region asa whole.“At the present time discussions are taking placeon the mandate and parameters of the peace-keeping operations of that Organization. In connectionwith the fact that the peace-keeping operation in ourregion will be the first to be carried out by the OSCE Azerbaijan has agreed to the provision of technicalexpert consultative assistance from the United Nationsfor the success of this operation.“Azerbaijan shares the general understanding thatpeace-keeping operations should be viewed astemporary in nature and should be used to promote aclimate to facilitate the settlement of a particularproblem. At the same time  however  we must not losesight of the fact that settlement is the ultimate goal. Inimplementing any peace-keeping operation we muststrictly abide by the principles contained in theUnited Nations Charter  particularly the principles ofrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity ofStates and non-intervention in internal affairs.“Peace-keeping operations must be based on anappropriate mandate drawn up with the consent ofall the parties involved  and they must be impartial objective and neutral in character. Azerbaijan agreeswith the current and established internationalpractice under which the military contingent of anycountry participating in a given peace-keepingoperation should not exceed 30 per cent of the totalfor the force. It is also important for theinternational organs involved in peace-keepingoperations to furnish all available information toStates and to keep world public opinion informed ofthe progress of the operation.“The settlement of the conflict betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan entails strict compliancewith these principles. Failing the liberation of allAzerbaijani territory occupied by Armenia  there canbe no question of any comprehensive settlement ofthis conflict. Restoration of the territorial integrity ofthe Republic of Azerbaijan and the return ofrefugees and displaced persons to their homes inaccordance with international practice are the onlybases on which a solution can be found to theproblem of the Armenian national minoritypopulation in Azerbaijan.“In the context of a settlement of theArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict I should also like todraw attention to the principle of the right of peoplesto self-determination  a principle that the Republic ofArmenia is flouting. The world has not yet found aworkable balance between the principle of the rightof peoples to self-determination  on the one hand and the principle of the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of States  on the other. Nevertheless  it isclear that the right to self-determination  ascontained in the Charter  is not intended to furnisha pretext for flouting the principle of independenceand territorial integrity.“The Republic of Azerbaijan  now a full-fledged member of the world community  hasundertaken to abide by all universally recognizednorms and principles of international law in itsrelations with other States. The Republic ofArmenia  however  has persistently attempted to use2General Assembly 21st plenary meetingthe principle of the right of peoples to self-determination as a pretext to legitimize andconsolidate its territorial claims and to justify itsaggression against Azerbaijan and its occupation ofAzerbaijani territory. Indeed  the expansionist circlesin Armenia have been implementing such a policy foryears. In 1988  when the Soviet Union was still inexistence  the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republicexpelled its Azerbaijani population — some 200 000persons  a national minority. Immediately followingthat inhuman decision  the Parliament of Armenia acting counter to all the norms and principles ofinternational law  approved Armenia’s annexation ofthe Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan — inother words  it decided to annex a part of the territoryof a neighbouring State.“Subsequently  50 000 persons were expelledfrom the Nagorny Karabakh region  whose totalpopulation numbered 170 000  with the financial andmilitary support of the Republic of Armenia. Inaddition  Armenian armed forces were used toconsolidate the annexation of the Lachin and Shushadistricts of Azerbaijan  through which the Republic ofArmenia maintains direct communication with theNagorny Karabakh region of the Republic ofAzerbaijan. Through this corridor  cynically referredto as a humanitarian corridor  a river of weapons ammunitions and human resources flows from theRepublic of Armenia. Some 20 per cent of theterritory of Azerbaijan is now occupied by Armenianarmed forces. Again  this armed expansion isaccompanied by a thorough ethnic cleansing' of theoccupied Azerbaijani territories and a scorched-earthpolicy.“The world community must condemn theactions of Armenia in Azerbaijan and call for the fulland unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armedforces from the occupied territories and for the returnof refugees and displaced persons to their homes. Thisis clearly a case in which we are witnessing a totaldisregard for the provision of the United NationsCharter that calls upon all Member Statesto refrain in their international relations fromthe threat or use of force against the territorialintegrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with thePurposes of the United Nations.'World public opinion must not be misled as to thetrue motives for the actions of Armenia  which iscloaking its aggression against Azerbaijan in thelofty principle of the right of peoples to self-determination.“Armenia’s aggression against Azerbaijan hascaused enormous suffering and grief to the whole ofthe Azerbaijani people  who have been forced by themilitary actions and occupation of the Armenianarmed forces to leave their homes  abandon theirproperty and flee in order to avoid falling into thehands of the occupiers. The Azerbaijani Governmenthas been forced to convert many schools  dwellings sanatoriums and rest homes into housing forrefugees and displaced persons. In the territory ofAzerbaijan  people are forced to take refuge in tentcities. The normal life of the country has beenalmost totally destroyed.“We are grateful to the countries andinternational and non-governmental organizationsthat have lent active humanitarian assistance toAzerbaijan. The United Nations too has played animportant role in this assistance. The activities of the1995-1996 humanitarian programmes  as presentedin the United Nations consolidated inter-agencyhumanitarian assistance appeal for the Caucasus include relief projects in the food  non-food  shelter education and health sectors. However  as theSecretary-General indicates in his annual report onthe work of the Organization  only 37 per cent  or$12.8 million  of the requirements pledged forhumanitarian activities in Azerbaijan had beenreceived as at 31 July 1995. Other projects carriedout under the aegis of the United Nations haveaddressed capacity-building and the transition fromemergency assistance to development.“Azerbaijan has always attached greatimportance to multifaceted cooperation with theUnited Nations system in the spheres of social andeconomic development. Following the dissolution ofthe USSR our country was confronted with the taskof radically restructuring the Azerbaijani economyon a free-market basis. No country can be expectedto undertake such a radical restructuring unilaterallywithout the active cooperation of internationalorganizations  and Azerbaijan has been no exception.So far  we can point with some satisfaction to thecontinued cooperation between the Government ofAzerbaijan and such important international financial3General Assembly 21st plenary meetinginstitutions as the International Monetary Fund and theInternational Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment. We have had considerable success instabilizing the exchange rate of the manat  our nationalcurrency. The Government of Azerbaijan has receivedapproval of sizeable loans to assist in a number ofmajor infrastructure projects and for drilling andtransporting oil.“Although the majority of the contacts betweenAzerbaijan and the United Nations system have beensuccessful  we must nevertheless mention somecurrent problems. We have not yet been able toresolve the question of a proper scale for Azerbaijan’scontribution to the regular budget of the Organizationthat would reflect my country’s real ability to pay.“In Azerbaijan’s brief period of independencesome important changes have occurred. The Republicof Azerbaijan has begun to build its free democraticsociety on the basis of a market economy. We shallcontinue to pursue that path. It goes without saying however  that the transition from one social andeconomic system to another requires a certain amountof time and very careful and meticulous work.“We need fundamental changes in many aspectsof the life of the Republic  and corresponding changesin the thinking of our people. After long stagnation the people have achieved civic freedom; now  theymust understand that freedom. This is one of our mostimportant areas of activity. A certain amount ofprogress has been made with respect to the politicallife of Azerbaijan. The principles of politicalpluralism  personal freedoms and freedom ofexpression  of the press and of conscience areguaranteed. Human rights are effectively protected. Amulti-party system is at work. We consistently act onthe principle of the primacy of law. Irrespective of sexor national  religious  ethnic or linguistic affiliation citizens of Azerbaijan enjoy equal rights.“Azerbaijan’s highest legislative body  the MilliMajlis  has adopted a new electoral law  which is amilestone in the development of a democratic societyin our country. This law is a further example of howAzerbaijan is proceeding with the building of ademocratic civil society. Parliamentary elections inAzerbaijan are scheduled for 12 November this year;this confirms our unswerving policy of strengtheningindependence and sovereignty. Many countries andmajor international organizations  including the UnitedNations  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe and others  have alreadyagreed to act as observers of the elections. I takethis opportunity to invite States Members of theUnited Nations to send observers to the elections inAzerbaijan.“In the social and economic sphere  ourpurposeful reforms in the political area and towardsa democratic society have made it possible to createthe preconditions for economic and social change which is proceeding with success in our country andwhich is laying the foundation for an early transitionto market relationships. The Republic has achieveda certain stabilization of macro-economic indicatorsand is doing all it can to encourage the developmentof free enterprise. We have begun a conscientiousprogramme of privatization. Inflation  which had inprevious years reached 30 to 35 per cent per month has now been reduced to near zero. We appeal tothe international community and to foreignbusinesses to increase their investment in theeconomy of Azerbaijan. We have created all theproper conditions for profitable activities by foreigncompanies. International consortiums are stepping uptheir activities; in addition to the Azerbaijan State oilcompany  these include major transnationalcorporations. These activities are aimed at jointexploration and development of oil and gas depositsin the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea.“The 50 years of the United Nations haveshown that the peoples of the world can achieve agreat deal when they combine their efforts and theirwill to defend world peace and to achieve theprosperity of peoples. We know that it was concernwith preventing another world war that ordained thefoundation of the United Nations  and this remainsthe main task before mankind today. For war annulsall that the efforts of peoples have achieved.”"
"12",449,"BDI",50,1995,"The United Nations is celebrating its fiftiethanniversary. Today  it is up to us to take stock of itsprogress and its successes  as well as its and shortcomingssince its inception  but also  and in particular  to considerand assess the experience it has gained  in order to providea firmer basis for its future  which  after all  is closelylinked with the future of mankind.The people of Burundi  whom I have the honour torepresent in this Assembly  set particular store by thissession  which should galvanize all the Member States ofour Organization to work for the progress and the survivalof the world as a whole.In Burundi  a number of activities to promoteawareness of the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations have been undertaken. We can assure the Assemblythat our country duly acknowledges the eminent role thatthe United Nations has played and continues to play inhelping Burundi return to the road of peace and security.We are pleased that the presidency of this session ofthe General Assembly  which should be the springboard forits revitalization  has been entrusted to Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral  who has been blessed with great intellectual andmoral qualities and wide political and diplomaticexperience. His country and mine enjoy friendly relationsin all areas. What has already been said about him hereshow that the congratulations my delegation extends to himare well deserved and justify the assistance it will bepleased to give him as a contribution to the success of hisnoble mission.We would also like to pay a sincere tribute to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister forForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire. Throughout his term ofoffice  he applied himself to the tasks resulting from thepresent developments in the United Nations. In thisconnection  Foreign Minister Amara Essy has workedwholeheartedly to promote our Organization across theworld and has brilliantly championed the strengthening ofthe United Nations and the enhancement of its prestige.This is an excellent opportunity to express our sinceregratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  whom I had the pleasure to receivein Bujumbura last July. We are extremely grateful to himfor his profound commitment to peace  security anddevelopment throughout the world. The resounding appealfor peace and national reconciliation he made to the peopleof Burundi in particular and to Africa in general still ringsin our ears.Two years have passed since  from this veryrostrum  His Excellency President Melchior Ndadaye who was swept to power in Burundi following democraticelections  addressed a message of peace  friendship brotherhood and solidarity to the General Assembly. Sincethe contemptible assassination of President Ndadaye on21 October 1993  my country has laboured under apolitical  institutional  social and economic crisis thatpersists to this day. Nevertheless  despite the devastationand the political and ethnic massacres  the people ofBurundi did not yield to despair. In a surge of optimism the registered political parties and the representatives ofcivilian society held negotiations and in-depth discussionson how to bring the country out of the abyss into whichthe enemies of the fatherland had plunged it. After longand arduous debates  the Convention of Government wassigned on 10 September 1994; this was followed by therestoration of the presidency and the establishment of aNational Coalition Government.We greatly appreciated the decisive contributionmade by the United Nations to the people of Burundi’sreturn to peace and security. When the crisis broke out the Secretary-General sent a Special Envoy to the scene.Following that  he appointed His Excellency AmbassadorAhmedou Ould Abdallah as Special Representative toBurundi  and we extend our profound thanks to him forhis patient and tireless efforts to bring the variouspolitical partners together  despite their often deepdifferences of opinion at the height of the crisis. TheUnited Nations sent to Burundi two successivedelegations made up of distinguished ambassadors to theSecurity Council and headed by a distinguished Africanstatesman  His Excellency Ambassador Ibrahim Gambariof Nigeria  to offer us advice and to bring us a messageof peace and comfort. Other delegations of the UnitedNations and various international bodies in the UnitedNations system came to Burundi to demonstrate theirsupport and solidarity. In the context of the promotion ofhuman rights and education for peace and tolerance  aUnited Nations Centre for Human Rights and a UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) Peace House were established in Burundi.The Organization of African Unity (OAU) alsodeserves our profound thanks because it has  from thevery beginning of the crisis  sought appropriate solutionsto enable Burundi to regain peace and stability. The workdone by the pan-African organization is primarily to the23credit of its Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. SalimAhmed Salim  who displayed considerable diplomatic andhuman skills on behalf of Burundi. His work was latercarried on by his Special Representative  His ExcellencyAmbassador Léandre Bassolé of Burkina Faso.We should like to extend our thanks to all of thefriendly countries which have assisted us in various waysand continue to do so  particularly in the brother countrieswhich gave shelter to Burundi refugees. We are working toenable our compatriots to return home safely and we arecoming to grips with the problem of displaced persons.The Convention of Government  which was mentionedearlier and the first anniversary of which we have justcelebrated  gave us an opportunity to set up Stateinstitutions and organs as well as various kinds of politicaland legal machinery that could restore confidence andcooperation among the political partners.The first mission assigned us under this Convention isto restore peace and security in the country. Then it will bea question of restoring the rights of refugees and displacedpersons  that is  to facilitate their return home with theassurance that in an initial phase they will be assured of thebasic necessities until they can provide for their own needs.The Government also intends to initiate the economicrecovery and national reconstruction programme. However if our subregion continues to produce refugees and to serveas a suitable place for illicit trafficking in deadly weaponsof war  this situation would constitute an ongoing source ofinsecurity and destabilization for the countries concerned.Last February in Bujumbura  when we hosted the RegionalConference on Refugees  Repatriates and Displaced Personsfor the Great Lakes region  organized under the auspices ofthe OAU in cooperation with the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees  a number ofconclusions were drawn and resolutions adopted. Today werecognize that the road to be travelled remains a long onebecause the resolutions that were adopted remain a deadletter.Indeed  it is important for the international communityto become better mobilized to help us eradicate the basiccauses of the continued instability and fragility of our lakesregion. In our opinion it would be necessary  first of all  foreveryone to have the same understanding of our historyand  above all  to accept it as it is. They should also giveserious consideration to lasting  definitive solutions thatmust be found for this conflict situation.For our part  we consider that the major problem inBurundi lies in the conceptions of  access to andmanagement of power among the various political actorsin the national community.We can affirm that the conflict that Burundi hasexperienced is far from being ethnic  as many politicaland media circles have alleged. The basis of the problemis essentially political  which is why solutions to thisproblem are condemned to be political also. We mustreject and denounce the advocates of the policy ofexclusion  segregation and extermination  which give riseto crises  instability and repeated conflicts. We condemnthe ideology of hatred  of violence and of genocideexploited by so many politicians who wish to attainpower or wish to remain in power at any cost.The crisis which we are experiencing dates from thebeginning of our independence and has deep roots in theorganization and direction of the country during thecolonial period. The various regimes which havesucceeded one another in Burundi were powerless toresolve this situation. The problem must be addressed bythe people of Burundi  assisted by the internationalcommunity and not replaced by it.We rely on the regional Conference on Security Stability and Development in the Great Lakes region which will be organized under the auspices of the UnitedNations  and which will seek to find appropriate  lastingand definitive solutions. We should like to thank theSecretary-General of the United Nations for havingdesignated an African diplomat to take charge of thepreparations for this Conference  to which my countryattaches real importance.Moreover  my delegation appeals to neighbouringcountries to help us neutralize the efforts of those who working from their own territory  have endeavoured todestabilize ours. It would indeed be illusory to want toextinguish a fire from within when  outside  militias armed bands or malevolent groups are organizing andtraining themselves in order to attack Burundi.Today  the country must face attacks waged jointlyby the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People(PALIPEHUTU)  the National Liberation Front(FROLINA)  the National Council — improperly labelledthe Democratic Defence Council (CNDD) — and itsarmed branch  the curiously named Forces for theDefence of Democracy (FDD). These groups  in collusion24with military-political forces  are responsible for thegenocide in neighbouring Rwanda.In addition to these attacks there is anotherdestabilizing force  the pirate radio station cynicallybaptized “Voice of the People”  or  “Democracy Radio” which inculcates ethnic hatred within the Burundipopulation and which is working towards the disseminationof a neo-nazi-type ideology in this region of Central Africaat the end of this twentieth century. We are relying on thevaluable assistance of our neighbouring and brotherlycountry  with which we share geography and history andwith which we maintain the closest relations  to dismantlethis medium of hatred  which is reminiscent in many waysof the infamous Free Radio-Television of the ThousandHills (la Radio-Télévision Libre des milles collines)(RTLM)  which galvanized the massacres last year inRwanda.We should like to reaffirm the unswerving attachmentof the Government of Burundi to the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairsof another State. We respect the bilateral  regional andinternational agreements and conventions to which Burundihas freely subscribed. In following these commitments theGovernment of Burundi hopes that our immediateneighbours and our partners will properly understand ourproblems and the problems that affect our region. Theyshould understand the complexity and delicacy of the latterso that in trying to help us find solutions they will avoidpouring oil on the fire.We know that  alone  we cannot arrive at harmonious satisfactory and lasting solutions  and that is why wewelcome with open arms the various forms of mediationaimed at helping us get out of the present crisis and atproducing stability within our subregion. However  wewould not want such mediation to lead to other  unexpectedproblems linked to undue interference in our internalaffairs.We have begun a campaign for the restoration ofpeace  with the support of the Government  the NationalAssembly and the political parties that are signatories to theConvention of Government. We are resolved to dismantlethe armed gangs  be they within or outside our country. Butour efforts to restore peace will be futile if we do not worktowards eradicating the phenomenon of impunity  which hasbeen aggravated by our country’s current crisis. In thiscontext  a request was sent to the United Nations toestablish an international judicial commission of inquiryinto the crimes committed in Burundi. We express ourgratitude to the Security Council for the establishment ofthis commission.Along these lines  we are planning to organize  inthe near future  a national debate on the fundamentalproblems affecting the country  with a view to theadoption of a national covenant for peaceful coexistencebetween the various constituent parts of the nation andalso of a new Constitution reflecting the realities nowfacing the country.Lately  the President of the Republic  His ExcellencyMr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya  has been consultingvarious socio-political groups — professionals  themilitary  representatives of religious communities  womenand disaffected youth — to solicit their suggestions forensuring the speedy restoration of peace in Burundi. Theconclusion is inescapable: everyone aspires to peace justice and development. That is why our partners shouldnot be discouraged  nor should they despair  when itcomes to Burundi. The programme of nationalreconciliation and reconstruction will require amobilization of appreciable funds  which Burundi alonecannot marshal. The reinstallation and reintegration of ourdisplaced persons  expatriates and those who have beendispersed  the reconstruction of the socio-economicinfrastructures that were destroyed  the training of ouryoung people and the relaunching of the overallproductive apparatus — these are my Government’s majorconcerns.We call upon the international community to supportus unwaveringly in order that we may implement this vastprogramme. We hope that our partners will respond in apositive way at the General Round Table of donorcountries  scheduled to be held in Geneva shortly  so thatthe necessary financial resources for the reconstruction ofBurundi can be mobilized.With respect to the Great Lakes subregion  Burundiencourages the Government of Rwanda to continue itspolicy of national reconciliation and to create theconditions of peace and security conducive to the returnof Rwandan refugees to their homeland. For its part  theinternational community must ensure that thoseresponsible for the genocide in Rwanda are punished inaccordance with the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil. We strongly urge the countries of the subregionto cooperate fully with the International Tribunal createdfor this purpose.25As regards the crisis in Somalia  my country hopesthat the protagonists will agree to form a government basedon a broad consensus. We invite our Somali brothers to laydown their arms and to work towards nationalreconciliation — the only road to lasting peace — and todevote themselves to rebuilding their country.As for Angola  we welcome the constructive dialoguethat has been established between President José Eduardodos Santos and the leader of UNITA  Jonas Savimbi. Thisis a positive development  which we hope will lead to acomplete cessation of the hostilities that have taken somany lives among the brotherly people of Angola. We alsonourish the hope that the Lusaka Peace Agreement will beimplemented strictly by the parties so that peace can berestored to Angola. We urge the United Nations to speed upthe planned deployment of forces in the context of theUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEMIII).We also welcome the developments in Liberia  in theMiddle East and in the former Yugoslavia. We hope thatthe recent events in the former Yugoslavia will not inflamethe situation further or stand in the way of a solution which has been awaited for so long by the internationalcommunity.A look at the political configuration of the UnitedNations reveals a strange paradox: at a time when hotbedsof tension are concentrated in Africa  at a time whenpoverty there has broken every record and at a time whennatural and man-made disasters are proliferating  manyinternational forums are seeking to reduce our continent tothe status of a poor relative. At a time when the goldenjubilee of our Organization is being commemorated  Africais the only one of the five continents to be excluded frompermanent representation on the Security Council. But thedangers that loom over Africa  both from within and fromoutside  require that it be at the centre of deliberations anddecisions on peace and security. Aside from this reality  thedemocratization of the United Nations is tantamount to acategorical imperative. Thus we strongly urge theestablishment of a genuine parallel between the emergenceof democracy on the scale of the Member States and thereform of the United Nations  so that Africa could be givenaccess to permanent seats on the Security Council. Underthe principle of democracy  the projected reforms of theUnited Nations system should reserve for our continent thelion’s share  for two reasons: first  Africa  as a vastcollective entity  has the right to permanent seats on theSecurity Council; and  secondly  Africa has the right toparticipate in the Council in a manner commensurate withits numerical significance. Once this twofold requirementhas been recognized  Africa will be prepared to selectthose countries that are best suited politically diplomatically  economically and demographically to sitpermanently on the Security Council  on behalf of theentire continent.On the eve of the twenty-first century  Burundi iskeenly aware that the United Nations remains the sourceof salvation for the human race. My country reiterates andreaffirms its unswerving dedication to the ideals andobjectives of the United Nations. As a concretemanifestation of that dedication  the Government ofBurundi — even though it has borne the brunt of theeffects of the international economic situation and of itsown  two-year-long  severe national crisis — has justdisbursed more than $76 000 by way of contribution tothe regular budget of the United Nations. Nevertheless Burundi must stress the imperative need for the worldOrganization to become an ever-present shield for peace security and progress. To achieve this  it must evolve withthe times and become a genuine universal forum in whichall countries  regardless of their political  economic geographical and economic disparities  can join togetherand unite in order to take decisions on the future ofhumankind.This metamorphosis  to which the countries of theUnited Nations so strongly aspire  requires of MemberStates and other accredited agencies working to that endnot only the political will but also and above all thecreative genius to revitalize and breathe new life into theOrganization  allowing it to meet the challenges as thiscentury enters its twilight years and to adapt to the vitalissues of a planet moving inexorably into the thirdmillennium."
"13",496,"BEL",50,1995,"“[Today more then ever we should realize thatwe are delegations of many countries] to the sameAssembly which collectively represents the interests ofthe world.

It wasnot written when we drafted the Belgian statement for thefiftieth session of the General Assembly. It was an extractfrom the official statement delivered by the President of theGeneral Assembly at its first session  Mr. Paul HenriSpaak  then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium. Hisappeal  issued at London on 11 January 1946  is aspertinent today as it was then.The United Nations was long paralysed by geopoliticalproblems posed by the East-West rivalry  but in recentyears the Organization has been able increasingly to focuson all aspects of universal society. This is a philosophy thatmarks a change in global attitude. Human rights  sustainabledevelopment  the environment  social change  populationquestions and the rights of women  to name but a few  havebeen on the agenda of the major international conferencessuccessfully organized by the United Nations. Aprecondition for the success of this international approachis that we have the courage to break away from the oldtaboos and dare for the first time to discuss issues as neverbefore.It is impossible for me here to discuss each andevery one of these items  and I shall limit myself tohighlighting two of them. I realize that in doing so I maybe ignoring so many other problems which are importantfor the immediate future of our United Nations.I will start with the question of disarmament. In Maythis year 180 countries agreed to the extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). The five nuclear Powers pledged to reduce furthertheir already greatly reduced arsenals  and all otherparticipants solemnly promised indefinitely never toacquire these weapons  which jeopardize the veryexistence of the Earth. Belgium urged other non-nuclear-weapon States to accept the indefinite extension of theNPT; I detected the firm will of all signatories to respectthe Treaty in letter and spirit.We expect nevertheless that nuclear arsenals will befurther reduced. In this context we pin great hopes on theprompt ratification of the START II treaty. Nuclear non-proliferation should be strengthened as soon as possibleby the signing next year of a comprehensive test-bantreaty and by a treaty prohibiting the production of fissilematerial for military use. Those two treaties will providean indispensable complement to the NPT on the pathtowards the total nuclear disarmament which Belgium hasalways desired.The coming negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty will show whether or not the nuclear Powersare willing to accept the zero option  which to my mindis the most important question for the future. In thiscontext Belgium deplores the recent nuclear tests andfervently hopes that the other nuclear-weapon States willmaintain their moratoriums. A decision not to conduct anyfurther tests would strongly promote the creation of apropitious atmosphere for the resumption of thenegotiations and their successful completion in 1996. Onbehalf of Belgium  I strongly urge the nuclear-weaponStates to desist from all further testing.I have just spoken about what are called weapons ofmass destruction  and obviously the threat posed bynuclear and biological weapons is enormous. But weshould remember that in fact it is conventional weaponsthat claim by far the most victims. In cooperation withthe European Union  Belgium will play an active role inthis field  as we have done in recent months with regardto anti-personnel mines. In this regard my country hasbeen a pioneer  including through the adoption by itsParliament of forward-looking legislation prohibiting the22production and use of such weapons in Belgium. In theUnited Nations we joined in the initiative to hold a specialconference in Geneva  over which my country had thehonour to preside. Belgium is also aware of the dangersposed by new laser weapons and their horrendousconsequences. My country is prepared to adopt an activistpolicy in this sphere.To my mind  the next priority of the United Nationsis social and economic progress. The promotion andprotection of human rights are an essential element of this.Our own history shows that respect for human rights andthe existence of a State based on law and of politicalinstitutions elected and functioning democratically andfollowing the principles of good management are absoluteconditions for sustainable development.Yet we cannot say that the results of internationalcooperation have been altogether positive. Countries both ofthe South and of the North must ponder this. It makes nosense to speak of peace on Earth if at the same time wecannot pursue the planet’s social and economicdevelopment. World-wide overall wealth has increasedsevenfold in the past 50 years and international trade hasgrown even more. But at the same time poverty has neverbeen greater. Furthermore  economic recession and the debtcrisis have affected certain sections of the population indeveloping countries more than others. The inequalities inthe distribution of income and wealth have thereforebecome even greater. To combat this we need to actinternationally  if only because of the globalization of theworld economy. Intensive multilateral cooperation including cooperation between the international financialinstitutions  the International Labour Organisation (ILO)and the World Trade Organization will be necessary. Wemust also consider how the population can be involved inthe preparation and implementation of reforms.Of prime concern are basic needs. Real socialdevelopment is impossible if those are not cared for.Belgium is ready to participate in this effort  as it has longdone. The Belgian social security system too is marking itsfiftieth anniversary. That system is now being questioned for the unemployment rate has increased dramatically threatening the financing of the whole system. However this system remains the best guarantee for preserving thebalance between economic development and socialdevelopment. The State should remain responsible for theprovision of the basic needs for all.Belgium therefore calls for the development of amechanism which allows economic development to go handin hand with social development. Governments mustrespect the rights of workers and improve workingconditions and the security and health of the workers. Thefive basic social conventions of the ILO — relating tominimum age for employment  the abolition of slavery freedom of trade unions  freedom of negotiation andnon-discrimination — should be internationallyrecognized as fundamental conventions  which wouldprovide a concrete impetus for this.The major international conferences organized by theUnited Nations have proven a useful means of studyingbasic questions relating to the goal of social emancipationand genuine sustainable development in all countries. InRio de Janeiro  old concepts of development werereplaced by that of sustainable development  which hasfunctioned as a common theme throughout all the otherconferences.At the World Conference on Human Rights  inVienna  a Declaration was adopted which underscored andenriched the universal consensus on the respect due underall circumstances to human beings. It called on allMember States not only to prevent human rightsviolations  but also to promote those rights. For its part Belgium was the first country in Europe to adopt a law in February 1994  linking respect for human rights todevelopment cooperation.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment  held at Cairo  recognized the relationshipbetween the individual’s reproductive and sexual healthand the development of every individual and everycountry.The importance of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  held at Copenhagen  lay above all in itsintegrated approach to linking the fight against poverty the creation of jobs  and the promotion of socialintegration  and in the adoption on that basis ofcoordinated national and international strategies. It isgratifying also to note the universal consensus on theconcepts and issues that will deserve our attention in thefuture.Finally  the Fourth World Conference on Women recently held at Beijing  stressed the role of women asfull participants in the decision-making process and ineconomic affairs  by recognizing that genuine sustainabledevelopment and true democracy will be impossiblewithout women.23The United Nations should make economic and socialdevelopment its highest priority. It should involve worldpublic opinion in these decisions and should ensure theirfollow-up and resolutely implement them in the field.Belgium is prepared to reflect the programmes of action ofall these conferences in its future policies in the spheres ofdevelopment cooperation  foreign trade  internationalfinance and in its foreign policy in general.I have laid stress on two areas where the UnitedNations will play a decisive role. It will be a challenge tous all; the results will not be assessed until the hundredthanniversary of the United Nations. To meet our goal  it isvital for us to strengthen the tool that is the United Nations.The United Nations and its specialized agencies mustmaintain — and strengthen and adapt — their resources andactivities so as to give effect to the decisions andachievements of these conferences. Specifically  duplicationmust be avoided; rationalization and the possible mergingof bodies working in the same field are inevitable.The Economic and Social Council must berehabilitated; its role could be reviewed. It should be themost suitable body for staging international conferencesand  through the United Nations system  should coordinateand supervise the implementation of conventions andprogrammes. It should also spur interaction among themajor agencies and institutions of the United Nationssystem.The agenda of the General Assembly must bereviewed so that the Assembly can regain its original roleas the Organization’s supreme decision-making  deliberativeand policy-making body.Security Council reform is the subject of intensedebate. Without going into details  I would like to recallBelgium’s view that such reform should strengthen  interalia  the Council’s capacity for action and itsrepresentativity. The Charter gives the Councilresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity on behalf of all  and for the benefit of all. Belgiumis convinced that the authority of Council decisions wouldbe enhanced if troop- and equipment-contributing countrieswere more closely involved in the preparation of those decisions.The Organization is facing numerous financialproblems. The development of new activities is oftenhobbled by disagreements on the allocation of costs. Thereis a growing structural rift between the capacity formultilateral action and the increasingly frequent demandsfor intervention.How can we prevent the United Nations frombecoming a victim of its own success? One fundamentalobligation is that every Member State must promptly paythe contribution it has been assessed based on its abilityto pay. Non-payment is a serious violation ofcommitments  and is even more deplorable when certaindelinquent contributors are also demanding a special rolein the Organization’s policy- and decision-makingprocesses.Finally  we must keep working towards the newinternational spirit to which I referred at the beginning ofmy statement. Without such a new awareness in societyat large  we shall never be able to make the UnitedNations into the universal instrument for peace andsustainable development it must be. In that context  Iwant to close with another quotation from that greatstatesman  the first President of the General Assembly Belgian Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak  who as earlyas 1943 said that“The world will never be organized if eachState retains its full national sovereignty and theabsolute right to resolve its political and economicproblems as it sees fit”."
"14",541,"BEN",50,1995,"You have the difficult and noble task  Sir  of guiding thework of the General Assembly at a time when the UnitedNations is celebrating 50 years of existence andapproaching a decisive turning-point in its history. Yourelection to this high office is cause for joy and satisfactionin the delegation of Benin  on behalf of which I have thegreat honour of speaking from this world-renownedrostrum.I am pleased to be able to add my voice to those ofpreceding speakers in congratulating you sincerely andwarmly and also in congratulating the members of yourBureau. I am particularly glad in that you represent acountry  Portugal  with which Benin is honoured to haveexcellent relations and valuable cultural ties. It is my beliefthat your experience and your qualities and abilities willhelp to ensure smooth proceedings and success here in ourdiscussions.You  Sir  are taking over your office from my brotherAmara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  to whom I would like toextend the satisfaction and appreciation of my delegationon the exemplary manner in which he presided over thework of the forty-ninth session. In an internationalsituation marked by doubt  fatigue and an absence ofresources  he endeavoured with lucidity  resolve andperseverance to reconfirm the central and irreplaceablerole of this Organization in attaining peace and socialprogress.I would also wish fraternally to extend a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  whom I welcome here with us today  aman of conviction and humanism whom we shouldsupport and recognize for his efforts and initiatives totranslate into action the purposes and principles of theCharter.Our world has changed considerably  and the wheelsof history continue to turn inexorably  throwing up theirshare of upheaval and change  which makes even clearerthe need for a universal forum and an instrument asvaluable as the United Nations. It has asserted itself as anessential catalyst for international cooperation based oninterdependence and an awareness of the common futureof mankind.The ceremonies commemorating 50 years of theUnited Nations give us an opportunity to evaluate what ithas done. I shall confine myself to just a few points.There is a saying in my country that whenever wehesitate about how to proceed in life  we should lookback over the road we have travelled. So  in thatcontext  I would like to recall that there should be threepillars supporting this Organization  namely: themaintenance of peace and security; economic and socialdevelopment; and respect for and protection of humanrights.I think I am right in saying that  since 1945  peace hasin general been maintained. Most States have now gainedtheir sovereignty and their peoples are exercising theirrights  and the fundamental nature of respect for humanrights has been universally recognized.Yet  there are such deep cracks in the second pillarthat the whole building may crumble. Hence the UnitedNations is now at a critical turning-point in its history.In a world in which economies and markets are beingglobalized  a world that is almost entirely characterized andunited by the communications revolution and the progressmade in transport  we soon realized that peace does notsimply mean that weapons are silent. Increasinginterdependence has not really created a genuine feeling ofsolidarity. Although this is often said — some of usspeaking before the international community every yearfrom this rostrum — it has not prompted collective actionto ensure prosperity for all.The three pillars that symbolize the authority of theUnited Nations and its ability to carry out its mandate mustall be strengthened if the building is to continue to stand.I did not mean to turn my back on Benin’s traditionby allowing myself to turn the thoughts of this Assemblytowards symbolism  but rather to highlight the reality of theproblems we face and the scope of the challenges theythrow down before us. Human dignity is what is at stakehere.The United Nations can become stronger only bystrengthening its second pillar  by promoting action ineconomic and social areas  by focusing its concerns ondevelopment in order to achieve or maintain peace throughthe promotion of social development.The Organization therefore has a central role to playin preventing mankind from drifting towards newconfrontation and impoverishment  and in enabling man togain greater control over his environment and his fate.The new dynamic in international relations resultingfrom the end of ideological confrontation is characterizedby a search for a new kind of inter-State relationship. Asa result  the hotbeds of tension and conflict that have notbeen quelled are now approaching a solution or are beingcontained. And yet  there is still such upheaval in someparts of the world that international peace and security arebeing threatened.I am thinking here of the negotiations between Israeland Palestine. They are the result of resolute action. Weknow how difficult was the road leading to theestablishment of lasting peace in view of the level ofdistrust and the acute  accumulated suffering involved.Yet  we have high hopes that bitterness and fear will beovercome so that dialogue may continue. We must allencourage dialogue between Israel and the States of theregion  and to that end  the good will of all is essential.In Benin  we welcomed the fact that the weaponshad finally fallen silent in southern Africa. For the firsttime in several decades  the region seems to be able todevote all its energies and resources to developmentactivities.Here  we wish to pay tribute to the maturity of thepeople and leaders of Mozambique who have helped toestablish a State based on the rule of law and politicalpluralism on the basis of free and democratic elections. Ican only congratulate the United Nations on what it hasdone to promote peace in that country. We are allconcerned that peace should be strengthened throughstability  reconciliation and national reconstruction. Facedwith this situation  the international community must more than ever before  support Mozambique by providingassistance that can recreate an environment conducive toeconomic development.I also welcome the agreements signed at Lusakabetween the Government of the Republic of Angola andUNITA  and on behalf of my delegation I should like toencourage them to live up to the commitments they havemade.The positive developments in Haiti are also mostwelcome. Benin applauds the reinstatement of thelegitimate Haitian authorities and the courage and senseof responsibility shown by the President  Jean-BertrandAristide  who has engendered a spirit of reconciliation.We appreciate the efforts made by the Government ofHaiti to strengthen democracy in the country byestablishing institutions following free elections. We havehigh hopes that security and stability can thus bere-established and will help to promote economic and2social development  the only guarantee of lastingdemocracy.Unfortunately  however  in other regions  the course ofhistory is still not running smoothly. This is the case inSomalia  Rwanda  Burundi and Liberia  where events wouldseem to suggest that the protagonists have learnednothing — but they have forgotten nothing either.In Somalia  the absence of any viable State structurehas plunged the country into an impossible situation withmomentous consequences. The desire to secureadvantageous negotiating positions through the use of forcehas led to continued suffering for the country. In expressingour sympathy for the people of Somalia  Benin wishes toremind the various factions that they must create theconditions for dialogue and national reconciliation and wewould urge them to be tolerant.In Rwanda and Burundi  re-establishing the judiciaryand establishing public order would seem to be the onlymeans of putting an end to the spiral of violence andencouraging national reconciliation  which is a prerequisitefor establishing trust and encouraging the voluntary returnof refugees. We cannot deny that the slow pace and thefragility of developments in the situation in those twocountries raise fears that the tragic events we so recentlydeplored may recur at any moment.In Liberia  we welcome the new situation that hasemerged from the cease-fire and the establishment of theCouncil of State. We urge all parties to strengthen therenewed peace by effectively disarming all the factions.The former Yugoslavia is undoubtedly the world stageon which new types of conflict and efforts to limit them arerunning at the same time. While taking what may seem adispassionate look at the situation in the Balkans region  weare not insensitive to the fate of millions of women children and elderly people who are the victims both ofnew kinds of exclusion and of the irredentism of thepeoples of the region.I should like to take this occasion to reiterate thatBenin strongly condemns “ethnic cleansing”  no matter whoits perpetrators may be  all violations of humanitarian lawand all attacks against United Nations personnel.Benin supports the idea of a comprehensive settlementwith respect to the consequences of the disintegration of theformer Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia. For thisreason  I appeal to all the protagonists to put an end tothe fighting and to attacks against innocent civilians.The New York agreements of 26 September 1995between the three major protagonist groups constitute adecisive step towards general and lasting peace in theregion  which  I trust  will soon cease to be the powder-keg of today’s world.The deplorable  indeed tragic  situations that I havejust described strengthen my conviction that the protectionand promotion of human rights and of fundamentalfreedoms still deserve our full attention. They justify thedrafting of new international instruments to complete theexisting legal arsenal  so that those who continue toperpetrate cruel and inhuman acts  genocide and “ethniccleansing” can be punished. In this spirit  Benin supportsthe establishment of international tribunals for the formerYugoslavia and Rwanda.But what will all these efforts mean if we do not putan end to the production  accumulation and internationaltransfers of weapons  and if we do not progress towardsgeneral and complete disarmament under internationalcontrol?In this connection  Benin reiterates its unwaveringsupport for all United Nations resolutions relating to thereduction  limitation and non-proliferation of nuclearweapons.One of the mandates of this Organization is to makegeneral development efforts the focus of our concerns.Changes in international relations and the liberalization oftrade have made us more aware of the many differentsectors and players involved in development. Thedeterioration of our environment has alerted us to theneed to focus our behaviour and actions on ensuring thelong-term development of future generations.We are both witnesses to and players in the changeswe are experiencing today. And yet we are notunequipped to implement the transition to another kind ofdevelopment  because we have at our disposal the toolsfor both diagnosis and prevention. There is only onepossible approach: the political will to implement ourrespective commitments.I should like to emphasize that as concernsimplementation of their commitments the developingcountries in general  and Africa and the least developedcountries in particular  have proceeded resolutely towards3qualitative political and economic changes. In so doing they have required enormous sacrifices on the part of theirpeoples in order to readjust and adapt to new worldconditions.We must acknowledge  however  that the commitmentsto carry out the duty of solidarity have not yet materialized.Benin  of course  fully appreciates the internationalcommunity‘s support for the developing countries  andparticularly for Africa and the least-developed countries ingeneral. However  the assistance provided is far frommeeting either the needs or the expectations.I sincerely hope that the results of the High-levelIntergovernmental Meeting on the Mid-term Global Reviewof the Implementation of the Programme of Action for theLeast-developed Countries for the 1990s  which began herein New York on 26 September  will make it possible toovercome these shortcomings.I urge the international community to live up to itscommitment to solidarity with Africa by contributing to theUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africain the 1990s. At the high-level meetings of the Economicand Social Council held in Geneva from 4 to 6 July last the international community reconfirmed its commitment tocontribute effectively to the development of Africa and tothe implementation of this New Agenda.It is therefore urgent — and this cannot be said oftenenough — to reduce the debt burden to a level that wouldenable us truly to set development in motion. I should likealso to invite all States to speed up their respectiveconstitutional procedures for ratifying the United NationsConvention to Combat Desertification in those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification particularly in Africa.The demonstrations organized worldwide at the timeof the first World Day to Combat Desertification andDrought bear witness to the commitment of peoples andGovernments to tackling seriously this worldwideenvironmental problem. This commitment must be backedby the depositing of the 50 ratification instruments neededfor the entry into force of the Convention in 1996. The firstconference of the parties could thus take place in 1997  theyear earmarked for the mid-term review of Agenda 21 andof all the recommendations and conclusions of the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development.Measures must also be taken to speed up theintegration of Africa into the international trade system andto help in diversifying economies and encouraginginvestment. Only in this way will that continent  whichhas suffered greatly throughout history  be able finally toemerge from the hellish cycle of poverty.Benin is prepared to contribute to making 1996  theInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty  anoccasion for us to strengthen the moral obligation andduty of solidarity that underlies the struggle againstpoverty. But our Governments’ actions can be successfulonly if they are supported by all our partners indevelopment.The year 1996 will also see the holding of the NinthUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Developmentand the Second United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (Habitat II)  which is being referred to as the“City Summit”. These two major Conferences  whoseimportance cannot be overemphasized  will provide to theinternational community an opportunity to assess theprogress made in the context of the commitment enteredinto at Cartagena in February 1992 and of the GlobalStrategy for Shelter to the Year 2000. However  thepreparatory committees for those two Conferences mustfocus on finding specific solutions rather than short-livedmeasures and recommendations.I am convinced that development cannot be achievedsimply by transferring one model of production andconsumption from one region of the world to another. Wemust go beyond that cliché and base ourselves on a truepartnership for development  in which responsibilitieswould be shared equally. For this reason  Benin welcomesthe outcome of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment and of the Fourth World Conference onWomen.Benin fully endorses the elaboration of an Agendafor Development with a view to the effectiveimplementation of the programmes of action that have notyet been carried out.In conclusion  I should like to express our firmconviction that this session of the General Assembly willmake it easier for us to achieve a consensus acceptable toall on ways and means of revitalizing and strengtheningthe institutions and structures of the United Nations."
"15",587,"BFA",50,1995,"On behalf of the Government and the people ofBurkina Faso  permit me to convey to you  Mr. President my sincere congratulations on your well-deserved electionto the presidency of this historic session of the GeneralAssembly.Your country  Portugal  has ties of friendship andcooperation with my own  based on the noble ideals of theCharter  and it has always worked to promote friendshipand solidarity among peoples. Your election is therefore arecognition of your personal skills and qualities and also awell-deserved tribute to your country. I am certain that theother members of the Bureau will place their recognizedskills at your disposal so that  together  you may guide thework of this session successfully.I wish also to convey our warmest congratulations andgratitude to my brother and friend  Foreign Minister AmaraEssy  of Côte d’Ivoire  for the remarkable work he did asPresident at the forty-ninth session. With his tact anddiscretion he gave a tremendous impetus to the work of ourOrganization throughout the year.Lastly  let me once again pay a well-deserved tributeto our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whohas  ever since taking office as head of the Organization been working side by side with us to give real content tothe basic commitments embodied in the Charter. TheAgenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development he hasproduced and the consideration they have been given sincetheir appearance have  we believe  been instrumental inensuring that mankind  now and in future years  will enjoyan environment of peace  security and prosperity.The creation of the United Nations 50 years agoawakened tremendous hopes for mankind  which had  inthe space of a single generation  suffered from twoparticularly savage wars with consequences that sorelyaffected the entire world and for which all peoples paida heavy toll.The ambitious programme of the Organization’sfounding fathers was to ensure for the future collectivesecurity  peace among nations and the harmoniousdevelopment of peoples.Fifty years after that profession of faith  the recordcontinues to reflect the contradictions and antagonismsthat undermine our own States. However  no Organizationhas so successfully embodied mankind’s hopes for abetter world.Admittedly  conflicts continue to exist anddevelopment seems more than ever a fantasy. However thanks to the concerted action of States  the world hasexperienced no widespread conflict. Indeed  whenever athreat to world peace has arisen  the United Nations hasbeen able to bring machinery to bear to limit thedestructive effects.Thus  we have faith in the United Nations eventhough the half century through which mankind has livedsince its creation has been experienced many ups anddowns. But what would it have been like had the UnitedNations not existed to channel activities for peace  tooversee the post-war period and the cold war  to give itsmoral sanction to the emancipation of peoples  tocoordinate assistance for economic and socialdevelopment and to set a moral standard and orderrelations among nations and human beings?Those are important achievements  but they oughtnot make us forgetful of the fact that on the eve of theOrganization’s fiftieth anniversary there are still manyhotbeds of tension in many parts of the world.In Europe  the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina notwithstanding some glimmers of hope on the horizon continues to cause concern to all States. We hope that thetalks now under way among the parties concerned willlead to a comprehensive settlement of the situation.In the Middle East the prospects opened up by theDeclaration of Principles signed at Washington on 13September 1993 between the Government of Israel andthe Palestine Liberation Organization continue to yield5promising results. Despite the extremists of every stampwho are incapable of accepting alternatives to violence anddeath  negotiations have not been broken off. The signingat Washington on 28 September 1995 of the Agreementnegotiated at Taba on a timetable for the second phase ofthe Israeli Army’s withdrawal from the West Bank and thetransfer of additional powers to the Palestinian Authority isa further step in the right direction. Burkina Fasoencourages this pattern of negotiation  which led to thePeace Treaty between Jordan and Israel of 26 October 1994and to the opening of talks on the Golan Heights betweenIsrael and Syria. We also encourage talks on the Lebanese-Israeli relationship.In Asia  Burkina Faso welcomes the spirit of dialogueand cooperation that prevails between the two Koreas andbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea andthe United States of America. We would note  however that a country like the Republic of China in Taiwan has notbeen able to be among us again this year  at a time whenwe are to celebrate a historic event.With respect to the question of Jammu and Kashmir Burkina Faso urges India and Pakistan  two fraternalneighbouring countries  to find a solution to that problemthrough bilateral negotiations.The African continent is facing many problems withdeep and complex roots. Many African countries continueto be destabilized by savage conflicts that are causingmillions of refugees and displaced persons to take to theroads and surge across international borders  where theirprecarious living conditions demand our attention.In Central Africa  the Great Lakes region remains apowder-keg that can explode at any moment. The miasmaof the tragedy in Rwanda can infect other regions if theproblem of refugees and displaced persons is not veryrapidly and correctly settled. We urge the Government andpeople of Rwanda to continue to mobilize againstextremism and to seek genuine national reconciliation basedon justice  equity and tolerance as well as on the country’seconomic and social reconstruction.In Burundi  notwithstanding the efforts of theinternational community  the situation continues to bedisturbing. It seems evident that that country will enjoypeace and security only when there is a clear and manifestresolve on the part of its political leaders to guide theircountry to peace and concord without hegemonistic designsor hidden ethnic agenda. In that respect the GovernmentConvention signed on 10 September 1994 is a starting-point that should be respected.The international community has a very greatresponsibility in this region. Rwanda  Burundi and thecountries of asylum have an urgent and pressing need forassistance. Thus  the United Nations Conference on peace security and stability in the Great Lakes region should beconvened as soon as possible so as to give the situationall the attention it deserves.For its part  Burkina Faso is contributing to theprocess by participating  on the one hand  in theOrganization of African Unity Observation Mission inBurundi while  on the other hand  under the auspices ofthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  it is participating in the maintenance of securityin the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire.In Somalia  the warlords continue to wreak havoc inthe country  unmoved by the suffering of the Somalipeople. We can only hope that as events unfold andlessons are learned from experience they will come tounderstand the vanity and incongruity of their behaviourand that they will reexamine their course of action andavert disaster for their country.In Sudan  Burkina Faso supports the work beingdone by the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought andDevelopment to find a solution to the fratricidal conflictthat has divided that country for so many years. Wewelcome the steps in that direction being taken byPresident Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.In West Africa the determination of the States of thesubregion and the efforts made to develop understandingand some confidence between the factions in Liberia haveled to the signing at Abuja  in Nigeria  on 19 August1995  of an agreement that offers prospects of peace forLiberia. Burkina Faso  as a member of the Committee ofNine on Liberia of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS)  was privileged to act aswitness to that Agreement between the Liberian factions.Like the other members of ECOWAS  it will be vigilantin ensuring that its terms are strictly complied with untilthe general elections scheduled for 1996 are held.Sierra Leone  a neighbour of Liberia  has for anumber of years endured a cycle of violence that hasinflicted unspeakable suffering on the civilian population.At a time when Liberia is committing itself to the path of6peace  we urge those involved in the conflict in SierraLeone to do the same  by opting for negotiations.Burkina Faso welcomes the positive developments inthe situation in Angola. We hope that the spirit of dialoguethat now prevails through the Lusaka Protocol of 20September 1994 will enable that long-suffering country toreturn to the path of peace  democracy and development.I want to hail the work of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which are makingenormous efforts to settle conflicts. We are firmlyconvinced that peace is indivisible and that the UnitedNations remains its primary champion throughout theworld  and especially in Africa. More than ever before Africa is seeking its proper course. While there is universalagreement on the need for democratic regimes  goodgovernance and respect for human rights  the paths we musttravel to achieve those things are tortuous and difficult. Yet in our view  crises stemming from the transition todemocracy will be quickly overcome. The real grounds forconcern lie rather in the dangerous implosion we see todayin African societies that are based on poorly manageddemocratic processes and chaotic governance and  aboveall  whose populations suffer grinding poverty.Here Africa must face up to its own realities. Withoutquestioning the need for international solidarity or theprimacy of the United Nations in conflict settlement Burkina Faso  like other African countries  knows thatAfrica must be the first to invest in the solution of itsproblems. That is what it is doing  without waiting foradequate means to be provided. It is in that spirit thatBurkina Faso and its leader  President Blaise Compaoré have been supporting the efforts of our brethren inneighbouring countries of the subregion and elsewhere onthe continent.It was also in that spirit that Burkina Faso joined theother countries of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) in working towards theagreement between the contending factions in Liberia. Andit is in that same spirit that Burkina Faso supports theMechanism of the Organization of African Unity for thePrevention  Management and Resolution of Conflicts inAfrica  which is an African response to new crisis situationson the continent.In short  Africa has its problems. To be sure  it hasreceived bilateral support from members of the internationalcommunity. But on the multilateral level  unfortunately  allthe global programmes adopted to date have beenimplemented only in a timid and inadequate manner. Themost recent of these  including the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s andthe Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries for the 1990s  are suffering terribly from a lackof financial resources and  to be frank  from a lack ofpolitical will on the part of the majority of our partnersfrom the developed world. In this connection  ourapprehensions were confirmed by the results of the recenthigh-level intergovernmental meeting to undertake a mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.Meanwhile  our debt burden has obstructedproductive new investment  and deteriorating terms oftrade have cancelled out earnings from commodities.More and more  Africa is losing its share of theinternational market  ultimately facing inescapablemarginalization at a time when the globalization of theworld economy is becoming apparent. But globalizationdemands solidarity and interdependence. We must makea choice: if wealth does not spill over borders  thenpoverty and destitution will.One of the problems calling for world solidarity isthat of the environment  and especially the fight againstdrought and desertification. When  faced with the greatdroughts of the 1970s in Western Africa  Burkina Fasomounted a campaign to combat this scourge  theinternational community did not seem to understand itsimportance. Today  protecting the environment is one ofthe priority tasks of States. The Rio Conference onEnvironment and Development  the June 1994 adoption ofthe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertificationin Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification  Particularly in Africa  and the entry intoforce of the Convention on Biological Diversity and theFramework Convention on Climate Change have trulygiven fresh impetus to greater awareness in this area. Butwhat good are all these instruments without the resourcesneeded to fight the evils they are meant to attack?Burkina Faso made a substantial contribution to thedrafting of the United Nations Convention to CombatDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing SeriousDrought and/or Desertification  Particularly in Africa  andhopes that it will quickly enter into force  to give evengreater momentum to the efforts of our countries withinthe Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Controlin the Sahel  and  with respect to East Africa  within theIntergovernmental Authority on Drought andDevelopment.7On the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the UnitedNations stands at a crossroads. It must turn away fromcold-war reflexes and stride resolutely towards the horizonof the twenty-first century. It must adapt quickly to the newcontext of a more open  globalized world  and must fromnow on accept the clear determination of all States toparticipate in world affairs. In this context  the UnitedNations needs to make the changes that will enable it tobetter profit from the contributions that States and regionsare ready to make.But the most biggest challenge facing the UnitedNations is undoubtedly that of the poverty and destitutionthat still afflict one fifth of mankind. The world ofsolidarity and brotherhood that we want to build will bepossible only if all human beings can live in dignity. In thatconnection  we have been working for five years onprinciples and objectives for children  women  theenvironment  human rights  population and socialdevelopment. Let us implement them.It is with that hope that we approach the work of thefiftieth session of the General Assembly. On behalf ofBurkina Faso  I reaffirm our complete devotion to the nobleideals of the United Nations."
"16",630,"BGD",50,1995,"I have the honour tomake the following statement on behalf of His ExcellencyMr. A. S. M. Mostafizur Rahman  the Foreign Minister ofBangladesh  who  though present in New York  is unableto attend this Assembly for reasons of health.“I warmly congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral on his unanimous election as President ofthis historic fiftieth anniversary session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. His election is a tribute not only to him personally  but to his great country Portugal. I am confident that he will do great honourto the legacy of his predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  to whom we owe deepappreciation  not least for his sponsorship of theestablishment  on 14 September  of the Open-endedHigh-level Working Group on the strengthening ofthe United Nations system.“Let me also commend our Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedicated anduntiring efforts to promote the effectiveness of thisworld body.“In this fiftieth anniversary year  the UnitedNations has reached a critical turning-point inappraising its past and in charting a viable course forits future  based on the renewed commitment  trustand consensus of its Member States.“The world of today is obviously quite differentfrom that of 1945. Then  the United Nations  in thewake of the devastating global conflagration thatwas the Second World War  was called uponto save succeeding generations from thescourge of war'.In the wake of the cold war  the United Nations isnow called upon to consolidate and secure anuncertain and amorphous peace.13“The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes thatthe United Nations  freed from nuclear and ideologicalconfrontation  would devote its full attention tobuilding a peaceful and more equitable world; tacklethe challenge of world poverty; advance regionalconflicts to resolution; distribute the benefits of peacedividends; and move towards fulfilling the unrealizedpremises of the Charter  especially with regard tocollective security.“These hopes were belied. The world of the1990s is more dangerous in many ways than the cold-war era. There is greater tension in more places  afurther degradation in the quality of life and manymore complex issues of law and ethics  managementand practical cooperation. Negative impulses haveassumed a variety of dimensions within States between groups of States and globally.“Within States  nations have come under siegefrom multiple threats  retarding their capacity to acteffectively or independently. Political instability hasfuelled an economic breakdown  and economicbackwardness has created political upheaval in anever-ending vicious circle. Long-suppressed national ethnic and cultural rivalries have resurfaced unleashing bigotry  extremism and violence. Theyhave generated powerful centrifugal forces that havenot only threatened to but actually breachedestablished boundaries. Demagogues  politicalseparatists and fringe groups are being encouraged andsupported by external forces to challenge thelegitimacy of Governments and their capacity togovern.“On another plane  fears are surfacing that thebipolar world of the past 50 years could now assumea North-South configuration  not between opposingpolitical and social systems  but between rich and poornations. Anxiety is increasing in the South that theirinterests are being marginalized; that developmentresources are being diverted or are dwindling; thattheir potential to act as partners in revitalizing theworld economy is being ignored; and that newconstraints and conditionalities are being selectivelyimposed.“Globally  new forces are emerging that no Stateacting alone can control but which threaten thelegitimacy of all States. Pollution  eco-damage devastating diseases  speculative dealers and money-launderers  organized crime  arms smugglers andterrorists have eaten into all societies  vitiated valuesand crippled development. Rapid technological andtransnational processes are reducing the ability ofStates to act on their own or to regulate domesticpolicies affecting the movement of goods  services labour and capital. Tensions over resources are acase in point. Forty per cent of the world’spopulation live on the banks of rivers or lakesshared by two or more countries. Dams andirrigation projects cause serious tension and actualconflict.“Ironically  at a time when the United Nationsis in greater demand then ever before and itscapacity stretched to the limit  a serious campaign ofvilification has been launched against it. It has beencharged with mismanagement  inefficiency corruption  excessive costs and over-staffing. Itsgrowing membership  in the wake of decolonization has been termed irresponsible  obstructive anddivisive  and it has been accused of indiscriminatelyexercising the so-called tyranny of the majority'.This tarnished image  propagated by a few butrejected by many  has left deep scars that havediminished the United Nations.“It is against this background that I now turn tosome of the priority concerns facing Bangladesh.“First and foremost is the financial crisis thatthreatens to undermine the United Nations. TheSecretary-General has declared that the UnitedNations is already technically bankrupt. Thefinancial situation has to be placed on an adequateand sustainable footing and its deterioration urgentlyreversed.“Bangladesh has consistently held that thecurrent financial difficulties were primarily a cash-flow imbalance due mainly to the failure by someMember States  in particular some majorcontributors  to fulfil their Charter obligations in fulland on time. These Member States must givepractical effect to their commitment to the UnitedNations by paying their assessed contribution in fulland on time  including all arrears. Capacity to payremains the fundamental tenet in determiningMember States’ contributions. To proceed on thebasis that simply a revision of the scales ofassessment would provide a panacea to all financialills is simplistic and misleading. It will neitherchange the aggregate amount of revenues available14to the United Nations nor guarantee better cash flowsor prompt payment. While it is likely that for sometime to come the bulk of United Nations revenues willcome from assessments and voluntary contributions Bangladesh supports exploring the possibility ofproviding independent revenue sources for the UnitedNations through various international transactions andtaxation.“Bangladesh supports the reform efforts that havebeen initiated to revitalize and restructure the mainorgans of the United Nations and to achieve a moredynamic interrelationship for them. We intend toparticipate actively and constructively in the open-ended  high-level Working Group on United Nationsreform which is to review the Secretary-General’sAgendas for Peace and Development  respectively  andthe report submitted by Member States andindependent commissions. While we support the ideathat the broad objective of the reform is to strengthenthe response and efficiency of the United Nationssystem in promoting the goals of development security  justice and equality and to improveaccountability and responsibility  we reject pursuit ofreforms of a purely mechanical or managerial nature.It seems ironic that the yardstick for determining whatshould or should not be pruned has been appliedselectively in the past  with peace-keeping operationsapproved by the Security Council proliferating at thecost of development programmes. Catchwords of cost-effectiveness  financial stringency  trimmingmanagement  redundancy  waste and inefficiency seemintended more to constrain control and reduce theUnited Nations role than improve its capability ofresponding to the needs of the internationalcommunity.“Our position with regard to Security Councilreform has concentrated more on strengthening thetransparency and efficiency of the Council’s mandatethan on enlargement of the permanent membership.While we fully support enlargement of the overall sizeof the Council to reflect the growth in membership ofthe United Nations  we believe that an increase inpermanent members should be considered only on thebasis of the most stringent criteria  and on the basis ofglobal recognition and consensus. We are opposed inprinciple to creating new centres of privilege ordistinctions that can distort the principle of sovereignequality.“Bangladesh welcomes the consensus achievedin the outcomes of the major conferences in Cairo Copenhagen and Beijing on population  socialdevelopment and women  which supplement theresults of the Earth Summit  the children’s Summitand the Vienna Conference on Human Rights.Together they have forged a meaningful andcomprehensive social agenda that has reinforcedpoverty eradication and people-centred sustainabledevelopment. It must be emphasized  however  thatsocial development is dependent on economicgrowth  which can be fuelled only in an internationaleconomic environment which is conducive to it.“The global society is only as strong as itsweakest link. The plight of the least developedcountries assumes special relevance and importancein this 1995 mid-term review year of the leastdeveloped countries’ Programme of Action for the1990s. Their continuing crises calls for immediateremedial action especially in increasing officialdevelopment assistance  writing off debts andassuring greater trade access on preferential terms.“Bangladesh has followed closely and supportsstrongly the evolution and development of theSecretary-General’s Agenda for Peace. We agreewith the priority emphasis that has been placed onpreventive diplomacy and conflict-preventionmeasures and recognize especially their cost-effectiveness. We believe that regional efforts andregional agencies should be utilized more frequentlyand their capacity strengthened. Bangladesh hasactively contributed to the peace-keeping mission ofthe United Nations and has always favourablyresponded in providing troops. We have closelyexamined and positively responded to the request forthe provision of stand-by troops. We are alsofavourably inclined to support a rapid-reactioncapability for providing humanitarian assistance.“At plenary meetings the General Assemblywill have occasion to address in greater depth someof the most pressing and critical political issues onthe agenda  including the ongoing conflict in Bosniaand Herzegovina  in which prospects for anegotiated solution have considerably brightened onthe basis of the Contact Group’s Peace Plan and theGeneva Declaration of Principles of8 September 1995; the continuing peace efforts inthe Middle East and the new interim agreementbetween Israel and Palestinian leaders as a follow-up15to the Oslo Agreement; the status of democracy andhuman rights in Haiti; and the review of the work ofinternational tribunals established in formerYugoslavia and in Rwanda. Given the fluidity andrapid evolution of events in some of these crises  it isour hope to comment on them at length duringconsideration of the specific item.“Let me say in conclusion that there is no doubtin our mind that the United Nations remains the onlyforum where we can meet the challenges of the futureby drawing upon our combined solidarity andwillingness to confront them together.

"17",676,"BGR",50,1995,"Allow me first of all tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency ofthe fiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.Your election is a clear recognition of the high esteem yourcountry justly enjoys as an important link between differentcultures and continents. This in turn has enabled Portugalto become an active partner of those countries  likeBulgaria  that are progressing towards democracy and amarket economy within a united Europe.In today’s world of profound change the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations is of significance aboveall as a vantage point from which to try to develop avision for the future.Situated at the historical crossroads of nations andcivilizations  Bulgaria today is seeking both to contributeto the successful redefinition of the United Nations rolein the world of tomorrow and to ensure its own nationalsecurity and wellbeing. The role of the United Nationsshould be above all to build upon the enhanced capacityof the Organization in three crucial spheres of itsactivities  namely  conflict settlement and peace-keeping post-conflict peace-building  and the laying of durablefoundations for lasting peace.Today we all recognize the emergence of a greatnumber of new challenges to peace and security markedby extraordinary diversity and complexity. The conflictstill raging in the former Yugoslavia has been a traumatictest of the key United Nations responsibility for conflictsettlement and peace-keeping. The disappointments in thisregard have been many and profound; yet we should allface up to the simple truth that our Organization can beonly as effective as a guarantor of peace as we Membercountries wish and permit it to be.Bulgaria has from the outset strictly adhered topolicies supporting a peaceful settlement under UnitedNations auspices. Unilaterally  it has adopted andconsistently abided by the principle of non-interference inthe conflict. It has chosen not to become involved  eitherdirectly or indirectly  in any type of military activities onthe territory of the former Yugoslavia  includingparticipation in United Nations peace-keeping. We havecalled upon the other countries in the region to exercise thesame restraint. On the other hand  throughout the conflictBulgaria has supported every international initiative aimedat achieving a peaceful  balanced  just and comprehensivesolution.In keeping with its obligations under the UnitedNations Charter and as a means of restarting negotiations Bulgaria has consistently implemented the internationalsanctions regime. This step was taken on the basis of anational consensus that  despite the heavy burden suchsanctions created for Bulgaria  it was our duty to implementthem as a dependable member of the internationalcommunity.Yet Bulgaria has sustained debilitating losses as aresult of the sanctions. Over the past few years  we haverepeatedly drawn attention to this problem  both as itconcerns Bulgaria and as it concerns cooperation with otheraffected States. The sanction-induced losses so far amountto well over 25 per cent of Bulgaria’s estimated grossdomestic product for 1995. This has made Bulgaria by farthe country most seriously affected.Bulgaria’s policies favouring a peaceful outcome havehelped to establish it as a stabilizing factor in a most deeplytroubled region of Europe. At the same time  we feel thatsuch recognition also contributes to enhancing the peace-making potential of the United Nations itself. Positiveinteraction between the policies of individual MemberStates and the decisions and measures of the worldOrganization is the decisive factor in enhancing the latter’skey mission  that of helping to settle conflicts and keep thepeace.However  Bulgaria’s experience also shows that inorder to discharge this mission successfully in the future theUnited Nations needs carefully to rethink its main peace-keeping instruments  such as economic sanctions and peace-keeping missions.In areas outside its immediate vicinity Bulgaria has inrecent years contributed ground forces and civilian andpolice observers. In the operation in Cambodia  generallyconsidered a success  several young Bulgarians lost theirlives. We sympathize with other countries that havesustained human losses in subsequent missions  includingthe latest in the former Yugoslavia. We therefore stronglysupport the view that there is a need to reform and improvethe ways in which such missions are planned andexecuted  with priority given to enhancing the safety ofUnited Nations personnel.Recently  mediation between parties to a givenconflict has been successfully utilized in the discharge ofUnited Nations conflict-settlement missions. In thiscontext  we welcome the agreement reached betweenneighbouring Greece and the Republic of Macedonia asa most important step towards lessening tensions in thewhole of southeastern Europe.A further major contribution in this regard should beactive United Nations support for and collaboration inbringing to a successful conclusion the present intensiveefforts to attain peace in Bosnia. Bulgaria welcomes theUnited States peace initiative and the efforts to implementit in close cooperation with the United Nations and thecountries in the Contact Group. This has opened up realpossibilities for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.Experience derived from the Yugoslav crisishighlights the importance of another crucial UnitedNations function  namely  post-conflict peace-building.Today  it is obvious that although negotiations have notyet achieved a final settlement there is a need to begin toaddress the problems of post-conflict peace-buildingwithout delay.One set of such problems concerns the reduction ofthe levels of armaments and armed forces. It is clear thatconflict settlement would be pointless were it notaccompanied by a set of actions designed to remove thesources of real or potential security threats in the area.Thus  in the arms-control field Bulgaria shares theview that the establishment of a future harmonized arms-control regime in Europe should combine measures ofboth a pan-European and a regional character. Suchmeasures should be based on the understanding thatsecurity must be indivisible and that any disproportionateconcentration of armaments  in particular when coupledwith a lack of control mechanisms  undermines securityand stability. Therefore  the establishment of a crediblesystem of arms control and confidence- and security-building measures for the territory of the formerYugoslavia  as part of and in line with the pan-Europeanregimes  must be an essential part of a comprehensivepost-war settlement. Relevant international bodies such asthe United Nations and the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) should play a veryimportant role in this respect. The main objective should2be to attain levels of armaments that will preclude once andfor all any temptation to use force.The second set of peace-building measures concernspost-conflict economic reconstruction and stabilization.Important work has been done at the United Nationsin the past several years for developing an integratedapproach to successfully implementing reconstructionprogrammes. Such an approach should encompass fourinterrelated aspects: strategic issues of reconstruction  needsand capabilities  post-conflict reconstruction framework andmobilization of resources.Today plans for reconstruction are being laid for partsof the conflict area in the former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria isparticularly well placed to contribute to such plans. This isso for a number of reasons: first  its long-standingrelationship with the countries in and around the conflictarea and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced anddurable political settlement; secondly  because of theexperience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with along record of practical work in the area; thirdly  acquiredknowledge and expertise in working with internationalfinancial institutions in implementing programmes forreconstruction and development. For all these reasons Bulgaria could be an important factor contributing to thesuccess of any reconstruction effort in the area.The emerging pattern of structured coordinationbetween various organizations within and outside the UnitedNations system provides guidelines and a very usefulexample to follow. It encourages our own thinking as westart exploring practical and institutional possibilities forcontributing to the concerted international efforts in thisrespect.At the same time  Bulgaria has every reason to expectalso to receive a part of the international post-conflictassistance for the region. Effectively building the peace inthe region requires that neighbouring countries that bore thebrunt of sanctions and have sustained inordinate losses beincluded on a priority basis in the list of recipients ofinternational assistance.Bulgaria’s concerns over the subject of sanctions havealready become well known. We have formulated them inextenso on several occasions. In fact  the internationalcommunity and  in particular  the General Assembly haverecognized the right and the need to include non-target thirdcountries in programmes for reconstruction anddevelopment. At its two previous sessions  on Bulgarianinitiatives  the General Assembly adopted by consensustwo resolutions on this set of issues. This year again  mydelegation intends to submit a corresponding draftresolution which I hope will receive universal support.At this point  I cannot but underline the findings andrecommendations contained in the report (A/50/60) of theSecretary-General entitled “Supplement to An Agenda forPeace” and  in particular  his conclusion that the price ofsanctions implementation should be borne equally by allMember States and not only by those who have had themisfortune of being neighbours or important economicpartners of a sanctions target country. I would like to takethis opportunity to commend especially the efforts of HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in this particularlyimportant field of United Nations activities.It is our view that  as a result of work already done today there exists a significant scope of agreement on theways and means for overcoming the specific economicproblems confronting the affected States  as reflected inpart IV of resolution 47/120 and resolutions 48/210 and49/21 A of the General Assembly. Bulgaria isparticipating  and will continue to do so  in an effort tohelp towards the successful completion of the discussionon these issues in the United Nations.Together with conflict settlement and post-conflictpeace-building  a third  parallel line of action should beundertaken without delay. It should focus on layingdurable foundations for lasting peace through economicand social development. The task of achieving durablestability and security regarding peace and economicdevelopment has always been of particular relevance inSouth-Eastern Europe. It has become all the more so inthe light of evolving European integration.In order to boost such development and lastingstability  there is an urgent need for concerted efforts bythe international organizations and specialized agencieswithin the United Nations system  coupled with broaderand more intensive cooperation at a regional level. It isdoubtless necessary to avoid overlapping and duplication.Yet a mechanism must be put in place for effectivelycoordinating programmes for early implementation ofachievable objectives.The Ministerial Conference on environment forEurope  which is going to be held in Sofia the last weekof this October  is a particularly apt example of thisapproach. Another initiative along these lines is theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe3(OSCE) seminar on the role of trans-Europeaninfrastructure for stability and cooperation in the Black Searegion  which will also take place in Sofia  a month later.It will be dealing with priority projects for developingregional transport  telecommunications and energyinfrastructure as factors both for economic growth and forlasting stability and peace in the area.The above forums could provide valuable inputs forthe work undertaken within the European Union with theaim of elaborating a comprehensive regional strategy forSouth-Eastern Europe. Such a strategy could be based onthe approach embodied in the measures accompanying thePact on Stability in Europe  put forward at the time by theUnion. Cooperation at the subregional level may also proveto be a factor of significant practical importance in thiscontext.For its part  Bulgaria  in the course of the past severalmonths  has attempted to develop thinking and proposalsfor regional stability  security and cooperation which couldinteract with initiatives and programmes developed byEuropean and international institutions and major worldpartners. It is our belief that developing the economicdimensions of regional security will greatly favour theovercoming of local tensions rooted in the past  as well asthe full-fledged implementation of the basic principles ofrelations between States under the Helsinki Act and theParis Charter.With a view to promoting such regional cooperation I would like to state from this lofty rostrum that Bulgariais ready to host a gathering of interested Central and South-Eastern European States at the governmental level in thecourse of 1996. Given careful preparation and the supportof the international community  such a high-level meetingcould become a major step towards lasting security andstability in a historically much-troubled part of Europe.The parameters of the new international system arestill taking shape today. What is positive is that in the daysof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations theinternational community is looking for pragmatic andresponsible approaches to lend new meaning to theOrganization’s mission. The discussion of the possibilitiesof and prospects for United Nations restructuring can drawon the accumulated wealth of experience and takeadvantage of the prevailing spirit of cooperation. Let usmake the best possible use of them and together ventureinto the new century stronger  wiser and more united."
"18",721,"BHR",50,1995,"At the outset I have pleasure in extending toMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral and to his friendly country Portugal  my sincere congratulations on his election asPresident of the General Assembly for this session  whichmarks the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  whenthe Organization is celebrating its golden jubilee. Inwishing Mr. Freitas do Amaral success in conducting theproceedings of this session  I assure him of my delegation’sreadiness to cooperate fully with him towards achieving thedesired objectives.I should like also to take this opportunity to expressmy thanks and appreciation to Mr. Freitas do Amaral’spredecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  for his dedicated and sincereefforts in guiding the proceedings of the last session.It is also a pleasure to express my deep appreciationto the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for histireless efforts to enhance the international Organization’sstanding and role and to enable it to carry out its greatresponsibilities and tasks.The United Nations was established 50 years agowith the purpose of becoming the effective means ofsaving humanity from the scourge of war which hadplagued the century. The Organization was also designedto serve as a mechanism aimed at developing a newinternational order based on justice and equality for alland the promotion of human and cultural interactionamongst the world’s various peoples in the framework ofa secure international community.States and peoples  in their desire for security stability and cooperation  supported the principlesenshrined in the Charter  including those which call forensuring the sovereign equality of and mutual respectbetween States  refraining from the threat or use of force entrenching the principles of settling disputes by peacefulmeans  respecting every State’s territorial integrity  andrefraining from interfering in the internal affairs of others.Guided by these principles  the United Nations hasachieved numerous accomplishments at the political economic and social levels. Many nations and peoples with the support of the United Nations  have been able toachieve political independence  attain their legitimaterights and implement development programmes.The 50 year experience of the United Nationsembodies profound indications of the future of a changingworld in which the enormous interacting developmentshave not yet reached the limit. The most prominentamong those signs is  perhaps  the end of the era ofconfrontation between East and West at a time when thehuman race is on the threshold of a new century. Theprofound significance of these developments is that theprevailing political climate has given rise to a situationthat favours the correcting of certain trends ininternational relations and their development in a mannerthat takes into account the new circumstances andchanges in several regions of the world.In the context of these historical premises  worldPowers have been concerned that changes might leadthem to proceed in disparate directions which  it wasfeared  would make it difficult for the internationalcommunity to check the unrestrained pace of the changesso engendered and control their effects on world peaceand security. Thus it becomes essential to develop abalancing strategy for joint international action  especiallynow that interdependence and multilateralism must formthe basis of cooperation in international relations.18This political reality was given expression on 31January 1992  when the Security Council — for the firsttime — held a meeting at the level of Heads of State andGovernment. The Council then requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report containing analyses andrecommendations concerning ways of enhancing andstrengthening the capabilities of the United Nations in theareas of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. Recently  on the occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  the Secretary-Generalhas submitted the important “Supplement to An Agendafor Peace'”  in which he set out his views and thoughts asa contribution to the continuous drive to enhance theOrganization’s capability to face up to threats tointernational peace and security.The significance of this new tendency was underscoredduring the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and its RioDeclaration on Environment and Development  Agenda 21as well as in many other important internationalconventions relating to development and the environment.It was further confirmed during the InternationalConference on Population and Development  held in Cairolast year. Both the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen  and the Fourth World Conference onWomen  held recently in Beijing  confirmed the principle ofinterdependence and recognized its importance.These world conferences and meetings have made theUnited Nations a global forum for the international politicsof multilateralism. Efforts are now being directed towardsaddressing the problems of the future  such asenvironmental pollution and population explosion  inaddition to economic and social crises and other dilemmasof a universal character.This increasing tendency to act in accordance with theprinciples of interdependence and multilateralism isundoubtedly a positive one that is in consonance with thepurposes of the Charter. However  certain aspects of thecurrent international situation raise a number offundamental questions concerning the role of the UnitedNations and its influence on the current developments onthe international scene which serve as pointers to the shapeof future relations between States.Such questioning includes  for example: How will theOrganization steer a course amid the new features of themodern political topography which is changing due toincessant strategic changes of international policies? Howwill the major Powers identify the role of the UnitedNations in the area of interdependence and internationalmultilateralism? And how will they deal with crises inareas of high tension around the world?It is obvious that such questioning has to do  inessence  with two fundamental issues. The first is thefuture of collective security  as envisioned in the Charter for the remaining part of this century and during the nextcentury. The second is the mechanism for internationaleconomic and social cooperation to which the majorindustrial States will agree.A search into the legacy of the United Nationsduring half a century leads us to say that these two issueswill constitute the major characteristics of internationalrelations in the twenty-first century. The problem of therealpolitik policies pursued by the Powers that influencethe formulation of international relations is that they donot seem to be in harmony with the principle of collectivesecurity. The problem of international economic andsocial cooperation lies in the fact that the concepts ofeconomic and social development held by the wealthyindustrialized countries are at variance with those of thedeveloping countries vis-à-vis the economic and socialaspects of development issues. In our view  this differenceof outlook creates obstacles that not only impede theimplementation and development of internationalcooperation but also affect the manner in which economicand social problems are dealt with.The two issues of collective security andinternational economic and social cooperation should beaccorded an increasing importance since they embody thesolid foundation of stability and progress in a world thatis in a state of flux. The need to attach such importanceto those two issues arises from the fact that  for over 50years  the international community has not been able toreach consensus on how to put into practice the principleof collective security in line with the vision of theCharter. In so far as international economic and socialcooperation is concerned  the North-South dialogue hasnot led to any positive result in over three decades.Given this fact  the world has to evolve newperceptions on how to address the issues of collectivesecurity and international economic and social cooperationin the context of a practical perspective that takes intoaccount the new changes that have taken place in theworld.In our view  it is possible  once the internationalcommunity musters the necessary political will  to put19into practice important aspects of the principle of collectivesecurity along the following lines:The creation of a mechanism that meets on a regularbasis within the framework of the Security Council tomonitor and detect threats to world peace and security.The development and better use of the mechanisms ofpreventive diplomacy in preventing  containing orpre-empting conflicts before they develop into serioushostilities.The development  in all seriousness  of the ideas andconcepts embodied in Chapter VII of the Charter  in thelight of the international community’s experience  tobecome the basis of dealing with aggression as it arises.The utilization of the capabilities of regionalorganizations in the context of United Nations cooperationwith such organizations in the maintenance of world peaceand security.As regards international economic and socialcooperation  this too requires the existence of the politicalwill  especially on the part of the wealthy industrializedcountries  to create an equitable global economicenvironment that may contribute to the achievement ofstability and prosperity for all States and peoples.We believe that the gap which exists  in the areas ofeconomic growth and social advancement  between thewealthy industrialized countries  with their enormouseconomic resources  and the developing countries  is amongthe most chronic and significant problems that face theinternational community.Regrettably  the commitments to implement thedevelopment policies and strategies agreed upon in theUnited Nations with a view to narrowing that gap have notbeen honoured. It goes without saying that the UnitedNations will not be able to discharge its mandate in anenvironment fraught with disparities  because the poverty unemployment and lack of productive employment that arerampant throughout the world are negative factors in thearea of development. Proceeding from its awareness of thisreality  the United Nations has convened the World Summiton Social Development in Copenhagen to address theurgent and serious issues of social development that facemankind. We believe that the implementation of thepolicies set out in the Summit’s Declaration andProgramme of Action should take place within the contextof the religious principles  national legislation  customsand traditions of every State.It is essential at this stage to reopen the dialoguewithin the United Nations system between developed anddeveloping countries concerning all development matters on the basis of the commitments set out in theDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation andthe International Development Strategy for the FourthUnited Nations Development Decade. To that end  a newand practical development plan has to be adopted with aview to ensuring compliance with the decisions of thevarious United Nations development conferences  so thatthe desired objectives of those decisions may be achieved.We are convinced that international cooperationcould be enhanced and strengthened through the adoptionof policies leading to the activation of the United Nationsrole in the area of economic and social cooperation bymeans of addressing such world problems as developmentand environment. Also  world trade mechanisms shouldbe developed in accordance with the common interests ofStates and in an equitable manner that takes into accountthe requirements of development and the economicproblems of the developing countries  accords dueattention to the socio-political aspects of the economicproblems that beset those countries and aims atconsolidating the foundations of their economic security.Notwithstanding its accomplishments  on the onehand  and  on the other  the obstacles and failures it hasencountered for reasons beyond its control  the UnitedNations now finds itself facing a new challenge. This newchallenge forces it to deal with crises and problemscaused by ethnic  national and even religious and culturalconflicts and clashes between parties that belonged toStates and territories which had originally been unified inaccordance with agreements reached in the wake of thiscentury’s wars.In view of the tense regional and internationalatmosphere caused by the eruption of those heretoforedormant volcanoes and the ensuing changes brought aboutby such eruption  it has become essential to enhance therole of the United Nations and provide it with thenecessary means of dealing effectively with such crisesand resolving them before they develop into devastatingwars between the sons of this or that country such asthose we now witness in Afghanistan  Somalia  theBalkans and other parts of the world where peoples aresuffering destruction and destitution.20In addition to the new issues that the United Nationsnow faces in the wake of the cold war  there is a host ofregional and international questions that continue to because for concern and require the attention of ourOrganization. Top of the list is the situation in the Gulfregion which  in the recent past  witnessed two destructivewars whose consequences continue to affect adversely theregion’s political and economic conditions and to jeopardizeits security and stability. Proceeding from our eagerness topreserve security and stability in this vital region of theworld  we call upon all parties to pay heed to itsimportance as an area where international interests criss-cross and as an area of strategic importance to world trade.In the light of these facts  we stress the need for Iraqto comply with Security Council resolutions concerning theState of Kuwait and the release of Kuwaiti and otherprisoners of war and detainees. While we call upon Iraq torespond fully to the behests of international legality  wemust voice our concern over the territorial integrity sovereignty and unity of Iraq which must be preserved andexpress sympathy with the brotherly Iraqi people whoendure difficult economic and social conditions that shouldend once their causes cease to exist.The persistence of the dispute between the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran over thequestion of sovereignty over the islands of Abu Mousa Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb is regrettable in view of itsadverse effects on the Gulf region’s security and stability.Consequently  Bahrain calls upon the Islamic Republicof Iran to respond to the United Arab Emirates call to seeka solution to the question of the islands through seriousbilateral talks  or by any of the other peaceful means thatare available for the settlement of disputes between Statesby mutual consent.The Middle East has embarked on a new historicalphase wherein optimism holds sway with the adoption ofthe principle of negotiation and respect for law as a meansto settle disputes between States instead of war  violenceand occupation of territories by force. The peace process inthe Middle East has taken significant steps since the historicWashington meeting 13 September 1993  which resulted inthe signing of the Agreement on Principles between thePalestinians and Israel. It was followed by the signing ofthe Peace Treaty between Jordan and Israel on 26 October1994 and the signing of the second phase of the Agreementof Principles on the expansion of Palestinian self-rulebetween the Palestinians and Israel in Washington on 28September 1995. The sparkle of optimism that has glitteredon the horizon should not be allowed to die out as aresult of the Israeli settlement policies that aim atchanging the demography of the occupied Arab territories particularly Al-Quds  in order to create a new reality.Bahrain welcomes these steps and reaffirms itssupport for the Middle East peace process. It alsosupports the endeavours and efforts that aim at reachinga just  comprehensive and durable solution based on theprinciple of land for peace as well as Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Proceeding fromthis  Bahrain reaffirms its support for the position takenby the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the restoration ofits full sovereignty over its territories in the Syrian Golanthat has been occupied since 1967. It is also importantthat the peace process should be reactivated on theLebanese track and that Israel should be compelled tocomply with Security Council resolution 425 (1978). Forif peace is to prevail  it should include all parties withoutexception.We appeal to all the parties involved in the disputein Somalia to allow the creation of a secure climate thatis conducive to the continuation of political efforts andhumanitarian activities. Such continuation depends on thecooperation of those parties and on their adherence to theprinciple of dialogue and understanding in order toachieve a political settlement that would ensure therestoration of peace  security and stability to this sisternation.The State of Bahrain has  from the beginning followed with utmost attention and deepest concern thesituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  along with all thehuman tragedies and injustices resulting from the policiesof aggression and criminal acts  including killings deportations and ethnic cleansing  committed by the Serbaggressors against the people of Bosnia. The crisis hastaken several turns and twists and has been accompaniedby political moves by regional and international partiesthat have almost deprived the international community ofcredibility.Bahrain has supported all United Nations resolutionsrelating to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has endorsed allthe efforts and initiatives undertaken by the UnitedNations  as well as other organizations and all those whodesire peace and uphold justice.As the Serbs have gone too far in their aggressionand in defying the will of the international community inpursuit of their expansionist and aggressive schemes that21have been exposed to all and rejected by all  we see a rayof light on the horizon which gives cause for hope that  atlong last  a solution for this human tragedy may be at handand might finally redeem the international community’ssilence over the plight of the Bosnian people.Bahrain supports the positive developments that aretaking place now in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It calls uponthe international community and the Security Council tomaintain pressure on the Serb aggressors towardscompliance with United Nations resolutions and acceptinga just and equitable solution for all parties. In particular the solution should be just and equitable for the Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina  whose people have sufferedmaterial losses and have been subjected to inhumansuffering as a result of the occupation of parts of theirterritories.While we voice deep concern over the ongoingconflict in Afghanistan  we should like to call upon theparties involved in the conflict to resort to reason and logicand  thereby  reach a cease-fire and work for peace stability and national reconciliation.The United Nations has deployed continuous effortsover the past few years towards the settlement of theCyprus problem. In this connection  we should like toreiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-Generalthat aim at reaching a just resolution of the problem inaccordance with the provisions of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.Bahrain  having supported the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the objectivesthereof is of the opinion that the Treaty  being aninstrument of international peace and security  should applyuniversally with no exceptions or special considerations.We should like  meanwhile  to stress the need for upholdingthe Treaty  adherence to its provisions and pursuit of itsobjectives. Bahrain views Security Council resolution 984(1995)  despite the limited nature of the guarantees itembodies  as a first positive step towards securityguarantees that are applicable to all  for States which do notpossess nuclear weapons.Bahrain supported the initiative of making the MiddleEast a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of massdestruction on the basis of its belief in the importance ofpeace  security and confidence building amongst all Statesof the region. It has also endorsed the resolution adopted bythe conference of the parties to the NPT and the armslimitations Treaty  despite its shortcomings. We areconfident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear andweapons of mass destruction would enhance the peaceprocess and lead to a situation wherein enormousfinancial resources would be saved and channelledtowards the economic prosperity and social developmentof the peoples of the region.Regional cooperation has become one of thenecessities of our modern world in view of theintertwined interests of the peoples of the world. It is thusa complementary part of  rather than a substitute forinternational cooperation. It serves today as an effectivemeans for the promotion of economic prosperity andmutual understanding with a view to establishing strongrelations based on mutual trust  good-neighbourliness andnon-interference in the internal affairs of others.The Arab Gulf States have long recognized theimportance of regional cooperation amongst them inenabling them to face the imminent risks that beset theregion. More than 15 years ago  they established the GulfCooperation Council with a view to reinvigorating Gulfjoint action and strengthening the historical and brotherlyties between the Gulf States on the basis of the unity ofobjectives and a common destiny. The Council’s marchhas witnessed positive developments in the fields ofcoordination and cooperation amongst its member States.The resolutions of the fifteenth summit which Bahrainhad the honour of hosting and presiding over havestrengthened this march. The summit had historicsignificance in that it addressed crucial Gulf issues byadopting resolutions that reaffirmed the determination towiden the scope of cooperation  to surmount obstacles andto settle all outstanding matters within the Council andthe unified Gulf family. Brotherly and friendly Stateshave welcomed these steps and expressed the hope thatthe same spirit would apply to all issues so that all theStates and peoples of the region may reap the benefits ofsecurity  stability and prosperity.The Governments of the States members of theCouncil have undertaken to continue to promote allaspects of cooperation between their States and with othereconomic groups  to look forward positively to theprospects of future work and to develop strategic visionsthat take into consideration the interests and priorities ofthe other members of the Council and those of otherStates in the interests of peace  security and stability inthe region and in the world at large.The strengthening of the United Nations role andincreasing its capabilities and effectiveness require the22developing of its bodies  including the Security Council  theorgan concerned with international peace and security. Theneed to develop the work of the Council has become animportant issue that has the unanimous support of MemberStates in view of the current international changes. Webelieve that such development should reflect the equitablegeographic representation of all regional groups in order toincrease the effectiveness and level of efficiency of theOrganization and to achieve balance in the Council  so thatits membership may be representative of the world’sdifferent cultures. As member of this internationalOrganization  Bahrain looks forward to participating in thework of the Council during the period of its membershipscheduled for 1998-1999.We all aspire after a world of security  cooperationand peace. Our international Organization  equipped as it iswith its membership’s intellectual and cultural values andwith the high principles and noble objectives enshrined inits Charter  is quite capable of satisfying this aspiration.However  in order for the United Nations to do so  we  itsMembers  must give the Organization our full support onthe occasion of its fiftieth anniversary so that it mayachieve in our behalf what we all desire  namely  justiceand peace."

This requires the review and updating of theinstitutions and processes of international cooperation.Within the context of the global consensus around the needfor such an overhaul  including the adoption of newapproaches  our tasks are greatly eased. If we accept theadage that form follows function  we must now determinewhat it is we are hoping to achieve  and what function weare seeking to serve. The form of the structure for ensuringthe effective execution of that function will then naturallyemerge.The framers of the Charter were determined to savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war. We havemanaged to do this as far as global war is concerned  butwhat have we saved these generations for? What is theirheritage? What is their future? Is it good enough to savethem for the seemingly inevitable lot of chronic poverty ignorance and disease  for the threat of nuclearannihilation or the consequences of global warming? Is itgood enough to save these generations for a life wherethe security and very existence of the planet on whichthey live is in jeopardy?Clearly  those responsible for establishing theparameters of action in the past have not produced theresult that is not only desirable but necessary to ensure astable  secure and viable future. The question now is whodetermines the assignment of responsibility. Is it possiblethat those countries most directly concerned haveabdicated their responsibility  with the result that their fatenow resides in the hands of those whose interests are  atbest  competing?It is only logical that those who stand to lose andbenefit most must assume the lead in establishing thecontours of the agenda for the process which will usherin the kind of order that gives coherence to their ideasand vision  and that provides for the attainment of theirobjectives. This places before developing countries likethe Bahamas untold opportunities and challenges. One ofthe major challenges will be to ensure that ourrelationship with our global partners is truly one ofinterdependence  and not masked dependence where themajority of humanity are only subordinate players citizens of countries marginalized and on the periphery ofglobal change.Genuine interdependence coupled with a true senseof interconnectedness would eliminate the desire forunilateral action. In this context  we are disturbed anddisappointed over the decision by two nuclear States toproceed with nuclear tests after the solemn commitmentsof the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. The hope of the international community hadbeen for complete moratoriums on testing until the entryinto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty  envisagedfor the end of next year.The Bahamas is especially pleased that United StatesPresident Bill Clinton  on 6 August last  unequivocallycommitted his Government to ending all testing of nuclearweapons  and further committed his Administration to thecompletion of negotiations on a comprehensive test-bantreaty.Despite the easing of global tensions since the endof the cold war  the maintenance of international peace20and security remains a major preoccupation for the UnitedNations. Religious and territorial disputes have presentedthe international community with new challenges and withthe need to provide appropriate solutions.Of all the regional conflicts in the world today particular mention should be made of the situation in theformer Yugoslavia. In this regard I must express mydelegation’s dissatisfaction with the continuation ofhostilities in that region. It is the hope of my delegationthat the efforts now being undertaken by the partiesconcerned towards achieving a negotiated solution to endthat conflict will meet with success.We also welcome the recent agreement on expansionof Palestinian interim self-rule. This constitutes a major stepforward in the Middle East peace process.It is the hope of the Bahamas delegation that duringthis fiftieth session of the General Assembly every effortwill be made to take decisions that will sustain effortstowards the maintenance of global peace and security.It is with a sense of responsibility that the Bahamasassumes a strong stance on the rehabilitation andreconstruction of Haiti. We participated in United Nationsefforts to return President Aristide to Haiti. This is a secondchance for Haiti. We note that since the return of PresidentAristide the gross human rights violations have subsidedand that the democratic process has now begun with thefirst and second rounds of elections.Elections  however  are only the beginning. Massiveassistance  financial and technical  is what is needed tocreate the proper institutional and infrastructural frameworkto facilitate rapid development in Haiti.The Prime Minister of the Bahamas has stated onseveral occasions “We in the international community have sold theHaitian people a bill of goods. We have told them thatdemocracy will bring peace  stability  and economicand social development. We must now ensure after-sales services.”Time is of the essence. The people of Haiti must not beallowed to lose hope for the betterment of their condition.We must ensure that we receive the necessary returns onour investment to date. To do so requires a strategy forensuring that the situation that has given rise to the initialcrisis is not allowed to re-emerge.There are now indications that some of the people ofHaiti have already begun to lose hope. I was informedonly a few hours ago that 216 new refugees were foundin the waters of the Bahamas. This brings the number ofnew refugees who have risked their lives on the sea in thelast month to over 1 000. This cannot be allowed tocontinue. The Government of the Bahamas  together withthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners reiterates its commitment to playing its part in therehabilitation of Haiti.The changes in the international system have alsomade States acutely aware that attention must now bepaid equally to environmental security. Illustrative of thisare the issues of nuclear testing  the transboundarymovement of hazardous and radioactive wastes  andnatural-disaster preparedness  which are of considerableconcern to us in the Caribbean region.Natural disasters have wreaked havoc upon countriesand people. The Bahamas extends its sympathy andsupport to our sister Caribbean States and the UnitedStates of America  which have just recently been victimsof this phenomenon. The Bahamas is encouraged by thesupport given by the United Nations system  CARICOM and other countries  including Japan  Canada  the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom  for the rehabilitation ofthe affected countries.A new approach requires a new attitude and a newcommitment to enforcing those aspects of the presentorder which  though potentially effective  have beenemployed selectively at best. Respect for the rule of law basic human rights and the dignity of the individual mustbe rediscovered. There is need for a strong ethical base toensure integrity and honesty in honouring agreements.This becomes increasingly important in the context of theglobalizing effect of trade and communicationstechnology. As commercial barriers are removed  we mustensure that ethnic and cultural barriers are not erected intheir place  as these produce intolerance and theconcomitant intra-State ethnic  religious and territorialdisputes.Equally important to this new approach is arecognition of the revised roles for former leaders andactors in our affairs; traditionally  matters of national andinternational concern were dealt with at theintergovernmental level. It is now necessary to recognizethat individuals and institutions  both public and private must have an input. Effective management or governancemust be inclusive.21This realization does not  however  remove theresponsibility of Governments to conduct their affairs in amanner that is both democratic and transparent  therebyfacilitating accountability. Democratization must mean aguarantee of free participation  where the expressed will ofthe people is fully reflected in the actions of Governments.Such democratization must not be limited to States  butmust spread throughout the international system and itsseveral components. The United Nations  as one of theprincipal elements of this system  must reflect thisdemocracy in its decision-making bodies  such as theSecurity Council. The Bahamas has followed thedeliberations of the Working Group on the reform of theSecurity Council with great interest and hopes that themomentum of those deliberations will be maintained  witha view to reaching consensus on the issues at an early date.Once again  the Bahamas wishes to record its supportfor the entreaties made by the Republic of China on Taiwanto this Organization to examine the merits of establishingan ad hoc committee to analyse comprehensively thecurrent implications and future ramifications of thepreclusion of the 21 million people in the Republic ofChina from contributing to  and availing themselves of  allthe benefits derived from membership in the United Nationsand its affiliated agencies. The Bahamas also lends its voiceto those who encourage dialogue and meaningfulconfidence-building steps between the People’s Republic ofChina and the Republic of China on Taiwan.The Government of the Bahamas is committed to goodgovernance and democratic principles  where human rightsand dignity are respected  and where strong democraticstructures exist  involving every stratum of society. Such acontext facilitates the decentralization of decision-makingto the communities which will ultimately be affected bythem.My Government’s philosophy is based on thefollowing seven tenets: the exercise of honesty andaccountability in all public matters; the development andstrengthening of the world’s economy  so that all peoplemay aspire to suitable and acceptable living standards  andto meaningful improvement of the quality of their lives; thecommitment to providing the private sector with incentives encouragement and scope for revitalizing and expanding theworld’s economy  so as to generate sustainable employmentopportunities for all people; the enhancement of educationaland training opportunities and the development of suitablerecreational facilities  so that young people will be equippedfor challenging careers and can lead purposeful lives; theestablishment of compassionate social programmes to assistthose in society who are in the greatest need; the creationof a physical and social environment as beautiful and assecure as possible  so that all people can enjoy the fullbeauty and wonder of the world without fear  hindranceor intimidation; and  finally  the development of mutualtrust and harmony among the peoples of the world irrespective of religious  racial  economic or socialdifferences.My Government recognizes the vital role of womenin all aspects of this process. It seeks to ensure that theyare involved in shaping and moulding their destinies byremoving all barriers to their access to policy-makinglevels of society and to their full involvement in thedecision-making process.It is gratifying to note that most of the critical areasof concern identified in the Platform for Action of therecent Fourth World Conference on Women are beingadequately addressed in the Bahamas.In fulfilling its responsibilities for shaping this neworder outside the Bahamas  my Government will seek toensure that its national priorities find room on theinternational agenda and in the organizations assigned toaddress these matters. We cannot decry the internationalcommunity for lack of action if we fail to provide thenecessary leadership.We extend such an attitude to our commitment toensuring that the United Nations  which constitutes thebest mechanism for addressing such an agenda  operateson a sound financial basis by seeing to it that ourcontributions are paid in full and on time. We encourageother nations to do likewise. It is a travesty that at a timewhen this Organization has been assigned such a vitalrole in the management of international affairs it is on theverge of bankruptcy  with only some 60 countries out of185 having fully met their financial obligations to date.Responsibility for our future is in our hands. Thefounding fathers of this Organization provided a solidfoundation. Regrettably  the structure erected thereon hasproved inadequate for the needs of the “family”. Let usnow ensure that in our renovations all concerns are takeninto account so that we provide not only shelter but alsowarmth and security."
"20",784,"BIH",50,1995,"Let me firstcongratulate you  Sir  and wish you success in your new most historically significant task.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations can beviewed as a time of retirement or as an opportunity for anew beginning and rejuvenation. We all bear aresponsibility to maximize the possibility that the UnitedNations will not only endure the next 50 years but willthrive as the centrepiece of a new world order andinternational peace and security.Bosnia and Herzegovina is keenly aware of the pivotalrole into which our country has been thrust. It is not a rolewe sought or one that we cherish. The successful settlementof the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina  consistent with theprinciples of sovereignty  democracy and respect for humanrights engraved in the United Nations Charter  can be acatalyst for this new beginning for both Bosnia andHerzegovina and the United Nations. However  a failure tohonour basic principles of the United Nations Charter andinternational humanitarian law could be fatal to Bosnia andHerzegovina and threaten the vitality and integrity of theUnited Nations.This coming Thursday  we all hope to see another firmstride towards peace in the Middle East. Although muchmore needs to be done to secure the rights of all in theregion and to bring about real stability and therefore truepeace  the peace process in the Middle East is anchoredby leaders who deserve our respect. They representpeoples who have been long maligned during the recentpast. The substantial differences that still exist betweenthese peoples are born out of previous injustices and outof conflicting claims to land.The war waged upon our country does involve aland grab and an aggression in violation of the UnitedNations Charter. However  more directly  the war is aboutideology — ideology not of religion and ethnicity but ofpolitics and tolerance. We have been the victims ofgenocide and our enemy is not defined by its ethnicity orreligion but by the ideology of intolerance  dictatorshipand fascism that it promotes.I have just come out of the negotiations with themembers of the Contact Group on Bosnia andHerzegovina and my two colleagues from Croatia andSerbia and Montenegro. I wish that I could say that I wasas confident about the prospects of success with respectto our negotiations as I am for the prospects of thenegotiations in the Middle East. While the Middle Eastnegotiations involve statesmen trying to resolve thecompeting claims of maligned peoples hungry for peace we find among our negotiating partners at least twoindividuals already indicted by the War Crimes Tribunalin The Hague for genocide and other crimes againsthumanity. While the international media show pictures ofthe mass graves of civilians murdered in the campaign of“ethnic cleansing” and genocide that gave the RepublikaSrpska its very beginning  we are now negotiating with ateam that includes the very indicted war criminalsresponsible for these murders and the mass graves.We really do hope that this negotiating process willbring about a step towards peace. We have come to thefirm understanding that victory can be defined in morethan one way. We are not seeking military victory overour enemies  even though our legal and moral status isconsistent with absolute military triumph. We havelearned to define our victory in terms of the lives that wecan save and in the opportunity to rebuild and reinstatethroughout our country democracy and human rights. Wecertainly do not seek revenge for the thousands of personsexpelled  tortured  raped and murdered. We only seek notto allow war criminals responsible for these crimes todictate our future and to seek legitimacy through thenegotiating process. We do have confidence that the WarCrimes Tribunal in The Hague will bring about justice18and will certainly know better how to address such warcriminals than the negotiators.We are sincerely committed to  and do believe in  thenegotiating process. Negotiations are consistent with ourgoal  which is to achieve peace  even if we have to makedifficult  painful compromises. Through peace we hope tore-establish democracy and respect for human rightsthroughout the entire country and in that fashion graduallyreintegrate our country. It is in many ways a risky andunprecedented road. None the less  we do believe that  inpeace  the ideology of an open  free  democratic andtolerant society is strongest  while a closed  totalitarian andintolerant ideology is strengthened by conflict. We dorecognize also that there are some legitimate considerationsthat have to be addressed in the negotiating process including internal territorial delineations and means torebuild the confidence of the population in the politicalprocesses and mechanisms that are designed to securerespect for human rights.Our country has been too scarred and too polarized bythis war for us to expect that peace and reintegration willnot require a special effort and mechanisms that may seemunnatural to many of us. None the less  there still remainsa basic contradiction in the existing negotiating process.That is because it is theorized that dictators and despots asnegotiators on one side are truly prepared to negotiate tobring about free and fair elections and democraticinstitutions as the basis for a new Bosnia and Herzegovina.That is because it is expected that hate mongers onone side are prepared to negotiate the establishment ofinstitutions that in fact ensure respect for basic humanrights.That is because war criminals on one side — the sameside — are called upon to negotiate the creation ofmechanisms that would facilitate the return of refugees anddisplaced persons  the very victims that these criminalsactually subjected to “ethnic cleansing”.I have just come from a set of lengthy and difficultnegotiations. The other side continues to refuse to acceptthe requirement that the future Parliament and Presidencyof Bosnia and Herzegovina should be elected by directelections by popular vote.We are being strongly encouraged — even pressured if you will — to agree to what may be a process other thanelection by popular vote as the means by which the futureParliament and Presidency of our country would beselected.We have already been lectured that the negotiatingprocess would collapse if we persisted in demanding thatthe extradition of war criminals to The Hague must behonoured by all authorities within the future Bosnia andHerzegovina  as is consistent with international law andthe demands of the international community on ourcountry as a whole.Let us be clear here once and for all on this. Wewill not settle for sham elections or other selectionprocedures in respect of our most basic governmentalinstitutions that dictators and despots want in order toundermine real democracy and legitimize totalitarianismunder the cover of an international peace agreement.The other side has been given the opportunity tochoose its own negotiating team. But the fact that theyhave selected members who have already been formallyindicted by the War Crimes Tribunal and others who mayyet be indicted will not affect our demand that they beextradited to the Tribunal.The selection of these negotiators is their choice. Butlet me emphasize once again: we will not allow anegotiating process to shield war criminals frominternational justice — not our justice  but internationaljustice. In fact  the success of the negotiating process willbe measured by whether or not war criminals are broughtto justice and by whether despots and dictators are sweptout of power  not by the agreements that such criminalsand dictators may sign.Elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot beeither free  fair or democratic until a basic respect forhuman rights is established  until war criminals are sentfor trial to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague  untilrefugees and displaced persons are guaranteed the rightand opportunity to return and to vote in these elections and until overall conditions are established consistent witha free and open society.Finally  neither can there be real peace unless anenvironment consistent with democracy and respect forhuman rights is promoted by all  including theinternational community.Well  what does all this have to do with the UnitedNations? It certainly has a lot to do with Bosnia andHerzegovina as a Member of the United Nations. Simply19put  the United Nations Charter and basic internationalprinciples can be overlooked only temporarily. However the United Nations cannot be the envisioned authority in thepreservation of international peace and security if theUnited Nations Charter is overwhelmingly ignored inestablishing the building blocks for peace. This is auniversal principle with global application.As I mentioned  I have just come from thenegotiations. I will be going back. We are surprised  we areangry that we have to negotiate over whether or not  inestablishing peace and a new beginning in Bosnia andHerzegovina  the other side will be forced to accept direct free and democratic elections. We are being told that wemust accept compromise language that means less than this.If they will not accept the words today  we must be trulysuspicious of their longer-term intentions ever to accept realpeace and democracy  or whether they in fact just intend toperpetuate their hold on power and domination over aninnocent Serb population.We have already made many painful compromises.We are prepared to make more — many more — in thesearch for a real peace. However  do not ask us — do notask yourselves — to settle for concessions to dictatorships to intolerance  to illegality  to criminality and hate. Do notallow yourselves and us to set aside the most basicprinciples of the United Nations Charter.We are prepared to work with all Member States inpartnership for that real peace and the necessarycompromises that all of us can live with."
"21",831,"BLR",50,1995,"First of all I wish tocongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his electionto the distinguished post of President of the GeneralAssembly at its fiftieth  jubilee session. I am sure that hispersonal and professional qualities will serve as a solidguarantee that during this particularly important session theUnited Nations will achieve new concrete steps in its searchfor ways to meet the complicated challenges facinghumanity.I wish to express our gratitude to his predecessor Mr. Amara Essy  and to the Secretary-General of theOrganization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.We are proud that Belarus was at the origin of thecreation of the United Nations and became one of thefounding Members of the Organization  having signed theCharter of the United Nations at San Francisco. Thathonourable right was a testimony to the internationalrecognition of the contribution made by the people ofBelarus to the defeat of fascism during the Second WorldWar  the homage paid to the millions of Belarusians whogave their lives in the struggle for liberty and of the rightof the Belarusian people to exist as a nation with its ownhistory  culture and future.Emerging from the ashes of the Second World War the United Nations has experienced the most seriouscrises and conflicts  the cold war and détente considerable changes in the political map of the worldand the break-up and formation of unions and blocs ofStates. The Organization has coped creditably with thesechallenges. Thanks to the United Nations humankind  forthe first time in its history  has acquired the opportunityto live for half a century in peace. The contribution of theUnited Nations to the process of the peaceful settlementof many conflicts is well known. One of the mostimportant achievements of the United Nations is that theworld has rid itself of such odious phenomena asapartheid and is close to a complete eradication ofcolonialism  another no less odious remnant of the past.It is also appropriate to note the role of the UnitedNations in elaborating and adopting universal documentsin the sphere of human rights  as well as in establishingthe supremacy of international law.The hopes and expectations of the peoples associatedwith the United Nations are convincing evidence of theimportant role of the Organization at this stage. The tasksthat the United Nations is facing today seem to be muchmore complicated than those of the past  when they weredictated by the pernicious but understandable logic ofconfrontation. Today it is necessary to solve thechallenges of the future world order; and this implies thenecessity to reform the United Nations system. Reform ofthe United Nations  including that of the Security Council one of its principal organs responsible for themaintenance of international peace and security  is thewatchword of the day  and is in many respects anextremely complicated matter. But each State can andshould make its own contribution to the formation of therenewed United Nations. This will enable the6Organization to reflect the diversity of the contemporaryworld  the interdependence of States  the equality of greatand small and the security and development of all. Thereform of the United Nations should result in a moreeffective Organization as a whole. The reform of theSecurity Council may be carried out only on the basis of areasonable increase in the membership of the Council  withstrict respect for the principle of the equitable geographicaldistribution of additional seats among all the regions of theworld. The Belarusian delegation is convinced that theallocation of an additional seat for a non-permanentmember of the Council to the Eastern European regionalgroup is fully justified and will ensure a new  emergingbalance of interests.I am sure that the United Nations will be able to adaptitself fully to the present realities  as well as duly torespond to the demands and foreseeable global challengesof the twenty-first century.Among the most serious problems the worldcommunity is facing nowadays are regional conflicts. Suchconflicts are not a new problem  but in their presentdimensions they represent a new challenge for the UnitedNations. We are fully convinced that  in striving for theirsettlement  the United Nations should not yield to thetemptation to use military force to accelerate the process.Peace-keeping and peace enforcement are two different andin many respects exactly opposite methods  and not links inthe same continuing chain of crisis resolution. We considerit very important not to go beyond the limits to violenceand ruthlessness that are incompatible with the nature of theOrganization.Our delegation notes with satisfaction the progressmade in the settlement of the Middle East conflict. Webelieve that the continuation of the direct dialogue betweenIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) willfinally lead to a comprehensive solution providing forrespect for the right of all States of the region to live inpeace within internationally recognized borders. We deeplyregret the terrorist acts that are periodically carried out inthe region and which considerably hamper the peaceprocess. Such acts must be severely condemned.The Balkan conflict is of special concern to us. Thepresent developments in this region are fraught with therisk of large-scale military activities in Europe.The unresolved conflicts within the post-Sovietterritories are still acute.From this lofty rostrum I should like once again toemphasize the unequivocal renunciation by Belarus offorce to solve existing problems and the need to searchfor ways to settle conflicts peacefully by political means.This leads me to the conviction for the necessity offurther strengthening cooperation between the UnitedNations and European regional and subregionalorganizations and agreements  especially the Organizationon Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Belarusstands for the broadening of interaction between theUnited Nations and the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS) not only in the sphere of conflict settlementon the territory of the former Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics (USSR)  but also in the fields of disarmament protection of the environment and the eradication ofterrorism and organized crime.Against a background of heightened confrontation insome regions of the world  one cannot but rejoice atsignificant achievements in the consolidation ofinternational security. We welcome the adoption by the1995 Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of the historicdecision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty. Belarushas been and remains a supporter of the strengthening ofthe non-proliferation regime. That is why our country having clearly determined its position at an early stage became a sponsor of that draft decision.At the same time  it is necessary to remember thatthe decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty wasadopted as a package. It envisions the strengthening ofcontrol over the implementation of its provisions and therealization of the approved principles and aims of nuclearnon-proliferation and disarmament. It is a duty of thenuclear-weapon States to confirm in practice theiradherence to their obligations. The most important criteriaof such adherence  in our view  are further progresstowards nuclear disarmament  a comprehensive ban onnuclear tests and the inclusion of positive and negativesecurity assurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States inan instrument of international law of binding character.Belarus confirms its non-nuclear-weapon status and isdetermined to implement the provisions of the Agreementon the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory infull and on time.I am pleased to inform delegations that at thebeginning of this year the Belarusian Parliament ratifiedthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons7and on their Destruction. We call upon all signatorycountries to the Convention to ratify it as soon as possible and we again declare our support for the comprehensiveban on chemical weapons.Belarus has always believed that  next to nucleardisarmament  the limitation of conventional weapons is ofenormous importance for the consolidation of internationalpeace and security. In this connection  I should like totouch upon the problems concerning the fulfilment of ourobligations under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forcesin Europe.Having assumed obligations under a Treaty in whoseelaboration it did not participate  Belarus has been guidedby the wish to assist in the consolidation of European andinternational security. From the very first days of theimplementation of the Treaty we spent a considerableamount of resources on its implementation and on thecreation of appropriate structures and industrial capacitiesfor the elimination of huge stockpiles of armaments andequipment produced not for Belarus  but for the then super-Power  the Soviet Union. But as time passed it has becomeclear that for the young Belarusian State the elimination ofthose weapons was a burden beyond its strength. Therefore we appealed to our Western European partners forassistance.For a long time our appeals were unanswered  whichled us to suspend the elimination process temporarily. Thatdecision was made due to a lack of financial resources  andhad nothing to do with issues of global and regional policy.I am glad to say today that an understanding of ourproblems has recently begun to emerge. Our reaction hasbeen immediate and fully adequate. As is known  thePresident of Belarus has declared that our country isresuming the elimination of conventional weapons inaccordance with its obligations under the Treaty.I would also like to point out that  by specialPresidential Decree  Belarus has declared a moratorium onthe export of anti-personnel land-mines for the period fromSeptember 1995 until the end of 1997.Our Republic attaches paramount importance to thedevelopment of international cooperation in the economic social and environmental spheres in the interests of thesustainable development of all countries. In this context  weattribute special significance to the series of world forumsheld under the auspices of the United Nations in Rio deJaneiro  Vienna  Cairo  Copenhagen and Beijing to considerproblems in such spheres as those of the environment social issues  population and human rights  and to searchfor ways to solve them. It is important that the decisionsand recommendations of these forums be duly taken intoaccount and efficiently utilized in elaborating “An Agendafor Development”  which is to determine the avenues andthe programme of human development for years to come.We stand for the inclusion in this document ofsubstantive issues related to economies in transition  anotion which would fully reflect present realities. Belarustakes a profound interest in supporting United Nationssystem-wide activities to promote the integration of thesecountries into the world economy. We are sure that  intoday’s world  such an integration is advantageous to alland in the interests of all.In this connection  I should like once again to recallthe Belarusian proposal — supported by the Commissionon Sustainable Development at its third session andapproved by a decision of the Economic and SocialCouncil at its substantive session — to convene in 1997an international conference on the sustainabledevelopment of countries with economies in transition.This proposal  once realized  would be an importantcontribution to the preparation of the special session ofthe General Assembly in 1997 to review theimplementation of the agenda for the twenty-first century.Belarus places ardent hopes in cooperation and interactionto implement this initiative  first of all with the EuropeanUnion  the European Commission  the European Bank forReconstruction and Development and other Europeanregional and subregional organizations  as well as withinterested partners. We also hope that the United NationsDevelopment Programme and the Economic Commissionfor Europe will provide their competent assistance inpreparing and convening the conference.One of the most important directions of the activitiesof the reformed Organization is  in our opinion  thedevelopment of economic dialogue within the frameworkof the United Nations aimed at the exchange ofexperience  the strengthening of the multilateral tradesystem and facilitating non-discriminatory access to worldmarkets. In this connection  we consider that the speedygranting of membership in the World Trade Organizationto our country would testify to a fair attitude towards afounding Member of the United Nations with an economyin transition.One cannot but note that  in countries witheconomies in transition  the effectiveness of tackling8social problems is directly linked with the fate ofdemocratic reforms. The new economic and politicalconditions in which these countries find themselves requirelarge-scale economic transformations and the socialadaptation of all population groups. Without effectiveinternational support  the achievement of this goal would bedelayed for an indefinite period. It is for this reason thatBelarus is interested in continuing all programmes initiatedby the Organization in the social sphere.The promotion of universal respect for  and theprotection of  human rights and fundamental freedoms isone of the goals stipulated in the United Nations Charter aswell as an important component of international security. Atthis jubilee session  it is appropriate to note that significantsuccess has been attained in this field since the inception ofthe Organization half a century ago. The undisputedachievement of the international community is the adoptionof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action  theconsistent implementation of which will be conducive tosecuring universal respect for justice  the supremacy of lawand human rights. Unfortunately  the path to fullimplementation of human rights is strewn with manyobstacles which  in our opinion  are raised by imperfectsocial relations rather than by a lack of will to exercisethese rights.We are convinced that it is high time today to thinkof  and act for  the benefit of tomorrow not only bystrengthening in every possible way the mechanisms ofprotection of human rights  but by taking concrete measuresto study and expand the list of fundamental universal andcategorical human rights.For more than nine years now  the Belarusians havebeen living under the conditions of an ecological disaster —that of the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant catastrophe. TheRepublic spends annually more than 20 per cent of itsnational budget to mitigate the economic  ecological andmedical after-effects of the Chernobyl accident. But mosthorrible is what is happening to the health and psyche ofthe people. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children hasincreased manifold. The birth rate has fallen 50 per centsince the period preceding the accident. Genetic diseasesare conspicuously on the rise in the most contaminatedareas. As time goes by  it becomes more and more evidentthat the Chernobyl catastrophe has infringed the mostsacred of human rights — the right to life.We are glad to note the important catalysing roleplayed by the General Assembly and its specializedagencies in drawing the attention of the donor countries andof the international organizations to the Chernobylproblems. As the day of the catastrophe recedes into thepast  the nature of the after-effects of Chernobyl alsochanges  requiring a strengthened role on the part of theUnited Nations in the development of Chernobyl-relatedbilateral cooperation. On its part  Belarus is ready to signbilateral memoranda on Chernobyl cooperation with theWorld Health Organization  the International AtomicEnergy Agency  the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  theUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization andother agencies of the United Nations system.In March 1996  an international conference will beconvened in Minsk  with the active participation ofUNESCO and the European Commission  tocommemorate the lamentable tenth anniversary of theChernobyl accident. We express our hope that thisrepresentative forum will help to step up joint efforts tostudy the after-effects of the radioactive fallout and makemore effective the efforts aimed at mitigating the fatalconsequences of the catastrophe  on the basis of theexperience accumulated by Belarus.Finally  the manifold and unfair increase in theBelarus rate of assessments to the United Nations regularbudget and to peace-keeping operations — caused by thefact that Belarus  along with the economically mostadvanced countries  was related to group B — hasresulted in the rapid growth of our arrears.We note with deep satisfaction the special decisionto relocate the Republic of Belarus to group C for theapportionment of peace-keeping expenses which wastaken during the resumed forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly. On behalf of the Government ofBelarus  I would like to express our sincere gratitude tothe delegations of all countries that displayed a spirit ofunderstanding and cooperation during the consideration ofthis issue. I address my special words of gratitude to theGovernment of Portugal  whose consent voluntarily torelocate to group B opened the way for the adoption ofthe aforementioned decision. I am confident that suchactions are an important contribution to the governance ofprinciples of justice in the work of the Organization which in itself is very significant on the eve of its goldenjubilee. For its part  the Government of Belarus  in spiteof the utmost economic difficulties  fully aware of thedepth of the United Nations financial crisis and sincerelystriving to fulfil its financial obligations to theOrganization  has decided to transfer about $2 milliondollars to the United Nations budget.9In his fifties  a person is no longer at the peak of hisphysical capacities  but acquires considerable lifeexperience and wisdom. I would like to express a wish thatthe United Nations  once its 50-year threshold has beencrossed  will remain full of strength and health andunsurpassed in wisdom in all its deeds."

We also at thisjuncture  then  express our thanks to the President’spredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  and thosewhose job it has been to supervise and implement thepreparatory effort.If this is a year of celebration  it is also a year ofreckoning. Inevitably  the jubilee has concentrated attentionas never before on our Organization. Can we withstand thescrutiny we provoke? Is our record one that  on balance vindicates the vision of the founders? And in a world thatis almost unrecognizably transformed since 1945  are weequipped for the changing role the United Nations mustnow play?Well over 100 States have come into being since1945. The myriad issues that now dominate the globalagenda are attended by a host of problems. The duties andburdens of the United Nations system have thereforeproliferated hugely. Can the United Nations cope? And arewe  the Member States  prepared to invest our enterprisewith the resources necessary to deal with the new realities.These  it seems  are the questions most urgently inneed of answers.In thinking of the future  though  we would do well tolook at the past. And I would wish briefly now to examineour historical record  highlighting some issues of specialrelevance to small countries such as Belize.Just four days ago  Belize celebrated the fourteenthanniversary of its independence. It was an independencelong delayed by the territorial claim of a neighbouringcountry. But it the end it was an independence madepossible in no small measure by this Organization and itsrole in world affairs.One of the things that in the first place made ouraspiration for sovereignty realistic  was the seminal 1960General Assembly Declaration on the Granting ofIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. And theUnited Nations thereafter became our guiding star as westeered our course between the Scylla of the historicalcolonialism from which we were escaping and theCharybdis of the recolonization that was inherent in theterritorial claim.During the years of our independent existence  thisOrganization has similarly continued to be a bedrock ofour viability. The principles enshrined in the Charter  andthe international legal order derived from those principles have been a welcome guarantee of our sovereignty. Theterritorial claim has not gone away. But the normsimposed by the United Nations  especially those requiringpacific settlement of disputes among Member States  haveat least helped to keep it from confounding our integrity.Who can doubt that  in one form or another  thissalutary experience of Belize with the United Nations hasbeen replicated by any number of small countries?Because of the multiplication of new States  especiallysince 1960  the international order has been characterizedby an unprecedented differentiation in underlying powercapabilities between the huge and the tiny. Very weakStates can  of course  never seriously hope to influenceinternational behaviour solely through the use of theirnational power capabilities. What the United Nations hasdone for us  then  has been to offer a plenitude ofsustenance via its many entities and constituent groupings.In effect  the set of opportunities created by the characterof post-Second-World-War international organizations thathave been the United Nations and its progeny has madesovereign equality a very real concept  powerasymmetries notwithstanding.For small States  certainly  the political anddiplomatic vitality of the United Nations system is amatter of undeniable fact. Nevertheless  the UnitedNations should continue to enhance cooperation withregional organizations  as it did last session when thisAssembly resolved to institutionalize cooperation with theCaribbean Community. Belize was honoured to introducethat resolution.Likewise  the principle of inclusiveness should beemployed to ensure that States in the various regions ofthe world  including Asia and the Pacific  are notconfined to incomplete participation in the internationalorder.22I turn now to the economic sphere. The record of ourOrganization is  I am afraid  rather less compelling. It istrue that various organs of the United Nations system —the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization (UNIDO)  the Economic Commission forLatin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)  the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) — haveprovided small States with an unprecedented forum for thearticulation of our concerns. Even now  Belize prepares toassume its elected seat on the Executive Board of theUnited Nations Development Programme. But continuinglarge disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world the unemployment  the persistent poverty  speak volumes asto the absence of sufficient progress on this front.Since the last general debate  the World TradeOrganization has come into being. In the Americas  theHemispheric Summit is now a matter of record. But wenote with regret that  even as liberalization advances  thecall of the disadvantaged for special and differentialtreatment goes unheeded. This is accompanied by thecontinuing volatility of the international trading andfinancial systems  and the well-known vulnerability of smallcountries to external shocks.For us in Belize  negative economic trends among ourmajor trading partners have had a baneful effect. This  inturn  has served to heighten our concern over the nature andpace of globalization. The structural changes that fragileeconomies need to make in order to be in step threaten toswamp us. But no one seems to be paying attention.Perhaps new forms of regionalism are the answer. Onearguable example is the new Association of CaribbeanStates  which will create the world’s fourth or fifth largestmarket area and of which Belize is the geographical centreand the cultural bridge.Yet it is essential  we contend  that the internationalcommunity exhibit full sensitivity to the condition ofsmallness. We remain highly susceptible to changes in theglobal marketplace; and adverse developments then imposeadditional setbacks on us in the areas of competitiveness development finance and overall fragility. For Belize  therecent crisis in neighbouring Mexico  starkly dramatized ourown precariousness.Generally  we think  the impact of the events inMexico on the markets and economies of other countriesserves as a clear warning. It is foolhardy to believe thatinflexible social and economic formulas can be applieduniformly to our differing circumstances. Heedlessadjustment and implacable time-tables might wellcondemn small economies to extinction.Indeed  many of our small countries have alreadymade strenuous efforts at stabilization and reform. Wehave liberalized trade  reduced fiscal deficits andprivatized State enterprises. But where are the rewards?We continue to be overcome by debt  by poverty and bywoefully inadequate social and physical infrastructures.And our difficulties are exacerbated rather than solved bythe austerities that reduce government spending andcurtail our public sector investment programmes.Time is not on our side  as economic and fiscalorthodoxy bear inexorably down on us. Our constituenciescontinue to press us: Where is the understanding of ourplight? Why is there is no capital inflow revival? What isto be done about the alarmingly high rate ofunemployment? When will we see the specialmechanisms to assist us with retraining  the moulding ofnew technologies  and the critically needed humanresources development? Can we ever seriously hope forthe dedicated financial resources that must underpin anyserious effort at diversification?We are being told that this liberalization advance —this march of the martinets — is the panacea for our ills but the evidence to the contrary is quite startling. For ourdomestic producers  for our banana farmers  it is a bitterjoke. Global free trade  it seems to many of us  is like theHoly Roman Empire: not holy  not Roman  not anempire.The Bretton Woods institutions certainly need todemonstrate more creativity. Their too-rigid reliance onthe prevailing orthodoxy is choking us. Democracy insmall countries will not be worth a fig if this auto-da-fé-type insistence on these articles of faith is not leavenedby a real appreciation of our peculiar needs.It is in this context that we also call for thisOrganization to promote true global cooperation in effortstowards sustainable development. This shared quest mustbe the essence of the economic relations and thedevelopment dialogue between the North and the Southand among the developing countries themselves. MyGovernment certainly pledges full support for the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) Unit onSouth-South Cooperation  well exemplified by the RutaMaya tourism project of our Central America. We also23call for support for strengthening the Alliance for theSustainable Development of Central America  a majorinitiative for developing what we call our delicate filigreeisthmus. And we welcome such relationships as Belize’srecently concluded joint implementation pilot programmeunder the Climate Change Convention.The overarching goal of our precursors was“to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar”.Well  how have we been doing on that score?In the sphere of peace and security  some gravedevelopments have taken place in various parts of theworld. In several places genocidal impulses have been letloose  with predictably devastating results. Paradoxicallyenough  the end of the cold war has resulted in an upsurgeof civil and territorial strife. Fratricidal conflicts have beenlaunched to the drumbeat of overblown notions of historyand dangerous concepts of ethnicity. For all the Assembly’sefforts  we continue to experience a relative stalemate inCyprus and elsewhere. The Balkan conundrum still seemsintractable  though we note with encouragement that thisOrganization has recognized that there is a limit beyondwhich forbearance ceases to be a virtue. Rwanda refuses togo away.Yet we hail now the breakthrough in Palestine  and weagain rejoice at the continuation of peace and stability inSouth Africa. In Namibia  Mozambique and Angola  theUnited Nations has assisted  or is assisting  in bringing civilwars to an end.In my own part of the world  the continuing UnitedNations partnership with the people of Haiti is consolidatingreconstruction and democracy in that Caribbean country.Despite the limitations on our resources  Belize is happynow to be able to play a commanding role in the CaribbeanCommunity and Common Market (CARICOM) sub-unit ofthe United Nations Mission in Haiti.Likewise  the United Nations Observer Mission in ElSalvador is successfully overseeing efforts to cement thenewly minted peace. In Guatemala  the dialogue betweenthe URNG and the Government  begun under the auspicesof our Secretary-General  is proceeding apace.My Government takes great satisfaction in the calmthat reigns almost universally on our continent  fromHispaniola to Tierra del Fuego. The disappearance ofauthoritarian Governments in Latin America and theresolution of most of our internal conflicts is bringingliberty and democracy to all our peoples. Our efforts cantherefore be committed fully now to the business offostering economic and social development  human rightsand the protection of the environment. As the first-everDefence Ministerial Meeting of the Americas confirmed our militaries are fully cognizant of the new role theymust play in supporting this process.We therefore applaud the strong and clear views onnuclear sanity expressed during the Conference on theextension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)and currently being reiterated. This delegation reaffirmsits own view that the parties to the NPT have nowinvested in the nuclear Powers a trusteeship that thosePowers must zealously discharge.At the same time  we must be equally aware of theother danger: the continued production  trade and use ofall types of so-called conventional weapons that harm maim and kill.In the context of more general concerns  we cannotescape the overdue obligation to rationalize also thestructure of the Security Council  so that the veto istamed and equity and democratization take centre stage.We continue to insist that all regions obtain balanced andequal representation as permanent members; smallcountries be brought into the Council’s decision- making;and consideration be given to such devices as multipartiteseats or constituency groupings.One final word on the question of peace andsecurity. The Secretary-General has stressed the multitudeof new demands for peace-keeping made upon theOrganization as conflicts erupt around the world. Thecaution has been expressed that the increased burdens inthis regard should not displace the attention that economicand social questions demand. Of course  the two areinterrelated. It is a truism that there can be nodevelopment without peace. We would content ourselves then  with merely urging that we put in place a morecoordinated system to embrace peace-keeping and conflictresolution as well as human rights and social andeconomic development.Also  the non-traditional threats to peace and securitymust be addressed. In recent years we have witnessedgrowing links among organized crime  drug trafficking terrorism and the spread of armaments. The dangers fromthis phenomenon are all the more insidious for being24novel. We must therefore quickly develop the internationalcooperation measures to deal with it.So  as this Organization completes its fiftieth year  wein Belize are well convinced of its continuing vitality. Thejeremiads of those that bemoan its failures are not for us.While we are not going to be Pollyannaish about what isadmittedly a mixed record  we see enough to be sanguineabout.There is extraordinary cooperation on the part ofStates  other political entities and non-governmentalorganizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concernof the United Nations organs; in the burgeoning multidimensional sphere of sustainable development; in theterritory where humane concerns and values  social orderingand cultural norms coalesce; and in the field ofpeace-keeping  of providing States and peoples withsecurity from violence and disorder.Of course there is still a long way to go. And we willnever truly realize the vision of the founders unlessMember States agree to provide the future United Nationssystem with adequate  reliable and predictable resources.Let us therefore  during this our half-century session determine to enhance our effectiveness. Let us rationalize let us economize. Let us pay our dues in full and on time.And let us intensify the quest for agreement on autonomousfinancing for the Organization and for related activities.Above all  let us dedicate ourselves to universality andpledge to enlarge our image and re-energize the world. Forthat day may still be greatly postponed when ourresolutions and decisions  rather than blood and iron  willsummarily determine the great international questions.But in continuing efforts at global conflict avoidance we are still  if the Assembly will forgive the colloquialism the only game in town. In other words  true internationalpeace and security can only ever come by way of theUnited Nations  which remains the last  best hope formankind."
"23",913,"BOL",50,1995,"Allow me to convey to the President of theGeneral Assembly the congratulations of the Governmentand people of Bolivia upon his election to the presidency ofthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. He can beassured that my delegation will cooperate with him toensure the full success of this important session.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theentry into force of the United Nations Charter affords afresh opportunity for critical and renewed reflection on thescope  difficulties and role of the multilateral system.During the year 1995 important meetings of universalscope have taken place  such as the World Summit onSocial Development  the Fourth World Conference onWomen  and the Review and Extension Conference on theTreaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Thosemeetings  together with others of a bilateral  subregional orregional character — notably the Hemispheric Summit inMiami — show that the principles which presided over thecreation of the United Nations are still very much alive  anddemonstrate the need to make significant further headwayin promoting peace  human rights  democracy  andeconomic and social development.Meetings at the highest level of the world’s politicalleaders and their representatives  ready to assumeundertakings on issues of such significance  are indicativeof a strong political will and reveal an interest in findingconcrete collective responses to the problems of our time.As a result of those Conferences  the worldcommunity has at hand new approaches that enrich andstrengthen prior agreements as it seeks to cope successfullywith contemporary challenges. For example  socialdevelopment and recognition of the due role of women insociety have ceased to be mere promises; they arebecoming definite realities before the end of this century.The International Decade of the World’s IndigenousPeople will make it possible for priority attention to begiven to that important sector of the community.The end of the cold war has not released the materialand human resources that were committed to that contest.Nor has it freed our minds of concern over war anddestruction. There persist negative situations andprejudices  which were born during that period when theworld was divided into antagonistic blocs  and which nolonger have any justification.The long-awaited peace dividend has not beenforthcoming; on the contrary  we see a proliferation ofconflicts in many parts of the world. Many of thesesituations are due to still unresolved social and nationalproblems  to a backlog of injustices and long-standingresentments  to geopolitical and economic interests which from within and from outside  have exacerbatedconfrontation for decades  and  above all  toGovernments’ difficulties in defining an effective form ofcooperation for the peaceful solution of problems.In this context  we reiterate our support for theprinciples and the renewed objectives of the Movement ofNon-Aligned Countries  whose chairmanship is shortly tobe assumed by the sister republic of Colombia.We feel a sense of solidarity with the peoples of theformer Yugoslavia  who are enduring the torment of anunjustifiable war. We also express our solidarity with themillions of human beings affected by military conflict unilateral blockades  hindrances to free contact with theoutside world  and by having been uprooted from theirlands.We reiterate what the Heads of State or Governmentof the Rio Group stated at their recent summit meeting inQuito:“We express our concern over attempts toenforce domestic laws beyond territorial boundariesin violation of international law and the fundamentalprinciples governing coexistence in the region. Suchactions violate the sovereignty of other States andare contrary to unanimously adopted transparenttrade practices”. (A/50/425  annex  para. 13)Bolivia expresses its condemnation of graveviolations of international law  war crimes  violations ofthe fundamental rules of coexistence  manifestations ofracism  and other offenses against humanity  all of whichshould be vigorously condemned. The work of the UnitedNations in this field has been important  but it needs to befurther refined. In that work  the role of regional andsubregional organizations for cooperation andcoordination is essential and should gain greaterimportance in years to come. These organizations include26the Organization of American States  the Rio Group and thevarious regional and subregional instruments of economicintegration  to which my Government lends its full support.We rejoice that Haiti and other countries have madefirm strides towards peace and democratic governance.Likewise  Bolivia notes with particular interest  andcommends  the peace process in the Middle East  whoseadvances in the face of difficulties give us cause to beoptimistic and to hope for reconciliation through thefashioning of innovative solutions with a distinctive explicitpolitical content. The agreement signed yesterday betweenIsrael and Palestine is an example of determination andvision of historic proportions.Bolivia has expressed its rejection of the resumptionof nuclear tests  which jeopardize negotiations towards thespeedy adoption of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.We condemn terrorism and organized crime  whosescope and reach cut across national boundaries and whichthus threatens security and constitutional stabilityeverywhere. Bolivia has signed several bilateral treatiesintended to advance international cooperation on legalmatters within a framework of strict respect for sovereignty but at the same time closing off avenues to impunity forinternational crime.As our awareness of the rights and duties ofmultilateral interdependence grows  cooperation inachieving the inherent right to development of all theworld’s peoples should come to the fore.In the new international situation  Bolivia supportsinitiatives aimed at strengthening the United Nations andshares the conviction that it is necessary to carry out majorreforms in its structure and functioning. Bolivia believes itessential as a first step in that direction to strengthen theGeneral Assembly as the principal organ providing foreffective participation by all countries.My Government supports initiatives aimed atexpanding the Security Council  in both its permanent andits non-permanent membership. Such an expansion shouldreflect the diversity of the world’s regions and enable allStates to participate effectively and responsibly in thecommitment to guarantee peace  security and the timelysettlement of conflicts  in a transparent manner and inkeeping with the interests of the international community not only in the narrow framework of the individual interestsof States.I also highlight the importance we attach to theUnited Nations in the area of international cooperation especially in the economic sphere and on matters of socialand technological development  and the urgency ofrestoring to the Economic and Social Council the highstature it originally possessed.The principles of justice and international law mustbe our main guiding light in seeking solutions to theproblems we face.With regard to Bolivia’s maritime question  whichwe have brought before international forums  I wish todeclare to this Assembly the political will of myGovernment to embark upon negotiations that areconsonant with our historic responsibility  that serve therights and interests of all parties involved  and that ensurea sovereign Bolivian presence on the Pacific Ocean.Bolivia has to contend with the consequences of the land-locked position imposed upon it  the economic  politicaland moral effects of which demand a solution in theframework of international solidarity  justice  equity andlaw.Just as countries call for international justice  we areobliged also to apply that principle within our ownsocieties. That is the golden rule of the Administration ofPresident Gonzalo Sánchez de Losada. Our message isone of change. Never before in the history of our republichave such profound and rapid structural changes beendemocratically and peacefully carried out as those thatbegan in Bolivia in August 1993.First  we are implementing the law on the people’sparticipation  which is integrating civil society into thepolitical system. Traditionally disadvantaged populationsnow have in their hands the ability to diagnose theirproblems and to prescribe public policy  especiallyregarding self-help to meet their own needs. This isessentially a policy of redistribution  which enables alarge part of the nation fully to assume their status ascitizens.Secondly  the foregoing requires training the peopleso that they will be able to meet internal and externalchallenges. To that end  another reform undertaken byPresident Gonzálo Sánchez de Lozada’s administration iseducational reform  viewed specifically in the light ofBolivia’s ethnic and cultural diversity and with the aim ofinstitutionalizing bilingual and multicultural education.27Thirdly  I am pleased to inform this Assembly thatcapital investment in Bolivia’s main public enterprises ismoving forward successfully and strongly. We aretransforming the largest productive and service units of thecountry to enable them to double their capital in the spaceof a few months  modernize their management inaccordance with the requirements of international life  andsecure a series of real benefits for the Bolivian population making possible individual investment by citizens of 50 percent of the share capital.Such initiatives represent an effort to make Boliviaequal to contemporary demands  especially those resultingfrom the international economy  which is characterized bygreat dynamism  innovation and competitiveness.International economic cooperation is indispensableand should enjoy the firm political backing of developedcountries and international financial institutions. For thatreason my country expresses concern about the decliningand negative trends of some sources of cooperation andfinancing. This situation is especially disturbing when seenin the light of the fact that Bolivia has to contend in itsterritory with a universal problem — namely  illicit drugtrafficking.It is paradoxical — to say the least — to urge anincrease in Bolivia’s contribution and in Bolivia’s tasks inthat common struggle precisely at a time when cooperationresources are decreasing. The task at hand is simultaneouslyto fulfil the commitments in the struggle against drugtrafficking and to prepare to embark on genuine sustainabledevelopment  especially in the rural sector  where the mostacute poverty exists.Given the magnitude of the tasks falling to Bolivia inthis matter  strong backing from the internationalcommunity is needed for Bolivia’s national strategy inregard to interdiction  prevention  the eradication of surpluscrops  and alternative development. That contribution isessential to Bolivia’s effort to cease being a link in thedrug-trafficking chain and  at the same time  ensurepolitical and economic stability and promote developmentof the country’s productive apparatus.With a view to consolidating the vision of sharedresponsibility with regard to the problem of drug-trafficking  the nations of the Americas support the holdingof a world conference to take stock of the situation and thestate of international cooperation in the struggle againstdemand for and production  sale  trafficking and illicitdistribution of narcotics. In that context  Bolivia activelyadvocates the holding in 1977 of a second internationalconference against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking under the aegis of the United Nations.Before concluding  I must refer to the topic ofsustainable development.We must stimulate vigorous and sustained economicgrowth  with social equity  in conditions that protect andmake efficient use of natural resources and ensure rationaldistribution of the fruits of that growth. Henceforth  wemust adopt a mode of development that is nurtured bytechnological advances designed to curb the waste andpollution that have characterized industrialized societies.Accordingly  it is with special satisfaction that Iannounce to this Assembly that in the latter half of nextyear Bolivia will have the privilege of hosting  in the cityof Santa Cruz de la Sierra  the American HemisphericSummit on Sustainable Development. We hope that theideas and proposals that emerge from that importantmeeting will contribute to the development of ourcountries and to better preservation of the environment inthis part of the world."
"24",960,"BRA",50,1995,"It gives megreat pleasure to make use of our common language tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election. We are honouredto see a Portuguese statesman  a friend of Brazil  and arepresentative of our commonwealth of Portuguese-speaking countries presiding over this session of theGeneral Assembly  a session that is bound to become amilestone in the history of the United Nations. MyGovernment is confident that  under your skilledguidance  our deliberations will forge the kind ofunderstanding and commitment capable of asserting thecredibility and pre-eminence of our Organization in worldaffairs.Let me also express our heartfelt appreciation toanother friend of Brazil  Minister Amara Essy of Côted’Ivoire  for his outstanding work at the helm of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.(spoke in English)I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and the Secretariat for theircontinued dedication to the United Nations and for theirrelentless work in carrying out their duties to theinternational community.In opening this debate today  Brazil wishes to renewits unwavering commitment to the principles and purposesembodied in the Charter of the United Nations. Theseprinciples and purposes set a mandate for peace anddevelopment  and are as relevant today as they were 50years ago. They coincide entirely with the aspirations ofBrazilian society. Our Constitution reflects them as thesupreme values of our political and social life indemocracy.I am proud to address the Assembly as therepresentative of a country that has widened itscommitments to democracy and human rights  tosustainable development with economic stability  to peaceand disarmament — a country at peace with itself constantly striving to extend its presence in the world bystrengthening traditional partnerships and fostering newones. We expect from our partners an attitude ofcooperation commensurate with Brazil’s growingparticipation in world markets and with its contribution tointernational peace and security.Democracy in Brazil continues to show extraordinaryvitality under the leadership of President Fernando HenriqueCardoso. Our institutional framework is being strengthened and progress in the social sphere is generating a renewedsense of citizenship among Brazilians.While strictly enforcing existing mechanisms President Cardoso is proposing legislation that will ensurethe full observance of human rights. Both at home andabroad  Brazil’s human rights policies are based ontransparency and full cooperation with civil society.Together with strong governmental action to tackle thecountry’s social problems  measures to promote and protecthuman rights will greatly contribute to redress the unjustdistribution of wealth that unfortunately still prevails inBrazil.Long-needed structural reforms and privatization arebeing carried out  paving the way for the consolidation ofeconomic stability and sustained economic growth.Brazil has achieved a high degree of economicopenness  thus accelerating its integration into theinternational economy and creating more favourableconditions for increased participation in international trade technology transfers and productive capital flows. Inflationhas been reduced to the lowest level in a quarter of acentury  allowing the country to pursue policies that benefitthe poor and the underprivileged.We are also engaged in a broad and dynamic processof open economic integration with our neighbours  addingeconomic substance to the political harmony that we enjoyin our region. MERCOSUR — a customs union bringingtogether Brazil  Argentina  Paraguay and Uruguay — isa highly successful political and economic reality  apartner ready for business and cooperation with allcountries and regions.Brazil has taken significant steps to furtherstrengthen its commitments to disarmament and to thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.President Cardoso publicly stated that Brazil has forgonethe development  acquisition and export of long-rangemilitary missiles. Congress is about to approve theChemical Weapons Convention  and comprehensivelegislation on export controls of dual-use technology isbeing finalized. Having decided unilaterally to abide bythe Missile Technology Control Regime’s guidelines  theBrazilian Government is currently discussing itsparticipation in the regime.Brazil’s commitment to peace and understanding wasclearly illustrated by its recent role  alongside the otherthree Guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol in bringing together two friendly nations in our region —Ecuador and Peru.Brazilian forces are actively participating in variousUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts  particularly inAngola  a country that shares with Brazil a commonheritage and is finally on the verge of healing the woundsinflicted by years of internal strife. We are also proud ofthe role played by our Government and our forces in thepeaceful transition to an elected government inMozambique.After too many years of difficulties  Brazilians haverecovered their pride. The country has entered a cycle oflong-term growth and greater long-term opportunities  anera of optimism and confidence. It is in this spirit thatBrazilian diplomacy is prepared to approach the worldand to work within the United Nations.As I reflect upon the events that have taken placeover this past year  I am tempted to say that“it was the best of times; it was the worst of times”.It has been a time for legitimate hope  but also atime of fear and horror; a time for accomplishments  butalso a time of frustration; a time for confidence in abrighter future for mankind  but also a time of regret forthe fact that peace  freedom  justice and well-being arestill unattained in many places in the world; a time inwhich risks and opportunities coexist side by side.2Current patterns in international affairs converge onthe twin concepts that inspired the revolution of the 1990s:democracy and economic freedom with social justice. Thisis the main thrust that will shape the coming century andensure liberty and prosperity for all.The very concept of power has changed. A country’ssovereignty and its capacity to satisfy the needs of itspeople depend increasingly on good social indicators political stability  economic competitiveness  and scientificand technological progress  not on military strength. It isnow widely understood that the fulfilment of national pridelies in democracy  development  trade and economic wealth rather than in the quest for hegemony or territorial gains.A new era of freedom is at hand. Countries arepeacefully seeking their place in their regions and in theworld  helping in the creation of wealth through trade andcooperation. Emerging economies have become asignificant force around the world  benefiting fromglobalization  greater economic freedom and the continuedgrowth of international trade. Economic integration has ledto stronger regional ties.Reconstruction and enhanced participation ininternational affairs are seen in many parts of the world just as others continue to prosper and grow in peace. Newor renewed partnerships have emerged in the fivecontinents.The Middle East is finally following the path ofdialogue and understanding  through a peace process thatwe firmly support and encourage. Angola and Mozambiqueare the new promises of southern Africa  furthering regionalpeace and conciliation as the South Africans have done.Latin America  and in particular the Southern Conecountries  has continued to show vitality both at thepolitical level  with democracy fully at work  and at theeconomic level  with freedom and openness leading to theresumption of growth and the expansion of trade.The United Nations has kept its role in themaintenance of international peace and security. A broaderagenda for the remainder of this century is underconsideration. Positive initiatives are under way to ensurethat the Organization is capable of more effectivelypromoting peace and development. Reform of the system isalso due to make it more responsive to the challenges thatlie ahead.The promotion of civil liberties and the quest forequal rights among women and men  minorities andmajorities  weak and strong are shaping the debate guiding action and strengthening citizenship all over theworld.These are indeed times of positive change. But evenas one celebrates these positive trends  one is painfullyaware of the manifold threats posed by the persistence ofpoverty and violence in many areas of the world. Theimages of the former Yugoslavia are living proof of pastfailures and present challenges and misperceptions. Theyremind us of how much needs to be done to fulfil thepromises embodied in the United Nations Charter.Extreme poverty and unemployment emerge asperhaps the most pervasive of the international issues affecting developed and developing countries alike corroding the social fabric while fostering extremism onthe part of individuals and engendering short-sightedsolutions on the part of governments.Terrorism  drug trafficking  organized crime xenophobia and racism  ethnic cleansing  religiousfanaticism and intolerance  and persistent violations ofbasic human rights continue to afflict millions of humanbeings. Misguided economic policies  financialspeculation and the volatility of capital flows threatenmarkets on a global scale. Emerging economies  strivingto consolidate stability and the resumption of growthwhile dealing with variables such as interest rates andcommodity prices  have become increasingly vulnerable.Disarmament continues to be an elusive goal. Thepromises heralded by the end of the cold war seem tohave vanished in a cloud of vague excuses. The so-calledpeace dividends have yet to materialize. The world istheoretically less threatening and dangerous.Competitiveness  technological capability  economicstrength and social indicators have become the standardsof national power. Yet  more positive moves indisarmament and non-proliferation have been offset byanachronistic economic practices and irresponsiblemilitary endeavours.Some countries continue to seek military strengthand strategic power. Even as commitment tonon-proliferation and support for nuclear disarmamentgain ground in Latin America  Africa and parts of Asia nuclear tests painfully remind us of the threats andhorrors that haunted the collective imagination during thecold-war years. Besides endangering the environment they3encourage the resumption of a purposeless arms race invarious parts of the world.Nuclear testing undermines efforts towardsdisarmament and jeopardizes the conclusion of acomprehensive nuclear-test ban. Instead of helping theinternational community strengthen collective securitymechanisms  certain countries persist in testing andimproving their nuclear arsenals. We deplore it.So where does the United Nations stand in the currentinternational scene? How can it deal with the conflictingand ambivalent forces operating in the world today? Wheredoes its responsibility begin and where does it end? Whatcan we do to realize the vision of our founding fathers?These are some of the questions that come to mind as weprepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization.It is certainly true that the Organization may haveseemed at times to be overwhelmed by the challengesbefore it. But it is also true that the shortcomings over thesepast 50 years would have been greater had it not been forthe United Nations  a universal conscience  an instrumentfor peace and understanding  as no other instrument hasever been  with a moral authority that the peoples of theworld have learned to recognize and support.In 1941 when the United Nations was but a distantdream overcast by war  Franklin Delano Roosevelt definedthe four freedoms upon which a true community of nationsshould be built. They were — and I find it useful to recallRoosevelt’s own inspiring words — the freedom of speechand expression; the freedom of every person to worshipGod in his own way; the freedom from want  which“translated into world terms  means economicunderstandings which will secure to every nation ahealthy peace time life for its inhabitants”;and the freedom from fear  which“translated into world terms  means a world-widereduction of armaments to such a point and in such athorough fashion that no nation will be in a positionto commit an act of physical aggression against anyneighbor”.Providing mankind with these four freedoms was thechallenge that ultimately gave birth to the United Nations.Yet  these four freedoms are still largely unattained. Theyremain an inspiration and a goal.In the past 50 years  the nations of the world haveused this podium to voice their hopes and concerns andto express their feelings about a true internationalpartnership based on peace and prosperity. The UnitedNations has undoubtedly represented a call for consensus a moral and ethic force  a promoter of political will andaction  a substitute for confrontation and dispute.The time has come for us to carefully assess theachievements and shortcomings of the United Nations inorder to set the course for the next half-century. The timehas come for us to create the conditions for the UnitedNations of the twenty-first century.In the aftermath of the Second World War the ideaof an international body such as the United Nations mayhave seemed utopian  especially in the light of the failureof the League of Nations and of the tragedies and crimesthat resulted from the pursuit of power politics  the kindof politics that led the world into war and its horrors.While avoiding utopianism  the United Nations wasdesigned to provide actual instruments of diplomaticinteraction capable of replacing power politics by ethicalvalues and of promoting conflict prevention and conflictresolution through negotiation and dialogue.With a pledge to peace and security on the one handand to development on the other  the United Nationshelped to write important chapters of contemporaryhistory  such as the building of a new pattern ofrelationship between developed and developing countries the search for development  disarmament  the protectionof human rights and human dignity  decolonization  thestruggle against apartheid and the condemnation oftyranny and oppression.In this process important organizations such as theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  and decisive forums such as the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development(UNCED)  and the several other United Nationsconferences dedicated to global issues  have played aparamount role. In these forums we have enhancedcommitments in the areas of cooperation for development the law of the sea  the rights of children  the environmentand sustainable development  human rights  population social development and the rights of women.We have certainly accomplished one part of ourdreams. So why not set our eyes on furtheraccomplishments? We look at the recent past and find the4United Nations at the centre of the most importantinternational events. Even when its action has beenconstrained by circumstances  the United Nations alwaysdisplayed moral strength. We look at the present and wesee a United Nations limited by its structure  strugglingvery hard to take advantage of its own experience to adaptto changing world realities in order to remain the foremostinternational force.And so Brazil confidently looks to the future. Peaceand development in the years to come will depend largelyon our capacity to renew and reform the United Nations. Ininstitutions  as in human beings  reassessment and reformare a sign of vitality  of maturity  of responsibility. AsBrazil has already pointed out a normative gap has openedup between some of the provisions of the Charter and therealities of today’s world.The fact is that most of the structures of the UnitedNations remain those crafted 50 years ago. Back then  theworld was entering a new phase of power politics andconfrontation that no longer applies. The membership of theUnited Nations was less than one third of what it is today.The concept of development was not at the core of aninternational agenda. Significant players in the developedand in the developing world had yet to achieve theinfluential role they have today.New realities demand innovative solutions. Greaterexpectations require stronger commitments. Nothing is moreemblematic of the need to bring the United Nations intoline with the realities of the post-cold-war world than thereform of the Security Council. As a catalyst for othermuch-needed reforms within the United Nations system reform of the Security Council is an imperative that shouldno longer be put off.In order to carry out its mandate in the field ofinternational peace and security on behalf of all MemberStates  the Security Council must have unquestionablelegitimacy. As is well known  legitimacy ultimately rests onrepresentativeness.Reform cannot entail a wholesale or indiscriminateenlargement of the Security Council  much less aninsufficient one predicated on the convenience of a limitednumber of States. Above all  it will be essential to ensurea more equitable representation of developed anddeveloping countries with both the capacity to act and aneffective presence on a global scale.The emergence of new economic powers and of anumber of developing countries with global projection hassignificantly altered the dynamics of world politics. Theseplayers have come to the forefront of the internationalscene and should be present in the core group ofpermanent members  so that the Council’s compositionbecomes more balanced and better reflects the diversity ofworld views.A qualitative increase in the number of permanentmembers of the Security Council  together with anenlargement of the non-permanent membership  wouldcorrespond to the necessity of making it moreauthoritative and efficient in carrying out its increasedresponsibilities in the post-cold-war era.Reform is not about the individual prestige of anycountry but about the prestige of the Security Councilitself. Brazil  for its part  is ready to assume itsresponsibilities in this endeavour.The same attention that is being given to improvingthe United Nations performance in the area of peace andsecurity must be given to efforts in the area ofstrengthening international cooperation for development.Poverty and unemployment both in industrialized and indeveloping nations  economic instability and misguidedeconomic policies affecting individual countries  as wellas the persistence or the rise of various forms ofprotectionism  are factors that adversely affect sustainedgrowth worldwide. These are issues that must be accordedhigh priority.Unemployment cannot be used as a pretext that willultimately lead to protectionism directed mainly againstthe developing countries. There is no use in trying toalleviate unemployment by accusing other people  bycreating new forms of disguised protectionism  by puttinga new strain on international relations. We muststrengthen the role of the World Trade Organization asthe mainstay of an open and non-discriminatorymultilateral trade system. We must promote a broadercoordination of macroeconomic policies and fosterregional economic integration  and provide better andmore effective cooperation in the areas of health sanitation  education  the administration of justice andother areas of great social impact. We must widen thedecision-making circles in order to include countrieswhose contribution to these objectives can beinstrumental.5The United Nations should be able to ensureimplementation of the commitments reached at the highestlevel at the United Nations Conference on the Environmentand Development  for much needs to be done to fulfil thepromises that were made in Rio de Janeiro regardinginternational cooperation for sustainable development. Thesame kind of follow-up should apply to the commitmentsreached at subsequent international conferences on globalissues.These are the main goals to be achieved by a reformof the United Nations institutions that directly or indirectlydeal with the issue of sustainable development. We firmlybelieve that a broad vision of reform of the United Nationsinstitutions will lead to an improved  more efficient andrevitalized Organization. For  as once stated in this veryforum by a distinguished Brazilian statesman  OswaldoAranha  who presided over the first special session of theGeneral Assembly  in 1947:“Above all  it is within our power to make the UnitedNations the sum total of justice  security and peace  orthrough our lack of wisdom to allow it to betransformed into one more sword to be wieldedblindly by force and instinct.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  First Special Session  68th plenarymeeting  pp. 3 and 4)The United Nations will stand as the greatest symbolof the twentieth century as long as it is able to keep itsvitality and effectively promote peace and development.Brazil is also committed to peace and democracy andbelieves that if all peoples of the world are free to expresstheir ideas and to build their own destinies  democracy willbe strengthened and will continue to serve the purpose ofdevelopment and social justice. Brazil is also committed to and knows that development depends on  an internationalenvironment of peace  cooperation and economic freedom.As our Heads of State and Government prepare togather in New York in October to celebrate theaccomplishments of our Organization  let us hasten tocreate the necessary conditions for them to build for thefuture with the same impetus and boldness that inspired theinternational community 50 years ago. Let us make surethat through our unfaltering commitment and our timelyaction the United Nations will emerge stronger from thefiftieth session of the General Assembly."
"25",1004,"BRB",50,1995,"It is my pleasure tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of thishistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly. TheBarbados delegation shares the confidence expressed inyour leadership  and offers our full cooperation as youpreside over the deliberations of this landmark event.I also commend your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côted’Ivoire  not only for his outstanding stewardship of theAssembly during the last year  but for the vision anddirection he has given to the ongoing work designed tofashion the United Nations of the twenty-first century.Let me also take this opportunity to extend a warmwelcome to a fellow member of small island developingStates  the Republic of Palau  whose admission to theUnited Nations took place in December 1994.Fifty years ago  the United Nations rose from theashes of a devastating world war. Understandably  theOrganization was shaped and influenced by theexperience of that war and by the coalition of Powers thatprevailed in 1945. It also grew to reflect the forcesunderpinning the post-war system of internationalrelations — a system characterized by that paralysis ofinternational political will known as the cold war.Yet  to its credit  the United Nations has fosteredremarkable progress on such vital issues asdecolonization  development and human rights  as well ason a wide array of international standards  which we havecome to take for granted. Through its extensive networkof organs and specialized agencies  the United Nationssystem has made tangible and lasting improvements in thelives of men  women and children all over the world.But that old order has come to an end  and we faceanew a world of tumultuous global change. Barbados seesthis world through the eyes of a member of the smallisland developing States — joint products ofdecolonization and the relative geopolitical stability thatthe United Nations has ensured since our independence.As a group  we have had mixed success in transformingthe legacies of colonial tutelage into genuine andsustained development for our peoples.As small and fragile members of the globalcommunity  we are constantly reminded of our owneconomic and political vulnerability. For us  what happensoutside our borders  beyond our control  whether man-made or natural  sometimes has more impact on our wayof life than anything we may do at home. One hurricanecan wipe out  in a matter of hours  an entire small islandeconomy. Only three weeks ago  Hurricane Luis wroughtsuch devastation on a number of our Caribbeanneighbours  causing major set-backs in their economicdevelopment. We extend our sincere sympathy to ourbrothers and sisters at this time of distress. Barbados iscooperating fully with others in helping to restore normallife to these Caribbean Member States.For small island States  how we recover fromdisasters such as this  and perhaps more important  howwe work towards ensuring that we make ourselves lessvulnerable: these are paramount to our survival. Clearly short-term assistance and the sympathy of theinternational community  while crucial  are not enough.Small size also means that our entire society  not justareas of it  is equally vulnerable to dislocations of theglobal economic system  including currency and6General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995commodity price fluctuations  new international tradingarrangements  and the changing fortunes of the majorindustrial economies.Notwithstanding these natural or man-madeconstraints  many small island States  including my own have achieved rising per capita incomes and improvedhuman development indicators but such indices provideonly an approximate measure of the present  based on thepast. They do not  and cannot  measure our vulnerability the resilience or lack of resilience of our economies andentire societies in the face of natural disasters and rapidglobal economic change.It is in this broad context that Barbados has given thehighest importance to the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  which my country had the honour to host last year.The Programme of Action  adopted by consensus underscores the role which the stewardship of small islandStates plays in the preservation of the global commons. Weurge international action to step up the support pledged inthe Declaration of Barbados and the Programme of Action.My delegation therefore calls for the steady implementationof the commitments and recommendations contained inGeneral Assembly resolution 49/122 of 19 December 1994.As a small vulnerable State  Barbados views someareas of the global political scene with deep concern.Following the end of the cold war  the people of the worldyearn for an era of peace and economic prosperity — butpeace  so far  has proved elusive. The outbreak of violenceand ethnic strife has reached unspeakable levels of humansuffering  taxing the capacity of the United Nations supportsystem to the limit.In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina  the largemajority of Member States looks on in agony andhelplessness at a crisis which has called into question thevery credibility of the Organization and the integrity of itspeace-keeping function. We recall words of the late SirWinston Churchill today: But Bosnia has not been theUnited Nations “finest hour”. But let us not forget that theUnited Nations is no more  no less  than the collective willof the Governments it serves.For vulnerable small States  United Nations protectionis critical. Developing countries  particularly those least ableto afford it  bring no influence to bear on major peace-keeping decisions  yet must pay their assessed share ofpeace-keeping costs  diverting scarce resources from thedevelopment effort. Barbados welcomes the encouragingsigns which have recently emerged from the peaceprocess between the parties of former Yugoslavia  andhopes that an end could be soon brought to the strife andbloodshed in this war-torn region.Barbados shares the anguish of the people in thestrife-torn countries of Africa  in particular  Rwanda Burundi  Liberia  and in similar areas of conflict aroundthe world  and hopes for early progress towards lastingpeace in those areas. At the same time  we welcome thepositive developments in the peace process in Angola andthat between Israel and Palestine. We hope that a peacefuland durable settlement to the problems elsewhere in theMiddle East may soon be reached.In Haiti  where democracy is beginning to take root Barbados is proud to have participated in the multilateralinitiatives and mission which resulted in the return ofHaiti’s democratically elected government. The return ofPresident Aristide underscores this continuing success andthis continuing process. Haiti is a prime example of avulnerable small island State receiving  at long last  thesupport and protection needed from its neighbours and theinternational community. Much still needs to be done ifHaiti’s recovery and development  long neglected in theface of political turmoil  are to be assured.We urge the international community to stay thecourse with Haiti. We know that progress will be uneven but we applaud the Government’s commitment to thedemocratic process. Haiti is a Caribbean country withwhich Barbados shares strong bonds of history andculture. The Haitian people can be assured of our supportin their struggle to nurture its fledgling democracy  andimprove the economic and social conditions of its people.Barbados applauded the decision of the UnitedNations last May when it extended indefinitely  the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Butnow the spirit of this agreement has become a casualty ofrecent events. Barbados deeply regrets the decision bysome States to resume nuclear testing  which runs counterto the spirit of the NPT and the commitment by nuclearweapons States to exercise the utmost restraint  pendingentry into force of a comprehensive nuclear-test-bantreaty. As a small island developing State and a non-nuclear-weapon State  Barbados has a vested interest inthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and thedisarmament of existing nuclear stockpiles.Barbados therefore supports the moratorium on thetesting of nuclear weapons in place  and urges nuclear7General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995Powers to heed the call by the international community torefrain from any activity that violates the spirit of theTreaty. As an island State whose people depend on the seafor a large part of their livelihood  Barbados is gravelyconcerned about the potential danger to its fragile marineecosystems. We are therefore implacably opposed to thetransshipment of nuclear materials and hazardous wastesthrough the Caribbean basin.International terrorism  transnational crime  drugtrafficking and money-laundering  are matters of graveglobal concern  particularly to a small country likeBarbados. The destabilizing threat of related cartels to thedemocratic order in small States is particularly serious.While Barbados has been put on full alert  we recognizeour limited capacity to effectively police our own borders.We deeply appreciate the bilateral assistance in this area and will continue to work closely with other regionalpartners and related international bodies to combat thisglobal cancer.The year 1995 is a special one for the United Nations.It is a year for solemn reflection on the mission andachievements of the Organization  and for new directions tomeet the challenges ahead.The world we face is characterized by increasingglobalization of production  liberalization of trade  and anexplosion of information technology. Increasingly  Statesfind themselves restricted in their capacity to control orinfluence the flow of international capital  other than byproviding hospitable conditions to attract it. Moreover  thereis an emerging consensus on the reordering of the role ofthe State in economic development  in the direct creation ofwealth and in the complementary nature of the public andprivate sectors.A significant feature of this changed world is theemergence of non-governmental organizations as a majorinfluence in domestic and international public policy.Barbados welcomes this participatory power of civilsociety  which has deepened and enriched the debate oninternational issues and helped shape the global agenda tobetter reflect the popular will.The framers of the Charter demonstrated this foresightin the Preamble  not with the words “We theGovernments”  but with the words “We the peoples”. Andas we approach the new millennium  the slow but suretriumph of peoples over institutions is becomingincreasingly evident. An appreciation and analysis of theseglobal changes is critical to a reformed United Nations if itis to meet the challenge of the twenty-first century whileremaining faithful to the original ideals of the Charter.But good governance still is  and always will be  thebest instrument for the expression of the popular will.Government is  after all  when exercised responsibly andaccountably  a profoundly moral vocation. And just asGovernments cannot  domestically  retreat from that moralfunction of fostering peace and upholding justice andliberty  neither can they do so internationally.Barbados supports the reform process. A reformedUnited Nations system should be cost-effective andefficient. The process should be orderly and informed bysolid analytical work  with decisions based on rigorousevaluation of the mandates and performance of affectedinstitutions and their relevance to the changing demandsof developing countries. In this connection  Barbadosbelieves that the abolition of the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization and the United NationsConference on Trade and Development would bepremature. Restructuring of these institutions may well bewarranted  but due process should first be served.Reform of the United Nations must not mean anabandonment of international cooperation and a retreatinto isolationism by the strong and powerful among us.The growing interdependence on which the welfare of allour people depends makes isolationism an irresponsiblefantasy. The problems that beset us — the degradation ofthe environment  the plight of the poor and thedispossessed  narco-trafficking and money-laundering human rights abuses  and  especially  ensuring the equalrights of women and children — can be solved onlythrough more intense international cooperation.Let us by all means streamline this Organization andits allied agencies. Let us make them more effective inthe delivery of programmes of direct benefit to ourpeoples. But let not calls for better management andincreased efficiency cloud any lack of resolve by themore fortunate among us to discharge their internationalresponsibilities  or hamper the Organization’s capacity tofulfil the mandates entrusted to it by Member States.The United Nations has before it a daunting task. Itmust enlarge the Security Council to better reflect therealities of membership since 1965 as well as thegeopolitical changes in the global environment. Inparticular  it must redesign its peace-keeping machineryto cope with the changing nature of conflicts in today’sworld — namely  conflicts mainly within nations  not8General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995between nations. Barbados supports the structure for suchreform contained in “An Agenda for Peace”  and salutes theSecretary-General for his distinctive leadership on thiscrucial issue.In the economic and social fields  the United Nationsmust intensify its support to the development effort ofdeveloping countries. Barbados supports the framework foran “Agenda for Development”  prepared by the Secretary-General. The United Nations now has before it acomprehensive development agenda created by thecontinuum of United Nations Conferences in New York  inRio  in Vienna  in Barbados  in Cairo  in Copenhagen andin Beijing. Barbados reaffirms the central role of women indevelopment  which is acknowledged in the respectiveProgrammes of Action of all these Conferences. Womenbring their unique perspective to the developmentprocess — and without it  the whole is impoverished.Implementation of these expanded programmes iscrucial. They must be carried out with commitment anddispatch. But even with expected improvements inefficiency  these critical tasks cannot be accomplishedunless the United Nations system is placed on a soundfinancial footing. This is why we urge early action to solvethe acute financial crisis of the Organization.All States  big and small  powerful and weak  learnthat power must be exercised responsibly. The big andstrong have a special role to play in a reformed UnitedNations  particularly in the maintenance of peace. It isunrealistic not to recognize this. But the small and weakalso have their own vital contribution to make. Both mustact responsibly and within both the letter and the spirit ofinternational law.Barbados is confident that Member States can rise tothis collective challenge. The machinery is already inplace — in particular  the Open-ended High-level WorkingGroup on the strengthening of the United Nations system.Barbados will participate fully in this historic session.It will work to revitalize and strengthen this uniqueinstitution  where humanity’s greatest hope for peace security  development and social justice resides. Together we can forge a renewed United Nations capable of fulfillingthe promise enshrined in “We the peoples”."
"26",1036,"BRN",50,1995,"Aswe will soon be commemorating half a century of UnitedNations work  may I start by presenting warm fiftieth-anniversary greetings from Brunei Darussalam to all ourfellow Members.Also  before commenting on our present situation  Iwould like to take this brief opportunity to thank twogroups of people who do not receive much publicity andwho I hope will not be overlooked in the generalcelebration.First  I think it would be most appropriate at thistime to mention those who have served this Organizationin the field as representatives of our various agencies oras part of our peace-keeping operations and specialmissions. Their work has always been at the heart ofUnited Nations efforts. It has given people throughout theworld a chance to look ahead with hope  and we wish allwho are engaged in this work much continued success.At the same time  I would like to look outside ourOrganization and thank our hosts. Here I am referring tothe people of New York and all the other cities around20the world who for 50 years have accepted the demandingresponsibility of being a United Nations venue. Theirsupport and good will have been crucial  and I would liketo say how much we appreciate this.With that  may I now turn to current business andoffer the President my congratulations on his election. I amsure he will guide us well during what we hope will be amost successful year.I would also like to thank the outgoing President  HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  for his contribution to ourwork over the past year and to convey my best wishes tothe Secretary-General and his staff.Given all the recent changes which have taken placein world affairs  our fiftieth anniversary comes at a criticalperiod. I would therefore like to offer a few thoughts on theapproach we in Brunei Darussalam would like to see theUnited Nations taking in the future.Fifty years ago  at the first session of the GeneralAssembly  President Truman’s opening address describedthe purpose of the United Nations as being“to provide the means for maintaining internationalpeace in the future”. (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  First Session  Plenary Meetings  34thmeeting  p. 682)The approach the United Nations took at that time wassuccessful. It certainly stopped great Powers from makingwar on each other in Europe. However  it also led to thecold war. This is now over  but it seems to have left behinda situation in which there is great potential for instability inthe rest of the world.Much of this  of course  is the result of the changeswhich have taken place in 50 years. The centres of powerhave moved  and the danger spots have shifted. We alldepend on each other a lot more for peace  security anddevelopment. The changes are so profound that many of usfeel they may call for an equally profound reform of thisOrganization.Brunei Darussalam is a fairly new Member  but wetend to think there is a strong case for this. We believe theUnited Nations has to adapt to change. We also hope thiscan be done soon. The future could hold some very seriousproblems  and they will require a United Nations which iswell prepared to handle them.The very worrying signs of what could lie ahead arealready quite clear. There are humanitarian problems ona vast scale. We face social and environmental issueswhich affect the whole world. There is instability in worldfinancial affairs. Trade disputes disrupt the peacefulconduct of international commerce. There is also what webelieve is the most serious concern of all: thedevelopment gap between the North and the South isgrowing wider and wider.This all means that the United Nations has anextremely challenging agenda as it starts out on the next50 years of its existence. An international situation nowexists in which it is essential that we recognize the stakeeach of us has in the welfare of all the others. We allhave to reaffirm our commitment to working very closelytogether as United Nations Members.So perhaps the most encouraging feature ofinternational affairs today is that in every part of theworld countries are trying very hard indeed to respond tothis new challenge. I also think it is fair to say thatwhatever can be done by individual countries or regionalassociation is being attempted.Having said that  however  I must add that there isone thing we cannot do: no country or regional group onits own can make the whole world stable and peaceful.For this  we rely on the United Nations. It is the onlymechanism which can deal with the basic causes ofinstability. Therefore  I would like to suggest that this isthe most important responsibility of the United Nationstoday. If it is to carry it out successfully  however  I alsosuggest that there are a number of useful lessons to belearned from recent experiences.The first of these arises from the crisis faced by theGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1991.Certainly  we are pleased to see welcome signs of hopein that country.However  I think it will be very difficult for most ofus to forget how badly United Nations personnel havebeen treated. Nor do we wish ever again to experience thefrustration we have felt over our representatives’ inabilityto implement Security Council resolutions.The Bosnian tragedy has obviously raised a greatnumber of questions. But  above all  I feel  we have beentaught one extremely important thing: if the UnitedNations is to be involved in a future situation like this  its21representatives must be given all the resources they need so that they can carry out their tasks effectively.A second lesson can be drawn  from the Middle East.We are still hopeful that the peace process there will reacha just and comprehensive conclusion. However  what hasbeen shown in Palestine is what was also evident inCambodia: peace negotiations and even peace treatiesrequire more than just formal recognition by theinternational community; practical assistance from us all isneeded if the result is to be lasting peace.The third recent lesson I see for us lies in recognizingto the full that the end of the cold war has made us awareof many other aspects of security which lie deeper than justmilitary defence.Next year  we hope that a comprehensive test bantreaty will be in effect. Among other things  it would be amost appropriate way to acknowledge the reminders wehave had this year of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But itshould also mean that everyone accepts that it isunthinkable for nuclear weapons ever to be used again. Theultimate aim now is the abolition of all such weapons. Ifthis is indeed accepted  then the idea of nuclear weapons asa deterrent cannot be logically sustained; nor can the needto continue testing such weapons.Instead  the logic of the post cold war period appliesand leads us to the more modern concept of security. Inother words  we should be doing everything we can to takeadvantage of the peace dividend and work together to solvethe great environmental  social and economic challenges weall face.There is one more lesson I believe this early post coldwar period has taught us. It is perhaps the most urgent ofall. This is that the increasing gap between the North andthe South in terms of development and the possibility ofmaking progress must be closed.The Secretary-General has suggested an importantshift in emphasis for the United Nations — from politics toglobal economic development. I think the Secretary-Generalis quite right. It is essential that the United Nations movein this direction. Peace-keeping  though much valued  is acostly  short-term response to global peace. The longer-termsolution is widespread economic development. What we doask  however  is that this be done urgently as time is not onthe side of developing nations.We naturally cannot predict what form the UnitedNations will take in the next half century of its existence.One thing  however  is beyond question  I feel: the worldis even more than ever in need of the moral force ofUnited Nations principles to guide it.May I assure you  Mr. President  that in its efforts toremain strong and effective and credible  the UnitedNations has the lasting support and commitment of theGovernment and the people of Brunei Darussalam."
"27",1078,"BTN",50,1995,"I have the honour to conveyto the President of the General Assembly  and throughhim to all representatives  the warm greetings and goodwishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King ofBhutan  for the success of the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. I offer Mr. Freitas do Amaral thefelicitations of my delegation on his election as Presidentof this historic session. His election to this high office isa tribute to him personally and to his country  Portugal which has always played an active role in the UnitedNations. My delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire for hisskilful stewardship at the forty-ninth session. Hispresidency has enhanced the esteem of the internationalcommunity for him and for Côte d’Ivoire.We also take this opportunity to welcome theRepublic of Palau into our family of nations. Itsparticipation will greatly enrich our Organization.This session is of especial significance for all of usas we celebrate the passing of 50 years since the birth ofthe United Nations. It is heartening to note that the grandand lofty vision which inspired our founding fathers stillcontinues to inspire and guide us. More than ever before we see today the evidence of the collective human will tounite against threats and obstacles to the survival andcontinued progress of mankind. The participation of nofewer than 150 Heads of State or Government in thespecial commemorative meeting later this month isglowing testimony to our abiding faith in this world body.The Intergovernmental High-level Meeting on theMid-term Global Review of the Implementation of theProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s was held in New York recently. The leastdeveloped countries as a group have not been able tomeet many of the objectives of the Programme of Actionand their overall socio-economic situation has continuedto deteriorate. Some of the factors responsible for thisdeterioration are  internally  civil strife and natural25disasters with their resulting consequences and  externally the debt problem  low levels of export and an inadequateflow of external finance. These countries have  however continued to implement wide-ranging reforms and in somecountries these efforts have shown positive results. Anumber of development partners have provided increasedsupport to the least-developed countries  for which we aretruly grateful. We believe that the least developed countrieshave the primary responsibility for their own development and with the support of the international community theyhope to alleviate the desperate plight of their peoples. TheLeast Developed Countries Division of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development deserves praise forthe excellent documentation it provided for the recentintergovernmental meeting on the least developed countries.Earlier this year  we supported the indefinite extensionof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). This was followed shortly thereafter by severalnuclear tests — in what we believe is a contravention ofthe spirit of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference ofthe NPT. We are increasingly concerned about the fate ofthe comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and our ultimategoal of eliminating all nuclear and other weapons of massdestruction.The maintenance of global peace and security stillremains the most pressing challenge for the United Nations.It has become the yardstick by which the United Nations istoday being judged. Increasingly  concerns are expressed asto whether the United Nations is able to carry out this task.The tragic situations in Somalia  Bosnia and Herzegovinaand Rwanda demonstrate the inability of the internationalcommunity to put an end to the immeasurable suffering ofthe innocent victims. Such cases raise an important issue.The number of peace-keeping missions has grownexponentially. The past year has seen 18 peace-keepingmissions involving 78 000 peace-keepers. The good newsis that the United Nations has a vital  ever-growing role toplay in keeping the peace and allowing combatants abreathing period in which to come to the negotiating table.The down side is that the peace-keeping missions are aconsiderable drain on the finances of the United Nations.Expenditures for peace-keeping operation are now morethan three times the entire budget for development. Surelydevelopment merits high priority as well.The most serious obstacles to sustainable globaldevelopment are the fast pace of population growth and theincreasing degradation of the environment. The situation isworst in the countries that are least able to bear the burdenand where there is already an appalling disequilibriumbetween people and resources. The more advancedcountries may delay their confrontation with theenvironmental crisis but unless these issues are addressedtoday  we may see the collapse of vital resources andclimatic changes in many parts of the world and newsecurity threats resulting from poverty and chaos. This isaggravated by the fact that the most significantdevelopments in the world economy are taking placeoutside the United Nations  and our Organization is beingincreasingly marginalized on economic  financial andtrade issues.It is important that the world continue to keepinvesting in people  especially women and children  andthat it meet their basic needs in education  health andsocial welfare. The historic United Nations conferences ofthis decade on children  environment  human rights population  social development and women embody theirreversible commitment of the international communityto chart a new course for the future. My country is firmlycommitted to the goals set by these conferences.I wish to acknowledge the special contribution of theUnited Nations to the development of my country. TheUnited Nations has been actively involved in every sphereof development in Bhutan  and has been responsible forhelping us set out on the right path of sustainabledevelopment. Every effort has been made on our part toensure that all assistance received has been properlyutilized and meaningful results achieved. I express theprofound gratitude of the people of Bhutan to the donorcommunity  which supports the United Nationsdevelopment activities. We have particularly benefitedfrom the activities of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Children’s Fund  theWorld Food Programme  the United Nations PopulationFund  the United Nations Capital Development Fund  theInternational Fund for Agricultural Development  theUnited Nations Volunteer Programme  the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations  the WorldHealth Organization  the International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank. They have contributed much to thewelfare of our people. We are also grateful to ourbilateral donors  particularly India  Switzerland  Japan Denmark  the Netherlands  Austria  Norway  Kuwait Germany  Australia  Thailand  and the United Kingdomfor their cooperation and support.The Working Group on the Strengthening of theUnited Nations System will once again look atstreamlining the Organization. Reform of several aspectsof the United Nations system is vital  especially as we26confront the many challenges of the twenty-first century.There must be better distribution of power within theUnited Nations. The crippling financial situation caused bylarge arrears by Member States must be overcome. It isalso time to examine the new mechanisms for meeting thefinancial requirements of the United Nations. My delegationfeels that a proper study should be made and reported tothe Assembly at an early date. In our view  the innovativeidea of a small levy on international air travel proposed bythe Foreign Minister of Australia  Senator Gareth Evans  issound and practical.We are of the considered view that the SecurityCouncil must be expanded to give greater representation todeveloping countries in order to uphold the principles ofequity and justice. Many least-developed countries likeBhutan feel they are being increasingly marginalized by thenew agendas and priorities of the United Nations. In ourview  the United Nations must represent the interests of allcountries equally  and not only those of a privileged few.We therefore support the expansion of the Security Councilto facilitate more equitable representation of developingcountries and deserving candidates that have emerged sincethe United Nations was established 50 years ago. As afellow South Asian nation  and as a member of the SouthAsian Association for Regional Cooperation  of which Indiais by far the largest member  we strongly support India’sinclusion in the permanent-member category of the SecurityCouncil. India’s candidature merits serious consideration onthe grounds of equitable geographic representation  thelarge size and enormous potential of the Indian economyand the fact that one sixth of mankind lives in India.Before I conclude  I should like to join precedingspeakers in paying tribute to the many organizations andindividuals that serve with unfailing dedication andcommitment to further the principles and purposes of theUnited Nations. I should like to pay a special tribute toMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations; to the late James Grant  former ExecutiveDirector of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) who did so much for the world’s children; to the manyBlue Helmets who have sacrificed their lives so that othersmay live in peace and security; and to the host of UnitedNations personnel and volunteers who have selflesslydedicated their lives to the service of others  sometimesserving under the most trying conditions."
"28",1119,"BWA",50,1995," I wish to extend to thePresident the sincere congratulations of my delegation onhis election to the presidency of this historic session ofthe General Assembly. Botswana and Portugal haveenjoyed the best of relations over the years. It is thereforewith great pleasure that I assure him of Botswana’ssupport and cooperation as he conducts the deliberationsof this body. Let me also take this opportunity to pay aspecial tribute to his predecessor  my dear brother andcolleague the Foreign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire  HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  for the skilful manner inwhich he guided the work of the forty-ninth session. Hiswas a most successful presidency  of which  as Africans we feel proud.We salute our indefatigable Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and his team ofdedicated staff for their selfless service to theinternational community at the most difficult and tryingperiod in the history of our Organization. The Secretary-General’s tenacity of purpose and his untiring efforts inthe search for peace are crystallized in his comprehensiveand thought-provoking report on the work of theOrganization.Five decades ago no one could have predicted withany degree of certainty the future course of events in theaftermath of the most devastating war on the face of theEarth. It was therefore a feat of wisdom and vision thatthe founding fathers of our Organization accomplishedwhen they conceived and established  from the ravages ofthat tragic war  a global Organization that has had such aprofound impact on the conduct of international relationsand diplomacy. That the Charter of the United Nationshas been amended only thrice in its 50 years of existencebears testimony to their foresight and diplomatic skill.The formation of the United Nations captured theimagination of peoples across continents  not only becauseits Charter promised to protect succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war  but also because it championedthe right of the colonial countries and peoples to self-determination and independence  at a time when that wasconsidered antagonistic to the national interests of the21colonial Powers. In addition  the Organization made acommitment“to promote social progress and better standards of lifein larger freedom”.This historic session of the General Assembly offersus a unique opportunity to evaluate the achievements andprogress made in the fulfilment of the ideals so brilliantlyand boldly expressed by the founding fathers in the Charter.It is time for introspection and reflection on the work of theOrganization and a time to institute reforms  as necessary to attune the Organization to a changed world and thechallenges ahead.It is regrettable that the military and ideological rivalrybetween East and West should have hamstrung the role ofthe United Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security during the first four and half decades ofits existence. Although the world was spared the possibledestruction that could have been visited upon it by a thirdworld war  the cold war led to the loss of many lives inregional conflicts across continents — on the KoreanPeninsula and in Cambodia  Angola  Ethiopia  Mozambique Vietnam and the Middle East  to mention only a few. Incolonial countries  and in Africa in particular  the strugglefor self-determination and national independence wasperceived through the prism of super-Power rivalry  whichperception resulted in bitter liberation wars.The past five years have  however  seen the birth of anew era  an era of hope for the United Nations characterized by general goodwill and cooperation ininternational relations. In other words  we are celebrating50 years of the existence of the United Nations in a new-found atmosphere of relative peace and stability in theworld. We should therefore commit and rededicateourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter aswe draw the road map for the Organization in the next 50years.The unity and resolve of the United Nations particularly as reflected in the facility with which  in thepost-cold-war era  the Security Council takes decisionspertaining to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  has dramatically enhanced the efficacy of theUnited Nations  a United Nations which has been freedfrom the shackles of ideological confrontation. The SecurityCouncil has indeed scored remarkable successes in themaintenance of international peace and security over thepast few years. We have witnessed successes in Cambodia Namibia  Mozambique  El Salvador and  more recently Haiti. And this very day an agreement of great import hasbeen signed in Washington  D.C.  between Israel and thePalestinians.This new atmosphere of international cooperationhas  however  not been without problems and setbacks.The tragedies of Somalia  Sierra Leone and Liberiaremain a thorn in the flesh and conscience of theinternational community. The internecine tribal wars inthe former Yugoslavia and in the Abkhaz region ofGeorgia have remained intractable  and the traumatic civilwars in Afghanistan and Tajikistan continue with totalabandon. These problems attest to the fact that all is notwell in international affairs. The United Nations mustintensify current initiatives aimed at addressing theseconflicts. The international community can never be atpeace when part of its body politic is being ravaged byconflict and war.As we approach the next millennium  theresponsibility falls on the generations that have benefitedfrom 50 years of relative peace  50 years of the UnitedNations  to prepare the ground for an even betterOrganization to serve future generations in the next 50years and beyond. We should establish a new system ofcollective security in which unilateralism and thepursuance of narrow national interests for undueadvantage should give way to multilateralism andcollective responsibility in addressing internationalproblems. Complex peace-keeping operations can succeedonly where there is multilateral cooperation and thepursuit of policies which can yield long-term results.Concerted efforts must be made to adopt consistentcriteria for the resolution of global problems.The question of equitable representation on andincrease in the membership of the Security Council hasgained currency in recent years  and for good reason. TheUnited Nations of 50 years ago was definitely differentfrom the United Nations of today. The number ofMember States has swelled over the years  bringing incountries of divergent national character and historicalbackgrounds; and membership in the Security Councilmust reflect this reality. In other words  the SecurityCouncil should be a concentrated reflection of the culturaland philosophical diversity represented in the GeneralAssembly. After all  democracy is about numbers  and theUnited Nations  including the Security Council  ought tobe the best school for the teaching and practice ofdemocratic principles.22We should exercise great care  however  in addressingthe question of the expansion and restructuring of theSecurity Council  lest we create new problems in our zealto solve old ones. We should guard against the SecurityCouncil’s remaining or becoming an exclusive club for thepursuance of the policies and strategic national interests ofthe rich and powerful nations. At the same time  we shouldavoid making the Security Council a big and unwieldyenterprise which would crumble under its own weight. Weshould strike the right balance between equitablerepresentation and efficiency and effectiveness.The report of the Secretary-General clearly shows thatpeace-keeping operations are very expensive. Over the pastfive years the budget of United Nations peace-keepingoperations has grown from an annual figure ofapproximately $600 million to a staggering projection of$3.6 billion by the end of this year. The United Nationscannot hope to sustain this kind of budgetary escalation.Greater attention must be given to preventive action.Here we agree entirely with the Secretary-General when hestates in the “Supplement to An Agenda for Peace” that“It is evidently better to prevent conflicts throughearly warning  quiet diplomacy and ... preventivedeployment”. (A/50/60/para. 26)A multifaceted approach is required to develop a capability including substantial human and material resources  thatwould enable regional organizations to detect potentialconflict situations and prevent them from breaking out.In this context  the Organization of African Unity(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Managementand Resolution was established in response to the manychallenges facing the African continent in the field ofpeace-keeping. It is an expression of Africa’s readiness totake effective measures aimed at solving conflicts withinthe continent. We welcome the support of the MemberStates  international organizations and individuals that havegenerously made resources available to the OAUMechanism  and we urge the international community tomake similar contributions.We also welcome the conclusions of a series ofconferences on conflict prevention and peace-keeping inAfrica sponsored by the British Government  the latest ofwhich was held in Gaborone  the capital of my country  on7 and 8 August 1995. Botswana is convinced that training planning and preparation  an effective early-warning systemand logistic support are fundamental to the OAU’s capacityto predict and defuse conflicts and  once they haveerupted  to undertake peace-keeping operations. Thefinancial support of the international community is crucialif the peace-keeping capability of the African countries isto be realized.The United Nations  in general  should be placed ona firm financial foundation if it is effectively to tackle themammoth tasks facing the world today  includingassistance to regional arrangements in conflict preventionand peace-keeping. The question of the financialemergency in which the United Nations so often findsitself  because of failure by Member States to honourtheir financial obligations to the Organization  should notbe allowed to fester into the next century. It seemslogical  at least to Botswana  that the decisions andresolutions which we adopt as Member States  and whichhave financial implications  should be accompanied by acommitment to make prompt and regular contributions tothe various budgets  programmes and funds of theOrganization. Otherwise there is no sense in adoptingsuch decisions and resolutions. As stated earlier  theresources needed for peace-keeping operations alone aresuch that every Member State must make its contributionif we seriously expect results from the Organization.We cannot talk about the maintenance ofinternational peace and security without reference tonuclear proliferation  because of all weapons of massdestruction  nuclear weapons pose the greatest threat tointernational peace and security. In this regard  Botswanais satisfied with the outcome of the Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The StatesParties not only agreed to extend the Treaty indefinitely but also adopted the principles and objectives for nuclearnon-proliferation and disarmament and committedthemselves to strengthening the review process for theTreaty. We were disappointed that some nuclear Powersresumed testing immediately after the conclusion of theConference.The States Parties further committed themselves tocomplete negotiations  no later than 1996  on a universal legally binding and internationally and effectivelyverifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The onusnow rests on nuclear-weapon States to honour their endof the deal. My delegation firmly believes that the onlyway to protect the world from the scourge of nuclearweapons is through their complete elimination.23The contribution made by the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies in the field of health  especially in thedeveloping countries  has been most impressive. Life-threatening diseases such as polio  tuberculosis  smallpox malaria and river blindness  to name but a few  have largelybeen eradicated in most parts of the world. The othervisible benefit of the work of the United Nations indevelopment has been the transfer of technology  especiallyto the developing countries  resulting in improvedsanitation  education  human resource development and foodproduction and storage.Currently  the United Nations is spending millions ofdollars on research and related expenditure on the AIDSpandemic  which is threatening the very existence ofhumankind and is posing a serious threat to the economicdevelopment of many nations. It is our sincere hope that theworld will quickly find a cure to save humankind from thescourge of this pandemic.We are concerned that in recent years the resourcesavailable to some specialized agencies of the UnitedNations have been declining. This has negatively affectedtheir contribution to economic development in thedeveloping countries. It is clear from the report of theSecretary-General that the core resources of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) have beendecreasing since 1992  and this has resulted in nationalindicative planning figures in developing countries beingreduced by 30 per cent from their original levels. This is anunfortunate trend indeed for developing countries considering that the UNDP is the agency of the UnitedNations charged with responsibility for the financing andcoordination of technical and development assistance. Andthe negative impact this trend has had in the execution ofdevelopment projects and programmes in the developingcountries cannot be overemphasized.It is imperative that the ongoing dialogue on thereform of the United Nations give due consideration to theimportant role that these agencies and programmes play inthe improvement in the living standards of peoples in thedeveloping countries. The reduction of the administrativecosts and the rationalization of the operations of theseorganizations should be carried out at the expense neitherof their capacity to deliver the goods and services nor ofthe quality of their product. In this regard  I wish toreaffirm the decision the African Ministers of Industry tookin Gaborone  Botswana  on 8 June 1995  in which theyappealed to the international community  particularly thedeveloped countries  to support the maintenance andstrengthening of the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization (UNIDO) to enable it to continueparticipating actively in the industrialization of Africa.The past five years have witnessed majordevelopments in the social and economic fields. Theinternational community has made great efforts inaddressing issues of international concern in these areas.In this regard  the successful holding of the WorldSummit for Children  the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  the World Conference onHuman Rights  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment and  most recently  the Fourth WorldConference on Women are illustrative. While the holdingof these conferences in itself deserves commendation  theinternational community should not be satisfied merelywith summitry. It should strive to adopt declarations andplans of action which are realistic and implementable.Above all  there should be a genuine commitment toproviding the necessary resources for the implementationof these declarations and plans of action.It is now four years since the General Assembly  inrecognition of the difficult social and economic situationprevailing in Africa  adopted the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa. At its high-level-segment meeting held in Geneva from 3 to 6 July thisyear  the Economic and Social Council concluded thatprogress in the implementation of the New Agenda hadbeen slow and insufficient  and reaffirmed that successdepended on the full support of the internationalcommunity. It is clear that while the primaryresponsibility for economic development in Africa restswith the African Governments and peoples themselves there is still an absolute need for the support of theinternational community.One of the priority areas of the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa is regionalcooperation and integration. In this connection  we insouthern Africa are engaged in efforts to ensuredevelopment through regional cooperation. The SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  after 10 yearsof rehabilitating and developing infrastructure  hasembarked on closer cooperation and integration aimed at inter alia  free movement of goods  capital  services andpeople.One of the recent major developments in thebuilding of the community was the accession of theRepublic of Mauritius to SADC at the organization’ssummit in August 1995 in Johannesburg  South Africa thereby bringing the membership of SADC to 12. We are24aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as aregion  but there is no alternative to this path of collectiveself-reliance if our region is to survive in the currentcompetitive international economic environment. Wetherefore call upon the international community to continueits support for SADC and its programme of action.To conclude  I wish to reiterate that this historicsession of the General Assembly offers us an opportunityto evaluate the achievements  review the lessons of the pastand chart a course for the future of our Organization. Animportant component of this introspection and reflection onthe work of the United Nations should be the improvementof public awareness of the United Nations  building a widerconstituency and demonstrating that the Organization willcontinue to be relevant in the years to come."
"29",1162,"CAF",50,1995,"Just last June we celebrated the fiftiethanniversary of the signing of the San Francisco Charter which to this day still governs our Organization. On thatoccasion  all Member States were able to take stock ofthe road we have travelled in 50 years of endeavouring totransform our planet Earth into one enamoured of peace freedom and justice.Not so long ago from this rostrum  throughMr. Ange-Félix Patassé  President of the Central AfricanRepublic  my country pondered the scope and significanceof the important events that are continually shaking theworld and touching the conscience of one and all.My country  at that time  looked forward to a newera of peace and security such as once existed in theGarden of Eden  and we welcomed the idea of fair andfruitful cooperation  especially for the benefit of the leastdeveloped countries such as the Central African Republic.But what do we see today?It is a tradition for the United Nations to meet in theGeneral Assembly to reflect on the way in which it16intends to assume its responsibilities in guiding the fate ofmankind  but there can be no doubt that this collectiveendeavour can only be pursued in the light of the objectiveswe have set — that is to say  international security andsustainable development. And so  this session  more thanany other  is of special importance for my country  theCentral African Republic  because our universalOrganization will need to ask itself whether it has fullyachieved its goals.I am therefore very pleased to convey to the Assemblythe best wishes of His Excellency  the President of theCentral African Republic  Ange-Félix Patassé  the Head ofState  for complete success. Together with all of the CentralAfrican people  he places deep confidence and unshakablefaith in the future of our Organization. I feel certain that thegreat personal abilities of Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral willenable us to look forward to the complete success of ourwork. To Mr. Amara Essy  the outgoing President  I wishto convey my sincere congratulations for the dynamism competence and effectiveness with which he so brilliantlyconducted the work of the last session of the GeneralAssembly  thereby doing credit to all of Africa. Allow mealso to express again my sincere congratulations to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for theoutstanding competence  constant dedication and unmatchedefficiency with which he is directing the work of ourOrganization.Since the end of the cold war  all nations have rightlylooked forward to an international environment that is moreconducive to cooperation and dialogue than to confrontationas was the case in the past. The tireless efforts of theinternational community to achieve this have been mostpraiseworthy despite the difficulties encountered in somecases in achieving peace and security  which areindispensable in the economic  social and culturaldevelopment of nations.In this regard  we should therefore  once again express thanks to the international community  which tookpart in the emergence of a true democracy in the CentralAfrican Republic  a democracy whose day-to-day practiceis acknowledged beyond its own borders. Strengthened bythat achievement  my country is practising a policy ofpreventive diplomacy and development and has justcompleted the first phase of this change  notably throughthe restoration of public confidence and establishingdemocratic institutions  re-establishing fiscal health andcontrol  health measures  training and education and by theadoption and promulgation  on 14 January 1995  of a newand truly democratic constitution. The Constitution  whichwas adopted by an overwhelming majority  introduces apolicy of decentralization  with its corollary ofregionalization aimed at involving the population in thetasks of development and at mobilizing all local resourcesfor the enhancement of the standard of living of the ruralmasses.The second phase of the programme pertains to othermajor challenges such as the regional development  theopening up of the country from its land-locked status bothinternally and externally; agriculture and livestock-breeding; the development of natural resources; andagricultural and forest management.All of these ambitious plans can be carried out onlyif there is a climate of confidence and peace in oursubregion — Central Africa. My country has fullyunderstood this and has pursued a policy of good-neighbourliness to bring about peace both within andoutside the Central African Republic. Thus  weconsistently contribute  through preventive diplomacy  toefforts to prevent international conflicts.A land-locked country whose present Government isburdened with a heavy and multifaceted legacy  theCentral African Republic is constantly searching forlogistical means to support the economic developmentefforts in order to promote an increase in production andstrengthen the fight against poverty.That is why the future programmes of structuraladjustment should necessarily include social dimensionsbecause  as has been stated by our Prime Minister  ourHead of Government  the Central African Republic cannotcreate new social outcasts  new disadvantaged classesresulting from these structural reforms  which are oftenvery restrictive.At a time when the efforts of the internationalcommunity are being speeded up in order to relaxtensions in the world  it is more specifically in the low-income and poor countries that we are increasingly seeingarmed conflicts producing massive destruction.Witness the case of Somalia where  after thewithdrawal of the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM)  the acute problem of repatriating andresettling some 500 000 refugees and 400 000 displacedpersons calls for the efforts of all of the internationalcommunity.17Witness also the case of Burundi where thesituation is of concern to my Government  which constantlyencourages that neighbouring Government to secure thepeace.However  my delegation commends the JointDeclaration of Peace signed between the President of theRepublic and the Prime Minister  which  I am sure  willmake it possible to reduce the tension and the threat tosecurity in Burundi  where problems of humanitarianassistance to refugees are becoming a source of constantconcern to all of the international community.In Rwanda  the machinery of the Organization ofAfrican Unity for the prevention  management andsettlement of conflicts will become fully operative with aview to bringing to an end the many sufferings of thepeople of Rwanda.On the one hand  my delegation encourages a returnto normal democratic life in that kindred nation and on theother the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda(UNAMIR) and the international community as a whole areurged to become even more concerned with the question ofsecurity and with the questions of refugees and displacedpersons.Along this line of thinking  my delegation highlyappreciates the farsightedness of Angola’s President Eduardo dos Santos  and of his brother  Mr. Jonas Savimbiof UNITA  who  thanks to the commendable mediation ofPresident El Hadj Omar Bongo of Gabon  agreeddefinitively to conclude peace through the Francevilleagreement.My delegation is concerned at the situation in SierraLeone  where war has been raging for four years  with greatloss of life and property.However  we welcome the positive turn of events inLiberia  where all of the armed factions have understoodthe need to lay down their weapons and to sit down aroundthe table to negotiate a peace — for this war  which haslasted all too long  will have known no victors and novanquished.The Central African Republic welcomes the fact thatour Organization has been able to affect the course of someevents that were major sources of concern to theinternational community. Despite the many situations oftension that are sometimes difficult to control  we mustwelcome the fact that in the two years preceding thisfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations we havewitnessed Africa’s complete political liberation  the endof apartheid and the gradual introduction of democracy notwithstanding isolated setbacks from time to time.We would cite in particular the Middle East  wheresignificant progress has been achieved in the peaceprocess in the region and where real  praiseworthy effortsare being made daily by the parties concerned  despiteoccasional difficulties encountered in implementing thecommitments that have been entered into.This gives me an opportunity to congratulate thepeoples of Israel and Palestine on their persistent efforts which were crowned with success by the signature  on 29September at Washington  of agreements pertaining to thesecond phase of that peace process.Congratulations should also be extended in respectof Chechnya  where the Peace Agreement recentlyconcluded between the parties will contribute toconsolidating a true and lasting peace in the region.With regard to the situation in Kashmir  we callupon our friends in India and Pakistan to come to anunderstanding and work out a negotiated solution to theproblem  in the name of justice.Turning to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina the Central African Government hails the praiseworthyefforts of France and the United States to calm troubledwaters. The international community too should exertevery effort to restore peace and security to Bosnia andHerzegovina  where ethnic  nationalistic or religioustendencies pose a dangerous threat to the tranquillity andstability of that part of Europe.No one is immune to these ancient sources ofconflict  and the Central African Republic sympathizeswith the countries and peoples enduring such tragic trials.In a few days the United Nations will celebrate itsfiftieth anniversary  without having brought into being thelong-sought new world economic order. The countries ofthe North continue to be powerful while those of theSouth continue to mark time with an official developmentassistance that has declined from 0.38 per cent in 1980 to0.33 per cent in 1993. Some donors are no longer meetingtheir commitments  so Africa continues to live through atime of poverty  natural disasters  migrations and all kindsof other misfortunes. My delegation therefore believesthat trade must be urgently liberalized through a18substantial reduction in tariffs and other trade barriers through the elimination of discriminatory treatment ininternational trade relations and by stimulating worldeconomic growth and sustainable development in theinterests of all countries  the developing countries inparticular.Indeed  the entry into force on 1 January 1995 of theAgreement establishing the World Trade Organization couldnot have been more timely  for were it to be fullyimplemented it would solve a great many of the problemsof the land-locked developing countries  the Central AfricanRepublic among them. And  as President Ange-FélixPatassé said here last year “What we need to save the continent is a realMarshall Plan  because at the present time multilateraland bilateral assistance remain insufficient to promotesustained and lasting growth.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Forty-ninth Session  PlenaryMeetings  19th meeting  p. 5)My delegation is among those that would stronglyurge the most powerful Member States to committhemselves to working towards the achievement of the goalsset forth in the Charter in order to ensure that the worlddoes not drift ineluctably towards chaos and disaster.Finally  with regard to the advancement of democracy the efforts of the United Nations will never be sufficient solong as the Republic of China on Taiwan is not admitted asa Member of this prestigious institution.As His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé  Presidentof the Central African Republic  noted in his appeal lastyear  under the Charter of the United Nations there are nolarge nations and there are no small nations  for all mustcontribute to peace and universal progress towards a just humane and democratic world.Democracy and respect for fundamental human rightshave and will have no meaning so long as the hard-workingpopulation of the Republic of China on Taiwan is notrepresented here in the Assembly. In this connection itwould be fitting to take into account the precedents thatexist with regard to the parallel representation of States inthe United Nations.We would recall the following words of the Presidentof the General Assembly at the opening meeting of thisfiftieth session of the Assembly on 19 September:“... the United Nations has ceased to be anintergovernmental organization with a limitedmembership and has become the only internationalorganization that is universal. Efforts must be madeto ensure that all States that are not yet Membersshould seek to be admitted in the near future. Forthe same reason  the most serious penalty imposedon a Member State should never be expulsion  butrather suspension  for the United Nations must  as amatter of principle  include all the world’scountries.” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings  1stmeeting  p. 7)The Government of the Central African Republicalso believes that dedication to international peace andsecurity should prohibit our engaging in any form ofintimidation or confrontation that can damagerapprochement among States or  especially  weakensecurity. This requires the highly desirable admission ofthe Republic of China to the United Nations.With regard to the restructuring of the Organizationat the end of its half century of life  the Government ofthe Central African Republic is firmly convinced that theonly remedy to the delays experienced in intervening inor contributing to the resolution of tensions or openconflicts is to be found in a decentralization of thesystem. That decentralization should begin with thedemocratic and equitable representation of Member Statesin the Security Council and at all levels. We regard thisas the only approach capable of taking proper account ofgeopolitical and economic specificities.In any event  this session should provide anopportunity to draft a new organizational chart for theUnited Nations and to adapt the Organization’s structuresand functions in the light of our stocktaking and relevantcomments by Member States.For its part  the Central African Republic reservesthe right to speak out in the debates in the Committeesand during the ceremonies commemorating the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. Whatever the case everything should contribute to make the twenty-firstcentury the century of Africa.In conclusion  the Central African Republic firmlybelieves that only respect for and observance of the spiritand letter of the Charter of the United Nations will trulyenable us to solve the problems that confront us as thiscentury draws to a close. We hope that this session will19mark a new stage on the way to effective cooperation forprogress and peace for the international community as awhole."
"30",1208,"CAN",50,1995,"It is a great honour to representCanada here today as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations during this general debate.Canada has always been among the strongestsupporters of the United Nations  not only in word butalso in deed. In 1945 we were  through Canadian PrimeMinister Mackenzie King  an original signatory of theUnited Nations Charter. Ambassador John Humphreyshelped write the 1948 United Nations UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Successive CanadianAmbassadors to the United Nations have distinguishedthemselves in the service of the Organization  as havecountless Canadian negotiators in areas ranging fromdisarmament to trade to development. In addition  LesterB. Pearson won a Nobel Peace Prize for his contributionto the success of the United Nations in establishing thefirst peace-keeping operation  in 1956.All these Canadians had a unifying purpose: topromote progress in implementing the United NationsCharter  which enshrines the commitment of the people ofthe United Nations to the advancement of humanity.Of course  there have been criticisms of theOrganization; many are legitimate and require attention.It is clear  however  that the international communityremains committed to the goals of the Charter and to theUnited Nations as the primary instrument for globalproblem solving.The United Nations deserves our continued support.If we look at the record of just the last few years  theUnited Nations has conducted successful peace-keepingoperations in Cambodia  Mozambique and Haiti. Thanksto the United Nations  in this decade alone 5 millionchildren will grow up normally  children who wouldotherwise have been paralysed by polio. This year theUnited Nations is working  as it does every year  toensure a better life for the almost 23 million refugees inthe world.Global resolve to support the United Nations and toadvance the interests of the international community hasrecently been underscored by such successes as theindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. At the Halifax Summit in June chaired by our Prime Minister  Jean Chrétien  the P-8(Political Eight) leaders reaffirmed their strongcommitment to the United Nations system of internationalinstitutions and added their ideas for revitalizing it.The central message is clear: we must take thismomentous opportunity to confirm and renew ourcommitment to the United Nations. To do so  we requirea renewed vision for the next 50 years. This vision must5be centred on not just striving for  but achieving  humansecurity on the basis of the freedom of people everywhereto live in peace and without fear  to be prosperous andenjoy equality  justice before the law and knowledge. TheMembers of the United Nations must work together now torenew the Organization and its agencies and programmesand to help make this vision a reality.In Canada’s view pursuing this vision requires a focuson three interlinked objectives: preventing conflict;responding quickly when conflict occurs; and supportingpeace-building efforts on an ongoing basis. I will addresseach objective in turn.(spoke in French)The first priority must be to help the United Nationsbetter protect people from conflict. The United Nations hashad important successes in the past few years but unfortunately  there have also been set-backs. If the UnitedNations is to adapt to a changing world  if confidence inthe Organization is to be restored  we must learn from thefailures of Bosnia  Somalia and Rwanda and build on thesuccesses of Cambodia  Namibia and El Salvador.Preventive action  as the Secretary-General has laidout so well in “An Agenda for Peace”  takes many forms from economic development programmes to mediation  tothe preventive deployment of personnel — as  for example in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia — fromthe investigation of human rights violations to theconclusion of agreements limiting the spread of weapons ofmass destruction. Prevention saves lives  forestalls untoldhuman suffering and makes the best use of limitedresources.Last year I announced at this podium that Canada wasproviding a list of Canadian experts available to the UnitedNations for preventive diplomacy missions. We are alsotaking advantage of our membership in La Francophonie in the Commonwealth and in regional organizations such asthe Organization of American States (OAS) and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) precisely in order to work towards enhancing theability of these organizations to prevent conflicts. OurPrime Minister  Jean Chrétien  is currently pressing for anexpanded Commonwealth role in democratization and goodgovernance  which are two key elements of conflictprevention. I recently convened a meeting of LaFrancophonie in Ottawa to generate recommendations forit to strengthen its role in conflict prevention  particularlyin Africa. These recommendations will be presented to theleaders  the Heads of State and Government  gathered atthe Francophone Summit to be held in Cotonou  Benin  inDecember of this year.Prevention also means deterring crimes againsthumanity. Canada strongly supports the earlyestablishment of an international criminal court  whichwill  we hope  deter such crimes in the future but  shouldthey occur  would punish the perpetrators. The recentlyapproved Platform for Action at the United NationsFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing lendsfurther impetus in this area.Our recent experiences in the former Yugoslavia andin Rwanda emphasize the link between security andhuman rights. The United Nations many human rightsmechanisms produce a wealth of information that couldhelp us identify and understand potential areas of conflict.The United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights has a role to play in enhancing the early warningfunctions of the United Nations. The experience of theHuman Rights Field Operation in Rwanda revealed theneed for the more effective coordination of UnitedNations field missions. Canada has commissioned workon the human rights components of field operations andon stand-by arrangements for them. This work will yieldrecommendations on ways to integrate human rights intoUnited Nations field operations  in a way consistent withthe approach outlined in “An Agenda for Peace”.One of the priorities of Canada’s foreign policy andone of the best ways to renew commitment to the UnitedNations consists of adopting a coherent approach to theprevention and management of complex emergencies.Averting crisis requires more flexibility and speed indecision-making and in implementation. In this regardCanada supports the proposal for a conference onsecurity  stability and development in the Great Lakesregion of Central Africa. We also reaffirm our strongsupport for the United Nations Department ofHumanitarian Affairs.(spoke in English)Another major focus of Canada’s preventive actionis arms control and disarmament  especially concerningnuclear weapons. The historic decision to extend theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) indefinitely provides a foundation for furtherimportant gains on nuclear disarmament. We must nowcomplete the comprehensive test-ban treaty negotiationsas early as possible in 1996 in order to permit its6signature at the General Assembly next September. Anagreement to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban theproduction of fissionable material for nuclear weapons iscurrently held up. We squander such opportunities at ourperil. Canada calls on all members of the Conference onDisarmament to proceed urgently with the cut-offnegotiations.Regrettably our efforts to take preventive action areeroded by the continued global imbalance between spendingon armaments and spending on human development.Multilateral institutions should take trends in military andother unproductive spending into consideration. All StatesMembers of the United Nations should comply with theUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms which will we hope  be expanded soon to include military holdings andnational procurement activities. Together  interestedcountries could develop criteria to identify excessivemilitary expenditures and appropriate internationalresponses. Canada has taken some initiatives in this regardin recent months and we look forward to productivenegotiations with many Member States here.When a United Nations preventive diplomacyoperation stumbles and efforts to prevent conflict fail Member States all too often criticize the United Nations.But much of the blame for the failures of the Organizationlies with the Member States themselves who do not provideit with the tools needed for success. These tools are neverneeded more than when a crisis erupts.Last year I discussed the problems the United Nationshas encountered in mobilizing its peace operations torespond to crises. Canada’s long experience with peace-keeping has convinced us that improvements are possible.The international community’s slow response to the horribleand deeply distressing events in Rwanda was very much inour mind. It was in this context that I announced thatCanada would examine ways to improve the capacity of theUnited Nations to react quickly to such events.Today I have the honour of presenting to theAssembly Canada’s report entitled “Towards a RapidReaction Capability for the United Nations” as a specialCanadian contribution to the United Nations during itsfiftieth anniversary year. It presents practical proposals forenhancing the United Nations rapid reaction capability inthe field of peace operations. I believe the proposals willboth help save lives and conserve scarce resources.The report expresses the view of the Government ofCanada  but considerable care was taken to consult withother Governments  non-governmental organizations andintergovernmental institutions. We are also deeply gratefulto the many experts from many countries who have lentus their time and wisdom.The main proposal of the report is the ""VanguardConcept"". This concept will permit the United Nations toassemble  from Member States  a multifunctional force ofup to 5 000 military and civilian personnel  and  with theauthorization of the Security Council  quickly deploy itunder the control of an operational-level headquarters.This operational headquarters would be responsible forthe advance preparations that are crucial if rapid reactionis to work. Forces will be provided under enhanced stand-by arrangements with Member States. Our other proposalsseek to enhance training  to create more efficient logisticsand transportation  and to strengthen the planning effortsof the entire United Nations system. Let me say that noneof the 26 recommendations in the report requires Charterreforms.But the search for immediate  practical solutionsmust not preclude more visionary possibilities. In thisregard  the report looked at longer-term questions  such asadvanced technology in support of the United Nationspeace operations  the feasibility of a permanent group ofcivilian police  the idea of a United Nations StandingEmergency Group  a permanent force as has beenconsidered by our colleague from the Netherlands; andthe question of independent sources of revenue for theUnited Nations system.(spoke in French)I believe that the recommendations in the report  ifimplemented  will strengthen the United Nations capacityfor more rapid  effective and successful peace operations.They will help restore confidence in the ability of theUnited Nations to respond to crises.We are conscious of the fact that words are notenough. In the words of a former military adviser to theUnited Nations:“We can’t deploy studies.”For Canada this report is only the first step intranslating ideas into action. To meet the growing needfor civilian personnel during crises  Canada will offer theUnited Nations secondment or the loan of civilianpersonnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in thedevelopment of a fully trained capacity in the areas of7human rights  legal advice  humanitarian assistance  andother aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises.Last week Canada sent the Secretary-General anupdated inventory of Canadian personnel and equipment onstand-by to the United Nations  including technicalinformation that would be crucial to rapid response. We arenow prepared to negotiate with the United Nations a moredetailed memorandum of understanding on stand-byarrangements  which would include more information onreadiness and capability standards.Our report devotes special attention to the creation ofan operational-level headquarters as the heart of the“Vanguard” concept. Canada is prepared to help inestablishing its headquarters should the United Nationsdecide to accept this recommendation. We have alreadymade a significant number of military personnel availableto the United Nations on secondment or on loan. We areprepared to make available additional personnel  bothcivilian and military  in order to bring this idea closer torealization.The time for moving towards fundamentalimprovements in the way the United Nations responds tocrises is now. A number of countries have advancedproposals similar to Canada’s and there are many new andinteresting proposals for change coming also from the non-governmental sector.Follow-up is of key importance. We need to marshalour energies  to determine the most promising areas ofaction  and to move quickly towards putting words intoaction. Over the coming weeks and months  Canada intendsto work closely with like-minded countries from around theworld  and  of course  with the United Nations Secretariatto this end.The ongoing work of peace-building must continuealongside preventive diplomacy and now rapid reactionoperations. Indeed  peace-building involves a wide range ofactivities. Much of the work needed for articulating a broadvision of human security has already been done in theseries of United Nations conferences in the economic andsocial fields  culminating in the Platform for Actionrecently adopted at the United Nations Conference onWomen. It sets out a comprehensive view of sustainabledevelopment  which balances economic and social agendasfor the purpose of promoting the well-being of society. Thisglobal consensus offers an opportunity to restore confidencein the work of the United Nations system in these fields and to dispel the perception of aimlessness and drift. TheUnited Nations can continue to play an invaluable role inforging global agreements on development goals  inadvocating core values  and in responding to humanitarianand development needs.We must seek to anchor change in a commitment topeople-centred sustainable development. A strongemphasis must be placed on the reduction of poverty andon the integration of the poorest countries into the worldeconomy. However  no single country  or even group ofcountries  can achieve global results alone. We are therefore  determined to work with all Member States topursue these goals sufficiently and effectively. Let metake this opportunity to set out some ideas on the way torenew commitment to the economic and social work ofthe United Nations.First  there is a need to achieve the right balancebetween wide-ranging debate and decisions on whichprogrammes should be adopted. The justified breadth ofdebate does not mean that United Nations programsshould be established to address every problem. There aremany other actors who play important roles. The UnitedNations should focus on what it is uniquely equipped toachieve.Secondly  there is a need for a fresh sense of thereal goals of development. The outcomes of the majorconferences are at the core  and their distillation andcoordinated follow-up should be a touchstone for theUnited Nations in the economic and social fields.The roles and functions of organizations andagencies should be examined and refocused to ensure thatthey are oriented to future needs. The Agenda forDevelopment is an important opportunity to initiate theinstitutional change required.Improving cooperation with and among specializedagencies is essential to give limited resources someimpact. The Economic and Social Council must take moreresponsibility for policy coordination within the UnitedNations system. A start was made this summer in Geneva.The recent establishment of the United NationsProgramme on AIDS is a promising example. There  theexecutive heads of agencies and programmes mustdemonstrate leadership  particularly in coordinating thefollow-up to international conferences and ensuring thatduplication  overlapping and needless spending areeliminated as far as possible.8We must effectively harness the complementary rolesof the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions.To ensure a smooth transition from emergencies torehabilitation  improved cooperation in crises must be animmediate priority. I urge the Secretary-General and theleaders of the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund (IMF) to propose new arrangements for post-crisisassistance. They could also establish a high-level workinggroup to consider how to strengthen cooperation  both atthe Organization’s Headquarters and elsewhere  in areassuch as data collection  analysis and reporting. The WorldTrade Organization (WTO) should also participate inrelevant aspects of this work.We have all come to understand the extent to whichhuman security is indivisible from environmental security.More and more conflicts are arising following disagreementover the use of finite natural resources. The United Nationstherefore has a key role to play in promoting sustainabledevelopment. Canada welcomes the recent success ofUnited Nations conferences in some areas of internationalresource-management operations  such as the UnitedNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks. Our goal is concrete  internationallysanctioned conservation measures. The same objectiveapplies to our efforts to ensure the sustainable managementof forests and arable land.The Rio Summit achieved landmark agreements onclimate change and biodiversity. Canada welcomes theprogress made by the Commission on SustainableDevelopment and by the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP)  in clarifying their respective roles infollowing up these agreements in collaboration withMember States.(spoke in English)In speaking about the three elements — preventiveaction  rapid reaction and peacebuilding — I wish toemphasize the need to see them as mutually reinforcing.United Nations Member States must be committed to allthree in order for any one to be successful.To ensure a renewal of the United Nations visionthrough these actions  we must also reassert ourcommitment to assuring the effectiveness of its key bodies.Although I could speak of many United Nations agenciesin this regard  because of its critical role in promoting thevision of the next 50 years  I will limit my remarks to theSecurity Council.The Security Council’s mandate to help preventdisputes and to resolve conflicts confer on it uniqueresponsibilities. The binding nature of some decisionsadds further weight to its deliberations.In recent years the Council has experienced a periodof intensified activity. It has also experienced setbacksfrom which we can all learn. One lesson of particularimportance is that members of the Security Council especially the permanent five  need to demonstrate a firmcommitment to the implementation of their own decisions.For Canada  the need for more open  transparent andcollegial decision-making is crucial. There must be closerconsultations with countries contributing personnel andequipment in order to help implement Council decisions.Here  real progress has been achieved of late  whichCanada warmly welcomes. This progress needs to beinstitutionalized.The credibility and effectiveness of the Council inpromoting international peace and security is also a keyelement. Although we do not regard expansion of itsmembership as a panacea  it is clear that compositionplays a role in fostering credibility and effectiveness. TheCouncil is no longer as representative as it once was. Itslegitimacy and perhaps also the quality of its decisions would be greatly enhanced by more representation fromthose countries that contribute the most to themaintenance of international peace and security and to thebroad purpose of the Organization — that is  the keycriterion for non-permanent membership enshrined inArticle 23 of the Charter.Perhaps it is time to reflect together on thosepurposes to which Article 23 refers. They would surelyinclude participation in United Nations peace operations commitment to arms control and disarmament  support forgood-neighbourly relations  humanitarian assistance human rights  development cooperation and the promotionof civil society. An understanding among Member Statesalong these lines would help in the selection ofnon-permanent Council members  whether on the existingbasis or on a modified basis.A recurring theme throughout my remarks has beenthe need for the United Nations to marshal its scarceresources more effectively. There is simply no otheroption if we are to restore confidence in this Organizationand in the specialized agencies. As the Secretary-Generalhas stressed  the Organization’s financial crisis is9crippling its effectiveness and its credibility. We cannotallow this to happen.The answer lies in addressing both expenditure andrevenue. Many Governments  including Canada’s  arefacing difficult budgetary decisions. We have had to livewith expenditure reductions in real terms while maintainingpriority programmes. International organizations mustrespect the same pressures as domestic Governments. TheUnited Nations and its agencies must focus on keyobjectives and reduce overhead spending in order to protectpriority programmes. In fact  there are many steps that chiefexecutive officers can take to increase efficiency and toreduce costs without impairing programmes  and we shouldall insist that they do so. Similarly  many agencies’ budgetsshould be held at present levels  wherever possible  if notreduced. Member States must work collectively to this end.Canada strongly supports the proposal put forward by theSecretary-General for an efficiency task force to addressthese issues. We are prepared to contribute both expertiseand personnel to get it started soon.While the United Nations needs to do more to limitspending and to promote efficiency  its financial crisiswould be significantly alleviated if its Member States wereto meet their financial obligations in full  on time andwithout conditions. Canada calls on all Member States todo so. We cannot accept that Member States  some ofwhich rank among the richest countries in the world  fail tomeet their financial obligations to this institution. This iseven more difficult to accept when we consider that anumber of the poorest countries in the world meet theirpayments in full and on time. Indeed  among the merely 60Member States that had met their regular budget obligationsto the United Nations fully by 31 July of this year  32 weredeveloping countries. Unfortunately  71 other MemberStates had made no payment at all. Almost 100 countriesstill owe money from previous years  including  I have tosay  several members of the Security Council. The majorityof Member States appear content to approve programmes appropriations and assessments without honouring theobligations to which they are committed. This isunacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.The General Assembly’s High-level Working Groupconsidering the United Nations financial plight should beginlooking at the establishment of incentives to pay. It shouldalso agree on an equitable method of sharing the burden free of the distortions that characterize the present scale ofassessments.In conclusion  let me say that I have sought to paytribute to this Organization’s achievements  and toemphasize that Canada strongly supports the UnitedNations. We are prepared to contribute concretely andactively to its revitalization and renewal. But confidencewill be restored and commitment renewed only through apartnership in which Member States live up to theircommitment and focus on key priorities that respond tohuman-centred goals for sustainable security anddevelopment. If we are successful  and frankly I trulybelieve that we will be successful  I have no doubt that 50years from now our successors will be able to praise without hesitation or qualification  the record of ourOrganization’s first 100 years."
"31",1269,"CHL",50,1995,"Let me first convey to you  Sir  my delegation’s and myown congratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly. Your appointment to preside over theAssembly at such an important session constitutes arecognition not only of your personal abilities but also ofthe important international role that Portugal plays on theinternational stage.As we commemorate half a century of the existenceof the United Nations  we do so with renewed hopes forthe purposes and principles of the Organization  and wewish to reaffirm our country’s commitment to it.The major processes taking place in the modernworld have transcended national borders and taken strongroot in the multilateral sphere. Like never before in thehistory of humankind  the solution of the problems of thepeace and security of States and the people inhabitingthem  as well as the protection of the individual  hiswelfare and his environment  depend more on collectivedecisions and action than on any one country. Ourmultilateral system may still have major defects andshortcomings  but there is no replacement that has thepolitical legitimacy of the United Nations to take up thechallenges facing us as we approach a new millennium.Hence  it is important  during this session of theAssembly  to engage in a broad debate on the functioningof our system  in order both to adapt its objectives to thenew realities and to introduce far-reaching changes in thestructures of the Organization  which were designed tomeet the challenges of a post-war world that no longerexists.My country aspires to occupy a seat in the SecurityCouncil as a non-permanent member in 1996 and 1997.From this rostrum I wish to express our gratitude for theunanimous endorsement we have received from the LatinAmerican and Caribbean Group  as well as for thesupport to be provided by other countries of the UnitedNations in the election  which is to be conducted at thissession of the General Assembly.Chile is in a position to assume this responsibilityand contribute to the search for the consensuses requiredto strengthen the Organization and make its decisionsreally effective. We shall do so on the basis of our17principles of international policy  seeking always to reflectthe views and interests of the region we wish to represent.We believe that the primary objective of a securitypolicy is to reduce the insecurity of the internationalcommunity as a whole  of its Member States and ofindividuals  families and the communities in which theylive. Helping to reduce these insecurities is the main task ofthe United Nations.We are experiencing the combined effects of theending of the cold war and of the process of increasingglobalization. Both have positive consequences in theeconomic and political spheres  but at the same time theyface us with new situations and uncertainties.The fear of the nuclear destruction that might haveresulted from the world-wide ideological confrontationbetween the major Powers has disappeared  and the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  towhich Chile is now a party  has been indefinitely extended.Nevertheless  the nuclear Powers and those aspiring tothat status still do not acknowledge that the very existenceof nuclear weapons capable of destroying mankind is asource of insecurity for us all. To believe that nuclearweapons confer greater security on the State that possessesthem is an illusion. What they produce is profound uneasein other nations and in the population of the nuclear-weapon State itself in the face of the possibility that theweapons  in an escalation of folly  might end up beingused.The renewal of nuclear tests by certain Powers —precisely at a time when  in the wake of the recentConference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  there should have been a moratorium onsuch tests so that a definitive test-ban treaty could beprepared — shows insensitivity in this regard. Nevertheless China and France  countries for which we profess respectand friendship  have opted to continue such tests. Wecondemn their attitude  and we see this as a clear setbackfor the cause of disarmament and non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons  which we all claim to share.For Chile  France’s decision to renew its nuclear testson Mururoa Atoll  in the Pacific Ocean  is of particularconcern. As a Pacific country and a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)  hascategorically condemned those tests  and President Frei hasmade our opinion known to President Chirac.We are concerned lest the South Pacific region  inwhich Chile has vital interests  should become a zone inwhich it is regarded as legitimate to engage in activitiesthat are unthinkable in other parts of the world. We wishto state clearly our willingness to work together withother States of the region to prevent the proliferation emplacement  transit or testing of nuclear weapons andother radioactive materials in that region and throughoutthe world.On the other hand  we appreciate the positiveattitude of those nuclear Powers that have declared andmaintained unilateral moratoriums. Chile  along with othercountries  believes that the General Assembly should takea stand on this issue in order to promote an immediatemoratorium on all nuclear tests  as proposed by the Headsof State of the Rio Group and the States parties to theTreaties of Tlatelolco and Rarotonga at their recentmeeting.The end of the cold war has given rise to a genuineideological decolonization that has opened the way forgreater freedom and democracy in various regions of theworld. Nevertheless  the hope that this change would leadto a more peaceful world has been thwarted. The newworld disorder has encouraged the development of ethnic religious  cultural or simply group differences. The formerYugoslavia  Rwanda and Somalia remind us that hatredthat still festers in various parts of our world.People rightly look to the United Nations to bring itspolitical and moral weight to bear in helping prevent suchatrocities. Consent to barbarism in any part of the worldweakens the moral fibre of all human beings. That is oneof the great lessons of the cold war; after the overthrowof fascism  the world also had an opportunity to expanddemocracy and freedom.Nevertheless  the systematic abuse of human rightswhich tactical allies were allowed to engage in  and whichalso characterized the Soviet Union and its areas ofinfluence  reduced the ethical quality of the worldinherited after the ending of the cold war. What alarms ustoday was just yesterday promoted or consented to for“reasons of State”.Thus  the promotion of human rights  freedom anddemocracy cannot be seen as unwarranted interference inother people’s affairs. There cannot be political  cultural ethnic or religious reasons for trampling on humandignity. This is the core of the emerging international18humanitarian law which Chile regards as a cornerstone ofthe world order for the twenty-first century.In addition  the need to promote the security of theindividual has recently acquired particular prominence. Themain factors that today affect such security areunemployment  hunger  poverty  marginalization  crime anddiscrimination on grounds of class  sex  religion  culture orethnic origin. People are demanding to be included in aprocess of development which affords opportunity  andasking that shared progress should ensure increased equalityfor all. Societies today are aware that social polarization isbecoming their main source of uncertainty.The world economy also recognizes this fact. AsPresident Eduardo Frei has said:“We know today that there can be no stableinvestment in unstable societies  and that economicprosperity cannot prosper amidst human insecurity. Onthe contrary  it is becoming increasingly apparent thatone of the main sources of growth and developmentfor the future is  in all countries  the incorporation oftoday’s marginalized people into the worldwideproduction system that is coming into being.”Heads of State and Government from all parts of theworld ratified these views at the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  when they stated:“We acknowledge that the people of the worldhave shown in different ways an urgent need toaddress profound social problems  especially poverty unemployment and social exclusion  that affect everycountry. It is our task to attack both their underlyingand structural causes and their distressingconsequences in order to reduce uncertainty andinsecurity in the life of people.” (A/CONF.166/9 annex I to resolution 1  para. 2)The same problems stemming from the processes ofglobalization and internationalization have led to theemergence of a new set of problems relating to security.These include the corrosive influence of drug productionand consumption  and the corrupting effect of themovements of vast amounts of money that this trafficinvolves; the degradation of the environment  from itsglobal impact on the ozone layer to its local effect on thehealth of children and the elderly; the large internationalmigrations resulting from insecurity in the countries oforigin; the expansion of international terrorism; and theincrease in transmissible diseases such as AIDS.One immediate conclusion emerges: there is nosubstitute for the multilateral system to tackle thisinterrelated set of problems. The areas for purely nationalaction are shrinking  while the need for internationalagreements and understandings is growing on a dailybasis.Another important conclusion is that to deal withthis multifaceted constellation of problems  we need tomake use of the United Nations system as a whole. If wewant to resolve the problems of security  as they areexperienced by people and as we have described themhere  not only the Security Council  but also the GeneralAssembly  the Economic and Social Council and thespecialized programmes and agencies have a vital role toplay. We must give them greater responsibilities inrelation to these issues.In this context  I wish to outline a number of generalprinciples by which our activity in the Security Councilwill be guided. We shall:First  focus on preventive diplomacy and on peacefulsettlement of disputes in accordance with Chapter VIin order to reduce to the minimum the use of force in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.Secondly  promote confidence-building measures andregional solutions based on the capacity for action ofcountries in the region; the regional option can beeffective  as the case of Latin America isdemonstrating  and should precede and complementrecourse to the Security Council.Thirdly  always maintain a special concern for thevictims of the conflicts dealt with by the Council encouraging the fullest use of humanitarian law.Fourthly  protect  in cases where sanctions have tobe applied  the interests and needs of the mostdisadvantaged sectors of society; we do not believein unilateral sanctions or in sanctions that ultimatelyhit only the weakest.Fifthly  promote greater transparency in theprocedures and decisions of the Council  so that theother States Members of the United Nations  civilsociety and public opinion at large can exercisedemocratic oversight over its actions; the morewidely the complexities of the issues it deals withare known and understood  the greater the supportfor its work will be.19Sixthly  monitor the growing cost of peace-keepingoperations with a view to rationalizing use of theavailable resources and making them more efficient.We believe that one of the essential tasks for theUnited Nations in striving to attain the goal of increasingglobal stability is to promote the progressive establishmentin various parts of the world of regional zones of peace andcooperation that is  geographical areas  defined by theparticipants themselves  in which are applied agreed rulesfor coexistence and the strengthening of peace and security.The United Nations has already declared the IndianOcean and the South Atlantic to be zones of peace. Thesame objective has been pursued by the Treaties ofTlatelolco and Rarotonga in relation to nuclear weapons inLatin America and the Caribbean and in the South Pacific.We need to draw the main lessons from the benefits andlimitations of the experience they afford.It is important to stress that the ending of the cold warleaves the concept of a zone of peace devoid of anyideological implication and makes it possible toacknowledge its practical usefulness. The Government ofChile considers that many regions  including ours  are in aposition to follow this example. We intend to request theSecretary-General to engage in consultations with theGovernments of United Nations Member States regardingthe interest in and possibilities of promoting zones of peacein various regions of the world and to report thereon to theGeneral Assembly next year.If we wish to make an effective response to thechallenges we face  we need to improve therepresentativeness and efficiency of our Organization. ThisAssembly will also have to discuss important aspectsrelating to the reform of the system in these two directions.Chile shares the view of many other countriesregarding the need to restructure the Security Council tomake it more representative. That entails bringing in as newpermanent members countries which over the past 50 yearshave acquired much greater weight than they had when theSecond World War ended.The new realities of the international system have notaffected only the developed world. Other regions haveincreased their influence in a world which — although“globalized” — is still extremely diverse.While maintaining its capacity for rapiddecision-making  which implies a small number ofmembers  the Security Council needs to be expanded totake all these factors into account. That will mean makingthe present categories of membership more flexible  whilealways maintaining geographical balance.Of course  we agree with all the countries of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean that any expansion of theCouncil should provide for an increase in therepresentation of our region  which in recent decades hasacquired a greater international presence and has shownitself always ready to undertake responsibilities in thestrengthening of international security.Nevertheless  the reform needed in the UnitedNations goes far beyond the Security Council. Importantreforms also remain to be carried out in the economic andsocial sphere  through which it will be possible topromote greater efficiency in the discharge of the majortasks of eliminating poverty  protecting the mostdisadvantaged social groups  creating employment protecting the environment and strengthening free trade.In these and other areas  we also expect importantinitiatives from this Assembly.Finally  the financial situation of the United Nationshas been a cause of concern to us all. This situation islargely due to the many additional tasks the Organizationhas had to take on in recent times. But we share the ideathat  rather than endlessly increasing contributions  it isimportant to take up the urgent task of rationalizingexpenditure and setting adequate priorities for ouractivities. We greatly value the initiatives the Secretary-General has been taking in this direction  and we assurehim of our full support in his efforts to adapt ourOrganization to the new realities.Over the past 10 years  Latin America hasundergone far-reaching structural changes in the directionof democracy  respect for human rights and economicreform. Now we are also making an effort to attack themajor problems of poverty and inequality that blight us and to eliminate once and for all the scourges of drugtrafficking and corruption.Chile  as an integral part of the community of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean  is a country of social peaceand continuing development. Our economy hasexperienced sustained growth rates and our country isdetermined to consolidate the democratic process andattain justice and social equity.20As a country that is open to the world  we haveexpressed our readiness to assume in full the internationalresponsibilities incumbent on us in the common task ofbringing about peace  security and development. We areconvinced that this Organization  which we helped to foundfifty years ago  will continue to be the main multilateralvehicle for our proposals  our contributions and our dreams."
"32",1315,"CHN",50,1995,"Mr. President  please allow me  first of all  towarmly congratulate you on your election to thepresidency of the current session of the GeneralAssembly. I am convinced that with your remarkableability and rich experience  you will admirably fulfil thismission. I would also like to express my appreciation andthanks to Mr. Amara Essy for the important contributionhe has made during his presidency.I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to extendmy welcome and congratulations to the Republic of Palau which was admitted into the United Nations after the lastsession.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the end ofthe Second World War and the founding of the UnitedNations. Over the past 50 years  the United Nations hasstood the test of the vicissitudes in the internationalsituation  grown steadily  scored remarkable achievementsand made major contributions to the peace and prosperityof mankind. Its membership has increased from 51 at itsfounding to today’s 185. The status and role of the UnitedNations  the most universal and authoritativeintergovernmental organization of sovereign States today is irreplaceable by any other international organization.The United Nations has traversed a tortuous anduneven path over the past fifty years  just like thedevelopment of anything else. On the occasion of thefiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations it is time to review the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter  earnestly summarize the positiveand negative experience  and introduce appropriate andnecessary reforms so as to revitalize the United Nationsand usher it into the new century with a new look to meetthe challenge of the times. This is the call of all peoplesand a lofty mission of the times.The United Nations  which was founded in thetriumph of the world war against fascism  reflects theardent desire and determination of the world’s people toavert the scourge of war forever  safeguard world peaceand security  carry out friendly international cooperation9and achieve common development. History has repeatedlyproved that adherence to the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter will enable the United Nations toplay a positive role in safeguarding peace and promotingdevelopment  while violation of and departure from thepurposes and principles of the Charter will impair thedignity and image of the United Nations and weaken itsrole. Therefore  to continue to uphold and carry forward thepurposes and principles of the Charter is an unshirkableresponsibility of all United Nations Members and a basicprinciple guiding the reform of the United Nations.The core of the United Nations Charter is the principleof equality between sovereign States and non-interferencein each other’s internal affairs. All sovereign States whether they are big or small  rich or poor  strong or weak are equal members of the international community. Theinternal affairs of a country should be managed by its ownpeople. Major world affairs should be addressed bycountries through consultations on the basis of equality andmutual respect. In international relations  to bully the small oppress the poor  override the weak  impose one’s ownsocial system  ideology and values on others or interfere inother countries’ internal affairs all run counter to the spiritof the United Nations Charter. Some people are publiclyclamouring for “containment” of other countries  whichshows that the cold war mentality still refuses to quit thestage of history. But it will ultimately be discarded byhistory. The post-war period of half a century proves thatin handling State-to-State relations  “hot war”  “cold war”or “bloc politics” do not work. Strict observance of theprinciples of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorialintegrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in eachother’s internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit andpeaceful coexistence are the only way for States to live inamity with each other and achieve common development.Since the last session of the General Assembly  thanksto the joint efforts of various quarters  the tendency towardsthe peaceful settlement of disputes through negotiations hasgrown and international economic cooperation has gainedmomentum. However  there still remain many destabilizingand uncertain factors in the international situation.Hegemonism and power politics continue to hold out. Peaceand development  the two major tasks of the world today still face grave challenges.Armed conflicts and catastrophic wars in some partsof the world remain unabated  which has not only inflictedheavy losses of life and property on the countries andpeoples concerned  but also casts a shadow over regionalpeace and stability and that of the whole world. All thiscannot but cause concern and distress among the world’speople. As the background and causes behind theseconflicts are complicated  to seek a just  fair andappropriate solution to them would call for tremendousand concerted efforts by all the parties concerned  theUnited Nations and the international community as awhole. We maintain that the parties concerned should  inthe fundamental and long-term interests of the people seek just and fair solutions through negotiations  takinginto full account both history and reality as well as thereasonable interests and positions of all sides. Whereconsensus cannot be reached immediately  the partiesconcerned should exercise restraint and patience so as toprevent contradictions from intensifying and at the sametime try to create conditions and an atmosphere for aneventual peaceful settlement.United Nations peace-keeping operations in recentyears have played a useful role in settling internationaldisputes peacefully. They have both accumulatedsuccessful experience and learned lessons from setbacks.We believe that  to ensure a healthy development ofUnited Nations peace-keeping operations and activities inother related fields such as preventive diplomacy  thefollowing guidelines should be established and followed:Observation of the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter  in particular the principle ofrespect for State sovereignty and non-interference in theinternal affairs of other countries;Settlement of disputes through peaceful means suchas good offices  mediation and negotiations instead ofresort to frequent mandatory actions. Even humanitarianoperations should not resort to military means;Opposition to double standards and the imposition ofthe policies and views of one or a few countries on theSecurity Council. Some countries should not be allowedto carry out military intervention in the name of theUnited Nations;For peace-keeping operations  adherence to theprinciples that have proved effective  such as obtainingprior consent from the parties concerned  observing strictneutrality and the non-use of force except for self-defence;Adoption of a realistic approach and confining theoperation within one’s capability. Peace-keepingoperations should be launched only when conditions areripe and should refrain  in whatever circumstances  from10becoming a party to a conflict in deviation from thefundamental orientation of such operations.It has been demonstrated time and again that UnitedNations peace-keeping operations  if divorced from theseguidelines  would  contrary to our wishes  fail to achievetheir desired objectives and might even go astray.Last May  the Review and Extension Conference ofthe States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) adopted the decision to renew theNPT indefinitely. This serves the interests of all signatories helps to strengthen the international non-proliferationregime and is conducive to the maintenance of world peaceand security. China believes that nuclear non-proliferationis only an interim step towards the ultimate goal of thecomplete prohibition and total destruction of nuclearweapons. The indefinite extension of the NPT must not beconstrued as an indefinite license for the nuclear-weaponStates to perpetuate their prerogatives.One year ago  also from this rostrum  on behalf of theChinese Government I called for the conclusion of aconvention on the complete prohibition of nuclear weaponsand put forward a series of complete and interrelatedproposals on nuclear disarmament. We are pleased to notethat the negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treatyhave produced some gratifying progress. China supports theconclusion of such a treaty no later than 1996 and willcontinue to work with other countries to this end. Once thetreaty enters into force  China will stop its nuclear testing.China’s possession of a limited nuclear capability isentirely for self-defence and for deterring the nuclear threatagainst it. The Chinese Government has from the verybeginning unilaterally undertaken not to be the first to usenuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstancesand not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons againstnon-nuclear-weapon States. China’s nuclear weaponstherefore do not constitute a threat to any country. Westrongly urge other nuclear-weapon States to respondpositively to China’s initiative by immediately startingnegotiations aimed at concluding a treaty on mutual non-first-use of nuclear weapons and an agreement on the non-use or non-threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States and nuclear-free zones.It has become a trend in today’s world that whencountries formulate their domestic and foreign policies theyaccord top priority to the economy and pay close attentionto national economic development. The worldwide tendencytowards economic integration  regionalization and theformation of economic groupings has accelerated  andcompetition among States in the economic  trade scientific and technological fields has further intensified.Under such circumstances  the developing countries arefaced with a formidable challenge as they strive foreconomic growth and higher living standards for theirpeople.Furthermore  over 1 billion people on this planetremain in abject poverty; this constitutes one of the worldcommunity’s most acute problems. Given much-neededsupport to the developing countries as they reactivate theireconomies and creating a favourable external environmentfor them are not only important conditions for the sharedeconomic growth and common prosperity of all countries but also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stabilitythroughout the world. Given the present situation  theUnited Nations should ask itself to pay at least as muchattention to development as to peace  effectively performits duties under the Charter and play a more dynamic rolein galvanizing economic growth and development in thedeveloping countries. The reform of the United Nationsmust result in the strengthening  not the weakening  of itsrole in the area of development.True  fairly rapid economic growth in the developingcountries must depend primarily on their own efforts.However  it is also important for the internationalcommunity  and the developed countries in particular  totake practical and effective measures to open markets provide development funds  transfer technology  increasedevelopment aid and reduce the debt burden in favour ofthe developing countries. International economiccooperation should be guided by the principle of mutualopening-up  equality and mutual benefit. Such practices asimplementing protectionist policies of one form or anotherand attaching political strings to economic assistance todeveloping countries are obviously misguided.Profound changes have taken place in China amidthe surging tide of change and development across theworld. The 17 years that have elapsed since the beginningof reform and opening-up in China have beenunprecedented in terms of the economic growth rate andthe improvement of the people’s living standards. Atpresent  China enjoys political stability  economicprosperity  ethnic harmony and vigorous advances indemocracy  legality and community undertakings. China’sexchanges and cooperation with the rest of the world havereached a level unprecedented in both scope and depth.Although there may still be many difficulties andchallenges along the road ahead  we are confident that 11through several generations of hard work  our people willlift China out of economic and cultural backwardness andturn it into a highly prosperous and democratic moderncountry.The Chinese people are peace-loving people. China’shistory for over a century following the Opium War wasone of tears  blood and humiliation in which the Chinesenation was subjected to repeated aggression  suppressionand plunder at the hands of the big Powers. Do unto othersas you would have others do unto you. The Chinese peopletreasure their hard-won independence and freedom and willnever commit aggression or intervene against others. Chinais opposed to hegemonism and power politics of any kindand will never seek hegemony for itself. With a populationof 1.2 billion  China will remain a low-income developingcountry for a very long time and the steady improvement ofour people’s living standards will remain our objective towards the attainment of which no effort will be spared.Even when China grows stronger  it will continue firmly topursue its independent foreign policy of peace and will livein amity with other nations. A stable and prosperous Chinais a positive factor for peace and development in Asia andthe world at large. This is a conclusion that people ofvision around the world have come to share.The Chinese people have waged heroic and unyieldingstruggles to resist external aggression and oppression and todefend the sovereignty  independence and unity of thecountry. There is but one China in the world. TheGovernment of the People’s Republic of China is the solelegal Government of China. It is the sole representative ofChina at the United Nations  and Taiwan is an inalienablepart of China. The peaceful reunification of the two sidesof the Taiwan Straits represents the unshakable will anddetermination of the entire Chinese people  including ourcompatriots in Taiwan. Proceeding from this reality  theChinese Government has put forward the correct proposalon peaceful reunification within the framework of theconcept of “one country  two systems” and a series ofrealistic and practicable policies and measures. The pastfew years have seen a steady expansion and deepening ofexchanges and contacts between the two sides in variousfields. Any attempt to obstruct peaceful reunification and tosplit Taiwan from China is doomed to failure. Shouldanyone try to do so  he would be lifting a stone only todrop it on his own toes.History moves on. Mankind is progressing. In fouryears we will usher in a new millennium. The future is fullof promise. Let us join hands and make concerted efforts tobring about a better world in which there are peace andcooperation  justice and equality  mutual respect andcommon development  a world of universal prosperity andcontinuous progress."
"33",1395,"CMR",50,1995,"The delegation of Cameroon congratulates Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. We wish him wellas he guides the work of this historic session  whichcoincides with the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization. Knowing as I doMr. Freitas do Amaral’s distinction as an educator and astatesman  I welcome his election.Moreover  the President represents a friendly country Portugal  whose involvement in Africa is of long standingand which shares with Cameroon a part of our history:When he alit on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea in 1472 the Portuguese Fernando Po was much impressed with theabundance of shrimp in the waters off what is now the cityof Douala and named the place “Rio dos Camarões” —Shrimp River — from which Cameroon takes its name.We also convey our appreciation to His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofCôte d’Ivoire  for the way in which he carried out hisresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session.Finally  we pledge to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our constant support in histireless efforts to enable the Organization to attain itsnoble purposes.It is of enormous significance that the presentsession of the General Assembly should coincide with thefiftieth anniversary of the Organization. The UnitedNations  which sums up and expresses the deep-feltaspiration of the peoples and nations of the world topeace  freedom and progress  has become anindispensable conclave of nations. The Organization’suniversality makes it the ideal forum for governing theworld order.The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary shouldtherefore be a source of satisfaction to the entireinternational community. It provides an opportunity togauge how far we have come since the beginning and toconsider our views on the future of the Organization.When they created the United Nations after the SecondWorld War  the founders affirmed their determination tosave succeeding generations from the scourge of war.Fortunately  for more than half a century theNorth — once the epicentre of most of history’s majorconflicts — has been a place of peace and cooperation;and  despite the build-up of weapons of mass destruction the rivalry between the two great ideological and militaryalliances did not drag international society into a thirdworld war  which would have sealed the fate of mankind.Aware of the danger to the world posed by the armsrace  the United Nations encouraged the conclusion of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andits indefinite extension; it has promoted the creation ofdenuclearized zones  inter alia in Africa  and theconclusion of the Convention on the prohibition ofchemical weapons; and it has given decisive impetus tomultilateral negotiations on disarmament.We are glad that  in its ongoing quest for peace  theOrganization has been able when necessary to adapt theCharter to the realities  including by devising the notionof peace-keeping operations  which have defused manyconflicts and created favourable conditions for dialogueand negotiation.By awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to UnitedNations peace-keeping forces on 29 September 1988  theNobel prize committee paid tribute to the devotion andcourage of the more than half a million men and women19General Assembly 21st plenary meetingwho since 1948 have served the cause of peace all over theworld.Even if in recent years peace-keeping operations havehad mixed results and have been accused of consuming thelion’s share of United Nations resources to the detriment ofdevelopment  it must be recognized that while the path hasnot always been smooth  these operations have on thewhole yielded positive results. The “Agenda for Peace” then  remains relevant  and must continue to be thefoundation of United Nations peace-keeping operations.Cameroon supports the recommendations of theWorking Group to strengthen these operations by definingin advance precise objectives  the timeframe for theintervention  and the resources needed for implementation.Similarly  and as we have always said  the United Nationsmust strengthen its cooperation with regional andsubregional organizations by making available the meansnecessary to enable them to discharge their peace-keepingmandate. That is why we welcome cooperation between theUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity inthe area of prevention  management and settlement ofconflicts on a continent riddled with crises and conflicts ofmany forms and many dimensions.This applies also on the subregional level: to the rolein the area of peace-keeping of the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa  whichdeserves support  as the Committee  which was created withthe assistance of the Secretary-General  brings together11 Central African countries which have decided to set upwithin their national armed forces units specializing inpeace-keeping operations to be carried out under theauspices of the United Nations and the Organization ofAfrican Unity. Cameroon trusts that the United Nations willshow greater interest in this available force of more than10 000 soldiers  which could serve as reserve forces forpeace missions.Another area where United Nations action has beenparticularly significant is decolonization. Thanks to thataction and to their own peoples’ emancipation struggles many colonial Territories have gained independence andsovereignty; today they make up more than half of themembership of the Organization. More than any othercontinent  Africa is proud to have unswervingly promotedthe process of its own total liberation  which was recentlycompleted with the end of apartheid in South Africa.Here we recall with gratitude that it was under UnitedNations auspices that Cameroon attained sovereignty afterhaving been first a German colony  then a Territory underLeague of Nations Mandate  then a United Nations TrustTerritory. It is our hope that the few Territories remainingunder foreign administration will freely exercise theirinalienable right to self-determination  so that the UnitedNations objective of the complete eradication ofcolonialism by the year 2000 may be realized.Also to the credit of the Organization are thepromotion of human rights  the ongoing development andcodification of international law  and achievements in allthe areas covered by the specialized agencies.The promotion and protection of human rights ingeneral and those of the most vulnerable anddisadvantaged in particular are at the centre of ourconcerns and those of the United Nations. The creation ofthe Centre for Human Rights  the convening at Vienna ofthe World Conference on Human Rights and theappointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rightsall enable the United Nations to follow progress in thearea of human rights throughout the world and to assertcertain principles by which States must abide. Cameroonwelcomes this  and attaches great importance torecognition of and respect for all human rights  includingthe right to development.As regards humanitarian assistance  our Organizationhas been active on all fronts where it has been needed providing aid to victims of catastrophes and naturaldisasters and war.At this stage  I would like to mention and welcomeaction taken in the field by the United Nations throughthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) and other organizations  such as the WorldHealth Organization (WHO)  the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) and the International Labour Organization(ILO).On another matter  we would like to welcomeprogress by the United Nations in the fight against thescourge of drugs. The United Nations International DrugControl Programme is a result of concerted efforts by theUnited Nations and Member States in the fight against theproduction  sale  demand for and traffic in  and theunlawful distribution of  drugs and psychotropicsubstances. Cameroon pledges and invites other States topledge unreservedly their support for the United Nations20General Assembly 21st plenary meetingConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances in order to stop the scourge ofdrugs.We would like to emphasize the considerable effortsexerted by the United Nations to focus the attention of theinternational community  in the context of worldconferences  on other questions of interest that requirecollective action  which should be taken by the entirecommunity of nations. These concerns have beenmanifested through the World Summit for Children  the RioConference on Environment and Development  the WorldConference on Human Rights at Vienna  the InternationalConference on Population and Development at Cairo  theWorld Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen  theCairo Conference on the Prevention of Crime  and FourthWorld Conference on Women at Beijing. On the questionof women  it is highly desirable that all States immediatelyfollow up on the decisions and recommendations of theBeijing Conference.But these successes of our Organization that I havejust mentioned may not have met the expectations of allpeoples.First  in the area of international peace and security the Organization has not been able to prevent the spread ofsources of tension and conflicts throughout the world. Untilrecently  it has been practically powerless in the face of thetragedies of the former Yugoslavia  Somalia and Rwanda.In the economic arena  the Organization notwithstanding the declaration of four United Nationsdecades  has not succeeded in adopting declarations programmes of actions and other strategies to bring aboutprogress and economic and social development indeveloping countries. The proof is that conditions in thesecountries are still unfavourable  and  in order to experiencegrowth once again  they must engage in policies ofstructural adjustment  the social burden of which has beena source of major concern to their Governments. This istrue also of the high price they must pay to join themainstream of world trade in order to avoid furthermarginalization.Development is primarily the responsibility of Statesand the peoples concerned. Cameroon nevertheless believesthat the United Nations should  because of its universalityand in the best interest of the international community as awhole  help to ensure global solidarity and interdependencewith a view to promoting development for all. This meansthat we must stop inveighing against Africa in uniformlypessimistic  not to say doomsday  tones. This style is alltoo familiar and suggests that our continent is  in thehistory of the world  nothing but a passive onlooker. Butwho  in all seriousness  can place at the sidelines of worldevents an entire continent  with 700 million inhabitantstoday — 800 million in the year 2 000 — and withimmense natural  human  cultural and spiritual wealth? Inthis connection  the Holy Father  speaking of Africa  onthe occasion of his recent second visit to Cameroon appealed in his post-synod apostolic exhortation foravoidance of any blanket condemnations of an entirepopulation  an entire nation or  still worse  an entirecontinent.In spite of the serious difficulties that it mustovercome  Africa is determined to shoulder responsibilityfor its future. The sweeping changes which it isexperiencing today are nothing but the forerunners of anascent order whose purpose will be to integrate ourcontinent into the world of the third millennium. Thisprocess of transformation is already yielding fruit in mostof our countries.As regards Cameroon  I would like in thisconnection  to emphasize our irreversible pursuit of theprocess of democratization begun by Presidency PaulBiya at the very moment he assumed power in 1982.Between now and the end of this year  there will besignificant progress in this process with the adoption of anew Constitution allowing for greater democraticparticipation by the citizens of Cameroon in themanagement of their own affairs  and a better balanceamong the various powers of Government.I would like to mention the impact our measures ofrecovery and economic liberalization have had on varioussectors of activity. Cameroon is enjoying self-sufficiencyin food  and is beginning to enjoy growth again. Inflationhas been halted and macroeconomic balance in majorareas has been re-established. In a word  there are signsof life in economic activity. Strengthened by thecredibility confirmed — had that really been needed —by the recent signing of the agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund  my country is widening itsaction for the acceleration of its economic recovery.Our Organization is confronted with a sudden andunexpected acceleration of history. Never has there beensuch an acute sense of upheaval. The same questions keepcropping up everywhere: Will the world in the future bemeaningless? What will the world order be like in thefuture? Will the Organization have a hand in this new21General Assembly 21st plenary meetingorder? And  finally  will it have the ability to be the meltingpot for this? But  when all is said and done  the end of thecold war has brought fair weather.However  it is clear that  50 years after its creation the Organization needs to turn over a new leaf. That beingso  might it not be highly desirable for it to re-think itsrole  its tasks  its functions  with a view not just to adaptingto this new context  but to responding better to the ever-increasing and ever-more-insistent aspirations of the peoplesto peace and well-being? In any case  this is the desire ofCameroon.These are the responsibilities we would like theOrganization to shoulder in order to ensure a better worldand a better future for the generation of the nextmillennium. In this connection  the manner in which theUnited Nations discharges its responsibilities  or rather thesuccess of United Nations missions  will depend on the realcollective political will of its Member States.For its part  Cameroon feels that the current thinkingon the restructuring of the Security Council augurs well forthe revitalization of the Organization. The same is true ofthe successful outcome of peace-keeping efforts madepossible by United Nations action and the concerted actionof the international community in Cambodia  CentralAmerica  Angola  Haiti  Mozambique and Eritrea. On thesame lines  the new diplomatic deals that are evolving inthe former Yugoslavia and the Middle East are undeniablyvery encouraging developments.In the final analysis  then  there is no reason not tobelieve that in the near future the peoples of regions whereconflicts are continuing will  like so many others  have theirrendezvous with peace.In all of these cases  Cameroon has the feeling that alasting solution will have to come through a meeting of thepolitical wills of the chief protagonists and the collectivewill of the international community.In spite of the difficulties that have impeded action inthe areas both of peace-keeping and of economic and socialdevelopment  the balance sheet of the Organization —though certainly uneven — is not as negative as somewould have us believe. The celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations gives the internationalcommunity an ideal opportunity to consider the ways andmeans available to our Organization to carry out thecollective work of ensuring peace  security and prosperityfor all.This anniversary must also be taken as anopportunity for renewal  for highlighting and praising thewealth of universality in the diversity in our Organization.This is an opportunity to renew our pledge andcommitment to the purposes and ideals of the Charter.This pledge and this commitment must be translated intoa strengthening of our determination and our ability to actcollectively so that  as was the wish of the foundingfathers  we can save future generations from anguish fear  poverty  suffering and all sorts of uncertainty  and sothat we may finally move forward along the path oftransforming the tools of war into the tools of peace.Cameroon  for its part  is prepared to contribute."
"34",1436,"COD",50,1995,"I should like to join the speakers who havepreceded me at this rostrum in offering you  Sir  on behalfof my delegation and on my own behalf  warm and heartycongratulations on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth regular session. I amparticularly pleased that the President of the GeneralAssembly is the representative of Portugal  a friendlycountry with which my country  the Republic of Zaire  haslong enjoyed excellent relations marked by trust and mutualrespect. We feel that your intellectual abilities anddiplomatic skills  together with your long experience ofinternational affairs  guarantee the success of our workhere.My congratulations go also to the other electedmembers of the Bureau  and I wish them every success intheir delicate task of providing you with assistance.Allow me also to pay tribute to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Essy Amara  Minister for ForeignAffairs of the sister Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  to whomI am bound by long-standing ties of personal friendship.I should like to express to him our joy and pride onseeing how masterfully he guided the work of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth regular session and ourappreciation of the energy  skill and ability with which hedischarged his mandate.Finally  I should like to pay a well-deserved tributeto the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  forhis excellent preparatory work for this session  hisoutstanding efforts to strengthen the role of the UnitedNations and his many commendable initiatives in supportof international peace and security.My thoughts here will turn mainly to the lessons of50 years of the existence of the United Nations; therevitalization and restructuring of the United Nations; thesituation in the subregion of the Great Lakes  particularlyRwanda and Burundi; the efforts for peace in the MiddleEast; the support of the United Nations system for effortsby Governments to promote and strengthen new orrestored democracies; external debt  internationaleconomic cooperation and development; disarmamentefforts; and  finally  the question of the return orrestoration of cultural property to its country of origin.This year the United Nations is commemorating itsfiftieth anniversary. When it was founded  it set itselfgoals that corresponded to the enthusiasm  hopes andneeds that emerged with the end of a devastating warwhose traumatic effects have not yet faded away entirely.Those goals were to maintain international peace andsecurity  guarantee justice and human rights  foster socialprogress and establish better living conditions in greaterfreedom.Where do we stand today?A fiftieth anniversary is an important milestone in thelife of persons  institutions and nations. A person who hasmade nothing of his life by the time he is 50 is not likelyto set a new course for his life afterwards. An institutionthat after 50 years has done nothing to attain the objectivesit set when it was founded inevitably raises the question ofits viability and the usefulness of its existence. A nationthat has done nothing for its people in 50 years must surelystep back and re-examine everything — its political leaders programmes  social projects  management and methods.Fortunately  this is not the case of the United Nations.It has some outstanding accomplishments to its credit. Ithas achieved real successes and made real efforts in theareas of economic and social development  decolonization human rights  development and peace-keeping. Its work inestablishing norms indisputably represents the highestaspirations of man  of all mankind and all peoples  for aworld free from war  threats  intimidation  poverty oppression and suffering.Today  therefore  the United Nations must preserveand consolidate its accomplishments while also adaptingitself to face the new challenges borne in the wake of theastonishing transformations the world has undergone sincethe end of the Second World War.For those of us from Africa  decolonization was anextremely important page in this story. What woulddecolonization have been without the United Nations particularly the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV)  theDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to ColonialCountries and Peoples? What would have happened inSouth Africa without the mobilization by the UnitedNations of the entire international community against thescourge of apartheid  and without its support for the heroicand legitimate struggle of the South African people underthe leadership of the recognized liberation movements particularly the African National Congress (ANC)?In Zaire we have not forgotten that 34 years and 10days ago  striving to promote peace and restore andmaintain the political independence and territorial integrityof the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which is todayZaire  one of the most devoted servants of the UnitedNations  its late Secretary-General  Dag Hammarskjöld died at Ndola.We have not forgotten that from July 1960 to June1964 the United Nations Operation in the Congorepresented the largest assistance programme undertakenby the United Nations up to that time.And so it is thanks to this major contribution by theUnited Nations that Zaire preserved its unity andterritorial integrity. Let me extend to the United Nationsthe deep appreciation of the Zairian people for this. Thatpage in our history  which is also a page in the history ofthe United Nations  reminds us that our people paid aheavy price for peace  and it made a pledge that thegenerations must hand down from one to another: nomore civil war; no more secessions because of tribal inter-ethnic or power conflicts; a firm commitment topeace and dialogue for development  whatever the natureor the intensity of our internal differences.That is why we gave the name of DagHammarskjöld to an important bridge in the city ofKinshasa  to pay tribute to the United Nations byimmortalizing the memory of the Secretary-General whodied on the battlefield in the struggle for peace. Thesymbol of the bridge derives from our understanding ofthe message of the United Nations. As an opening on theworld and forum of nations  is not the United Nations with its message of peace and dialogue  building a bridgebetween nations?And yet  despite the outstanding progressindisputably made throughout the world  many otherthings have also happened. The cold war has endedwithout this being much help to the development processin the countries of the South  particularly in Africa  wherepoverty has increased in a worsening economic and socialsituation.In the wake of this worsening situation  Africa  inparticular  is experiencing the reappearance of diseaseswhich had been eradicated and the appearance of newendemic diseases  without having the necessary resourcesto cope with them.Decolonization is virtually over now. Apartheid hasbeen abolished  and Africa  facing the new challenges ofdemocratization and development  seized by the fever ofdemocratization  is undergoing irreversible changeaccompanied by new difficulties.2At the international level  new kinds of domination areemerging  and could lead to the same results as those of thepast  if we are not careful. Will “globalization” of people’sbehaviour and standardization of reflexes and needsimprison freedom  stifle identities and crush the culturalexpression of peoples?There has been no Third World War  but  as in formerYugoslavia  Rwanda  Burundi and elsewhere  a new kind ofwar has emerged  based on ethnic and tribal “cleansing” tragic consequences for security  peace  the environmentand the development of nations that are very disturbing.A new kind of international crime is engulfing Africaand the world: violence — attacks on individuals and theirproperty  armed robbery and highway robbery; economicand financial crime — counterfeiting  money-laundering illicit drug trafficking  large-scale fraud in commodities andso forth; political crime — fundamentalism andinternational terrorism  which take us back to the times ofthe pirates and the corsairs. Of course the telegraph  thetelephone  air travel  radio  television  computers and videoshave done a great deal to shrink distances  but they havealso helped to strengthen the forces of disorder.Multilateral cooperation  development financing andthe spirit of international solidarity have all been fritteredaway. The new international economic order has notemerged  and bilateral cooperation has been halted forvarious reasons  some political in many countries  such asZaire  at the precise moment when those countries are facedwith a sharp reduction in financial resources. Theconditions attached to development aid are more stringentthan ever  and assistance for democratization  stronglyencouraged at the La Baule Summit  is also subject toconditionalities.The phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons isnow unprecedented in scope.A century of hope  particularly the last half of thecentury  would thus seem to be ending on a note of despairwhen we look at what the causes of the new threat to worldpeace in general and peace in Africa in particular are:armed conflicts  serious internal struggles  poverty unemployment  inequality  discrimination  intolerance policies of exclusion  the struggle against State despotism political and social failures  and so on.To those who are seeking refuge from tyranny we canalso add — on our continent those who are fleeing anarchy.The tragic fate of persons displaced because of civil war orviolence is one of the major humanitarian problems of ourage. There are many armed conflicts today which derivefrom the struggle between communities swept along byintolerance.It is therefore imperative that the members of theinternational community shoulder their responsibilities help each other and act together to reverse these negativetrends.As the Secretary-General of the United Nationsnoted on 20 October 1994  quite rightly:“Societies that used to think they were completelyautonomous now know that they are very closelylinked to one another. The life of each individual wherever he may come from  is today part of aplanetary whole. Today it is recognized that theloftiest objectives of mankind — peace  justice andprosperity — can be attained only if an increasinglybroadly agreed effort is made. And then a wholeseries of new problems whose worldwide dimensionsare quite clear demand solutions that no one countryor group of countries can find in isolation.”In order to cope with the new challenges facing usall  with the problems of development  peace and security the United Nations has to rethink its methods  itsorganization  and its effectiveness.The influx of nearly 3 million Rwandese refugees toeastern Zaire  about which I shall speak later  revealed tous some of the shortcomings of the United Nationssystem faced with new challenges.First  30 000 armed men belonging to the formerarmed forces of Rwanda came to Zaire on 14 July 1994 and obviously we were not expecting them. They came toregions of North and South Kivu following the civil warin Rwanda. After being disarmed  they were supposed tobe taken care of. But by whom? Problems arose as totheir status.Were they prisoners of war? Zaire was not at warwith Rwanda  we were told. Were they war detainees?“No”  we were told by the International Committee of theRed Cross (ICRC)  “they are not within our competence.”Are they  then  political refugees? “No”  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) replied. “Men in military uniform are notpolitical refugees  and so they do not fall within ourcompetence.”3And so  the 30 000 military men of the formerRwandan armed forces began to take care of themselves  tothe detriment of the villagers and local populations  whilethe United Nations system looked on  powerless.Secondly  at the behest of the Secretary-General andthe international community  we agreed to move them faraway from our border with Rwanda  for obvious reasons.So we found sites in Shaba  Maniema and Equateur. JointUnited Nations-Zaire evaluation missions were sent to theseregions.Assuming that there were three people in each family we identified 90 000 individuals belonging to the formerRwandan Army to be moved from the Rwandan border.Having seen this evaluation  the United Nationsdeclared the cost exorbitant  and the Secretary-General wasunable to find the financial resources needed. So  the ideawas abandoned and the United Nations asked Zaire to takeappropriate security measures and to keep the 30 000military men where they were  namely on the border withRwanda.But  leaving them there made the Kigali Governmentnervous about possible destabilization  and so it beganspreading unfounded accusations against Zaire. Withoutchecking the facts at all  the United Nations thenrecognized Kigali’s claims and lifted the arms embargo onRwanda which had been established pursuant to SecurityCouncil resolution 1011 (1995) of 16 August 1995  in orderto help that country protect itself against some hypotheticalthreat  but the United Nations has done nothing at all aboutthe 30 000 military men left to be cared for by Zairewithout any assistance.And what is more  after lifting the arms embargo onRwanda on 16 August 1995 so that it could arm itself anddeal with the threat of destabilization from Zaire  theSecurity Council adopted resolution 1013 (1995) two weekslater setting up an international Commission of Inquiry tolook into allegations that the former Rwandan Governmentforces were being trained and supplied with weapons fromZaire in order to destabilize Rwanda. This is all quiteastonishing  not least because the highest level of thecollective security system of the United Nations wasinvolved. I myself have served on the Security Council. Iwas President during the Malvinas war and I have alwaysbelieved that at that level of responsibility  matters shouldbe considered with the utmost care.Either the Security Council has proof and takesaction  the setting up of an investigative commissionbeing now irrelevant; or the Security Council has noproof  so it investigates and takes a decision after it haschecked the facts. The credibility of our Organization isat stake here. These are just two cases showing theinability of the United Nations to deal with the newchallenges.The much-needed revitalization of the UnitedNations depends on the interest and the efficacy it showsin dealing with conflicts and complex situations that callfor its intervention.The same holds true for its restructuring. Fifty yearsafter its inception  the United Nations needs to adjust andadapt to the new challenges facing the world today including economic and social development; politicalconflicts against a backdrop of ethnic cleansing; changesaffecting international relations; and the changes that havetaken place in the world since 24 October 1945; the needto enlarge the circle of decision-makers in matters ofinternational peace and security; the need to ensure moreequitable and balanced representation of the nations of theworld on the Security Council and to avoid any danger ofthe collective security system being manipulated; and theinadequacy of the financial resources to cover the scale ofthe tasks facing this universal Organization.This therefore seems to be the cost of ensuring anew dynamism in United Nations activities  for thischanging world is not exactly reassuring. And manyevents are taking place without the nations of the worldknowing why or how. There is a danger that politicallobbies may use the cogs of the United Nationsmachinery to their own ends  using their influence without any counterbalance  and that certain Governmentsmay bring pressure to bear on the United Nations. Thisslippery slope was certainly not foreseen when thecollective security system was established.The Republic of Zaire welcomes the current peaceprocess in the Middle East. We noted with satisfaction theagreements signed between the State of Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization on the one hand andbetween Israel and Jordan on the other. To our mind these are important steps towards the establishment of anoverall peace.Zaire wholeheartedly supports the bilateralnegotiations and the progress made thus far in the peaceprocess and urges all parties to implement the agreements.4We trust that efforts will be made to ensure that furthernegotiations are held soon between Israel and other ArabStates.Emphasizing the need to ensure progress in Arab-Israeli negotiations in other directions of the peace process the Republic of Zaire would urge the establishment ofdialogue between the protagonists  and encourage them todo their utmost to reach agreements that reflect thelegitimate aspirations of each side.This is the only way in which we will be able toovercome an age-old distrust and create the conditionsneeded for progress and development in the Middle East  inthe spirit of peace that has been so long in coming.The situation in the Great Lakes subregion in CentralAfrica is of great concern in the Republic of Zaire becauseit calls into question the peace  stability  security anddevelopment  not just of Rwanda and Burundi  but of theregion as a whole.The Republic of Zaire  I wish to emphasize  has noparticular problem with Rwanda or with Burundi.Yesterday  Zaire offered refuge to the Tutsis who weredriven from their home and today we are offering refuge tothose who have left their country. A human tragedy of anunprecedented scale is unfolding in this region. Everythingborders on the extreme  including the urge to exclude otherpeople; the hatred that pits the fraternal enemies  the Tutsisand the Hutus  against each other; the dramaticperegrinations of people who are hounded because of theirethnic origins or political opinions; the ease with whichhuman lives are destroyed  including the lives of children women  old people  and intellectuals; the instinct forviolence; the scale of the flow of people searching forshelter  fleeing certain death; the imbalance in the divisionof political and military power and the rejection ofdemocratic principles in the running of the country.As former Tutsi refugees from 1959 and from 1962-1963 are returning home  thanks to the return to power ofthe Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR)  it is now the turn ofmillions of Hutus  who represent 85 per cent of thepopulation  to leave their country  abandoning theirproperty  their land and their houses to the newcomers.The Tutsis  who were forced out in the 1960s at theheight of the Hutus’ power  and who account for 15 percent of the population  took 30 years to prepare theirforcible return to power. How long does the internationalcommunity want to wait until it is the turn of the Hutumajority to return to power using force?Every time there is this kind of swing  new humandramas will be condemned and major problems ofreinsertion and reinstallation will emerge.In this cycle of deliberate violence  it will becomeincreasingly impossible to say who is innocent ofsomething and who is not guilty of something.Faced with a tragedy of such magnitude  theinternational community and the United Nations seem tous to be rather helpless. Who then will take the necessarymeasures to help these countries  to prevent their situationfrom deteriorating  to preserve peace and security in theregion and to prevent further genocide?The resolutions and declarations adopted to date bythe United Nations do not take account of all the realitieson the ground. They do not cover all the aspects of thetragedy that I have just described that exists in Rwanda Burundi and in the subregion of the Great Lakes as awhole. And these resolutions and declarations havepolitical implications that contribute to the region’sinstability.No purpose can be served at the stage where we aretoday by quoting lofty principles or deciding who is righton the basis of who can best present their version of thesituation and the facts. Instead  we must objectivelydefine the concrete problems facing Rwanda and Burundias States and take specific measures  within theframework of an overall approach to the question  toensure the repatriation of refugees; national reconciliation;power-sharing; the establishment of the needed balance inthe armies that now constitute the political support ofGovernments  in order to create republican armed forces;the establishment or revitalization of the democratizationprocess; assistance in reintegrating refugees into society;reconstruction and development assistance for thecountries of origin and of asylum; and  finally  theestablishment of viable judicial structures  so that therecan be some justice. There is indeed a justice problem and it must be solved.It is in this spirit that the Republic of Zaire supportsthe holding of a regional conference on peace  stabilityand security in the Great Lakes subregion  following thesigning of bilateral agreements on the repatriation ofrefugees. If this conference is to succeed  it must  forobvious reasons  be planned very carefully. The5Government of Zaire welcomed the appointment by theSecretary-General of the United Nations of AmbassadorJesus to the post of Special Envoy. Zaire will cooperatefully with him in order to ensure the success of his mission.I should like also to draw the Assembly’s attention tothe fact that the influx of Rwandese refugees into easternZaire  an event unheard of since the end of the SecondWorld War  appears to have been relegated to the backpages of international news now that its sensationalistaspect has worn thin. The refugees destroyed a pricelessnational heritage: the national park of Virunga  a site listedby the United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) as a national treasure. The localflora and fauna — mountain gorillas  elephants and otherprotected species — were not spared. The environment  theecology  and basic sanitary and educational infrastructureswere destroyed. General Assembly resolution 49/24 of 2December 1994  on special assistance to countries —including Zaire — receiving refugees to help restore theareas destroyed by the massive presence of refugees  has sofar had no impact or follow-up whatsoever.Zaire  a victim of the tragedy in Rwanda by virtue oftheir common border  has been accused  with increasingfrequency  of attempting to destabilize Rwanda. Theaccusers are none other than those who wish to use therefugee question to destabilize the Great Lakes area inorder to live out their dream of creating a new Ima empirethat would challenge the principle  inherited from colonizedtimes  of the inviolability of borders; they would attempt toresolve the ethnic conflicts in the region by distributingland here and there — all this to the detriment of Zaire.This approach shows that a political issue underlies thewhole problem. Either we are dealing with refugees  in thetrue sense of the word  and then their massive presence andthe destruction they have wrought in our country cause ourpeople a serious safety and security problem — whichwould entitle us to invoke the exception envisaged in theDeclaration on Territorial Asylum; or we are dealing withpeople quietly expelled from their country for political andethnic reasons  in which case  since no constitution in theworld would allow a country to expel its citizens for ethnicor political reasons  we do not have to accept thesecastaways of “ethnic cleansing”. That is why  in order thatthe pretext of Zaire’s supposed attempt to destabilizeRwanda not give certain countries the opportunity to carryout a plot against my country  Zaire — in the wake of thelifting of the arms embargo on Rwanda  which was decidedon by the Security Council  and in the face of thejeopardizing of our national security and the serious threatsthat face our population — resorted to one of the existinginternational instruments concerning refugees  namelyGeneral Assembly resolution 2312 (XXII)  of 14December 1967  the Declaration on Territorial Asylum  tourge the international community and the United Nationsto shoulder their responsibilities  because Zaire does nothave the means to bear alone the burden of the massivepresence of refugees in its territory  particularly since itis on the eve of holding elections.I would recall  since much has been said about this that the second preambular paragraph of the Declarationon Territorial Asylum states that a person faced withpersecution“has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countriesasylum from persecution”and paragraph 1 of article 3 states that such a person shallnot be“subjected to measures such as rejection at theborder or  if he has already entered the territory inwhich he seeks asylum  expulsion or compulsoryreturn”.Since 1960  Zaire has been taking in refugees fromRwanda — sometimes Tutsi  sometimes Hutu — and wehave always followed that provision to the letter. Butparagraph 2 of article 3 states:“Exception may be made to the foregoing principleonly for overriding reasons of national security or inorder to safeguard the population  as in the case ofa mass influx of persons”.And if a State should decide that  for whateverreason  an exception to that provision is justified  it can“consider the possibility of granting to the personconcerned an opportunity of going to another State” and can then bring this matter before the internationalcommunity.This is precisely the situation that Zaire found itselfin. It decided to be an exception to the principle  and soinformed the Secretary-General and the Security Councilof the United Nations. Countries wishing to take in theserefugees are welcome to do so  but Zaire refuses tocontinue to be accused of destabilizing Rwanda simplybecause we accepted 3 million Rwandese on our land. We6wish to cut out at the root the trumped-up charges againstour country. In this way  the international community willbe able to judge better our determination to live in peacewith our neighbours.However  acceding to the request by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the Zaire Government heldtalks with Mrs. Sadako Ogata  the head of the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  and asked her to organize  on the UNHCR level a voluntary repatriation  on a massive and uninterruptedscale  of the refugees to their countries of origin  so that by31 December 1995 all of the refugees would have returnedhome.The international community has an obligation to helpRwanda and Burundi to deal with the problems ofrepatriation and reinsertion of their nationals. During ourlast meeting in Geneva on 25 September 1995  we agreedwith Rwanda’s Minister of Rehabilitation and with Mrs.Ogata on the modalities for repatriating the refugees by 31December  to the tune of 8 000 to 10 000 persons per day at various points of entry  which were identified —Shangugu  Kiseni or Gibumba.We can think of no Government that would hesitate asto what course to take if it had to choose between therequirements of international solidarity and those of nationalsecurity and the protection of its population.To judge by the information that appears in theinternational press  the impression that some wish to giveof Zaire is that it is a hell where it would not be verypleasant to live.Zaireans are human beings. Like human beingsanywhere  some are good and some are bad  some not sogood and not so bad. We are also a people. Whatever onethinks of me personally  or of any other politician in mycountry  this cannot be allowed to discredit an entirepeople  or affect the image of my people as a whole.When many fled the horrors and the violence of war it was to the “hell” of Zaire that they chose to come andlive. But one might well wonder what would become ofpeace in Central Africa if Zaire were incapable ofmanaging conflicts between tribes — we have more than450  as well as our other internal political problems — andif it exploded like Rwanda  spilling our 47 million peopleinto neighbouring countries.For countries such as ours  that have experienced thewhole range of turbulence that a people can know —above and beyond the colonial period  which more or lesspersisted into the first years of independence  and theprice of building a post-colonial State in conformity withthe aspirations of our people — there is no greater goodin the world than peace. Without it  all illusions aside progress and development are out of the question.In the name of peace  every State must be fullyresponsible for its people and must learn to live with itsown national contradictions and refrain from obligingothers to bear the burden of its incapacity to managethose contradictions. Otherwise  the internationalcommunity  both at the regional and global levels  mustcome to its aid to develop its capacity to resolve itsproblems without inflicting further wounds  and above allwithout inflicting them on other countries  developingcountries like our own  whose resources are needed forother purposes.The international community thus has the duty andshould have the courage to impose peace andreconciliation in the Great Lakes region and state clearlyits refusal to countenance the drift towards exclusion andethnicity.Zaire shelters many African refugees on its territoryand  out of a sense of common humanity and anappreciation of our historic ties with its neighbours decided to take in our Rwandese brothers. But we can nolonger pay for the tragedies that are engulfing ourneighbours  with all their economic and securityrepercussions on our border population.As I have said  we believe the internationalcommunity must do all it can to reassure our people byhelping the Governments of Rwanda and Burundi to makeall the necessary provisions to guarantee the speedy returnof the refugees and their reintegration in their homeland.We reaffirm here our resolve to work for the restorationof a climate of peace in our subregion and to make ourcontribution towards all the efforts at reconciliation aimedat strengthening mutual confidence and security there.But we can no longer cope alone with thoserefugees. We can no longer shoulder alone thehumanitarian burden imposed upon us by humanitarianprinciples and the agreements we have signed.On behalf of my Government  I should like to takethis opportunity to thank Mrs. Sadako Ogata and the7Executive Committee of the High Commissioner forRefugees for the efforts they have been making withlimited resources to solve the problem of refugees in theGreat Lakes region and for their assistance in rehabilitatingthe Bukavu airport and the port of Uvira.Our thanks also go to the member States of theEuropean Union which have pledged contributions for therepair of roads in North and South Kivu in advance of theorganization of elections.In the 1960s  few governing structures in the countriesof the South demonstrated particular interest in orattachment to the close connection that exists betweendemocracy and development; democracy and human rights;and human rights and development.With the passage of time  the difficult experience ofmanagement has taught us some lessons. It makes moresense to manage growth and wealth than degradation andpoverty; it is not enough to consume what others produce but one should learn to produce what one consumes;inheriting infrastructure and ways of life conceived byothers is one thing  but conceiving one’s own communalapproach to life and to fix one’s own limits for oneself isanother.In all things  it is the individual that remains the focusand the medium. An individual whose rights and freedomsare flouted  who is aware that he does not count in nationalaffairs  drifts away from the ruling circles and from thenational effort for development imposed on him fromabove  from policies out of touch with his own daily life.Many of our countries have  in the course of the last 30years  experienced the indifference of the individual whoserights and freedoms were left out of account.Today  in the light of the economic and socialcollapse  that link between human rights  democracy anddevelopment is understood and acknowledged. It is not justbecause of what was said at the conference at La Baule  butbecause of the importance and the intensity of the messagewe heard at La Baule  that the process of democratizationin Africa must also be understood as an act of awareness of self-awareness. That is how this process becomes trulyirreversible.In the Republic of Zaire  five years of difficulttransition have done considerable damage at the political economic and social levels. That is why we have not beenable to play our full part in the arena of free nations.Domestically  we have not been fully able to shoulder ourresponsibilities to deal with the socio-economicrequirements of our people.But now we have decided to bury the past and toassume our duties to the full and to offer our contributionto the solution of problems facing the internationalcommunity  if it be only through our analysis of thesituation.We intend to strengthen ties with all friendlycountries  particularly our traditional friends  in findingtogether appropriate solutions to the problems which havebeset our relations. At the same time  we mean to givesustained  real and useful meaning to the diversificationof our external relations in the field of development.Internally  through another kind of management  ofwhich the Prime Minister spoke in September 1994  andin the context of restored liberties  we intend to meet theaspirations of our people to a better quality of life. Thisis a matter of priority.Democracy does not mean licence  and the state oflaws implies that all citizens are subject withoutdiscrimination to the law. In our countries  educating asmany people as possible  changing the way people think raising the general level of education and political anddemocratic awareness — all of these draw upon thelimited financial resources of the State to strengthen following the forthcoming elections  democracy and thestate of law and of progress.While the Government is seeking to createconditions of legal security and an economic environmentfavourable to the creation of fruitful partnerships andmutually advantageous cooperation  we want to count onour external partners and the international financialinstitutions — in short  on the international community —to take up with us the challenge of development. Thepresent institutional order in our country conforms to thedesires of our people as expressed through its politicalclass as a whole  and is designed to extricate us from thecrisis rationally and methodically. But our efforts alonewill not suffice. That is why we seek aid to accompanythe process of democratization  because  unfortunately  thesupport of the people for political scenarios is alsoimportant to finding a solution to their daily concerns.As the Manila Declaration emphasizes  by mutualsupport  the internal and external forces that endanger thenew democracy can be overcome. The United Nationsthus has a duty to support efforts by Governments 8including ours  to promote or consolidate new orre-established democracies.The eradication of extreme poverty in all countries particularly developing countries  has become one of thepriority development goals of the 1990s  in keeping withresolutions 47/196 and 47/197. The year 1996 has beenproclaimed International Year for the Eradication ofPoverty. This honours our Organization.Over the past 50 years  the United Nations has madeserious efforts to intensify international economiccooperation. In particular  it has adopted the Charter ofEconomic Rights and Duties of States and the Declarationand Programme of Action on the Establishment of a NewInternational Economic Order based on justice and equity.None the less  the trade relations between the developedand the developing countries continue to show an imbalancewhich  having been allowed to persist and grow  is today areal threat to peace everywhere.In Africa  efforts made at the national  subregional andregional levels to break out of the vicious cycle of povertyhave not been sufficiently supported by the internationalcommunity. Stricken by an unprecedented crisis  Africa hasfor years groaned under the weight of its debt. It hassuffered the effects of lowered commodity prices  of thedeterioration in the terms of trade  of protectionism in thedeveloped countries  and of a drop in official developmentassistance.The debt is a major hindrance to economic growth anddevelopment in Africa. The heavy debt burden absorbs onethird of our countries’ export earnings and represents aserious drain on resources which would otherwise haveserved to finance growth and development.In order to implement economic reform  stabilizationand structural adjustment programmes and to eradicatepoverty  the debtor developing countries need to mobilizethe resources necessary to their efforts. They also need newsupplies of financial resources and concessional financialassistance from creditor countries and multilateral financialinstitutions.Debt relief is becoming increasingly unavoidable ifnational resources are to be freed up to support activitiesnecessary to social development. The responsibilities whichdebt and debt servicing impose on our developing countriesare so alarming that we must apply ourselves withparticular inventiveness and urgency to the search forsolutions to the problems to which they give rise. Theyrequire a leap of imagination.That is why we feel it to be necessary and urgent toassess the progress made in the various United Nationsbodies in the establishment of a new internationaleconomic order  so that  in response to the results of thisassessment  we can take appropriate measures to promotedevelopment in developing countries and internationaleconomic cooperation.The Republic of Zaire hopes that  at this session  theGeneral Assembly  in the framework of agenda item 96(c)  on the external debt crisis and development  will takeinto consideration the recommendations made by thenon-aligned countries at their meeting in Jakarta from 13to 15 August 1994. It may find therein ways and meansof resolving the problem of the debt of developingcountries and of promoting their harmonious development.Everyone knows that the external debt of thedeveloping countries cannot be absorbed at its currentlevel without the cooperation of the developed countriesand the international financial institutions  which mustagree on the establishment of a new world economicorder that would take the vital interests of its partners intoaccount. The countries of the North would also benefit bymaking an additional effort to understand that the debtorcountries can only honour their debt-service obligationsaccording to their financial capacities. In the currentsituation  compelling them to meet all their financialcommitments could end up in a collapse of theireconomies  despite all their good-faith efforts.1995 has been proclaimed World Year of Peoples’Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World Warand Member States have been called upon solemnly tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of theSecond World War. This year we will also consider andassess mid-way the Declaration of the 1990s as the ThirdDisarmament Decade.How can we commemorate the victims of theSecond World War today without also giving thought tothe victims of the wars in the former Yugoslavia  Liberia Somalia  Rwanda  Burundi and elsewhere? When will wecommemorate the victims of those wars? There is nodestruction of human life that is more appropriate thanany other. The United Nations was supposed to savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war — butwhich war  what kind of war? True  the kind of warfought from 1939 to 1945 has not recurred  but can we9assert today that mankind has mastered the arts of peace?It is in men’s minds that the instinct for war must bereplaced by the spirit of peace if the world is to be savedfrom the scourge of war. If it is not  any progress we havemade will remain fragile.The United Nations offers us the opportunity toconsider from a global perspective the questions of war peace and security. It remains an essential instrument forachieving the objectives of arms control and disarmament.But situations of conflict and tension must be preventedmore effectively. An efficient system of collective securitythat allows States to reduce their military capacities must beput in place. It is no longer enough to limit arms andpromote disarmament by regulating weaponry andestablishing the balance of power at lower levels. We feelthat that is not the way to achieve the goal of developmentfor all  which is the new major challenge facing the UnitedNations.We must reinvent trust in international relations. Wemust make a new creative effort to ensure that disarmamentgoes hand-in-hand with the achievement of peace  securityand development throughout the world. In this context  webelieve that the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use of ChemicalWeapons and on Their Destruction — the first global andtruly verifiable disarmament treaty — offers a worthwhileavenue. Indeed  it carries a security gain for all Statesthrough the total elimination of an entire category ofweapons of mass destruction. We hope that this Conventionwill soon have the required number of ratifications to enterinto force and thus become a standard shared by all States.Since the inclusion in the General Assembly’s agenda in 1973  of the item on the restitution of works of art tocountries victims of expropriation  we have noted withsatisfaction the continued and growing interest in this itemshown by Members of the United Nations. In addition tobilateral negotiations for the restitution of cultural property we now have the Convention on the Means of Prohibitingand Preventing the Illicit Import  Export and Transfer ofOwnership of Cultural Property  to which the number ofStates Parties continues to grow.However  the quantity and quality of the culturalproperty “returned” or restored are insignificant comparedto the importance which the General Assembly attaches tothe item. Promises made to Zaire by countries which stillhold works of art and other cultural treasures belonging toZaire  as well as museum pieces and archives that areessential to preserving and nourishing cultural values have not been fully kept.We call on the Secretary-General  in cooperationwith the Director-General of the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  to doeverything possible to encourage those countries tohonour their obligations so that the objectives of theUnited Nations and the countries of origin can be met.I wish the General Assembly every success to thework of its fiftieth session and I wish the United Nationsa long life."
"35",1483,"COG",50,1995,"The General Assembly’s choice of Mr. Freitas doAmaral to serve as President at this fiftieth session is afitting tribute to his eminent qualities and to the role hiscountry  Portugal  has always played in internationalrelations. I would like to congratulate him on behalf of mydelegation and assure him of our cooperation.We are grateful to his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  for the skilful way in which he reflectedand conveyed our concerns throughout his mandate.I would like to reaffirm the profound gratitude of theGovernment of Congo to the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the concern he showed to finda settlement to the political crisis that overwhelmed mycountry in the first two years after the democratic electionof Professor Pascal Lissouba as President of the Republic.Despite the fact that the United Nations inherited thedifficulties of what were often troubled times and despiteits often controversial role  it remains the repository ofhope for the peoples of the world. The fiftieth anniversaryis a fitting time to look at what the Organization’sexperience has taught us so that we may be able toestablish a more confident and optimistic idea of how theOrganization and mankind as a whole will move into thethird millennium.This session with its inherent symbolism  coming asit does at an exceptional period in the development ofinternational relations  places us squarely between thefading dogmas that for a long time seemed to inspire theperfect system of management and human development and the universal desire of the most destitute people forgreater political freedom  development and the assertionof their moral and cultural identity.As countries once subjected to ideological  politicaland economic domination move steadfastly forward  theUnited Nations remains  as ever  the ideal vehicle forpreventing upheaval from shattering world peace.In other words  faced with the new world situation this celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization can be analysed only in terms of a breakwith the past and a time to take stock of new realities inthe face of the overriding need to establish newmachinery to govern the international community.The various scenes rightly described for us from thisrostrum undoubtedly show the world as it is and as wewould like it to be. I  therefore  endorse the concerns andproposals voiced here  particularly  as regards therestructuring of the United Nations system  the Agendafor Development. There are so many seemingly self-evident issues that will  I am sure  enjoy the consensualsupport of all delegations  as happened at the recentUnited Nations conferences  which have given our States25a platform from which to deal with the major problems ofthe world.From Rio to Beijing  via Vienna  Cairo andCopenhagen  we have established priorities and madecommitments that we hope will be translated into action.As the Secretary-General of the United Nations rightlynoted in his report “An Agenda for Development”  peace isthe foundation for development. The persistence of hotbedsof tension in certain parts of the world is not conducive tothe emergence of new prosperous nations. Quite thecontrary  in the absence of peace  these hotbeds of tensionthwart prospects for development more and more every day.In this context  we should encourage the peoples ofAngola and Liberia to continue along the difficult path tonational reconciliation after the several years of fratricidalcivil war they have endured.We must be gratified by the strengthening of the peaceprocess in the Middle East through the Israeli-Palestinianagreement of 28 September 1995.We should  finally  hail the recent developments in thesituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina marked by the effortsof the parties to the conflict to seek ways and means toachieve peace.Unfortunately  while expressing our satisfaction at therestoration of the democratic regime following the coupd’état in Sao Tome  thanks to international condemnation we must denounce from this lofty rostrum  any seizure ofpower by armed force as has just happened once again inthe Comoros.Finally  we would like to express our great concern atthe instability and insecurity that persist in Africa particularly in the countries of the Great Lakes.The situation in that part of the African continent is ahuman tragedy. There  as elsewhere in Africa whereviolence is rampant  ethnic hatred and intolerance havecaused massive flows of refugees to flee to neighbouringcountries.This is what has happened in Zaire  a fraternal andneighbouring country which  from this rostrum  appealedfor solidarity from the international community in helpingit to overcome the consequences of this tragedy withrespect for human dignity. We express the hope that thisappeal will be heeded by the entire internationalcommunity.In the face of all this  it is not difficult to understandwhy Congo cannot fail to support the idea of holding aconference on peace and stability in that region. We wishto state that we are ready  as are other members of theUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa  to go along with thisinitiative in accordance with the Brazzaville Declarationon cooperation for peace and security in Central Africa.This Declaration  adopted after the Committee’s seventhmeeting on 1 September 1995  is truly a profession offaith  in which States reaffirm their determination to worktowards the establishment of confidence  peace andsecurity in the Central African region.The valuable support which the United NationsSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hasconstantly given to our Committee has contributed to thefruitful results our States have achieved. Furthermore  thissupport guarantees success in achieving the objectives ofestablishing a collective security system in Central Africa.We thank him once again.Today  as in the past  the limits and sluggishness ofmost of the States of the African continent remainunchanged. They are due  on the one hand  to the overalltrend towards acceptance of stereotypes and  on the otherhand  to the fact that the requirements of modern timesare out of kilter with the basic values underpinning oursocieties.Therefore  the democratization of institutional life which we have embraced victoriously also seems to be abreeding-ground for long-contained contradictions. Here they manifest themselves as conflict  even fratricidal wars.My own country  Congo  has not been spared these post-democratic upheavals and vagaries.Allow me to refrain from any dire descriptionswhich the images of the tragedy experienced by thepeople of Congo would conjure up. This is because I takegreat pride in expressing the hope of a new Africanpolitical class  to which I belong  that it will be able tofollow in the footsteps of great democratic nations andbanish evil for ever.This new generation would like to pioneer newgovernance. By that I mean a new way of exercisingpower  unflawed by hereditary belligerent instincts  thattakes account of the psychological and moral aspects of26our civilization and the specific features of the societalenvironment without jeopardizing the universal values thatguarantee life with dignity.In truth  I would like to invite everyone here to sharein the heartfelt cry of the citizen of a country which  havingembarked on the road to the democratization of itsinstitutions and thus the free choice by the people of theirleaders  has turned its back on wanton and barbaricviolence.This violence was dictated by the obsession withpower on the part of those who lost the elections — powerat all costs  absolute power. Other examples on the Africancontinent support this grim picture.The mid-term review of the democratizationprocess — a review that began in Africa three years ago —prompts me to put the following questions to the Assembly in view of our societies’ crisis situation:With respect to multi-ethnic States  is it legitimate toassume that the mere codification of constitutional normscopied from older democracies is sufficient to transformfeudal entities into democratic ones and so move on to amarket economy  and to move from autocratic tribal rule tothat of intellectual and political elites chosen for their keensense of duty in the service of nations?Is it legitimate to believe and accept that simplysubordinating our assistance to African countries to theneed for their democratization will suffice to persuade theirformer leaders — who for two or three decades governedour States without opposition or any sharing of power — ofthe virtues of democracy?Such a change  in our view  can take place only aspart of a lengthy process. Furthermore  an undoubtedrequirement is that Africa accede to democracy byconducting an in-depth analysis of its contemporarypolitical history and then adopt rules for politicalgovernance that have consensus as a necessary dimension rules that can ensure power-sharing by the major politicalgroups and the necessary stability for democraticinstitutions. In this connection  my country’s experience hasbeen a sort of litmus test.No solution could have been found without thepersonal and unwavering dedication of the President of ourRepublic  His Excellency Mr. Pascal Lissouba  whosewisdom and keen sense of dialogue served as a catalyst. Onthe basis of our own social values  traditions  realities andhistory  our Head of State  without underestimating therelevance of the principle that elections are necessary todemocracy  has assumed the role of a real paterfamilias gathering around him Congolese people of everypersuasion.In this spirit  at the initiative of the President of theRepublic  a Forum on the Culture of Peace  organizedjointly by the Congolese Government and the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)  was held in November 1994 in Brazzaville.The decisions taken there have enabled us to make a freshstart. Two of them pertain to the reorganization of thepolice  with a view to better adapting it to its traditionaltask as a republican police force  and to the restoration ofthe power of the judiciary.Several months later  following politicalconsultations  a broader Government that included theopposition was set up. The current power-sharing betweenthose who represent institutional legitimacy by virtue ofbeing elected and those who did not receive the popularvote attests to a consensual undertaking based on the ideaof participatory democracy. This approach is rooted in themanner in which our village communities were longgoverned and reduces the sources of conflict thataccession to power could have triggered.A democratization process that unfolds in this wayhas the necessary resources at its disposal to bear fruit  ifthere is peace. The quest for peace is therefore a crucialrequirement for our States. The democratization ofinstitutions will remain a pipe dream if there is no will on the part either of the African political elites or of theinternational community  to approach the democraticprocess in Africa in a manner that takes into account boththe quality of the political classes that governed fromindependence until the beginning of democratization andthe need to restore peace where obstacles are placed in itspath or it is directly threatened.In order to put the idea of participatory democracyinto effect  the Congolese Government  once peace hadbeen restored  began a national programme ofadministrative and economic decentralization in order toenable the various political forces to exercise politicalpower at a more grass-roots level. Today  town  villageand regional councils have been established that take partin the decentralized governance of various communities.Thus  decentralization is a prime example of one of themajor steps in power-sharing.27But in the final analysis  in Congo as elsewhere inAfrica — especially in Central Africa — peace remainsfragile. It is still  to all intents and purposes  at the mercyof the political appetites of those who believe that  in thename of democracy and regardless of the people’s choice they have the divine right to be in power and the obligationto oppose those who accede to it.This observation led me to ask the seventh ministerialmeeting of the United Nations Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa  whichwas held in Brazzaville from 28 August to 1 September1995 and over which I had the honour of presiding  to thinkabout the following point.Democracy  which we all wholeheartedly aspire to will be doomed to failure if we do not take the wisedecision to equip ourselves with not only the necessaryintellectual means but also  and above all  the political willto reflect on the kind of government our countries shouldhave in the world of today. This reflection must necessarilybe based on history and on the moral and legal rules thathave provided our various communities with peace  stabilityand respect for the rights of the individual and for propertyrights. Such reflection will be useful  I believe  if we are tospare our peoples the ordeal of fratricidal wars.Clearly  democracy cannot be a source of peace ortake hold lastingly in our countries if accession to politicalpower on the part of a group of persons is regarded byother members of the international community as theexercise of power by one ethnic group or a coalition ofethnic groups. Likewise  to exercise moderation andrestraint is the moral duty of those who win elections andwho wield power. This is a crucial requirement in order togive a feeling of security to those whose past politicalpractices have left them convinced that they can be inpower only if one or several members of their own ethnicgroup or of their region are also involved. This is the evilthat has been eating away at Africa and at its path towardstrue democratization.In fact  a democratic regime is without any doubt theone that will enable our countries to promote the flourishingof their elites and to ensure their development and safety.However  as members will note  our collective aspiration togreater freedom and equality has at times borne the seedsof destruction. This is because the transplant that thesurgeons of democracy thought they needed to performautomatically on Africa — without taking into account thepossibility that certain of its elements might be rejected —has come up against our own social realities  which arecharacterized by the fact that for all time  and especiallysince independence  politics has been  and remains  theroyal road to upward social mobility.In such an environment  the rotation of power —one of the basic rules of classic democratic regimes — isperceived as a way of marginalizing that part of thecommunity that loses the political elections. The rule ofthe rotation of power  which is perceived and applied bythe winners of elections as a means of removing frompower those who have lost — which in older democraciesis a normal occurrence — is viewed in our countries asa source of conflict  as my own country’s example shows.In such circumstances  should not the establishmentof a democratic regime in our countries be understood  inthe context of a consensual vision of governance  as atransitory stage towards a democracy that would includethe classic concept of the rotation of power?It would seem wise today to tackle the democraticphenomenon by including in the rules and in the basicfoundation of democracy a peacemaking dimension that while stemming from our socio-political realities and ourown world view  would fit into a global framework. Therotation of political power would  in this transitionalstage  take on a new  less conflictual dimension  whileremaining one of the elements of genuine democracy.Such an approach would confer greater legitimacy onthose who are elected.The international community is therefore once againcalled upon to help Africa bring peace to itself and toprovide itself with stable democratic regimes. This is theonly way that Africa’s development can be achieved.May this historic session of the General Assemblybe a decisive turning-point for new victories ushering ina better world and an Africa moving forward towardsdemocracy and progress.The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.28"
"36",1530,"COL",50,1995,"On behalf of my Government I congratulateMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session a crucial time in the history of the Organization. I shouldlike at the outset to express our full readiness to make amajor contribution to the success of the deliberations underhis leadership.I should also like to express our appreciation andgratitude to Minister Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire for hisexcellent performance as President of the General Assemblyat its forty-ninth session.The peoples of the world believed that the end of thecold war would bring peace and prosperity — and they arestill waiting. Indeed the changes that have taken place ininternational relations have not been accompanied bychanges of a similar magnitude in the relations between theindustrialized North and the impoverished South. On thecontrary  the situation of developing countries  far fromhaving improved  is deteriorating further. The internationaltrade system does not meet the expectations that therewould be access to markets and transparency in the rules ofthe game. Poverty has not been reduced  socialdevelopment is at a standstill  the scientific andtechnological development of the South continues to lagand the external debt problem is still a heavy burden on oureconomies.It is our duty now to realize the dream of those whowrote the San Francisco Charter — something that has beenpostponed for 50 years by a cold war and dozens ofregional conflicts and overshadowed by the grief of thevictims of armed conflicts.The period of transition through which theinternational system is passing should not lead us to acceptso-called unilateral solutions to problems that are global innature nor to permit the emergence of a new era ofintervention in matters that lie within the domesticjurisdiction of States. There is an imperative need toconcert policies and coordinate strategies to faceinternational problems and to foster constructive linksbetween North and South.The United Nations  which was a stage for the coldwar  must now cooperate in eradicating poverty  inmaking sustainable human development viable  inguaranteeing equality of rights between men and womenand in giving full effect to human rights — in otherwords  it must work on behalf of human beings — allhuman beings — without distinction of any kindwhatsoever. The United Nations has the responsibility tostrive to make the hopes and expectations that arose at theend of the cold war a reality and not the source of newfrustrations.The current situation requires a modern UnitedNations attuned to the new times  a pluralistic anddemocratic Organization that will be an instrument for thepromotion of a world order that can make the right todevelopment a reality and achieve peace. The building ofa new international system to replace the hegemonic weapons-based and unilateral practices of the past is agoal towards which we must work from within thisOrganization.The international system we aspire to create is onecompatible with interdependence and autonomy  with thestrengthening of the international organization and withfull respect for the sovereign equality of States  onecompatible with economic development and devoted tothe significant improvement of the living conditions of thepoorest segments of the population.It is indispensable to forge a new economic modelthat can satisfy the needs of our people  one characterizedby social justice and equity  efficiency andcompetitiveness. At the same time  we are convinced thatgenuine and representative democracy  free from foreigninterference  must be the key element in preserving peaceand observing the basic principles of respect for thefundamental rights of the human person and of economicand social development.For the preservation of peace  security andinternational stability it is indispensable that the nuclear-weapon States act responsibly and immediatelydiscontinue nuclear testing. In this regard  we deplore therecent nuclear tests that have been carried out notwithstanding the opposition of the internationalcommunity to that practice.Next month the Eleventh Summit Meeting of themembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries willtake place in Cartagena de Indias  Colombia. My countrylooks forward to the attendance of leaders of developing32nations and is prepared to shoulder the creative challengeof presiding over the Movement for the next three years.In recent decades  under the leadership of HisExcellency President Soeharto of Indonesia  the Non-Aligned Movement adopted a new course  one in tune withcurrent reality  abandoning the confrontational context infavour of cooperation as the central focus of its action. Weshall continue to pursue that task with enthusiasm.With the same determination with which it succeededin its struggle against colonialism  the non-aligned countriesmust now face the challenge of eradicating poverty andclosing the vast gap between rich and poor and betweendeveloped and developing countries.In the twenty-first century non-alignment will mean acommitment to peace and to the well-being and progress ofour peoples  as well as action against poverty andmarginalization. It will also entail a commitment tocooperation in dealing with global problems and a strugglefor participation and against unilateralism and imposition.In facing the next century  non-alignment mustparticipate actively in the reform of internationalinstitutions  including the United Nations and the BrettonWoods institutions. Non-alignment must also promote theneeded changes in the structures of cooperation and thedynamic modalities by which developed countries andinternational institutions provide resources for theimplementation of projects and programmes of South-Southcooperation.One of the global problems that calls for an effectivemultilateral strategy headed by the United Nations is that ofillegal drugs. This is not an issue that can be dealt with bya single country or small group of nations. This is atransnational crime of vast proportions  overwhelmingdimensions and the greatest perils. It is a crime withoutnationality.We Colombians have suffered more than anyone fromthe devastating effects of this problem. We have suffereddeath and corruption as a consequence of the huge profitsto be derived from this illegal activity. We find itsurprising  therefore  to note that the internationalcommunity is not fully aware of the real nature anddimensions of the problem of illicit drugs.We are dealing with an illegal economic activity withdimensions that have been compared with those of the oilindustry. It is seven or eight times greater than the grossnational product of a nation like Colombia; it operates indozens of countries and entails a number of linkedactivities  including money laundering and the deviationof chemical precursors. Such linked activities generallytake place in developed countries and are as important asthe growing of coca leaves or their transformation intococaine.Many studies indicate an increase in theconsumption of illegal drugs in industrialized countries aswell as an increase in new markets throughout the world.World statistics demonstrate that deaths from drug abusehave trebled since 1988 and that an increase of 1000 percent has been observed in medical emergencies due tococaine overdose between 1978 and 1993.My country has battled  with more success than anyother  against the producers of and traffickers in illegaldrugs. Colombia eradicated marihuana crops in the 1970s destroyed the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s and dismantledthe Cali Cartel in the 1990s.Colombia is responsible for more than 50 per cent ofthe poppy crops eradicated worldwide and for theconfiscation of more than a quarter of the total amount ofcocaine and cocaine base seized globally.The eradication of illegal crops in Colombia must beaccompanied by similar efforts to bring about theeradication of marihuana crops in other countries including in some industrialized countries in the North.During the first year of President Ernesto Samper’sAdministration  the anti-drug cartel policy has producedresults that no prior administration in Colombia  or in anyother nation  has been able to achieve.Thanks to Colombia’s success  the world now has ahistoric opportunity to defeat drug trafficking once andfor all. Yet this opportunity could be missed if adequatemeasures are not immediately adopted to combat moneylaundering  the deviation of precursor chemicals andpermissive consumption.My country has proposed creating a special unit ofthe Economic and Social Council to oversee measures ofinternational cooperation  the adoption of an inter-American convention against money laundering and theconvening in 1997 of an international conference toevaluate the results of the Vienna Convention and tomake the necessary adjustments to it.33There is still time for the international community toface up to its responsibility to bring about the final defeatof this international scourge."
"37",1655,"CRI",50,1995,"It is the honour of the delegation of CostaRica to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this historicsession marking the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. We are extremely pleased that a distinguishedson of Portugal  a country so closely linked to Latin4General Assembly 21st plenary meetingAmerica by history and culture  has been chosen for thishigh position. We offer you our full cooperation in theperformance of your important duties.We wish to express to Member States the gratitude ofthe Government and the people of Costa Rica for havingelected our country to one of the vice-presidencies of theAssembly. That election is a significant honour.It also gives me pleasure to join previous speakers inthanking the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  for the splendid way inwhich he performed his duties as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session.Costa Rica wishes to convey its recognition of theindefatigable work carried out by the Secretary-General andby other Secretariat officials towards peace and security.The devoted efforts of the Secretary-General to championa safer  fairer  more peaceful and more humane world forfuture generations will be a great legacy for mankind  alongwith his determination to transform and modernize theOrganization and carry it into the future.Fifty years ago  Mr. Julio Acosta  former President ofthe Republic and Minister for Foreign Affairs of CostaRica  who headed our country’s delegation to the UnitedNations Conference on International Organization at SanFrancisco  said that the future of the world lay with theCharter of the United Nations  which was the mostimportant human document of the last 1 000 years. That indeed  is what it has been  at least over the last 50 years despite the many difficulties  the many frustrations  themany conflicts. The Charter of the United Nations has seta new course for mankind and has provided theinternational community with an ethical code that growsstronger every day.Costa Rica  a founding Member of the Organization is firmly committed to the United Nations  in accordancewith its long-standing regime of democracy and respect forhuman rights. The values and principles which give shapeto this Organization were an integral part of Costa Ricanlife many years before the San Francisco Conference. Withthe abolition of the armed forces in 1948  our countryrenewed its faith in law and its hope that reason  not force would govern relations among human beings. With thatdecision of President José Figueres  Costa Rica addressedthe world and declared peace. With the same thought inmind  the Government of Costa Rica has promoted manyUnited Nations initiatives in support of peace and humanrights  including the establishment of the University forPeace  the declaration of the International Year of Peaceand the creation of the office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. All these ideas areaimed at realizing mankind’s dream of sustainable peace.In the spirit of commemorating in deeds the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization  Costa Rica proposed aWorld Week of Peace  to begin on 24 October this year.This initiative  sponsored by a large number of countriesand unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on12 July 1995  would silence weapons everywhere in theworld for at least a week  so that in the future sustainablepeace might prevail over destructive war. Costa Ricahopes that during the Week all Member States will carryout pro-peace activities and reflect on how important it isfor mankind to learn to live under the sign of concord.My delegation is aware of the practical constraints thatstand in the way of the World Week of Peace achievingits goals on the desired scale. However  it is our beliefthat any move that could be taken this week to promotedialogue  coexistence and harmony between nations wouldbe a valuable contribution to the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations and to the building ofthe future. The effort will have been worthwhile if evenone human being — a child  a woman or a man — issaved from death as a result of this initiative.There are no conflicts without solutions. All groundis fertile for reconciliation. How many tears were shed inSouth Africa  how much blood was spilled in the MiddleEast! However  animosity has gradually disappeared andharmony is beginning to flourish. Multicultural democracyis giving a new and peaceful direction to the history ofSouth Africa. With the recent agreement on the WestBank  Israelis and Palestinians continue to show thatpeace is always possible. If there is a will for peace peace can be achieved. In that context  the United Nationsmust continue to be the forum where all the peoples ofthe world have fair representation. No country should beexcluded from becoming a Member of this Organization.For many years  the world prevented a generalconflagration by resorting to containment. Today although the East-West confrontation has dissipated  andpreventive diplomacy is making headway  there are stilllatent seeds of world conflict  concentrated in the sub-human conditions in which a large portion of the world’spopulation live  and evident also in the massive decay ofthe environment.The urgent need to solve senseless conflicts such asthe one in the former Yugoslavia and to end the violence5General Assembly 21st plenary meetingbesetting so many places in the world should not make uslose sight of the fact that true peace involves a series ofelements much more significant than the mere absence ofwar. As has been recently stated by His Holiness Pope JohnPaul II  who offered to the world such a beautiful messageof hope and goodwill today from this Hall “... peace is not limited to the silence of cannons. It isnourished with justice and freedom. It needs theatmosphere of a spirit rich in some fundamentalelements  such as the sense of God  the taste forbeauty  the love of truth  the choice of solidarity  andthe capacity for tenderness and the courage toforgive.”The fiftieth anniversary of the Organization is anoccasion for reflection  but we should also use it tomeditate on the challenge of our times: to achievesustainable development.In Central America we have committed ourselvesfirmly to a comprehensive peace process anddemocratization  in a regional effort to build peace anddemocracy where these are needed  and to strengthen themwhere they already exist. This journey is culminating todayin the encouraging advances experienced in the dialogue inGuatemala. Costa Rica is optimistic about the efforts to finda lasting peaceful solution to the problem involving thatbrotherly country. We give our full support to thenegotiation process being developed to that end under theauspices of the United Nations.Central Americans  who for many years havesuccessfully advocated this process of peace anddemocratization  are today also committed to an alliance togenerate in our region a new model of development combining freedom and the well-being of the vast majority with respect for the natural environment. This CentralAmerican commitment to the region itself and to theinternational community is being implemented throughvarious actions and development projects. We hope that theinternational community as a whole will understand andappreciate Central America’s effort  and will lend it itssupport  as several friendly nations have already done.As an integral part of the process of the consolidationof peace and the building of sustainable development respect for human rights is no longer just a legal and moralobligation of Governments; it has become an essentialcondition for harmonious life in every society. However we cannot disregard the fact that many situations in whichthese rights are still ignored or violated persist  making thetask of the relevant international bodies doubly important.It is not legal to violate human rights  but it is not rightto sit idly by  using the pretext of respect for sovereignty which is only hypothetical respect and borders oncomplicity.For Costa Rica  a party to the InternationalCovenants on this matter and the headquarters of theInter-American Court of Human Rights  it is essential thatthe United Nations assume a more dynamic and energeticrole in the protection of fundamental human rights andrequire from Member States strict compliance with theirresponsibilities in this area. For this purpose  protectiveentities  in particular the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  should beprovided with more resources. We must also strengthenmeasures against States which ignore therecommendations of those bodies  or prevent them fromperforming their duties.We are also concerned that overcoming the balanceof terror has not put an end to the arms race  and that isa matter of concern to us. We cannot understand why atthis time in history there are still countries which  withsurprising levity  destroy the environment and endangertheir neighbours with nuclear tests. This is a flagrantviolation of the commitments that marked the conclusionof the negotiations to extend the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and has a negativeeffect on the tasks related to the drafting of thecomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. Costa Rica hasnever possessed  and does not want to possess  nuclear orchemical weapons  and strongly urges participant Statesto speedily conclude negotiations on this treaty and toensure that it takes effect as soon as possible.However  the danger of a nuclear holocaust shouldnot make us unconcerned about the problems caused byconventional weapons  the traffic in which has a tragicimpact on the third world and keeps a series of veryharmful conflicts alive. Many Governments ofunderdeveloped countries continue to waste resources onweapons  resources needed desperately by their ownpeople for basic necessities. The democracies of theindustrialized world continue providing those weapons ina business which undoubtedly  on a short-term basis  isfinancially more profitable than cooperation fordevelopment.In 1994  relying on an initiative of the Governmentof Romania  a group of 25 countries proposed to theGeneral Assembly the adoption of a voluntary  global andnon-discriminatory code of conduct for the international6General Assembly 21st plenary meetingtransfer of weapons. My delegation believes that thissubject must be reactivated without delay and also thatconcrete action must be taken to make the Register ofConventional Weapons within the United Nations effective.The reduction of military spending has an immediaterepercussion on budget allocations for the promotion ofdevelopment and well-being. In Costa Rica  we learned thislesson almost half a century ago and we have had noreason since then to regret our decision. However  we alsobelieve that providing special treatment  such as cooperationfor development and the transfer of technology for peacefulpurposes  to countries which reduce military spendingwould be a great incentive  as has been suggested by OscarArias  a former President of Costa Rica and a Nobel PeacePrize Laureate in 1987.In the spirit of building a new world  a world betterthan the one that existed 50 years ago  the internationalcommunity has the duty to promote changes in the area ofinternational economic relations.In recent years  there have been significantreformulations in international trade plans. A World TradeOrganization has been created to replace the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade  and there has been aproliferation of regional free-trade plans. However  this hasnot dissipated the worrying trends towards protectionismthat are increasingly being developed by industrializednations. While the underdeveloped countries are applyingprogrammes with a view to the adjustment and the openingup of trade  the richest countries are imposing burdensomelimitations on trade. My delegation considers that the ninthsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD)  to be held in South Africa in1996  must become a fundamental forum for the discussionof these problems.Since the first meeting of UNCTAD  held in Genevain 1964  77 countries of the Third World have joined indemanding more equitable conditions in regard to worldtrade. The fight for this new international economic orderhas today become a priority because  even though themilitary-political blocs which divided the world in therecent past have now disappeared  the gap between Northand South is becoming ever greater. In the circumstances we consider that the presidency of the Group of 77 andChina  to which Costa Rica was appointed a few days ago is not only a great honour but also an importantresponsibility. Costa Rica is deeply grateful for the supportit received in achieving this significant position and wehope that in the performance of our duties we will make aconstructive contribution towards the launching of theGroup of 77 into the new international realities.For some years now  it has been suggested that thereis a need to redesign the United Nations in order to givethe Organization a new look in keeping with a differentworld situation. Costa Rica  on various occasions  hasexpressed its support for initiatives in this area  includingthe suggestion that Germany and Japan should becomepermanent members of the Security Council  and that weshould guarantee permanent representation for all regionsin that body. Today  on the occasion of the celebration ofthe fiftieth anniversary  we wish to reiterate Costa Rica’sfirm commitment to the renovation of the United Nations.It is urgent to take steps along the lines pointed out bythe Secretary-General in his “An Agenda for Peace” and“An Agenda for Development”  and it is important thatthe international system should comply with theresolutions of the General Assembly and the mandates ofthe Security Council. It is also essential to provide afollow-up to  and implement  the commitments made atthe Rio  Copenhagen and Beijing conferences.In celebrating the fifty years of its existence  theUnited Nations is still young. It remains young becauseits spirit is still generously irrigated with idealism andwith faith in mankind. The Organization remains youngbecause it still believes that the human being has a greatercapacity to convince than to shoot  to love than to hate to build than to destroy  to procreate than to kill.Let us preserve this essence of youth in ourOrganization. In 1995  as in 1945  in spite ofdisappointments  bitter days and years  the United Nationsrepresents the hope that there will be a future for ourchildren. The United Nations is the most importantdemonstration that there will be a future because thewords uttered in this Hall many years ago by the thenForeign Minister and later President of Costa Rica  DanielOduber  are still valid. He said that the United Nationshad revealed itself to be the only entity capable ofminimizing the sufferings which  alternating with thesatisfaction of being alive and of performing our duties were the common lot of mankind.I would conclude with the inspiring words uttered byHis Holiness Pope John Paul II in this Hall this morning “The answer to the fear which darkens humanexistence at the end of the century is the commoneffort to build a civilization of love  founded on theuniversal values of peace  solidarity  justice and7General Assembly 21st plenary meetingliberty.” (Official Records of the General Assembly Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings  20th meeting  p. 6)."
"38",1724,"CUB",50,1995,"There is nothing new in the newspapers thesedays: “Ethnic tensions growing in various parts of theworld”; “Violence claims a three-year-old victim”;“Concerns increase over new outbreaks of dengue fever”;“Fighting continues in the Baltic”; “Young man commitssuicide after killing his parents  his brother and eightother people”; and “Children of the third world run therisk of contracting the diseases of the Western world”. Isthis peace? Is this the new world? Is this the new orderto which we committed ourselves 50 years ago? Half acentury after the end of that devastating world war arenations really united?Until a short while ago many of us believed that wehad finally distanced ourselves from the danger of worldwar and that some long-standing confrontations werebeginning to be resolved through dialogue andnegotiation. However  the threats of a world cataclysmhave grown over decades of regional and local conflicts stirred up by a wide range of motives involving24geopolitical  economic and trading disputes as well asethnic and religious conflicts.Europe  the veteran of two world wars  which thoughtit was protected by a number of post-war agreements  isnow the arena for a number of confrontations in all cornersof that continent. In the Balkans  concentration camps which we believed had died with Hitler  have once againmade an appearance.Terrorism  originally fomented by certain powerfuldeveloped countries  has now turned against those verycountries with a lash like the tail of the serpent and now  inorder to combat that scourge  they are spending the samemillions they had invested earlier in perpetrating it.Drug trafficking is also terrorizing the major cities  butwhat promotes that scourge is not the cultivation of certaintypes of vegetation in the underdeveloped world  buttolerance of drug consumption and covert protection for itsproduction and trade in order to make a profit in those verycities.Extremism  xenophobia  racism and discrimination onthe basis of national origin  creed or gender areproliferating once again  together with the spectre offascism  which seems to have arisen from the tomb.Globalization  an all-inclusive term conceived in theinterests of the major transnational corporations  is nowdevouring national entities  sovereignty and independencebeyond any limit or reason  bringing in its wake a globalinvasion of destitution  population growth  mass migrationand environmental degradation  which cannot be avoided byeven the most powerful of this world.At the same time  ideological differences  theimposition of measures  isolation and selfish actions of allkinds continue to torpedo our new efforts to integrate intoassociations  such as the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) and the recently established Associationof Caribbean States (ACS).An exclusive kind of panamericanism in thishemisphere is sabotaging the aspirations of the communityof Ibero-American and Caribbean nations to strengthen theirforums of regional concerted actions and to seek consensusto meet their common needs. The country that has arrogatedto itself supreme leadership in this area as a manifestdestiny has  as it did two centuries ago  been conspiring toabort any regional or international association of peoplesthat does not fit in with its narrow national interests.Asia and Africa  which achieved decolonization  arenow laboratories in which societies with age-old culturesand a strong tribal heritage are being afflicted with newliberal and Western models that are totally alien to theirnational characteristics.Fifty years on  despite all its efforts  the UnitedNations has not been able to eliminate hunger  poverty the millions of children dying of diseases that are curableand entire peoples who are longing for a simple glass ofdrinking water.The virtual reality in which we are told we livetoday cannot conceal the nuclear weapons which  as hasbeen asserted  may destroy the planet three times over  asif once were not enough. Nor will the illusion of thefuture created in the opulent cities so rich in show-windows and neon lights save the world from the wastethat is being emptied into the oceans  the contaminationof the atmosphere  and the destruction of ecosystems andspecies  including the human race.Such news is rarely seen on television in thecivilized countries where we are constantly told aboutmarvellous detergents; but how can one cleanse the worldof the horrors of war and destitution with suchdetergents?Light and shadow  but above all more shadow thanlight  seems to be the mood of this General Assembly onthe eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.In preparing itself  Cuba has noted with concern the oftengraceless and vulgar way in which highly developedcountries are trying to take advantage of this opportunityto define new economic  legal and political bases for theworld. These bases run counter to the true objectives ofpeace  development  equality and justice  as well as of thepreservation and needed restoration of the cardinalprinciples of the Charter.In the complex debates of the last few months manytributes have been paid to the argument of limitedsovereignty  humanitarian intervention and preventivediplomacy  all set forth in “An Agenda for Peace” in theimplementation of which the United Nations is wastingtwo thirds of its budget.Those discussions have not been free from brusheswith fashionable neo-liberal ideas that equate developmentwith assistance and set up chains of conditionalitiesdisguised as the same good intentions with which the roadto hell is paved.25From the bipolar world of the East-West conflict wehave moved to the unipolarism of the most powerful  andonly the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and theGroup of 77 have managed to survive  although some havetried to do away with them  silence them or reeducate them as if the problems of the third world were dependent solelyon disputes between the great Powers and their post-warallies.To the calls by the vast majority of the world for thepreservation of sovereign equality  territorial integrity andnon-interference in the internal affairs of States  which arethe bases of international law  we have been given answersthat seek to destroy those principles for the benefit of afew. Whenever reason raises its head  an attempt is madeto trample on the third world’s right to development byimposing mechanisms in which the factor of domination isinherent  something this Organization was establishedprecisely to combat.All the efforts and time we have spent here toestablish a new  more just and more equitable economicorder have been doomed to failure by the intransigence ofthe rich  which has made the gap between rich and poor agulf that is ever-more unspannable.A great wave of privatization has done away withnational structures and is jeopardizing the important butfragile social achievements of mankind in its development.Streets  parks  cities and even prisons are beingprivatized  and under this influence it would appear that weare now approaching the privatization of law and of worldpower  and the United Nations itself is unable to escapefrom this  for some believe that the bulk of Member Stateshave little or nothing to say in deciding their own destinies.Let us agree on this: the world has changed. We canrepeat it. It is true. But how has it changed?Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of thehuman race we are forced to live at the same time withunspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritualprogress in which we might feel some pride as we approachthe new century.The “civilizatory” crisis began in the richest and mostpowerful part of the planet and is now spreading tointernational agencies and into this lofty arena.The countries of the South cannot desire or continueto support the notion that the North should constantlyimpose conditions upon it. The countries of the Northmust listen to our views as well as alter their ownpatterns of development.Although it is fashionable to include the issue ofhuman development in the agendas of internationaldiscussions  it has been relegated to second place by post-modern technocracies. There are those who celebrate thefall of the Berlin Wall and the breakdown of theEuropean socialist world without realizing that no newworld has yet been constructed to replace them and that on the contrary  many other new walls are growing uparound us.From the centres of world power refined and subtleforms of a new colonization are being imposed as part ofnational policies and national-security strategies — inother words  of extraterritorial domination.Cuba knows this by heart. The ridiculous charitablegestures  the crumbs fallen from the table  the alms  all gohand in hand with the cultural and ideological invasionthat corrodes peoples from within and neutralizes them asactors on history’s stage.The new ark of the post-modern saviours ispredestined to divide humanity into the auto-elect and theexcluded. Solidarity  the symbol of love among humanbeings and the essential attribute of mankind’s salvationin every age  is now an endangered species.Like the model the leadership is seeking to erect onthe basis of brutal selfishness  the third world seemscondemned to become bogged down in debates onconfrontation and cooperation and to abandon the best ofthe human spirit  which is precisely this solidarity.And this very Organization which combatedcolonialism and apartheid with such solidarity has alsobeen changed into a kind of supranational mechanism farremoved from its intergovernmental design.Is there solidarity in the secret contacts and covertunderstandings that precede the decisions taken by theOrganization  which is manipulated in the interests ofcertain Powers?Can we regard as solidarity the further invasions toeradicate famine  safeguard peace  restore democracy andsupport so-called good governments?26Can there be solidarity in a Security Council withouttransparency and anti-democratic in its workings  which nolonger fulfils the principles of the Charter or exceeds themand refuses to abolish the veto power and renouncepermanent membership?What kind of solidarity do we mean when that body the Security Council  resists even the alternative of sharingits obsolete power fairly with other nations that betterrepresent this world?In international law we must in no way accept as validthe life-style of those who proclaim as a nationalphilosophy that they have no friends or interests — unlesswe wish to bring on mass suicide for the planet.And if we are to avoid suicide  we must definitivelysupport the conclusion of treaties that will completely banatomic weapons  their technological monopoly and peacefuland simulated explosions and declare a total moratorium ontesting until the practice is completely banned. Such treatiesmust be acceded to by all nuclear Powers without anyexception.For the third consecutive year I have come heremandated by Cuba to address this Assembly and todenounce what has already been denounced  to condemnwhat has already been condemned  and to reiterate the callof the overwhelming majority of the community of nations.On the very threshold of the twenty-first century thecriminal economic  trade and financial blockade which theUnited States has imposed against my country for 36 yearscontinues. We have survived the attempt to eliminate us which has been mocked by the tenacious resistance of mypeople.After years of crisis  the Cuban economy experienceda 7 per cent growth in the past year while the budget deficitwas reduced by almost half. Inflation  measured by theinformal exchange market  was reduced by more than 80per cent  and at the end of the first half of 1995 theeconomy had grown by 2 per cent.Significant economic measures made those resultspossible  and yet the traditional attention our Governmentgives to education  health  employment and social securityhas never diminished.All this has been possible because since 1959 we havezealously and resolutely defended the commitment made tothe fathers of our nation to keep it free and sovereign  90miles distant from that great Power that has alwaysregarded us as part of its backyard  as some sort of annexto its own territory.It has been possible because in this world obsessedto its very soul with buying and selling — while ofcourse deriving profit from the process — we havemaintained and demonstrated that one can live with anethics based on principles  on national unity  on justice on respect for human dignity  equity  morality and loyalty and no one — absolutely no one — has the right toquestion this.It has also been possible because we have kept faithwith the Charter that we signed 50 years ago  with itscommitment to respect and require respect for oursovereignty  our national independence and our self-determination  while not allowing interference of any kindin our internal affairs.There is more. These results have been possiblebecause  free from the commitments of the past  and withthe experience of having depended economically on othercountries  we have with great sacrifice undertaken thetask of building our economic independence.It would be ungrateful of me if  in speaking of theincredible achievements of the Cuban people  I made noreference to the millions who have stood by us duringthese difficult years: the dozens of countries andGovernments that did not break off relations with Cuba those that strengthened their relations and those that foundthe courage to enter into such relations for the first timein the face of unspeakable pressure and threats.It is precisely now  when trade and foreigninvestment are beginning to energize the Cuban economy that a campaign has been launched in the United StatesCongress to approve a bill that would mock and runcounter to the wishes of the majority of nations and harmfree trade and all civilized forms of relations betweenpeoples and Governments.Certain extremist sectors in this country are trying todelay a lasting solution to the conflict between these twocountries for many years and to abort the migrationagreements signed by both Governments last year.Only two days ago the House of Representativestook the first step towards this crime in approving thatbill which  among other absurdities  proposes an27international blockade against Cuba  which is really directedagainst the whole of humanity.This is no surprise to us because  apart from gesturesfrom the many friends that we have in this great nation those who have directed its destiny over the last 36 yearshave brought us nothing good. However  we trust that thereare still honest people who  even without being friends ofthe Cuban Government  may have the basic common senseto know which side is in the right.There is also time to stay the hands of those in theSenate and the Executive Branch who wish to stab in theback the future of any attempt at a rapprochement betweenCuba and the United States and add new tensions tointernational relations that are already difficult.Faced with a world that accepts diversity anddifferences  that does not turn to us with aggression orisolate or discriminate against us  this North Americanposition is automatically blocked in time and in existence and is isolated in its attitude towards Cuba in thisAssembly.My country does not question anybody’s right to thetype of government they desire. We urge no one to imitateour model. But neither can we accept that anyone shouldimpose a different one on us. We affirm this in the strongbelief that the democratic  economic and social justiceprocess initiated in Cuba in 1959 has followed an honestpath; it has demonstrated its viability  its strength and itscapacity to face the challenges of these times and respondto them.We firmly believe in the authenticity and the popularsupport underpinning our revolution and our socialism —a socialism as Cuban as our palm trees. We defend ourright to life and to our own voice  because in the world ofpluralism that we aspire to  plurality and diversity amongnations must be respected.In this Assembly there are documents circulating thatprove what I say  as well as vulgar threats and attempts atblackmail against those who are exercising such freedoms not only because they are ethical in taking the right side ina matter of international interest  but because they havelinks with Havana.Diplomacy and politics these days cannot be practisedby threatening families that wish to be reunited  orbusinessmen  members of Congress or politicians who haveto resort to bodyguards for their own protection.What can we expect the next century to offer us ifthis trial imposed on Cuba by a world Power succeeds?We need something more than the reiteration of thecondemnation of the blockade in this Assembly. Cuba isfully entitled to call for action that would put an end tothis madness  because any Member State may be the nextvictim in the future.It is high time now to put an end to a conflict whichhad its origins more than two centuries ago — beforesocialism emerged  and long before the East-West conflictand the triumph of the Cuban revolution.Cuba has managed to succeed thanks to solidarity.In its name  we hope that the issue of human rights maycease to be used as political manoeuvring in a way thatstains the honour of many decent countries. Alongside thelying and pathetic chronicles of human rights violationsin Cuba  the world must recognize that there has been nolack of love  no lack of sacrifice in the salvation ofmillions of women and children who  because our tradewas blockaded  did not have enough food to eat.The often heroic and painful efforts to securemedicine for the sick  insulin for diabetics  aminofilin forasthmatics and pacemakers for those with heart conditionsmust be recognized and acknowledged  because theproviders of those medicines and the experts concernedwere warned off  boycotted or proscribed by the TreasuryDepartment of the United States.The world must know that the right to life is deeplyjeopardized in Cuba  and that my country is living working  loving and every day renewing its hopes of abetter world in spite of that.If truth were better valued on the market  the worldwould correctly identify the most striking victims of thehuman rights violations in Cuba: the vulgar servants of aforeign Power from which they receive encouragementand resources to conspire against the very land in whichthey were born to promote the annexationist aspirations ofour powerful neighbour.Moreover  honest people throughout the world candiscern among the members of the Cuban community inthis country a growing majority who have begun todefend the sovereignty of Cuba  to claim the rights thathave also been denied them and works with all oursupport and all our respect to normalize relations withtheir homeland.28The world cannot be deceived all the time  least of allthe noble and hard-working people of the United States who daily call out for solidarity with Cuba. Without theblockade  Cuba would more clearly demonstrate itsunsuspected reserves of talent and energy and the materialand spiritual quality of our lives would be improved. Thatwould enable us to give our modest support much morefreely to the cultural and scientific advancement of allmankind and of the United States as well.It is incredible that in the so-called land of the free tourists and businessmen are able to travel and invest freelyall around the world except to one destination and in onemarket  which is increasingly attractive and is located only90 miles from its own shores.The people of the United States  whose economy politics  dignity  laws and human rights have also beenprofoundly damaged  must prevent this seed sown for morethan 30 years from becoming a genuine source of nationalshame  as was its war against Viet Nam.Let it be clearly understood: Cuba desires normalrelations with the United States  provided that a naturalfeeling of good-neighbourliness  respect and equalityprevails between the two countries. But Cuba will nevergive way to threats and will survive at all costs whateverhappens  because it is capable of escaping from crises  butcannot shake off the dishonour of living on its knees. Itwill not do that. Cuba will continue with its forwardmovement to change and develop. Our economy  althoughsubject to the blockade  will grow and will provide forand meet the most pressing needs of our people. Thepowerful infrastructure that we have built up over threedecades with what some have called the subsidy thatCuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level ofeducation and culture and a stable land of peace andorder. All of this is sustained by the broadest popularconsultation and consent and a democratic consensusenjoyed by few Governments.The changes which Cuba has made and will continueto make in its own way apply not only to our economy but to our political system  civil society and institutions in order to make our democracy increasingly genuine andparticipative. These changes fall squarely within oursovereign prerogative. They have not been made to pleaseanyone outside  especially those who have so alteredthemselves as to be unrecognizable.Day by day  minute by minute  Cuba is striving toimprove itself  to adapt and survive in this global jungle where more than ever before survival of the fittest is therule. The lion may be able to devour the deer  but he hasa hard time swallowing the hedgehog.For this reason  the United Nations must also changeand become more democratic  to become the genuinevehicle for development and peace which humanity needsif it is to survive. It must become a forum for dialogueand concord where the principle of the sovereign equalityof States is the keystone and foundation.Many have spoken  and will continue to speak thisyear  of celebrating the merits and work of the UnitedNations  which no one can deny. On behalf of mycountry  I prefer today to commemorate rather thancelebrate and to call on this Assembly  50 years after itsfounding  to veto irrationality and vote unanimously forthe future of mankind."
"39",1770,"CYP",50,1995,"I should like to begin byextending to you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly. This is notmerely a recognition of your long experience and youroutstanding ability and diplomatic skill  but also a reflectionof the esteem in which your country  Portugal  is held inthe United Nations. We are certain that under your ableguidance the work of this very important session of theGeneral Assembly will be a landmark in the history of theOrganization.I should also like to pay a warm tribute to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the determined leadership which he hasdemonstrated on vital issues and for his reports on the workof the Organization  which have already resulted in theadoption of a series of measures  providing working toolsfor the activities of the United Nations. Cyprus isparticularly grateful to the Secretary-General and hisdedicated staff for their untiring efforts to find a just andlasting solution to the question of Cyprus on the basis ofUnited Nations resolutions.In April 1945  when it was obvious that the worldwas breaking up into two armed camps  delegates fromthe then independent nations met to create a worldorganization capable of building an era of peace andinternational cooperation out of the chaos and conflict ofthe Second World War. They drafted the United NationsCharter  a document of principles and norms  aimed ateffectively dealing with aggression and improving humanrights and economic and social conditions for peopleeverywhere.For five decades the spirit of the Charter was keptalive under very difficult circumstances  even when inmany cases the United Nations took the blame for thefailings of its Member States. It is an indisputable factthat the United Nations  despite its shortcomings  hasmanaged the transforming of colonies into independentcountries  restoring democracies and promoting the ruleof law. It has also been successful in resolving conflictsin many parts of the world — in Namibia  inMozambique  in Angola  in Cambodia  in CentralAmerica and in the Caribbean — and it has provided theinspiration for the drafting of major arms-control treaties.Its peace-keepers have saved thousands of lives  fed1millions of people  and helped to restore a degree ofnormality in areas of conflict.Equally  it has played an important role in promotinghuman rights and stimulating economic recovery  monetarystability and growth in the developing world. Furthermore over the past 50 years there has been a series of UnitedNations-inspired conferences which dealt with major issuesthat vitally affect the peoples of the world. More recently United Nations-sponsored conferences  including the EarthSummit at Rio  the Vienna World Conference on HumanRights  the Cairo International Conference on Populationand Development  the Copenhagen World Summit forSocial Development and the Beijing Fourth WorldConference on Women  have left their indelible imprint onthe history of mankind. On the other hand  there have beenreversals — in Rwanda United Nations efforts failed toavert genocide  and in Somalia the tragedy continues.Equally distressing is the unabated bloodshed in theBalkans  while United Nations efforts on the problem of mycountry are still to bear fruit.Fifty years of existence provide an importantopportunity to look back  to reflect on both our successesand failures. But it is also an opportunity to look forward to determine where we can and should go from here especially now  when the cold war  now ended  hasregrettably generated a wide range of security problemsstemming from economic  political or social tensions orissues of nationalism. The complex nature of the challengescalls for multilateral action and an integrated approach.Drawing from the lessons of the past and the challenges ofthe present  we must open up new ways to use themechanisms provided originally by the Charter.In this context  the continuing debate on the Agendafor Peace has stimulated new thinking about the particularchanges needed to re-equip the United Nations for its rolein this field  so as to vindicate the vision of its founders.From this rostrum I have had the opportunity to present insome detail our views on the proposed conceptualorientations. I do not need to stress that my country is fullycommitted to these goals. The recent history of Cyprus canbe seen as a case study  demonstrating the need for such aninitiative and the importance of further expanding itsconcepts.Under the United Nations Charter disarmament andarms control are integral parts of international peace andsecurity. Though for decades progress towards disarmamentand arms control was made impossible by the rigidities ofbipolarization  the latter’s demise has now opened up newpossibilities.In the last two years we have witnessed majorachievements  the most important of which was thedecision to extend indefinitely and unconditionally theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons along with the strengthening of the review process for theTreaty and the adoption of a set of principles andobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.Furthermore  we will soon be entering into commitmentsfor the conclusion of the comprehensive test-ban treatyand the negotiation of a treaty banning the production offissile material for nuclear purposes. These should be seenas products of the momentum which has built up in thedisarmament field since the end of the cold war. Weshare the view that much still needs to be done in theareas of both non-conventional and conventional weapons for  as long as military threats to security exist  thedisarmament and arms-control process will continue to bean essential element of international security.The reduction of forces and armaments alone cannotprovide for or guarantee international security  but it canreduce the risk of an outbreak of military conflict and cancontribute to confidence-building and conflict resolution.In this context  I would like to remind this body of myproposal for the complete demilitarization of the Republicof Cyprus: the withdrawal of the Turkish occupationforces  the disbanding of the National Guard of Cyprus the handing over of all its arms and military equipment tothe custody of the United Nations Peace-keeping Forceand the placing into a United Nations account of allmoney saved from the purchase of arms  to be used forinfrastructure development projects beneficial to bothcommunities. I feel that our proposal reflects not only ourgood intentions but also the spirit of the times.Unfortunately  it was rejected by Turkey.Genuine security also includes economic well-being protection of human rights and environmentalsustainability. All these dimensions function together  inan interlocking and mutually reinforcing way  asfoundations of peace. There is much concern today thatthe United Nations should have an agenda and workingmethod of direct relevance to the economic and socialneeds of societies in which individuals or groups aredeprived of their freedom or of the basic necessities onwhich human life depends. Newspapers and televisionscreens air these needs daily. The internationalcommunity’s ability to offer a decent and secure existenceto all its citizens is called into question by the numerous2human tragedies  atrocities of war  terrorism  traffic inillegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of ourplanet.It is self-evident that global cooperation and effectiveaction is a sine qua non for effectively combating these andother evils tormenting world society. Our most importantgoal must be the implementation of our existingcommitments  as provided for in the Charter. In placing theemphasis on this  we are setting no modest objective. Whatwe should recognize is that the body of principles andcommitments which have been built up over the last 50years cover the full range of civil  political  economic andsocial issues.Our task should be to reduce the obvious gap betweenaccepted principles and everyday practice  to apply theseprinciples without discrimination and at the same time toconsider ways of strengthening further the existingmechanisms. In this context  we must face up to theproblem of holding to full account those who flout theauthority of the United Nations  persistently refuse torespect the rights of others and choose to disregard theinternational commitments which they have freely accepted.When I speak of the need to uphold the authority ofthe United Nations  I feel entitled to use as an example theexperience of my country and its people. Since 1974  whenTurkish forces invaded Cyprus  37 per cent of the territoryof the Republic has remained under military occupation byTurkey. The Turkish occupation troops  instead ofwithdrawing after repeated calls by solemn Security Counciland General Assembly resolutions  are increasing in numberand modernizing their military equipment  thus posing notonly a serious threat to the security of our region but alsoa challenge to the authority of the United Nations. TheSecretary-General has stated in his reports to the SecurityCouncil that the area of Cyprus under occupation by theTurkish forces is the most militarized area in the world.Another point of particular concern to us is themassive violation of the human rights of the displacedpersons who were forcibly evicted from their homes by theTurkish occupation forces and whose homes and propertyhave been usurped by illegal settlers imported from Turkeyto Cyprus in an effort to change the demographiccomposition of our population and colonize the part ofCyprus occupied by the Turkish forces. All these flagranthuman rights violations have been committed against mycountry despite a number of General Assembly andSecurity Council resolutions calling on all States to respectthe sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unityof the Republic of Cyprus and to avoid any actions whichcould change the demographic structure of the island.Turkey’s defiance extends also to resolutions callingfor the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Republic ofCyprus  the return of the refugees to their homes underconditions of safety  the humanitarian issues of themissing persons and the implementation of the thirdVienna agreement  regarding the living conditions andwelfare of persons in enclaves in areas under the controlof the Turkish occupation forces.On this solemn occasion  I wish sincerely to express on behalf of the people of Cyprus  the Government andmyself  deep appreciation for the solidarity offered us bythe Assembly. I ask that its most valuable support bereinforced with added emphasis  for it is high time theresolutions of the United Nations on Cyprus wereimplemented if a just and lasting solution is to be arrivedat without further delay. We must remember that failureto uphold international law and respect for human rightsin one situation sets a precedent for similar failureselsewhere  with often catastrophic consequences. Recentexperiences have demonstrated this all too blatantly.At every turning point in modern history  nationsconvene to shape a new world order. This is another suchhistoric turning point  and the United Nations is the forumfor the world order we must build. We have  I believe  acollective responsibility to understand the nature of thenew  post-cold-war role of the United Nations  to continueour effort towards the institutional reforms needed to re-equip the United Nations for its role and to makecommitments of the human and financial resourcesnecessary for the United Nations to carry out effectivelyits mission. We believe that the topics of primeconsideration should include the restructuring of theSecurity Council  the system of international security asprovided for in the Charter  the further development andimplementation of the basic concepts of An Agenda forPeace and An Agenda for Development and the financesof the United Nations.It is now generally accepted that the SecurityCouncil’s membership must be increased so as to becomemore representative of the Organization’s membership. Itis also recognized that it has to improve the effectivenessof its decision-making to deal with the challenges ofinternational security in the future. Openness in itsproceedings  democratization in its decision-takingprocedures  and broader consultation by the permanentmembers with non-permanent members and with those3outside the Council whose interests are affected by aparticular issue before it  will contribute to the effectivenessof this all-important United Nations body.On the other hand  we should ensure that the GeneralAssembly  the universal organ of the United Nations  wherethe sovereign equality of Member States is democraticallydepicted  be fully respected and utilized more  if we are toserve well the peoples of the world.It is of paramount importance to recognize that  forpeace and stability to be maintained and for democracy tobe rooted  economic and social development isindispensable. That is why we welcome the efforts of theUnited Nations to answer social and economic problems though the United Nations was created primarily as apolitical body to address political issues. Today  however more than ever  we must face social and economicchallenges  for it is not enough to bring forth the end ofstrife and violence. It has been correctly said that if wecontain violence but ignore poverty we will sooner or laterdiscover that we have simply traded one misery for another.The historic Middle East accord offers a good examplein this respect  where what has been achieved in the courseof the peace process should be cemented by the economicsupport of the international community  thus ensuring a justand lasting peace in the Middle East.Never in the history of mankind has the awareness ofinterdependence and globalism been so strong as it is today and never has mankind had so much technological know-how at its disposal. Building upon the accumulation of 50years of United Nations experience in multilateral relationsand the everlasting principles and ideals of the UnitedNations Charter  we can and must do everything within ourpower to bequeath to coming generations a better world where security  democracy  human rights and prosperityprevail and are shared by all."
"40",1794,"CZE",50,1995,"Allow me at theoutset to congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his electionto the prestigious office of President of the GeneralAssembly at this fiftieth session. His distinguished career inPortuguese politics serves as an assurance that his tenurewill be very workmanlike and fruitful  in addition tocelebratory. I wish also to thank the outgoing president Ambassador Amara Essy  for the excellent job he did lastyear.It is particularly auspicious to address the GeneralAssembly this week — a day after the signing  inWashington  of a bulky  carefully crafted andlong-argued-over agreement between Israel and thePalestinian Authority on the second stage of Palestinianautonomy; and a few days after the signing  here in NewYork  of a much slimmer  much more tentative and muchmore general set of additional principles for peace in theSouth Slav States  which  nevertheless  we hope represents the next step towards peace in that area aswell.On 24 October  the United Nations will celebrate itsjubilee. This indicates that the objectives and ideals ofthis Organization  as set out in the Charter  are still validand still at the forefront of the interest of the internationalcommunity. This fills us with joy  all the more so sinceone of the founding Members of the Organization wasCzechoslovakia.The founding of the United Nations was the logicaloutcome of the efforts of countries which  having beenaffected by the most terrible war in the history ofmankind  wanted to ensure that a new organization wouldprevent any repetition of a similar conflagration.Guaranteeing global peace  however  has never beenthe sole objective of the United Nations. The UnitedNations constitutes a unique forum for all countries without distinction  to present their opinions and pursuetheir international interests in all areas of concern including not only security and disarmament but alsosocial and economic development  protection of theenvironment and other issues that are particularly pressingnowadays  including drug trafficking and terrorism. TheUnited Nations thus offers a platform for solving globalproblems.The United Nations efforts to implement theprinciples of its Charter enjoy the full support of theCzech Republic. Mr. Václav Havel  the President of theCzech Republic  will no doubt underline the importancewe assign to it when he speaks from this rostrum nextmonth. Nevertheless  in view of the changes that havetaken place since the inception of the United Nations there is an urgent need to adapt the Organization to newchallenges  to thoroughly reform it and to turn it into abetter and more effective instrument of multilateralinternational relations.The most important task is that of creating a moreefficient and more cost-effective system. We need apractical system  one which  even with limited means would guarantee global security  uphold human rights and9contribute far more effectively to development in lessprivileged parts of the world. We need an Organization that on the basis of the principle of universality  is open to allthose who are willing and ready to participate in thisendeavour.The United Nations cannot spend a penny more onprogrammes that duplicate one another or on programmesthat have become ineffective or even unnecessary. Manyprogrammes can be consolidated  or indeed eveneliminated  without any adverse effect on theirbeneficiaries. The message is clear: many of our nationalGovernments are implementing cost-control and efficiencymeasures  and a similar approach must be taken by theUnited Nations as well. We recognize the important rolethat the Advisory Committee on Administrative andBudgetary Questions (ACABQ) plays in the process ofmanaging the United Nations finances and the importanceof the Office of Internal Oversight Services  created lastyear. These organs must control United Nationsexpenditures even more strictly.The Charter of the United Nations devolves the basicresponsibility for maintaining international peace andsecurity to the Security Council. In this role  the Council isirreplaceable. It is perceived as a compact  efficient transparent and alert body that should guarantee rapid andeffective United Nations action  wherever necessary  tomaintain or restore peace anywhere in the world.Although it is currently perhaps the most efficientlyoperating organ of the United Nations  there is room forimprovement. The Council must put greater stress onpreventive diplomacy  and it should further improve theflow of information between its members and other UnitedNations Members  as well as its cooperation with theSecretariat. Greater transparency of the Security Council inits decision-making would also be desirable. These are stepsthe Council can pursue by itself.A broader issue is that of restructuring the Council which requires our special attention. We support  andactively participate in  the Open-ended Working Group onthe reform and restructuring of the Security Council  andwe anticipate that the proposals that eventually emerge fromit will actually be implemented. The number of permanentand non-permanent members of the Council should increaseto about 20. Any substantially greater number would affectits effectiveness. It should  as far as possible  includerepresentation by all regions  and the Group of EasternEuropean States should be allotted an additional seat. Weoppose any new categories of Security Council members.Participation in maintaining world peace and meetingfinancial obligations to the United Nations are some ofthe criteria that should be considered in determining theexpansion of the permanent membership. We believeGermany and Japan to be suitable candidates  andadvocate expanded representation of Latin America Africa and Asia.Logically  non-permanent members  and small Statesin particular  cannot play the same role as permanentmembers with the veto. Nevertheless  non-permanentmembers have a positive role to play in the Council’sactivities and in its decision-making. During its currenttenure on the Security Council  the Czech Republic hasbeen contributing constructively to the Council’sactivities. Our own active policies demonstrate  on theone hand  the unmistakable place of the Czech Republicamong traditionally democratic countries and  on the otherhand  our independent analyses and attitudes  in which weare beholden to no other Power. Our Security Councilactivity has also demonstrated — if such a demonstrationwere indeed necessary — our commitment andinvolvement not only with respect to Europe  but also inseeking solutions in far-away conflicts which at firstglance may not affect us.The Czech Republic supports a more active role ofthe Security Council in various aspects of conflictmanagement and in delving even deeper to the roots ofconflicts. Such a role  exemplified for example inpreventive diplomacy  aims at creating conditions and anatmosphere for parties in dispute to enter into serious andsincere negotiations  thus restoring stability and peace inthe regions where tension prevails. When it comes toimplementing the results of negotiations  active andcomplex peace building and peacemaking have been ourprimary vehicles. We do not share one-sided negativeevaluations of the results of United Nations peace-keepingoperations. In some regions normalcy has been restoredprecisely because of the United Nations and its peace-keeping activities. But there are also regions wheretragedies unfold unchecked despite the United Nationsbest efforts  including tremendous financial  material andpersonnel contributions.In its extent  depth and consequences  the crisis inthe former Yugoslavia amounts to the greatest and mosttragic conflict in post-war Europe. The inability of Europeand of the international community in general to stop theconflict has undermined the confidence of the worldpublic in a number of international institutions. Gaps inexisting security arrangements have become apparent  and10the European integration process has slowed down andbecame more complicated. The Balkan conflict is alsofrequently linked with the crisis of the United Nations andwith the perceived need to create a more effectiveinternational security mechanism for resolving regionalconflicts. In this strange way  the war in the formerYugoslavia might thus eventually assist in forming a new more effective security mechanism.It transpires that the international community was notready for the conflict. It underestimated its complexity andits potential for escalation. Its length and its chroniccharacter are linked with the military-strategic equality ofthe antagonists who  despite international pressure  havebeen refusing to negotiate. They believe  quite erroneously that they can attain more of their objectives by fighting thanby negotiating and signing a peace agreement. The latestdevelopments indicate that it is impossible to attain anysignificant success in solving conflicts of this type withoutthe determination of the international community and thecombination of strong political pressure  sanctions and theappropriate use of military force. But it is still moreobvious that a final  just and lasting solution can be attainedonly by peaceful negotiations.The fate of the innocent civilian population lies at theheart of our concerns. The victims of ethnic cleansing  thestill-concealed tragedy of the men and boys of Srebrenicaand Zepa and the exodus of Croatian Serbs from their oldhomes all evoke fears for the fate of civilians. We shouldhelp monitor the observance of human rights for civilianson all sides of the conflict.The United States initiative regarding Bosnia andHerzegovina  as well as Croatia  amounts to an effort tocreate a joint peace project of Contact Group members andother interested parties. This effort should be fullysupported by the international community and presented tothe belligerent parties as the basic framework for solvingthe crisis. The de facto recognition of the territorialintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia  and of the Srpska Republicby the Sarajevo Government  as well as the acceptance byBosnian Serbs of the Contact Group plan dividing theterritory of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a 51:49 ratio  shouldcertainly facilitate the next phase in peace negotiations.The changing approach of the Serb party to peaceinitiatives of the international community  especially to thelatest United States plan  confirms the more cooperativeapproach of Belgrade to finding a peaceful solutionacceptable to all sides. This is definitely a positive. By thesame token we supported the joint North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO)-United Nations operation  eventhough we realize that in and of themselves  air strikeswould not resolve the conflict. Effective cooperationbetween the United Nations and NATO in implementingrelevant Security Council resolutions has demonstratedthat NATO has a very important role to play in theregion.Solving the problem of Eastern Slavonia should alsobe on the agenda of current peace efforts.The Czech Republic is ready to continue its activeparticipation in peace missions in the former Yugoslavia whether under United Nations auspices or under someregional arrangement according to Chapter VIII of theCharter. Needless to say  the Czech Republic willcontinue to the best of its abilities to providehumanitarian assistance  and intends to participate in thepost-war reconstruction of the war-ravaged areas.There has been a great increase in the number ofpeace-keeping operations since the end of the cold war.In the last five years  more peace-keeping operations havebeen launched than during the entire previous existence ofthe United Nations. In 1995  16 peace-keeping operationswere functioning  compared to eight in 1988  with almost70 000 personnel. Expenditures rose about five times.This issue is inextricably connected with the criticalfinancial situation of the United Nations. The UnitedNations is almost $4 billion in the red. The CzechRepublic supports not only the reform of financing peace-keeping operations  but of the entire system of UnitedNations financing. The system should be based oneconomic indicators — per capita national product — andshould correspond to a given country’s ability to pay. Letme assure you that the Czech Republic takes itsresponsibility very seriously.We are prepared to pay our fair share of the burdenimmediately and in full  as soon as this share is decidedand we receive formal notification from theSecretary-General.Czech authorities are right now drafting legislationwhich  if adopted  would create a legal framework for theCzech Republic’s participation in the United Nationsstand-by arrangements. The system should be as effectiveas possible. Similarly  initiatives aimed at theestablishment of United Nations rapid-reaction units to bebased on this system — including  for example  the recent11Canadian proposals to this effect — have ourunderstanding. Resolving all political  organizational andfinancial issues will take time  yet we feel that this is apromising way of addressing the critical question of gettingpeace-keeping operations started in time.We hope very soon to become a party to theConvention on the Safety of United Nations and AssociatedPersonnel. We share the burden of peace-keeping operationsby sending troops  military observers and other personnel and therefore have a keen foreign-policy interest instrengthening their status and security.Strengthening regimes of non-proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction is high on the agenda of the UnitedNations. It is our view  shaped by  among other things  therecent horrific discoveries of the United Nations SpecialCommission in Iraq  that the Security Council should playa more important role in this regard.The unlimited extension of the Non-ProliferationTreaty attained earlier this year in this very building is asuccess of truly historic importance. An important task isthe preparation of an agreement on a complete andcomprehensive ban of nuclear tests. We hope that theintensive negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament inGeneva will reach a successful conclusion in 1996. And letme make one point: nuclear tests undertaken despite vocalprotests from around the world do not contribute to theobjective of global denuclearization.The expectation of an early ratification of the 1993Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction has not yet been realized.Nevertheless  we hope that in 1996 the Convention willenter into force.Existing regimes of export and import controls fordual-use material  equipment and technologies are also veryuseful. They complement or expand on internationalagreements  conventions and treaties concerning thebanning  elimination and non-proliferation of weapons especially those of mass destruction. I have in mind inparticular activities of the so-called Australia Group  theNuclear Suppliers’ Group  the Missile Technology ControlRegime and the emerging New Forum  the new multilateralarrangement on export controls.The importance of the topics of this year’s UnitedNations conferences  the Social Summit in Copenhagen andthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women  attractedbroad public attention — which  for that matter  was oneof the objectives of their organizers. As we reflect onthese conferences  evaluate their final documents andreview the fate of the documents that emerged fromearlier conferences  we are contemplating the very futureof such meetings.Notwithstanding all the expectations and enthusiasmthat accompany them  we note the increasingdisenchantment from the moment a conference is overand its conclusions are to be implemented. It thenbecomes obvious that large parts of its declarations failthe litmus test of practicality. One wonders: do thetremendous efforts and the very considerable outlaysinvolved in organizing such activities really have the endeffect we would all desire? We are not sure that we cananswer in the affirmative.The Czech Republic is a candidate for membershipin the Economic and Social Council at this year’selections. The successes of our economic transformationhave already proved to be of interest to other economiesin transition. And they have allowed the Czech Republicto become an emerging donor country in theeconomic-assistance equation. These are some of thearguments I would submit to support our candidature. Weof course realize that the Council is as badly in need ofreform and streamlining as other segments of the UnitedNations body  and maybe more. We are prepared to offerour analytical skills in suggesting improvements and tosupport reasonable proposals leading to such reforms.Allow to me say a few words from the perspectiveof another high office I currently hold  that of theChairman of the Council of Ministers of the Council ofEurope. The United Nations and the Council of Europehave a number of points in common. These commonpoints should be further explored with a view toeliminating duplication even across organizations economizing expenses and leveraging our resources.Some ideas about cooperating in the triangle of theUnited Nations  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe haverecently been shared in Strasbourg. I have full confidencethat any ideas that are deemed useful will be furtherexamined and implemented by our organizations.The Czech Republic wishes to demonstrate itscontinued emphasis on multinational diplomacy and onassuming its proper role in the governance of worldaffairs. We have been doing so in the Security Councilthese past years; we do so by sending our troops  military12observers and other personnel to far-flung corners of theworld; and we do so by offering multilateral and bilateralassistance. Putting our shoulder to the wheel  we join othersin moving this organization of ours into the nextmillennium and into its next 50 years."
"41",1856,"DEU",50,1995,"Please accept my warmcongratulations  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. At the same time I wish to thank your predecessor  Ambassador Essy  forhis successful work.The United Nations 50 years on — that makes thissession of the General Assembly an event of extra-specialsignificance. The people of the world have highexpectations. We must take stock  but in so doing wemust  above all  look to the future.The representatives of 50 nations who assembled inSan Francisco in the year 1945 were intended to be  asPresident Truman put it  “the architects of a better world”.What has become of their blue-print?Today the family of nations has 185 members.Millions of people all over the world owe their lives  theirfreedom and their health  their jobs and their homes  tothe United Nations and its specialized agencies.Decolonization has been completed  apartheid has beenovercome  and respect for human rights is no longer aninternal affair. In the field of disarmament a historicbreakthrough has been achieved: in May of this year theproliferation of nuclear weapons was halted. Thatconstitutes a big step towards making the world safe formankind.All these are considerable achievements which manycritics of the United Nations have overlooked in thisjubilee year  achievements on which you  in particular Mr. Secretary-General  and your staff are to becongratulated. Indeed  the United Nations  in spite ofsome unjustified criticism  can take pride in what it hasdone for the cause of peace  freedom and human dignity.Especially worthy of our gratitude and appreciationare the more than 68 000 United Nations troops currently4serving on missions in all regions of the world. Whenservicemen from Asia  Africa or Latin America attend tothe basic needs of refugees in Europe  in the formerYugoslavia  and keep the beleaguered people from starving then that is  I believe  a marvellous indication that the “oneworld” is a reality. Lest we forget: nearly 5 000 of thosetroops  the Blue Helmets  have been killed or wounded inthe line of duty. The Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel must be put into effect assoon as possible. This we owe to all those who serve theUnited Nations.As we recap the events of the past year  we also haveto consider the huge problems now confronting the worldOrganization. The ability to safeguard peace: that is theworld’s main criterion when judging the United Nations.And here we have reached a critical point.Somalia  Rwanda and Bosnia: these countries stand fordisappointment and setbacks as well. However  I shouldlike to make it very clear that in such cases the culprit isquickly found  too quickly. Nothing is more convenientthan to point to the alleged inefficiency of the UnitedNations. And nothing could be further from the truth.When it has not been possible to help people  whenUnited Nations troops have been humiliated in the formerYugoslavia  it has in nearly every instance not been thefault of the United Nations. The problems have lain in itsunsatisfactory mandate  in the lack of political will on thepart of Member States  and  unfortunately  in the shortageof funds. It is we  the Members  who cause the difficulties.Following the holding of United Nations troops ashostages  the atrocities in Zepa and Srebrenica  and theterrible second bloodbath in Sarajevo’s market place  thecommunity of nations has demonstrated that there is a limitto the amount of brutality and contempt for internationallaw it will tolerate. And there has to be a limit.The resolve of the United Nations and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has paid off — notonly for the people of Sarajevo  who for three years havebeen starving and freezing and kept under constant fire  butalso for the peace process.Yesterday  here in New York  the parties to theconflict had another meeting with the Contact Group  ofwhich Germany is a member. Another step forward wasachieved on the constitutional issue following the resultachieved in Geneva  and I believe this step to be a decisiveone. For the first time since the conflict began there is arealistic prospect of a negotiated peace settlement.But I should like to warn against being over-euphoric. A lot has still to be done. We shall have to putone stone on top of another stone in order to finish thisbuilding. This time none of the participants should leavethe conference table until an agreement has beenreached — a peaceful agreement at the negotiating table and not an agreement on the basis of military actions.Anyone who continues to prefer bloodshed  to prefermilitary actions  will be taking a great responsibility uponhimself.From the beginning  Germany has played an activepart in these efforts. We have never taken sides  nor didwe ever want to take sides  against one party; rather  wehave always taken up the cause of the victims  those whohave been tormented and driven from their homes.To date  the German Government’s humanitarian aidin the region amounts to more than 1 billion Deutschemarks. And I should like to stress strongly that we haveno double standards  nor should we have doublestandards. In the short time since August  we haveprovided more than 6 million marks to help Serbianrefugees from Krajina.My country has contributed in various ways to allpeace-keeping operations. By sending medical personnelto Split and deploying Tornado fighters for the firsttime — fighters which we have made available inPiacenze  Italy — in a United Nations peace-keepingmission  we have also shown that we do not merely talkabout taking on more responsibility  but that we act to doso.We will also meet our responsibility when it comesto implementing the terms of a peace settlement — andI hope that this settlement will come soon. Thereconstruction of Bosnia’s economy requires a genuinelyinternational cooperative effort  an effort on the part ofthe international community. The European Union — andGermany  of course  as a member of the EuropeanUnion — will play its part.What lessons can and must we learn from what hashappened in Somalia  Rwanda and Bosnia?First  the United Nations must confine itself to doingwhat is feasible. Its resources are obviously being strainedbeyond the limit. It cannot take on every responsibility. It5cannot solve all the problems that the world is confrontedwith.Secondly  the extent and duration of the commitmentof the United Nations must be more precise  the politicaland military objectives must be clearly defined  and theremust be a realistic and  above all  coherent mandate.Thirdly  if the world Organization is going tointervene  then it must act consistently and resolutely. Theremust be no repetition of what happened in Rwanda or Zepaor Srebrenica.Fourthly  cooperation between the United Nations andother organizations such as NATO must from the outset beplanned in such a way that maximum speed and  above all efficiency are assured.Fifthly  we believe that the regional organizations mustplay a larger role than they have done so far. Not everyproblem must go straight to the United Nations. In Europe for instance  and in other places of the world too  theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) could assume much greater responsibility.However  we have to enable it to do so.Still  let there be no illusions. Peace-keeping is not justa fair-weather exercise. Such missions will always be apt tocreate problems for the world Organization.And  in view of the hundreds of thousands of livesthat have been saved in Somalia and Bosnia  who can arguewith an easy conscience that the United Nations should nothave intervened? And many of these people have alreadybeen forgotten. What is required here is an increased peace-keeping capacity — constructive help  not destructivecriticism.And to those who over and over again have called intoquestion the actions of the United Nations and its peace-keeping operations  I would like to address the followingquestion: Is there an alternative? Who could take the placeof the United Nations? Indeed  Europe has not been able tocope with this tragedy in its own house as well as we allhoped it would.But nor should we forget the European Union’sachievements in the former Yugoslavia. It paved the wayfor the Contact Group’s ongoing peace efforts.To my mind  the conflict in the former Yugoslaviaemphasizes how important and right it was for WesternEurope to embark on a new course after the SecondWorld War  a course that was directed against nationalismand against the use of force. For four decades  as a resultof the East-West conflict  not all European nations wereable to follow that route of the European Community today’s European Union.The European Union is now striving to correct thatterrible aberration and bridge the gulfs that separate itfrom Central and Eastern Europe. The goal is one Europe a Europe in which the old big-Power politics andhegemonic aspirations can never again take root.That Europe must have a legitimate place for Russia but for Ukraine as well. The European house does notconsist solely of the European Union: it has many rooms.Neither of these two nations  Russia or Ukraine  shouldbe left outside. To our Russian and Ukrainian partnersand friends I say: Europe needs your contribution and itdoes so also in bringing peace to the former Yugoslavia.Here their new partnership with the European Union andNATO must — and  I add  will — prove its value.Many feared that when the East-West confrontationdisappeared Europe would focus exclusively on its ownaffairs. That has not been the case. The European Unionis intensifying its political  economic and culturalcooperation with the other regions of the world.In Asia  Africa and Latin America it is already amodel for peace  prosperity and regional integration. Inthe United Nations the European Union is the principalpartner for dialogue with the developing countries.The European Union and Germany have beenparticularly active in promoting peace and economicrecovery in the Middle East. The recent agreement on theWest Bank worked out by Yassir Arafat and ShimonPeres is another important milestone on the road to lastingpeace in that region. I congratulate both sides on theircourage and on their far-sightedness. The United States isplaying a major part in this process in this region. We aregrateful to them for that. Egypt has rendered an importantcontribution as an intermediary.Increasing the peace-keeping capacity of the UnitedNations also involves reforming the Security Council.There is now a global consensus  I believe  that this isnecessary.The first steps towards reform have already beentaken. More changes have been made to the Council’s6methods of work and more transparency achieved in thepast two years than in the whole of the previous fourdecades.Like many other Member States  Germany considersthat the Council should have more permanent and non-permanent members. The nations of Asia  Africa and LatinAmerica need wider representation and I think we owe it tothem. They have deserved it. The same applies to severalcountries with an important global role.Germany  with the support of many Member States has announced its interest in permanent membership of theSecurity Council. Our willingness to assume greaterresponsibility  also within this framework  is for us thelogical and consistent extension of our commitment to theUnited Nations. This commitment is consistent with thefundamental principle of our foreign policy  which is togive priority to multilateral cooperation. We have abided bythat principle in pursuing European integration  and webelieve that that same principle would help us play a usefulrole in the Security Council.The world finds itself faced with many new conflictsand challenges. It is crucial that in dealing with them weshould focus our efforts more than we have done so far onconflict prevention. A political solution must remain thefirst option. That requires wider use of human rightsobservers  improvements in the United Nations earlywarning system  the promotion of democratization and theobservation of election processes  as successfully donerecently in Mozambique.We have provided a list of experienced intermediariesfor the tasks of preventive diplomacy. The example ofMacedonia shows what the preventive deployment ofUnited Nations Blue Helmets can achieve. I am very happyabout the agreement that has been achieved between Greeceand Macedonia on this extremely important issue.Preventing fire can save countless lives and in any case itis cheaper than putting fires out. On my recent visit toRwanda I was deeply shocked  in the truest sense of theword  by the atrocities that have been perpetrated there byhuman beings on other human beings. If the United Nationshad intervened at an early stage and resolutely  many livescould have been saved.Germany has set up a substantial emergency aidprogramme for Rwanda. We are trying in particular to dosomething about the awful prison conditions. I myselfvisited prisons  in Kigali for example  and I must tell youthat I have never seen anything like that in all my life.Urgent remedies are needed here to ensure that oneinjustice is not followed by another. I travelled to Burunditoo  and I returned deeply saddened and concerned. Wemust not make the same mistakes in Burundi.Disarmament  arms control and confidence-building — these are some of the main components ofconflict prevention. In recent years we have made thekind of progress that no one would have believed possibleat the height of the arms race 15 years ago. The task ofbuttressing this breakthrough and building on theachievements has acquired great political significance.A few weeks ago we commemorated the fiftiethanniversary of the first atomic bomb explosions overHiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons must never never  be used again. They must be eliminatedcompletely  as required by article VI of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That aim wasreaffirmed by the nuclear Powers at the New YorkConference extending the Treaty.Never has the door to a ban on every kind ofnuclear-test explosion been wider open than today. Wemust now direct all our efforts to the achievement of thisgoal. The Geneva negotiations must produce such acomprehensive ban by the autumn of 1996 at the latest.Anti-personnel mines  too  are “weapons of massdestruction”. Day in  day out  they are taking a terribletoll on human life  and many of the victims are womenand  above all  innocent children. If any kind of weaponmust be outlawed  then this one should be.Eliminating this scourge is a task of the highestpriority  particularly in Nicaragua  Angola  Mozambique Afghanistan  Georgia and Cambodia. Germany  togetherwith its European partners  will continue the initiative inthis direction during this session of the GeneralAssembly.At the First Review Conference of the Conventionon certain conventional weapons  which opened in Viennathe day before yesterday  tougher export restrictions willhave to be agreed on and a strict ban imposed on the useof anti-personnel mines.I appeal to all Members of the United Nations: Inthe name of humanity  accede to the Convention oncertain conventional weapons as quickly as possible.7There are good reasons why the work of the UnitedNations began with the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The United Nations is more than a mere gatheringof sovereign States. It is based on the common belief in thedignity and worth of every human being  and it is my viewthat this must remain the focal point of all political activity.Universal Children’s Day  celebrated a week ago reminded us of the awful fate to which these  the weakestmembers of society  are often exposed. The United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) therefore needs the support ofevery one of us.The task of helping those people all over the worldwho have been persecuted and deprived of their rights mustremain at the top of the political agenda. Pressure from theinternational community  the media  non-governmentalorganizations and private citizens must be maintained.Those who torture people and who treat human rights withcontempt should not be able to sleep peacefully. To thisend  the High Commissioner’s position will have to bestrengthened and the Centre for Human Rights betterequipped. People who commit war crimes must know thatthey will be prosecuted under international criminal law.Hence  Germany strongly urges the establishment of apermanent international court of justice.But above all  stronger measures to protect minoritiesare called for. “Ethnic cleansing” is no basis for peacefulcoexistence  either in Europe or anywhere else.More than 27 million people are today on the move.This is one of the most dramatic events of our time. Thecause is not only hunger and distress  but  in most cases unfortunately  ethnic and religious fanaticism. Diversity ofculture and tradition is one of the world’s greatest assets and no one should seek to impose a particular model ofsociety on others.The fact that there exists a core of human rights whicheveryone has to respect is quite a different matter. This wasreaffirmed at the Vienna Conference and should not bechallenged by anyone.Today the dialogue of cultures is central to the questfor peace. I have invited leading representatives of theIslamic world to come to Germany in November toparticipate in such a dialogue. My feeling is that we haveto learn to understand each other better. I have also urgedthat the Bosnia Contact Group closely coordinate its effortswith the Islamic Contact Group.In Germany  two and a half million Muslims areliving harmoniously with the local community. In myview  it is extremely important that we should developcooperation and mutual trust at the international level aswell  and I am speaking as the German Foreign Minister.Islam cannot be equated with terrorism orfundamentalism. No new enemy stereotypes must beallowed to develop. I think that we should be happy thatwe have been able to do away with the old ones.Peace and development are inseparable. Any reformof the United Nations worthy of that name shouldtherefore encompass economic and social matters as well.This fiftieth anniversary is a unique opportunity to createa modern framework for a new development inpartnership. Work on the Agenda for Development musttherefore be completed as soon as possible.Apart from improving and simplifying the financeregime for United Nations development activities  thechief concern is to coordinate and efficiently implementthe results of the world conferences on the environment social problems  population growth and women —especially the Conference on Women that has just endedin Beijing.These are the main interrelated issues of our time aswe pursue the goal of peace. The planet Earth mustremain habitable for future generations as well. Progressis possible only through equal and fair partnershipbetween North and South. Germany will continue to exertevery effort to this end.None of this can be done unless we can come togrips with the biggest crisis confronting the UnitedNations: that of its financial situation. There is no reasonto deny that it has assumed dramatic proportions; one hasto be quite frank about this. This crisis can be overcomeonly if all contributors  and especially the main ones meet their obligations punctually. Germany is the thirdlargest contributor to the United Nations  and we pay ourbills. We cannot allow a situation to continue where thosewho pay their contributions on time are also burdenedwith the arrears of wealthier Members. Unless decisiveaction is taken very soon  whole areas of activity couldgrind to a halt.I very much welcome the confirmation by theAmerican Secretary of State that the United States standsby the obligations arising from its membership. TheUnited Nations needs an America that fulfils its8leadership role  just as the United States needs a worldOrganization capable of  and willing to undertake  reform.How can we overcome this financial crisis? First  wemust restore the balance between the budgets for peace-keeping operations and the regular budget of the UnitedNations. We cannot allow resources for such operations tobe used up to the point of depletion while at the same timefunds for urgent programmes of economic or socialdevelopment are either non-existent or have to be cut back.Secondly  it is time we found a scale of assessmentsthat reflects Members’ actual ability to pay. You Mr. Secretary-General  have made great efforts torationalize the Organization’s work  to ensure budgetarydiscipline and to reduce staff. I appeal to all Member Statesto give Under-Secretary-General Paschke the support heneeds for his difficult job.The United Nations is indispensable to the task ofmaintaining global order and as a forum and instrument forinternational cooperation  today no less than in the era afterthe Second World War. No other organization has the sameability to focus the interests and energies of the world’snations  which we believe is necessary.The United Nations is not “the others”  but us  theMembers. And this Organization is only as strong and asunited as we  its Members  make it.Hence my appeal today to the Assembly: let us stopour constant vacillation between euphoria anddisappointment regarding the United Nations. Let us stopapportioning blame  which leads nowhere. Let us rathermerge vision and pragmatism  solidarity and responsibilityfor our own actions into a rational and realistic internationalpartnership under the aegis of the United Nations. Let usgive this world Organization more clout and make it moreefficient and economical. Yes  we will have to slim downthe United Nations. It has to save money. Let us do thesethings in a constructive spirit  together with  and on behalfof  the United Nations. Let us give the United Nations whatit needs — including paying our dues.That is what the world community expects of us now and rightly so. That is the task facing the family of nationson the threshold of the new millennium. If the reforms fail there will be only losers.“Hope is the pillar of the world”  they say in SouthAfrica. Fifty years ago  such a pillar of hope for mankindwas erected in San Francisco. Let us do everything toensure that this pillar will continue to support the hopesof mankind in the next 50 years as well. Germany willcontinue to play its part."
"42",1894,"DJI",50,1995,"The United Nations has today reached a historicturning-point for at this session  we are celebrating thefiftieth anniversary of its founding. I am convinced thatthis Assembly will benefit greatly from the President’svast experience as a distinguished jurist. On behalf of mydelegation  I would like to extend to Mr. Freitas doAmaral my sincere congratulations on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly for a session whichwill undoubtedly prove to be productive.We are deeply indebted to Mr. Amara Essy for theactive and competent way in which he conducted theproceedings of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. It should indeed be noted that a number ofproblems and reforms had the benefit of particularattention under his presidency.We would also like to express our gratitude and ourhigh regard to the Secretary-General for his enlightenedand pragmatic leadership. Today  more than ever  theuniversality of the United Nations offers to many of usthe possibility of having our voices heard throughout theworld. We would also congratulate the Secretary-Generalon his efforts to preserve and strengthen the role of theUnited Nations in its work for peace  collective securityand development.The situation in the world today  marked as it is bya multiplicity of hotbeds of tension  demonstrates to us —if that were necessary — the paramount role of theUnited Nations. This is naturally a subject for reflection22General Assembly 21st plenary meetingand of course a useful matter for us to ponder when weanalyse our compliance with the Charter and the ideals setforth in it as we now stand on the threshold of an erawhich  without any doubt  will prove vital for mankind.Today  indeed  we are living in a different world — aworld which the end of the cold war has stripped of thestructures and priorities that were familiar to it. New crises difficult to understand and to which we must today findappropriate responses  have arisen in all parts of the world.Neither States nor even regions can deal with themeffectively and individually.The explosion of ethnic identities  too long suppressed and the breaking up of States  have posed formidablechallenges to the international community  thus threateninginternational peace and security. The crises that areravaging the world today are not as specific as those of thecold-war era. Since they fall outside the focus of interest ofthe great Powers  the responsibility for action falls on theUnited Nations. However  the absence of clear-cutmandates  plus the inadequacy of resources  is partiallyresponsible for the performance of the United Nations in itsnew role as guarantor of peace. In the light of thesecircumstances  it is no surprise that early intervention isoften late in coming. But when the United Nations doespossess the necessary resources and support  it can achievecommendable results.The persistence of social and economic crises  thecollapse of Governments and structures underlie thisoutbreak of civil conflicts in the world. It is clear that it isnot enough simply to separate the combatants and stop thefighting in order to eliminate the multidimensional causesof these conflicts. Until these causes are understood andcombated from the very outset of the crisis  we will neverbe in a position to combat the flagrant acts of violenceagainst civilian populations. Until we are ready to offerfirm resistance to injustice  to acts of aggression  tocontinuing violations of human rights and peoples  we willbe doomed to watching history repeat itself over and overagain. Recent experiences of the United Nations havedemonstrated this  but none of them is more revealing thanthe history of Bosnia.Nothing has contributed as much as Bosnia toengendering a feeling of outrage within the internationalcommunity. Although numerous resolutions of the SecurityCouncil reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrityof Bosnia  confirming the inadmissibility of the annexationof territory by force and condemning “ethnic cleansing”have been adopted  the reaction of the internationalcommunity to the challenge posed by the Serbs hasalways been hesitant and confused. The cost of this warin terms of loss of human life  hardship and materialdestruction is frightening. Serb bombings have turned thedesignated “safe areas” into vast prisons. Sarajevo hassuffered by far the most from Serb strangulation.However  the fall of the “safe areas” of Srebrenicaand Zepa marked a turning-point in the attitude of thegreat Powers in this long and bloody conflict. These actsof genocide undoubtedly constitute one of the greatesthumiliations for the international community since theSecond World War. The combined effects of bombingsand diplomacy seem to have negated Serb domination onthe ground at the same time as it has promoted prospectsfor peace. Furthermore  United Nations personnel andhumanitarian convoys are no longer exposed to Serbattacks thanks to the recent resolve shown by the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization. For the time being aggression is not paying off and the Serbs seem to havepartially renounced their traditional tactic of murderingcivilians with impunity. Over all  developments in thesituation have dealt a new hand and breathed new lifeinto the peace process. We welcome this new attitude  butpeace must be both durable and honourable for all people.Bosnia  as a sovereign State  must be protected. Similarly Sarajevo must be preserved as a multiracial andmulticultural city.The handshake between President Arafat and PrimeMinister Rabin in September 1993 was a source of greathope and we can but rejoice further at recent events. Thesecond phase of negotiations led to the signing inWashington of the Taba Accord on 28 September 1995.We can only welcome that outcome. We encourage thetwo parties to persevere in their efforts to expedite theimplementation of these agreements. They must strive tocontain the violence of extremists and to take allnecessary measures to strengthen mutual trust  which will undoubtedly  contribute to lasting peace.The mutual recognition of Israel and of the PLO hasopened up a tremendous opportunity to strengthen peaceand development in the Middle East  as well as tradingand economic potential for the entire region. These arethe stakes and neither of the parties  neither thePalestinians nor the Israelis  should underestimate theimportance of this new perspective.Sometimes there are mixed feelings about UnitedNations efforts around the world to contain hostilities andsettle disputes. The United Nations has effectively been23General Assembly 21st plenary meetingparalysed and hamstrung by the lack of resources and theabsence of any precise mandate during the crisis inRwanda. The establishment of the International Tribunal for Rwanda which is responsible for trying and prosecutingthe persons guilty of genocide has also been delayed.Serious political dialogue can be broached  because itwould be hard to deny that those who promoted encouraged or committed crimes must be taken to court.Furthermore  the whole issue of the reconciliation andreconstruction of the country has failed because ofpersistent internal tension and delays in the deployment ofinternational aid. An enormous task still lies ahead  not justin terms of the repatriation of refugees but also of thereconstruction of destroyed infrastructures  includinghousing  schools and medical facilities.In many respects  there are great similarities betweenthe situation in Burundi and that in Rwanda. To date all-out civil war has been avoided but the situation remainsextremely volatile. The region as a whole is in need of truereconciliation. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General  who is trying  through constant contact  dialogueand visits to the area  to resolve these complex problems.His recent decision to appoint an experienced diplomat toorganize a national conference to promote reconciliationand mutual understanding among the countries of the regionis a wise decision.After almost two decades of fratricidal and destructivewarfare  Mozambique is today ready to begin the work ofnational reconstruction following the peace process. Weshould congratulate all the parties that have taken part inthe political transformation of Mozambique on havingadhered to the peace process. Mozambique  with itstremendous potential for economic recovery anddevelopment  has a great future ahead  which it should turnto full advantage. This is a country for which theinternational community has every reason to congratulateitself for having given it timely support and substantialresources to back the peace process.In Haiti  the refusal of the army to comply with thepeace agreement and its intransigence in spite of thecondemnation of the international community left theUnited Nations with no alternative but to take resoluteaction  beginning with economic sanctions  and theninternational intervention. This made it possible for theUnited Nations to deploy a peace-keeping mission there.With the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide political violence and human rights violations have beengreatly reduced. There is now a basis for ensuring thesecurity of the population  guaranteeing increased politicalparticipation and consolidating democracy.The untiring efforts in the long and difficultnegotiations in Lusaka to restore peace in Angola finallyled to an agreement on a general cease-fire and theestablishment of a government. The United Nationsplayed a prominent role in these negotiations with the fullsupport of three observer States. Much remains to bedone  but progress has been steady and positive. Thefuture of Angola will depend on the political will anddetermination of its leaders to forge a new vision  a newnation.In Liberia  the determination of the United Nationsand of the countries of the region has made it possiblefinally to conclude an agreement between the parties.Hostilities are nearing an end  and a cease-fire is to benegotiated. This agreement  concluded just a month ago does not mean that our troubles are over  but we can seethe light at the end of the tunnel. The Liberian peopleseem determined to put a final end to this long anddestructive war  and it is the duty of the internationalcommunity to contribute to this long-awaited outcome thenecessary resources and substantial support.Last year  we witnessed the end of United Nationsoperations in Somalia  when it became clear that thedetermination of the various Somali parties to reach acompromise in the interests of the people of Somalia wasvisibly lacking. Somalia has fallen into oblivion. It issuffering from total political paralysis. Once again  it isthe same old story: warfare among factions. The countrymust be helped to get off to a new start in order to createbetter prospects for peace and stability.We must recall that the prospect of a new civil waris more likely than ever. The spectre of famine is loomingon the horizon. And the personnel of international aidorganizations faces a difficult choice: to accept a state ofincreasing insecurity or to abandon the country to chaos.We want to hope that  no matter how complex anddesperate the political situation in Somalia  theinternational community will not abandon that countryand will continue to provide the necessary support to theSomalis  in particular in the realm of humanitarianassistance. We hope  moreover  that our brothers inSomalia will find the path to wisdom and engage inconstructive negotiations to put an end to the suffering ofthe Somali people.24General Assembly 21st plenary meetingMy country  the Republic of Djibouti  continues toface difficulties in our economic development that areexacerbated by the presence of refugees and displacedpersons  which make up more than 25 per cent of ourpopulation. The pressure thus placed on our infrastructures our medical services  our housing sector and on educationand employment is more than we are able to deal with. Thecumulative effects of the civil wars that have raged inrecent years  both in our country and in neighbouringcountries  and of natural disasters — drought as well asfloods — have seriously hindered our efforts in the area ofdevelopment.A new era of peace and political stability has begun inmy country  which regained its reputation as an oasis ofpeace after the signing of the peace agreement of December1994 and the formation in June 1995 of a new Governmentthat reflected the new situation.Once peace had been achieved  and without anytransition  we began the difficult process of redressing ourcountry’s finances and economy  which had been seriouslyaffected by the consequences of three years of internalconflict and the negative world economic situation.The first phase of a vast restructuring programme proposed by the Government and approved by theParliament  has just been launched through theimplementation of various measures involving severebudgetary restrictions. In addition to these measures  we arecurrently negotiating with the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank for the means to carry out a structuraladjustment programme. Furthermore  in accordance with theresolutions of the Copenhagen World Summit for SocialDevelopment  we wish to preserve our social achievements without which no lasting development can be envisaged.On the regional level  Djibouti is still working towardsthe establishment of a climate of cooperation in all areas.The member countries of the Inter-Governmental Authorityon Drought and Development (IGADD) and of theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(COMESA) have great potential and resources  and IGADDand COMESA are the best instruments for harmonizationand coordination to maximize the exploitation of theseresources.On the international scene  Djibouti has dischargedproductively and responsibly its current term in the SecurityCouncil  and thanks all the countries that have supported it.Our participation in peace-keeping operations  particularlyin Rwanda and Haiti  where Djibouti’s police and armedforces are currently serving  is one of the best proofs ofthis.Together with its neighbours  Djibouti hopes to be ina position to struggle against  and overcome  theconsequences of instability and conflicts in our region.We share the Secretary-General’s view that the workof the United Nations is frequently misunderstood. Thedevelopment crisis is often overlooked because of thepriority given the short-term alleviation of emergencysituations. But development is no less urgent — quite tothe contrary — because today development is a globalissue  and peace  the economy  the environment  socialjustice and democracy are its various aspects. Thepressures created by poverty  unemployment and socialdisintegration are no longer contained within individualfrontiers; they affect our entire “global village”  movingfrom country to country and from region to region. Onlyconsistent growth and lasting development will be able tohalt them. But  clearly  no country  no region can alonesuccessfully face these problems. Even the best-performing economies will face high unemployment ifworld economic growth is not sufficient to absorb theirproduction. If we restrict ourselves to promoting growthin some sectors to the exclusion of others  the result ofthe growth will be unimpressive.But it is most surprising that despite the fact thatworld economic growth yields sufficient resources toeasily eliminate extreme poverty from the face of theEarth  poverty not only persists but continues to increase.The world has a great need of an engine for growthworldwide  a role played by the United Statesimmediately after the Second World War  when itbroadened world markets. But we can no longer hope thata single country will take on this function. Likewise outdated international economic policies and institutionsare standing in the way of investments  the creation ofdevelopment programmes and the markets necessary toincrease demand in the third-world countries andconsequently stimulate economic growth.Aside from this global reality  the difficulties facedby sub-Saharan Africa are sui generis. The Secretary-General himself recently called the economic results inAfrica disappointing  even in the countries that areengaged in-depth reforms. Thirty-three of the 48 least-developed countries in the world are in Africa. There aremany results of this state of affairs and they are wellknown. The recent onslaught of ethnic conflicts and civilwars has greatly contributed to instability  to the many25General Assembly 21st plenary meetingfaces of poverty and to the underdevelopment of thatregion. These conflicts have forced millions of people toseek refuge in other countries or to become displacedpersons. The situation is particularly tragic for women andchildren.If Africa is to have a serious chance to develop  thecrushing burden of foreign debt must be alleviated. Thelong-term debt of the African continent  amounting to $37billion  constitutes about one-half of the debt owed by allthe countries of the “third world”. Very few of thosecountries are in a position to repay their debt.However  for Africa at least to come close to theobjective of 6 per cent of annual growth in its grossdomestic product  as envisaged by the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  wouldrequire substantial external assistance. Even those among uswho  in Africa  have opted for free markets and healthycurrencies  view privatization and balanced budgets withscepticism.This situation  exacerbated by the shocks created bystructural adjustment programmes and political reform  iscontinuing to intensify internal pressures and socialtensions.It is important to maintain aid levels during thistransitional period because this will contribute to stabilizingthe economic conditions that would permit the emergenceof political and social conditions propitious to freeinstitutions. Without such assistance  our fragile economiesare threatened with collapse before they can even attemptto carry out their reforms. Yet  the fact is that for themajority of African countries now engaged in this effort the flow of capital and assistance in all forms is beginningto dry up.As the President of the General Assembly has rightlysaid  the world is passing through a transitional period thatis still “vague  confused and imprecise” (Official Recordsof the General Assembly  Fiftieth Session  PlenaryMeetings  1st meeting  p. 6). The effort to identify  tounderstand  to assign priorities and to try to remedyproblems whose dimensions have profoundly changed hasjust begun. It is revealing  indeed  that in his statement thePresident told the General Assembly that the newinternational order that is to be built must not leave out theUnited Nations  either by replacing it or by doing awayentirely with it.For the United Nations represents a concept of work an expression of the idea whereby all mankind shouldunite its strength to solve problems and improve itsconditions of life. To replace  weaken or marginalize theUnited Nations would constitute an assault on thisconcept.The United Nations  that is  mankind workingtogether  should be the central mechanism through whichthe world can achieve lasting growth and to lendcredibility and legitimacy to our efforts. Peace andsecurity remain important questions  but development andeconomic and social problems are just as vital.The structure of the United Nations should reflectthe realities and present problems as they really exist inorder to tackle them in an effective  professional way.Djibouti favours the constant monitoring of UnitedNations operations in order to define means and methodsto eliminate all waste and reduce unnecessary costs.However  the improvement of the functioning andthe structure of the United Nations will prove of limiteduse if the Organization does not have the resources itneeds to operate. The time has perhaps come to envisagenew methods for financing the United Nations. Inaddition  in the realm of collective security there is a vitalneed to enlarge the Security Council  while respecting theprinciple of equitable geographical representation  and tomake it more democratic and more transparent. Thestructure and functions of the Council should beperiodically reviewed as the international situationevolves.In conclusion  we are the United Nations  and theUnited Nations is us. Together we can achieve greatthings."
"43",1959,"DNK",50,1995,"It is a sad irony that whilewe are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  the Organization finds itself in serious financialcrisis. If not redressed  this crisis will threaten the verygoals of our Organization.Denmark gives top priority to a strengthening of theUnited Nations. Hopefully  we can make headway duringthis session of the General Assembly as regards thefinancial situation of the United Nations and the “Agendafor Development”. We hope that the High-level WorkingGroup under the chairmanship of the President of theGeneral Assembly will keep up the momentum of thereform process.I wish to concentrate on eight points.The first is social development. The World Summitin Copenhagen identified new approaches for action.States have the primary responsibility to attain the goalsof the Summit. In this endeavour  we need the fullsupport of the international community  the UnitedNations  the multilateral financial institutions  regionalorganizations  local authorities and the civil society. Allpartners must participate fully and must increase theirefforts.We also need specific efforts to keep the Summitissues on the agenda. To stimulate the implementation ofthe Summit results  Denmark would like to seeestablished an independent forum on social developmentissues. This forum should supplement the work ofinternational organizations and of intergovernmentalcooperation. In particular  it should compile and analyzedata on social development issues  thus providing thebasis for dialogue. I hope that agreement on the creationof the forum can be reached at this session of the GeneralAssembly.Sustainable economic and social developmentrequires a collective effort. It requires a substantialtransfer of resources  concessional as well asunconcessional  private as well as public  from thedeveloped world to the developing world.The total volume of assistance to developingcountries has declined over the past few years. We mustchange this sad pattern. A first  necessary step would befor all industrialized countries to live up to the UnitedNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product(GNP). Three years ago  Denmark reached 1 per cent ofGNP. We intend to continue that policy.19The need for emergency relief is greater than ever. Itis a short-sighted solution to finance emergency relief outof funds set aside for development. We must find additionalfinancing.Improving the condition of women throughout theworld is of vital importance. We  the Member States of theUnited Nations  have the responsibility to implement thePlatform for Action adopted at Beijing. This platform mustbe pursued at all levels. Let us start right now.The second point is the “Agenda for Peace”. The ideasexpressed therein on preventive diplomacy and a rapidreaction force must be implemented  followed — after aconflict has ended — by confidence-building andhumanitarian measures.Many of these tasks can be carried out by regionalorganizations. Giving more responsibility to regionalorganizations would in Europe mean strengthening theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE).We have seen an increase in the number andcomplexity of peace-keeping operations. Successfuloperations such as those in Namibia  Cambodia and  mostrecently  Mozambique and El Salvador should not beforgotten. As noted by the Secretary-General  the problemsposed by several of today’s conflicts are unprecedented. Wemust learn to tackle these new problems. United Nationspeace-keeping forces have proved to be an invaluable tool.We all have an interest in improving peace-keeping as aunique instrument in international crisis management.We must react strongly against deliberate attacksagainst United Nations personnel. Such attacks areabsolutely unacceptable. I appeal to all Member States toadhere to the Convention on the Safety of United Nationsand Associated Personnel so that persons committingattacks against United Nations personnel are brought tojustice.Denmark attaches great importance to the UnitedNations stand-by forces arrangement. We were among thefirst to assign troops. We are currently  together with like-minded countries  exploring practical ways to a furthershortening of United Nations reaction time.There is also a clear need for minimum standards asregards troops and equipment. Denmark supports actiontaken by the United Nations in the field of training. TheUnited Nations must be given the right to set qualitystandards for troops made available to the Organization.The insufficiency of funds is putting the UnitedNations into an almost untenable operational situation. Wemust soon reach consensus on reforming and stabilizingthe financial foundation of the Organization.As regards reimbursement for equipment put at thedisposal of the Organization  agreement on a new systemmust be reached during this session of the GeneralAssembly.The third point concerns the former Yugoslavia.More than two thirds of the total number of troops underthe United Nations serve in the former Yugoslavia. Theinternational community has made a substantialcontribution towards settling the conflict. We have keptnegotiations going  sometimes against all odds. We havesustained what may be the most difficult peace-keepingoperation the United Nations has ever mounted. We haverendered extensive humanitarian aid.We hope that we are now closer to peace. Still many obstacles will have to be overcome. The conflictremains a huge challenge to the international community.The basic principles for a settlement in Bosniaagreed upon in Geneva early this month form a goodbasis for further negotiations. Pressure on all parties fora negotiated settlement must be upheld. Lasting peace canbe achieved only through negotiations.Denmark continues to give full support to theinternational negotiating efforts  including the efforts ofthe Contact Group. Denmark has provided a substantialnumber of peace-keepers and given sizeable contributionsto alleviate humanitarian suffering. This commitmentstands.But it is absolutely unacceptable when UnitedNations peace-keepers are used as pawns in militaryconfrontations. It is intolerable to see them exposed tosurprise actions and direct attacks with loss of life andcasualties as the tragic consequence.The international community must be prepared foraction to be taken when peace is finally achieved.Denmark stands ready to contribute. The present situationpresents a window of opportunity; we must seize themoment.20I would like to express my congratulations on theinterim agreement between the Greek and the MacedonianGovernments and to pay tribute to the untiring efforts ofMr. Cyrus Vance.My fourth point relates to the Middle Fast peaceprocess. The strong determination to reach resultsmanifested itself in the peace treaty signed last autumnbetween Israel and Jordan and in the latest agreementbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority on the secondstage of Palestinian autonomy. Unfortunately  we see lessprogress in relations between Syria and Israel and betweenLebanon and Israel. But we welcome the clear political willto engage in efforts that may bring progress. All partiesstand to gain if they realize that there is no real alternativeto negotiations and to a just and lasting peace foreverybody.My fifth point is that there is now hope in the field ofdisarmament  arms control and confidence-buildingmeasures. We see positive trends  in particular theagreement reached on indefinitely extending the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Theimplementation of this Treaty has also become moreeffective. The end of East-West confrontation has led todramatic reductions in nuclear stockpiles. But as long asthese weapons exist  the risk of their use remains. Denmarksupports the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treatyno later than 1996. In particular we support the effortsmade to negotiate a true zero-yield test ban.At the same time  we deeply deplore the nuclear testscarried out by China and France. We urge allnuclear-weapon States to refrain from further testing.The Conference to review the 1980 Convention onProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of CertainConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to BeExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects isnow taking place at Vienna. We need progress at theConference towards the ultimate goal of the abolition ofanti-personnel land mines.The sixth point is that the Security Council needs tobe enlarged to reflect the world of today. There must beadditional seats for non-permanent members on theprinciple of equitable geographical representation. Denmarkalso supports an enlargement of the Security Council withGermany and representatives of the Asian  African andLatin American regions as permanent members.My seventh point relates to human rights. Theinternational protection of human rights must beimproved. International cooperation on monitoring respectfor human rights must be strengthened. Additionalresources to carry out this work must be found. Inparticular  we must strengthen the Centre for HumanRights and the office of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights. Denmark will serve as a member of theCommission on Human Rights as from 1 January 1996.Our key priorities as a member of that Commission willinclude the fight against torture  the furthering of the rightto development and the rights of indigenous peoples. Theestablishment of a permanent forum within the UnitedNations is a major political aspiration of indigenouspeoples around the world. Denmark shares that aspiration.The General Assembly should decide to call adiplomatic conference on the establishment of apermanent International criminal court to try cases ofserious international crime.With my final point I wish to draw attention to thestatement issued today by the Nordic Foreign Ministerson the financial situation of the United Nations. In thatstatement the Nordic countries call on all Member Statesto fulfil their financial obligations towards the UnitedNations by immediately paying all outstandingcontributions. Imagine how much more could be done ifthe United Nations had its present outstandingcontributions — $3.5 billion — at its disposal. It is aparadox that those criticizing the United Nations for alack of efficiency are often those who do not honour theirfinancial obligations. They are in this way holding theOrganization hostage. They continue to criticize theUnited Nations as if the Organization were not theirorganization.Denmark sees no alternative to internationalcooperation to solve global problems. The will ofMember States determines the strength of ourcooperation. Much more can be done  providedGovernments are willing.The United Nations has experienced muchturbulence. The United Nations needs renewal. TheUnited Nations needs resources. The United Nationsneeds commitment. Denmark remains as dedicated to theUnited Nations today as we were 50 years ago."
"44",2004,"DOM",50,1995," May I first of all on behalf of theDominican Republic and on behalf of its ConstitutionalPresident  Mr. Joaquín Balaguer  express our sincerestcongratulations to the President of the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly.Secondly  I wish to express our profound gratitudeto the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic ofCôte d’Ivoire  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  whopresided over the forty-ninth session and  particularly  tothe Secretary-General  who  by his extraordinary effortsand tireless dedication in a world marked by challengesand breaches of the peace  wages a daily combat for thefull implementation of the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter.The Dominican Republic can affirm with pride onthis fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the UnitedNations its role as a founding Member of the UnitedNations  which signed the San Francisco Charter withinthe international order that rose from the ashes of theSecond World War  whose fiftieth anniversary we alsocommemorate  and as a country that defends the principleof sovereignty as the inalienable right of the people.Fifty years after the creation of the United Nationsin 1945  the world is in a state of transition toward whathas been termed a new world order  moving frombipolarity to unipolarity in a multipolar world  followingupon the world built in Yalta and in the Bretton Woodsagreements.The 1945 order was based on a balance of powerand on the United Nations as a reflection of the realdesire to seek security and universal peace — and theOrganization has managed  since its creation  to avertanother nuclear holocaust.16General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995Small countries such as the Dominican Republic staunch guardians of their national sovereignty  havewitnessed during the five decades since 1945 this ordercreated through the United Nations and its specializedagencies  with Bretton Woods  the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO)  the Council for Economic Aid(COMECON)  the Warsaw Pact  and the EuropeanEconomic Community — today the European Union; theevolution of countries with market economies and thosewith centrally planned economies  and the decolonizationprocesses which have resulted in the establishment of manyindependent States. All this has left an indelible imprint onthe annals of contemporary history and has been rich inlessons for all the nations of the world — lessons  in aword  on relations between North and South.The order which emerged from Bretton Woods wasreflected in the International Monetary Fund (IMF); theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development(IBRD); and the aborted International Trade Organizationof 1947  which was replaced by the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT)  from which the agriculturalsector  services and intellectual property were excluded. Allthis explains why 46 years later  with the Uruguay Roundof Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the birth  in 1993  ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO)  we are givingmultilateral shape to world trade in order to overcomebilateral barriers and  above all  the protectionism that waspractised by the industrial countries.In these five decades  the small countries had tostruggle mightily to uphold the principles of democracy including respect for human rights  and to defend their rightto access to the markets of the industrialized countriesagainst tariff and non-tariff barriers  quotas  and downwardspiralling in the prices of their raw materials. We can however  point with pride to the way we fought for ourdemands for greater symmetry and fairness in commercialand economic relations. This in the end led to theestablishment of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD).The San Francisco Charter illuminated like apowerful beacon the road to the future of the countries thathad had to experience the difficult period of the bipolarworld. For its part  the Dominican Republic  committed asalways to the principles of the Charter  was able to attainthe functional democracy we enjoy today. This took placewithin a world that has some 30 integration processes andhas seen the emergence of three strong economic-integration blocs with their spheres of influence — such asthe European Union and the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA) — in addition to the Free TradeZone of the Americas  which will probably be establishedin the year 2005; and  for Eastern Asia  the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC). There are alsothe political repercussions these processes have had on aworld where the dreams for centrally planned economieshave faded. Our country is now a member of the recentlyestablished Association of Caribbean States (ACS).This new world order that has now become theglobal village foreseen by Marshall McLuhan  within aglobalized  international economy  will not be withouttensions  for we do not yet fully grasp the culturalplurality of nations and the strong search for identity inregions and within ethnic and religious groups. Contraryto the popular phrase  history has not come to an end. Anew process is beginning with the expression by peoplesand regions of their national identity.The globalization of trade would seem to transcendthe borders of the nation-State and create a concept of aregion-State  given the fragmentation of nationalaggregate assets.Within the family of nations we feel proud to havebeen not only one of the 51 States that participated in theSan Francisco Conference  but also one of the first tohave ratified  in resolution 962 of our National Congress the Charter of the United Nations  which was promulgatedby our Executive Branch on 11 August 1945.On the fiftieth anniversary of that memorable datewe wish to pay tribute to those members of theDominican delegation who signed that historic document:Manuel Peña Batlle  Emilio García Godoy  GilbertoSánchez Lustrino  Tulio Franco y Franco and MinervaBernardino. We are a nation deeply committed to theproper functioning of democratic institutions  havingattained a commendable political stability in ourcontinent’s community of nations.In this context  the United Nations will be making apraiseworthy contribution to the process of maintainingstability in our country by responding to the request ofthe Dominican Republic for reimbursement of the fundsspent in implementing the economic embargo imposed onour neighbour  Haiti. The Dominican Republic hassubmitted that request to the Secretariat and ourGovernment is now awaiting a response.As a developing country the Dominican Republicmust face many challenges in the sensitive areas of drug17General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995trafficking and drug consumption. This is a problem ourcountry has met with a State policy that provides for severepunishments for offences related to this crime againsthumanity. At the present time legislation is pending in ourNational Congress to punish money-laundering  which is anactivity related to the criminal drug traffic. We are alsocoordinating our policies with the international community since in this field more than any other internationalcooperation is required.It is fitting here to congratulate the United NationsSecretariat on the successful holding of the Fourth WorldConference on Women at Beijing. That Conferencerepresents a milestone in the Organization’s history becauseof the recognition it has granted to that noble human beingwho makes up half of all humanity and is the mother of theother half.In that connection we would reiterate at this fiftiethsession  just as we did at the last session  our concern at theSecretary-General’s proposal to merge the InternationalResearch and Training Institute for the Advancement ofWomen (INSTRAW) with the United Nations DevelopmentFund for Women (UNIFEM). The General Assemblyshould recall Economic and Social Council resolution1979/4 of 9 May 1979  which established the permanentheadquarters of the Institute in the Dominican Republic.We wish to reiterate — with the utmost courtesy  butalso with the utmost firmness — our request thatINSTRAW and UNIFEM not be merged  maintaining thecommitments contained in General Assembly resolution34/157 of 17 December 1979 and the agreement thatestablished INSTRAW in Santo Domingo so that our firstcity of America may remain the headquarters of thatimportant Institute. This would also be in keeping with theextraordinary importance of the recently concludedConference on Women.We are now only six years from the beginning of thetwenty-first century  in the year 2001  and our thoughts turnto an assessment of the past 50 years since the founding ofthe United Nations. We should also be visualizing thefoundations and the shape of the new world order for thebuilding of a future based on security and world peace.This will require a qualitative change in the United Nations removing the sacrosanct aura surrounding the veto power ofthe great Powers in the Security Council and promoting ademocratic system of coexistence among States andpeoples.The United Nations and we  its Member States  willhave to meet the challenge of the demographic or so-called population bomb with growth estimated at 84million persons per year  and related problems  such asthe fact that in 1990 only 40 per cent of the world’spopulation lived in rural sectors and over 50 per cent inurban centres of over 100 000 inhabitants. The number ofpersons suffering malnutrition is estimated to reach 512million by the end of the century. Children withoutschooling will number 315 million  and there will be 889million illiterate persons. Those living without sanitationsystems will reach 1 750 million. Dealing with thoseproblems will be a real challenge.The new context of the world order will require athree-pronged approach involving an ecological response a political response and an economic response.Although the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme was an important step forward for theprotection of the biosphere  consideration should be giventhe possibility of creating  after proper study  anecological response embodied in a United Nationsenvironmental security council composed of MemberStates with a permanent 15-member executive committeeand a secretary-general with executive powers.The political response would come from the reformof the United Nations Charter. In this connection  weshould bear in mind that Article 109 of the Charter which was written in 1945  provides for the convening ofa General Conference within a 10-year period for thepurpose of reviewing the Charter. In addition  on 22 April1991 a number of former Heads of State and politicalleaders appealed for a renewal of the United Nations.Today  it is appropriate to envisage the inclusion ofGermany  Japan and India as members of the SecurityCouncil  as well as the inclusion of representatives ofthird-world countries.Charter reform would  of course  imply the exerciseof the powers of the Secretary-General supported byunder-secretaries for environmental  political andeconomic affairs.In addition  the economic response should comefrom a clear and precise definition of the role of theUnited Nations within the new order. Since  in theeconomic sphere  the Group of 7 has already beencoordinating its policies through a kind of securitycouncil  with the recent addition of Russia  we mightenvisage its incorporation into the United Nations as a18General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995sort of Economic Council that might include  in addition the countries of southern Asia and the Pacific  as well asLatin America and other regions. It could eventuallybecome a Group of 18  linked to the General Assembly  theEconomic and Social Council  the specialized agencies andthe regional commissions.The Dominican Republic hopes that the ideas andsuggestions that have been put forward  many now understudy and being proposed in various forums  will be viewedas a good-will contribution by a small nation — a nationthat is small but proud of its participation in theinternational community.For that reason  we cannot  as a small nation thatbelieves in unity within diversity  fail to mention oursupport for the agenda item — proposed by Burkina Faso Costa Rica  Dominica  Grenada  Guatemala  Guinea-Bissau  the Solomon Islands  Nicaragua  Niger  Panama the Central American Republic  Saint Lucia  SaintVincent and the Grenadines  Swaziland and our country the Dominican Republic — regarding the special situationof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the internationalcontext  based on the principle of universality and inaccordance with the established model of parallelrepresentation of divided countries in the United Nations.The Republic of China on Taiwan  a FoundingMember of the United Nations  has a population of21 million  a high level of economic development and fullpolitical democracy. It has been a model to all developingnations. Its aspiration to participate in the United Nationsonce again is something positive for the internationalcommunity. The Organization must not ignore itsexistence. The Dominican Republic supports theestablishment of an ad hoc committee to seek asatisfactory resolution of this matter.At this fiftieth session  the General Assembly shouldtake stock of the achievements of the United Nations inits 50 years of existence as well as of the unfulfilledobjectives in the area of the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. But above all it should adopt a visionof the future that will enable us to build a democraticsystem of coexistence among States and peoples  inspiredby the profound human aspiration to lasting peace. Maymerciful God help us attain these goals."
"45",2051,"DZA",50,1995,"Allow me first to say how pleased we are to seeAmbassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal presiding overthis session of the General Assembly  a session thatcoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. His election to the presidency is a tribute thatexpresses recognition of his personal qualities. Wewelcome this unanimous election of a high-rankingrepresentative of the friendly country  Portugal  whoseskills and experience we value. I should like to assurehim of the support and cooperation of Algeria.I should also like to express Algeria’s gratitude tohis predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  Minister for ForeignAffairs of the Côte d’Ivoire for his outstanding efforts andachievements throughout his mandate.We are verygrateful to him for the manner in which he has honouredAfrica and wish him every success in his work in theservice of his country.15I should also like to say how grateful we are to theSecretary-General of the Organization  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  and how much we appreciate his sagacityand resolve at a time when the role of the Organizationvis-à-vis the call for peace  security and development  isbecoming more urgent. I wish to renew to him assurancesof our full confidence and continuing support.This session of the General Assembly is trulyexceptional in that it takes place at a time when theinternational community is at a historic turning-point. Neverbefore has there been such a need for stability and security nor has there been a more pressing quest for a fairer  moreequitable and balanced world. Herein lies the symbioticsignificance of this fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. It comes as a timely reminder of the importanceof world peace and security and of the need for our nationsto organize their common future on new foundations.Thus  when we take stock of the Organization’sactivities over the past 50 years in all areas of internationallife  the transformations and shortcomings such stocktakingreveals make it incumbent upon us to make a special effortto identify the stakes and the challenges we must face up toas the century draws towards its end.How our world shapes up will depend on our doingso. Therefore  the ambition of the world Organizationshould be to give true content to collective security and topromote the creation of a new paradigm for development.The United Nations must adapt to a changing andsingularly complex world reality by going back to thesource  to the principles upon which it was founded if it isto forge a new future for all.At a time when the international order has lost itsregulatory capability and the international community lacksthe frames of reference that could help guide its action  itis up to the United Nations to regulate inter-State relations to promote a stable and equitable order and to foster amodel that would be acceptable to all.At a time when it is becoming clear that tradeglobalization and market integration respond only partiallyto the growing need for justice  equity  stability andsecurity  the United Nations must take its position at theforefront of the drive towards harmonization which is amust for conflict prevention  crisis management rapprochement between peoples and the promotion ofcooperation between States.However  if the Organization is to perform its role it must be given the means that would enable it to betterorganize international society and equip it to face up tothe upsurge of intolerance  the escalation of terrorism  theexacerbation of tensions and conflicts  the aggravation ofthe economic situation of the most deprived countries  thesocial malaise in the industrialized countries and anoverall decline. In short  the United Nations must beequipped with the means that would enable it to defendfreedom  law  justice and equity.This means that nothing could be done in theabsence of the political will of States that bear theresponsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying thedisaffection that is noticeable today vis-à-vis the UnitedNations by giving true meaning to the Organization’sinvaluable and multifarious contributions towards thepromotion of an international society that is more just better organized and better structured.Whether it is a matter of democratizing internationalrelations  completing the process of decolonization upholding human rights  strengthening the disarmamententerprise or ensuring the continuity of internationalefforts to promote development  the contributions ofStates and their awareness of their responsibilities remainindispensable if the United Nations is to be able toperform the ever-developing role it has to play in thiscontext.Proceeding from this  it is only by improving thecollective capabilities of the international community toface up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices thata true meaning could be given to preventive efforts ofdiplomacy  to peace-keeping operations and to theelaboration of a genuine structure of internationalcooperation.It is only with a new vision  a new thinking and newmodalities of action that the international communitywould be able to surmount obstacles and ensure futuresuccess.As we approach the end of the century  it isimportant to rethink our practices with a view toelaborating long-term complementarities that would riseup to future challenges  spare the world new crises andestablish the regulatory rules our world needs.It is this vision that inspires Algeria in its thinkingof the need for international action that should be mademore palpable in order to ensure greater consultation16among nations  and greater understanding among peoples aswell as greater courage in striving to achieve peace anddevelopment.It is this vision that guides Algeria’s national renewalendeavour which aims at establishing on firm foundationsthe rule of law  promoting economic reform andstrengthening the democratic process.The democratic presidential elections  the first roundof which will take place on 16 November 1995  willtranslate into actual political reality  the will and desire topromote the sense of responsibility of all Algerians and tohasten the laying of firm foundations for an open  free anddemocratic society.This democratic process  an ever-renewed experiment is bound to contribute to the achievement of stability  theconcretization of democratic freedoms and development inour region  and  as it truly expresses the aspirations of ourpeoples  it will be the appropriate retort to all attempts atsubversion  of which terrorism is the most abhorrentmanifestation. To us  combating terrorism is a battle indefence of democracy. As any complacency vis-à-visterrorism would be an absolute negation of democracy  itfollows that we cannot remain indifferent to this scourgewhich poses a really serious threat to international peaceand security. Thus  the struggle against terrorism does notallow of any laxity but must be pursued most vigorously inthe context of decisive international action whose aimshould be the total eradication of this scourge from all oursocieties.If we are to rise up to this challenge  there is a needto accord a high priority to economic and socialdevelopment. This is a need that is more urgent than everbefore. Its relevance has been recognized today by all theGovernments of one region. Awareness of the threat of thescourge of terrorism and the interest shown in the Algerianproposal regarding the need for a response in solidaritywithin the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean regiondemonstrate fully the strength of this conviction.In the context of the newly emerging political economic and social realities  Algeria has accorded specialpriority in the context of its immediate environment  to theproblems of security and development and to the sort ofcontributions required in resolving such problems.Proceeding from this  Algeria is convinced that theunitary Maghreb project is necessary  not only for thesecurity and stability of the Maghreb region  but also forthe prosperity of the Euro-Mediterranean region  as wellas the Arab and African regions.It is precisely within the context of the need toestablish a unified  strong and stable Maghreb region thatAlgeria makes its contribution towards the achievement ofa just and lasting settlement to the question of WesternSahara. Part and parcel of this policy is Algeria’s supportof the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-Generalaimed at a transparent and credible implementation of thesettlement plan through a genuine referendum  whichwould ensure the free exercise by the people of theWestern Sahara of its right to self-determination andindependence.Any violation of the settlement plan  especiallythrough the moving foreign populations to the WesternSahara  would have very serious consequences for thepeace process. All obstacles that impede theimplementation of the settlement plan should be dealtwith through direct dialogue between the two parties tothe conflict  the Kingdom of Morocco and the PolisarioFront  with the aim of creating the proper conditions fora peaceful settlement to the conflict that would realize theaspirations of the peoples of the region. A just and lastingsettlement to the question of the Western Sahara wouldcontribute to the strengthening of the Maghreb unitaryedifice  thus making it a fundamental element of successfor medium- and long-term cooperative strategies in boththe Sahelian-Saharan and Mediterranean regions.In this connection  to lift the sanctions whichcontinue to severely afflict the brotherly Libyan peopleand to search for urgent solutions to the relevantdifferences  is an urgent need that acquires particularsignificance and should make part of any forward-lookingstrategy. Here  as elsewhere  political will underscores theneed for an intelligent understanding of the situation andfor a positive dialectic that would contribute to thebuilding of a community of stability and progress. It is inthis spirit that we continue to deploy efforts that aim atconsolidating cooperation in the sahelian-Saharan region an enterprise which we shall endeavour to pursue tosuccess at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean conferencein Barcelona.In the Middle East  where the building of peacerequires from all parties sincerity  determination andrespect for the commitments undertaken  Algeriacontinues to make its contribution towards theestablishment of a lasting peace based on a just andoverall settlement consistent with the rights of all the17region’s peoples. That is why  while supporting the peaceprocess  Algeria has continuously underscored the need forwithdrawal by Israel from all Arab territories occupiedsince 1967  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif and respect for thenational inspirations of the Palestinian people. In thiscontext  Algeria welcomes the conclusion of the agreementon the extension of Palestinian national autonomy in thewest bank of the Jordan as a new positive step and calls forits translation into concrete reality.The search for a just  comprehensive and lasting peacein the Middle East calls for full awareness of the fact thatthe challenges which face the peoples of the region requiremore wide-ranging and more efficacious solutions. Fromthis standpoint  since Iraq is fulfilling its commitmentswhich arise from the Security Council resolutions  thesanctions which severely afflict the people of this countryshould be lifted.By the same token  Kuwait’s internationallyrecognized borders must be fully respected. Finally  therestoration of the sovereignty of the United Arab Emiratesover the islands of Abou-Moussa  greater Tumb  and lesserTumb must be reaffirmed. By meeting these conditions new prospects for stability and security in the region canemerge.The alarming situation in Africa  where instability anduncertainty are symptomatic of a protracted crisis andwhere the fundamental elements of a new solution arebeing sought against a backdrop of disorder  the hotbeds oftension that persist in Angola  Liberia  Burundi  Rwandaand Somalia must now be quenched. However  any returnto stability will only take place through economic recoveryand escape from the economy of indebtedness that hasseverely damaged social cohesion  to a new type ofeconomic organization that would foster growth andguarantee the modalities of international integration.As of necessity  this calls for dealing  as a matter ofurgency  with the social costs of structural adjustment andimplementing the new United Nations programme forAfrica in order to avoid the tragedies and sufferings thatbeset the peoples of Africa and to put an end to themarginalization of the African continent. This is the price-tag on stability and peace in Africa and security in theworld.We are equally concerned at the latest developmentsin Bosnia and Herzegovina where an entire people  whosevery survival is threatened  face hatred  exclusion and theinsanity of ethnic cleansing. It is no longer possible totolerate this savage onslaught on the conscience ofhumanity. It is the international community’s duty andresponsibility to put an end to this situation which ispolitically unacceptable and morally intolerable. From thisrostrum  I would like to reiterate Algeria’s solidarity withand support for Bosnia and Herzegovina in exercising itsright to defend its unity and territorial integrity and toprotect the dignity and values of its citizens. In this spirit Algeria has supported the current peace initiatives aimedat a just and lasting solution that would ensure respect forthe constitutional principles that the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina wish freely to choose.In addition to these concerns  Algeria hascommitments relating to peace throughout the world  asentered into in the framework of United Nations peace-keeping operations in Angola  Cambodia and Haiti  andparticipation in the election monitoring process that led tothe birth of the new South Africa.All this reflects Algeria’s posture and itscommitment to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. This is reflected in the comprehensive andcoherent policy Algeria has always pursued with regardto disarmament issues  a policy that has led to itsaccession to the major disarmament instruments. Its recentaccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  its effective contribution to thepromotion of consensus solutions in the negotiations onthe Treaty’s extension  and ratification  several weeks agoof the Chemical Weapons Convention  are significantmoves that reflect Algeria’s desire to play an active rolein achieving general and complete disarmament.The need for a viable international order based onsolidarity has never been as urgent as it is now at a timewhen the world is in the throes of a phase of systematictransition.If it acknowledges how far we are interdependent the international community will be able to usher in anorderly world society of solidarity that respects thediversity it enjoys.That is the reason why we must reduce the wideninggap between North and South that  in the long term  areanathema to both international peace and security  and putour minds to the establishment of new balances based onrenewed international relations. Such relations  if they arebased on consultation and openness to the solidarityinterests of the international community  will promotecredible solutions to development problems. They must18validate the efforts of developing countries to regulatedomestic adjustment processes  restore social balances andensure all the conditions for meaningful integration into thenew international order.In the face of rapid changes that threaten social fabricacross the board  it is essential to promote a stable predictable international economic environment that wouldbe conducive to development efforts. In this context  moreequitable financial  monetary  trading and technologicalrelations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade asan effective instrument for mutual development  forreconciling peoples and strengthening the internationalcommunity.In the face of these challenges  the United Nations with its experience and credibility in terms of global issues can provide inspiration  encouragement and help toelaborate and follow up future strategies. It is therefore ourduty and responsibility to ensure that the United NationsOrganization reasserts its authority  makes its structuresmore democratic and rationalizes its working methods.Such an endeavour should be founded on thereaffirmation of Member States’ commitments to the kindof renewal that is based on and inspired by the principlesof the Charter of the United Nations.This means that any restructuring of the UnitedNations system must meet the requirements of truedemocracy in international relations and should focus on therevitalization of its bodies  improving coordination betweenthem  rehabilitating the General Assembly and ensuringtransparency in reforming the Security Council. Whether itis a matter of establishing order among the essentialelements of action or global decision-making  theprerequisite of democracy is now at the very heart of theproblems of peace and development. In this context  “AnAgenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for Development” areof the utmost importance.Thus  if we look clearly at the international situationand what is really at stake  this adaptation process will leadto new hope for humanity and ensure a lasting foothold inhistory for international peace and security."
"46",2098,"ECU",50,1995,"First of all I should like to extend my warmestcongratulations to you  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  arenowned and distinguished academician andinternationalist  on your well-deserved election asPresident of this historic session of the General Assemblymarked by the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. I should also like to pay a tributeto Mr. Amara Essy in recognition of the admirable workhe performed as President of the forty-ninth session of theAssembly.At the end of the twentieth century and the dawn ofa new millennium  in a world characterized by aglobalization of the economy and the dynamics ofinternational relations  our reality is conditioned by factorssuch as the substantial progress of science  thetranscendence of the technological revolution  the decisiveinfluence of communications and information  theexpansion of trade and the consequences of cultural andreligious interaction. However  an acute imbalance ofsocial and economic aspects coexists with these factors mainly in the developing world  whose inhabitantsaccount for three quarters of mankind.We are faced with problems that were not foreseenat the beginning of this century  including theinternationalization of environmental problems fragmentation and the revival of violent nationalisms political and social instability  and the decrease in thetransfer of international resources for development.In many third world countries social problems areincreasingly becoming more acute. Extreme poverty accompanied by hunger  malnutrition  abandonment unemployment  disease and ignorance  has been combinedin many regions with guerrilla movements and armedinsurrection. Several countries face the consequences ofthe foreign debt crisis  associated with the lack ofinternational political solidarity to relieve it. In manyregions corruption has become an endemic disease. Theproduction  consumption of and trafficking in narcoticdrugs devastate our traditional social structures. Violence 5rural and urban  is on the increase  and the brutal meansfrequently used to suppress it actually promote its growth.Thus  in my capacity as Secretary pro tempore of the RioGroup  and as Ecuador’s representative in the Group  Ishould like  on its behalf  to call for the convening of asecond international conference on narcotic drugs toexamine appropriate mechanisms to foster the world fightagainst drug trafficking and its dire consequences.Keeping this perspective in mind  Ecuador willcontinue to favour the adoption of urgent measures withinthe international community to fight vigorously against allthese social problems  which affect so many countries. TheGeneral Assembly proclaimed 1996 as the InternationalYear for the Eradication of Poverty. My country hopes that with this proclamation  international public opinion willbecome more conscious of the complexity of this graveproblem and will try to find measures for its solution.Since the end of the cold war  international tensionshave eased  and the intensification of trust between Stateshas fostered the adoption of measures concerning nucleardisarmament. However  the danger implied by theproliferation and use of nuclear weapons prevails. For thisreason  Ecuador strongly condemned the nuclear tests byChina and France. We hope that the general appeal to ceaseall such tests will receive a positive response from thesetwo countries.Ecuador favoured the consensus for an indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  and  at the same time  considered that thishistoric decision formed part of an integral unity with theprinciples and objectives adopted on that occasion for thenon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and also withdisarmament. In this regard  Ecuador recalls that thenegotiations concerning a comprehensive nuclear-test-bantreaty should conclude in 1996  at the latest  and thatnegotiations to ban fissionable materials for nuclearweapons should be scheduled shortly  with a view toachieving general and complete disarmament  pursuant theprovisions of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.In this context  the full enforcement of the Treaty ofTlatelolco has made Latin America a nuclear-weapon-freezone. Our region offers this example as an incentive for theestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  especially inareas of greater tension.My country applauds the agreements reached by Israeland the national Palestinian Authority  which willundoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of peace in oneof the regions most stricken by insecurity  violence andarmed confrontations — the Middle East. We considerthat these efforts and the measures to be taken inaccordance with agreements already concluded willcontribute to the total pacification of this region.Consequently  Ecuador expresses to the two parties itsencouragement and its confidence that  with internationalsupport  they will continue along the path of peace thatthey have  happily  taken.On the other hand  we must express our deepconcern about the ongoing armed actions in the formerYugoslavia  in spite of the Security Council’s frequentappeals and resolutions. We believe that the Powers withhigher international responsibilities should resolutely takethe necessary steps to end this regrettable situation. At thesame time  Ecuador wishes to join in appeals concerningthe dangerous situation in Burundi  which could result inbloody events comparable to those in Rwanda.The main purpose of the United Nations  its veryreason for being  is the maintenance of international peaceand security. It has been pointed out that since 1989 morethan a hundred armed conflicts have erupted around theworld — most of them due to domestic problems. Suchsituations have endangered the maintenance ofinternational world peace and security — even worldpeace in some cases — showing the increasingly clearinterrelationship between domestic and internationalaffairs. That is why Ecuador believes that peace does notsimply mean the absence of armed conflicts; it alsocomprises the political  economic and social conditions inwhich our peoples evolve. It should therefore berecognized that the non-military issues of human securityand sustainable development have been added to thetraditional security concepts.Ecuador believes  therefore  that the United Nations with its 50 years’ experience of successes and failures must be prepared to face the new challenges appearingthroughout the world. Furthermore  it should be pointedout that the international community today has more trustin the world Organization and is more often seeking moredirect  more effective  intervention to reduce or resolvepolitical  economic or social conflicts. This situationdemands that the United Nations should be strengthenedand restructured.My country believes that the Security Council shouldbe restructured to reflect adequately not only the newinternational world order but also the current membershipof the United Nations. It should also become more6capable — through the adoption of early-warningmeasures — of taking prompt and effective action in thefields of conflict-prevention and the continued deploymentof peace-keeping operations to re-establish and consolidatepeace. We do not believe that this urgent need torestructure the Council will be met by the mere inclusion oftwo major industrial Powers as new permanent members.When the question of increased membership is beingdiscussed  we maintain that if the current imbalance is to beprevented from continuing to deteriorate  all geographicalregions should be appropriately represented.We disagree with the extension of the veto privilegeto additional members. Since this is a mechanism createdto respond to world political realities that no longer exist the Powers possessing this privilege should willingly agreeto restrict its practice exclusively to issues related toChapter VII of the Charter. The whole world wouldwelcome such a decision by the five permanent membersas an effective step towards a more democratic UnitedNations.The General Assembly  too  should be thoroughlyrevitalized to enable it to carry out its duties under Article11 of the Charter in an effective and responsible manner and so that its resolutions — in particular  those concerningissues related to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity — may  duly observed and enforced  exercise theinfluence we would hope to see of resolutions of thehighest political organ of the United Nations. TheEconomic and Social Council should also respond moreadequately to the broad requirements set forth in theCharter. The Trusteeship Council has lost its significance and should be entirely restructured. Similarly  the broadfunctions assigned to the Secretary-General in Article 99 ofthe Charter should be exercised to the fullest.Ecuador believes it is necessary to review the structureand functions of the Bretton Woods institutions and theirrelations with the United Nations. In order to obtain optimalresults and fully utilize existing resources  it is essential tocoordinate international efforts with regard to theinternational monetary system and economic and socialprogress.The severe financial crisis facing the United Nationscould be alleviated were the Member States that are mostin arrears  for various reasons  to make a sincere effort tomeet their obligations. It is unacceptable to transfer theburden of resolving this crisis to the developing countries whose weak economies cannot satisfy such demands.Having made respect for all human rights the mottoof its Government  Ecuador attaches particular importanceto United Nations actions in favour of the protection andpromotion of such rights. It views with great concern themassive violations of human rights and the recrudescenceof what were thought to be extinct practices  such as“ethnic cleansing”  which in some cases — as in theformer Yugoslavia — have reached genocidal proportions all of which constitute an unequivocal threat tointernational peace. Ecuador expresses its revulsion at and condemns  attacks against civilians  especially theelderly  women and children  which are creating agrowing number of refugees. Such violations are achallenge not only to the United Nations and the manyvalid international instruments  but to the moralconscience of all mankind.Ecuador promotes and supports all measuresdesigned to put a stop to this deplorable situation  topunish the guilty and to re-establish a climate of trust harmony and peace. It believes that the internationalcommunity has a clear and unavoidable responsibility inthis regard. We hope that the General Assembly  andparticularly the Security Council  will take the necessarysteps to deal effectively with the dangerous breaches ofinternational peace and security such violations represent.We express our confidence in and support for the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights  and hopesthat the Assembly will provide the administrative andfinancial resources necessary for him to carry out hisimportant tasks to the full.Ecuador believes that democratic systems are theproper response to peoples’ yearning for freedom andfraternal coexistence and for cultural expression.To attain the objectives of the International Decadeof the World’s Indigenous People  Ecuador  a multi-ethniccountry  has submitted various concrete programmes andinitiatives  in consultation with national indigenousorganizations  designed to improve the economic  socialand cultural status of those groups while fully respectingtheir distinctive characteristics. It hopes to be able to relyon international cooperation in bringing these initiativesand programmes to fruition.In previous decades the United Nations led thestruggle for the self-determination of peoples  whichresulted in an end to the shameful colonial system. Fromthe earliest years of its existence the Organizationcondemned the apartheid system  and it continued to doso until apartheid was abolished. The time has now come7for the United Nations to fight for the realization of theright to development  based on solid economic and socialfoundations  implying a promise of better living conditionsfor millions of human beings. Stable and lasting peace canbe achieved only through a sustainable and harmoniousdevelopment.That development must go hand in hand with urgentsolutions to the problem of preserving the great heritage ofmankind — the environment. Agenda 21  resulting from the“Earth Summit”  must be complied with. To play its part Ecuador will continue to seek international cooperation topreserve its immense ecological wealth  not only of itscontinental territory  but also — and particularly — in theAmazonian region and the Galapagos Islands.In keeping with its policy of opening its economy Ecuador has become the first new member of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  which enables it  inter alia  tobenefit from the guaranteed application of the principle ofnon-discrimination in its trade relations with all othermembers  to negotiate better terms for trade in Ecuadoriangoods and services  to obtain technical support andassistance and to enjoy the favourable terms of tradeaccorded developing countries.My country considers that a stable relationship shouldbe established between the World Trade Organization andthe United Nations  and we therefore actively support thedrafting of an agreement between these two Organizationsin keeping with the Marrakech Accord and the SanFrancisco Charter. That could be the basis for theestablishment of a new  more just and efficient internationalorder  in which respect for the human person is guaranteed people’s welfare is fostered  economic development isshared and the balance and fairness of international tradeare guaranteed  so as to create a society based oninternational cooperation  solidarity and interdependence.The United Nations is called upon to perform animportant task in realizing this new order. To that end  notonly must the Organization as a whole be restructured  butall Member States  great and small  must offer their totalpolitical support to the United Nations.Ecuador has always upheld its historical  Amazonianand peaceful tradition and its respect for the rule of law. Ithas adhered to the purposes and principles of the Charter including non-recourse to the threat or use of force againstthe territorial integrity of any other State and the obligationto resolve international disputes exclusively throughpeaceful means.Problems created by breaches of the peace occur inevery part of the globe. Thus  early this year Ecuador wasinvoluntarily involved in an unsought armed conflict ofunpredictable consequences with its southern neighbour Peru. The Secretary- General of the United Nations andthe Organization’s Member States were informed of thisunfortunate conflict  which arose out of the territorialproblem that has for decades soured relations between ourtwo countries. A peaceful  just and definitive solution ofthis controversy is a necessity not only for our twonations  but also for peaceful coexistence in LatinAmerica. My Government has always sought to avoidsuch conflict through diplomatic channels. The actionstaken by the guarantor countries under the Rio Protocolof 1942 were extremely important in arriving at acease-fire during the military confrontation and in leadingto the pacification process agreed to in the ItamaratyPeace Declaration of 17 February 1995 and ratified in theMontevideo Declaration of 28 February. This process hasgradually led to the restoration of peace. We trust that with the assistance of Argentina  Brazil  Chile and theUnited States  and their military observers still deployedin the conflict area  the aspirations of the Ecuadorian andPeruvian peoples will be fulfilled and that a definitivesolution to the problem on the terms that I havementioned will be achieved.The action taken by the guarantor countriesregarding the conflict between Ecuador and Peru hasproved particularly effective  and we are certain it willlead to a total normalization of relations between Ecuadorand Peru. At the recent meeting of the Heads of State andGovernment of the countries of the Rio Group  held last4 and 5 September  there were important signs ofrelaxation of tension in the statements made by the Headsof State of both countries as well as in the encouragingpositions of the other countries  which we believe provide not only a clear orientation towards peace butalso support for complete peaceful coexistence  while atthe same time creating a space for dialogue  constructivenegotiations and a resumption of the integrationistprocesses that serve to consolidate peace. All this moreover  will clear a sure path towards cooperation  invarious spheres of our relations with our neighbours andwith other countries  with mutual respect andunderstanding. I believe we have begun to move towardsa better understanding  and if we prepare a framework ofgood will we will be able not only to bring our divergentpositions closer together but also to reach agreements forlasting solutions.8The problems threatening international peace — whicharouse natural fears  create anxiety  work against thepeople’s well-being  cause enormous losses of human lifeand bring about an immense deterioration of social andeconomic development — are no doubt the gravestproblems  and they call for action for peace by all meanspossible. They are deep-rooted problems that require apositive response from international organizations  bothglobal and regional  when their assistance is needed tosolve such problems."
"47",2143,"EGY",50,1995,"Itgives me great pleasure to extend to the President  and tohis friendly country  Portugal  our congratulations on hiselection as President of the General Assembly for thishistoric session  which crowns 50 years of internationalwork under the banner of the United Nations in the serviceof humanity  individuals and peoples.I should also like to express our profound appreciationto His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Côte d’Ivoire  for his wise conduct of the workof the forty-ninth session and for his valuable efforts in thepreparatory work for the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary.We now live in an age wherein the international mapof political relations is being redrawn  side by side with thereshaping of the scales of economic relations and  probably the essence of existing social and cultural systems. Theuniversal nature of issues and the similarity of the problemsfacing our contemporary societies have become theprincipal feature of our world. Consequently  the only wayto deal with such issues and problems is to promote andrationalize international cooperation  since the majority ofthe problems we face today cannot be dealt withunilaterally at a time when the fluctuations of financialmarkets  the transactions of transnational corporations andthe impact of information networks and communicationsatellites all transcend the national boundaries of States. Wecannot hope to succeed in dealing with problems againstsuch a complex backdrop without international andcollective action in the interests of the entire human race.In this  we see a very significant role for the UnitedNations in formulating the modern concepts needed indealing with problems in such a difficult and complex era.Although the ending of the cold war did removetremendous obstacles that  for so long  had adverselyaffected efforts of international cooperation in all fields this  in itself  has not been conducive to the spontaneousemergence of a new international order based on legality justice  and democracy  that is capable of maintainingpeace and bringing prosperity to peoples. This requires aconsensual vision of what the content and rules of such anew international order should be. It also requires thedissipation of the growing fears that many countries nowharbour as a result of the tendency to entrench policies ofdouble standards  to look for some ideological orintellectual foe to demonize and to make a target forcriticism  international mobilization and techniques ofsubjugation.This can be seen clearly in the performance of theSecurity Council and in its hesitant posture when it comesto facing up to certain situations  probably because of thelack of the necessary political will  or to the fact that thatwill falls hostage to conflicting attitudes. Again  this maybe due to the fact that we  as an international community are still unable to develop a concept of a system ofcollective security that would be in consonance with theprovisions of the United Nations Charter.In this connection  let us call to mind the tragediesof ethnic genocide perpetrated against the people ofBosnia and Herzegovina. Having done this  let us call tomind the ability  the inability or the ambivalencedemonstrated in reacting to those international crimes andthe adverse impact they have had on the credibility of theworld order  of which the United Nations continues to bea principal cornerstone. We need to pause and review thecollective-security system and how we can improve it.We must also consider the need for a parallel economic-and social-security system in the light of the global trendtowards market economies and in the light also of theachievements made in the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) and the related problems in thedeveloping world  which constitutes the overwhelmingmajority of the human race.It is no longer possible to face up to the challengesof tomorrow with the methods of yesterday  especiallythat the concept of security is no longer limited toterritories or national boundaries at a time when mostarmed conflicts take place within such nationalboundaries  and when the lack of economic and socialdevelopment has become a universally grave problem. Itfollows from this that the challenge which now faces theinternational community represented by the UnitedNations has to do with the extent of the Organization’sability to address such new issues  with the degree of itssuccess in forging an international and democraticconsensus in that regard  and with the presence orabsence of the political will to enable the United Nationsto perform its role through the provision of the resourcesit must have in order for it to do so.The United Nations has made an outstandingcontribution towards the promotion of internationalawareness of issues which stand as milestones in thehistory of the twentieth century  prominent among which5are decolonization  the eradication of apartheid and dealingwith the issues of economic and social development andhuman rights. Such concepts have now become the veryfoundations of civilized international behaviour.Having said this  we must say that what the futurerequires is a new universal social contract as I called for inmy statement before the General Assembly at the forty-seventh session  in commenting on the Secretary-General’s“Agenda for Peace” submitted in 1992. A series ofinternational conferences on children  on the environment on human rights  on population  on social development andon women have provided the international community witha wealth of programmes of action and ideas which couldprovide solid basis for drawing up the universal socialcontract we propose in order for our work to lead todevelopment  security and peace.Whether the United Nations is able to forge suchconsensus  will depend on its ability to close the credibilitygap from which it has suffered over the past few years. Noamount of administrative reform or restructuring  howevergreat  would enable it to rise to the demands of this newera unless such reform is accompanied by the mobilizationof the political will to support the United Nations and touphold its credibility together with a process of conceptualreform that should be inspired by the ideals and objectivesof the Charter and should aim at formulating a modernprogramme of action that responds to the realities  issuesand challenges of today’s world.In order for the United Nations to lead internationalaction in such directions  it must enjoy financial stability.Such stability cannot be achieved without our collectivecommitment to pay in full our assessed contributions to theOrganization’s budget. Egypt hopes that the Member Statesshall seize the opportunity of the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of the Organization  truly ahistoric occasion  by issuing a declaration committing allMembers  and especially all the States permanent membersof the Security Council  to pay all assessed contributionsand all arrears before the end of the year  to underscore ourcollective and genuine support for the Organization.The General Assembly has achieved a great deal overthe past 50 years in the political  economic  social andenvironmental fields and has contributed to theestablishment of principles of international conduct in thespheres of democracy  respect for human rights and thecodification and development of the principles ofinternational law. However  the present era is a time forreformulating international relations  which requires theAssembly to perform a new role that promotes ourcollective capacity in the areas of security  developmentand international cooperation.The Secretary-General’s initiatives have alsocontributed to initiating a discussion of such hot issues aspreventive diplomacy  peace-building in post-conflictsituations  and coordination between the United Nationsand other international and regional bodies. Suchdiscussions have shown that there is a growing tendencyto attach increasing importance to such issues  particularlyon the part of the developing countries  a matter whichhighlights the need to promote the focal role of theGeneral Assembly in building international consensus onsuch important issues.The growing tendency to develop and reform theUnited Nations has focused attention on the SecurityCouncil’s role and its performance. It was only naturalthat the General Assembly should have focused ondiscussing the rules and procedures that the SecurityCouncil should follow  particularly in the areas that needto be reviewed in the light of the latest developments ininternational affairs.Any in-depth examination of the Council’s role inthe light of such developments would highlight the factthat many of the substantive and procedural aspects of theCouncil’s work need to be reviewed  either by theCouncil itself or by the General Assembly if the Councilshould fail to do so. Since the end of the cold war  theCouncil’s performance has tended to be characterized bycertain features of which stand out the ineffectiveness ofsome of its resolutions  which lend themselves to manydiverse interpretations and the tendency of some of thoseresolutions to aim at achieving political objectives whoseobjectivity is often debatable. All such aspects have anundoubted effect on the Council’s credibility and efficacy.The ongoing consultations in the Working Groups onhow to improve the methods and procedures relating tothe imposition and lifting of sanctions by the Councilhighlight the concern felt by the Member States over suchmatters. The point is that  in such cases  there should bea minimum level of safeguards  through the application ofa set of agreed  uniform rules and procedures  in order forthe imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in amanner that strikes a balance between  on the one hand the interests of the international community and  on theother  the extent of the human suffering endured bypeoples on whom the sanctions are imposed.6The increasing importance the international communityattaches to the question of reforming the Security Councilhas focused attention on a number of issues such as theneed to improve the Council’s practices and procedures improve its performance and underscore the need fortransparency in its work.Egypt is convinced that there exists consensus ofopinion that there is a need to increase the membership ofthe Council in order to expand international participation indischarging the major responsibility of the Organizationand  thereby  to promote the Council’s efficiency. We arealso aware of the heavy responsibilities that go withmembership in the Council. Proceeding from this and givenEgypt’s regional and international contributions in thecontexts of Arab  African and Middle Eastern affairs andother spheres  together with its constant support of UnitedNations activities  we believe that Egypt is well placed inthe ranks of the States qualified to bear the responsibility ofmembership in a new and expanded Security Council thatwould be more equitable and balanced in its representationof the different regions of the world.When we speak of expanding Security Councilmembership  we do not have in mind a mere increase in thenumber of permanent seats allocated to the developedcountries at the expense of the developing countries. Whatwe have in mind is striking the necessary balance betweenthe developed and the developing countries  by reinforcingthe Council with a number of developing countries that arecapable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capableof having the necessary impact at the regional and theinternational levels  in a manner that would make theCouncil more representative of international reality and thereby  much more effective in dealing with internationalissues.On the other hand  and from a more practical point ofview  we believe that the ideas put forward by Egypt andby other countries concerning the addition of a number ofnew  rotating seats for a specific number of States wouldafford a larger number of States the opportunity of sharingin exercising the responsibilities of membership in theCouncil. We believe that this would promote the Council’srole  enhance its credibility as a body that is trulyrepresentative and enrich it with the membership ofcountries that play important and effective roles in theirregions.I should like to seize this opportunity to put on recordthat Egypt welcomes the consultations the Security Councilconducts with the countries that contribute troops to peace-keeping operations  and call upon the Council to adhereto the spirit of the provisions of Article 44 of the Charterby institutionalizing such consultations so that they maybecome an integral part of the decision-making process inrelation to any peace-keeping operation. This wouldincrease the chances of success for all such operations.Here I must point out the vital role that could beperformed by regional organizations and arrangements  inaccordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter  inmaintaining international peace and security in generaland in the area of preventive diplomacy in particular. Inthis connection  I should like to mention that Egypt hasset up the “Cairo Centre for the Settlement of Disputesand the Maintenance of Peace in Africa”  and that we areconfident that this Centre will receive the necessaryassistance from the United Nations Department of Peace-keeping Operations and from States with the necessaryexpertise in this field.The founding of the United Nations wascontemporaneous with the beginning  50 years ago  of asad chapter in the evolution of the question of Palestinethat triggered the Arab-Israeli conflict  with all the warsand tragedies that conflict entailed. Now  half a centurylater  we witness the beginnings of a comprehensivesettlement to this question and the progress towards anArab-Israeli peace. The United Nations has left its imprinton all aspects of the question of Palestine and theArab-Israeli conflict. Some of its earlier resolutionssparked off the Arab-Israeli wars. Some others have laidthe foundations for a peaceful settlement  such as SecurityCouncil resolution 242 (1967)  and resolution 425 (1978)on Lebanon  the resolutions on Al-Quds  the refugees andthe Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.A few days ago  in Washington  we witnessed thesigning of the transitional-phase agreement by thePalestinian President  Yasser Arafat  and the Israeli PrimeMinister  Yitzhak Rabin. This is a historic achievementtowards resolving the Palestinian problem  as it initiatesthe second phase of the agreement concluded between thetwo parties and expands Palestinian authority to the WestBank. This is a sound move that brings Palestine closerto having a full-fledged Government with its legislative executive and judiciary branches within a preliminaryregional framework.Although the agreement is transitional andrepresents a delicate balance of commitments between theemerging entity and Israel  it is undoubtedly a majorpositive step at the strategic level. In practical terms 7paves the way for the partition of the land of Palestinebetween Israel and the Palestinian entity which would reachcompletion only through the establishment of thePalestinian State on all the territories of Gaza and the WestBank. It is important to note here that the Palestinianparliament  which will be elected within a few months  willrepresent also the Palestinian people in Al-Quds.Early on  Egypt had opted for the role of pioneer inthe long march towards peace in the Middle East. CampDavid and Taba  which were two outstanding milestones onthis long march  have now been joined by a host of otherlandmarks along the road to peace. However  we are fullyaware of the obstacles and pitfalls that are still in the wayof a comprehensive peace  both on the Syrian and theLebanese tracks  which must be reactivated urgently indeed and on the Palestinian track  where everything depends onthe honest and immediate implementation of the agreementand serious preparations for the Israeli-Palestiniannegotiations on the final status. Egypt looks forward to aday in the near future when its vision of a new Middle Eastwould materialize.From this very rostrum  at the forty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly  on behalf of Egypt  I called uponthe States and peoples of the Middle East to give thoughtto the shape of our relations in the post-settlement period.I invited them to join us in formulating the makings andfoundations of new relations between the countries of theregion that would rest squarely on three pillars: politicalsettlement  economic and social development and regionalsecurity and arms control.Our views in all this proceed from the conviction thatpeace will never become permanent and will never takeroot without a balanced and constructive interaction thatwould serve the common interests of all parties. I havetouched upon the recent developments in the area ofpolitical settlement. I should like to add here that theframework of this settlement is still fragile and that it needsa great deal of prudence and caution. What is needed aboveall else in this respect is that all parties should abstain fromtaking any unilateral action that might infringe the rights ofthe other parties or pre-empt the final outcome of thenegotiations.The Economic Summit meeting for the Middle Eastand North Africa  held in Casablanca in October 1994  wasan important step for regional economic cooperation. Theparticipants in that meeting may recall Egypt’s insistencethat genuine peace is peace that prevails amongst peoplesand that genuine peace is that which serves as a foundationfor economic cooperation. As we move closer to theAmman summit  scheduled to be held towards the end ofOctober 1995  we reiterate that belief and call for realprogress on the different tracks of the peace process inorder to provide the necessary conditions for promotingcooperation in the region.In this connection  Egypt believes that it is the issuesof arms control and regional security that will determinethe form and extent of cooperation amongst the countriesof the region in the future. Egypt views security  as theprincipal mainstay of the edifice of peace in the MiddleEast  and believes that it should rest squarely on the firmfoundation of equal rights and obligations for all partiesin the region with regard to disarmament  so that equalsecurity may be achieved at the minimum level ofarmament and guaranteed through the defining ofcommon rights and interests and not through theacquisition of weapons of mass destruction.Proceeding from this  we call for initiating concretesteps towards:- Israel’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subjectingits nuclear facilities to the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) international regime of safeguards andinspection.- Engaging in discussion aimed at establishing azone free of weapons of mass destruction in the MiddleEast.- Reviewing the relevant international agreements ondisarmament  by the countries of the region  with a viewto harmonizing their positions and commitments regardingthose agreements.I seize this opportunity to call upon the permanentMembers of the Security Council which sponsored theresolution relating to the Middle East in the Review andExtension Conference of the States Parties to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to takeconcrete steps that would ensure the accession to theTreaty by all States of the region and to initiate theestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in theMiddle East in accordance with the Egyptian initiativewhich has enjoyed the consensus of all the partiesconcerned for more than 15 years now.Speaking of the Middle East  I shall now address thesituation in the countries neighbouring Egypt. I shall8begin by extending a brotherly greeting to the brotherlypeople of Sudan and say that only what is right and truewill prove to be right and true in the end and that thingswill inescapably revert to normal in a Sudan that will befree from the politics of terrorism under the guise ofreligion. The historical ties of friendship that took root overthe ages between our two peoples will continue to flow asstrongly as the flow of the river Nile through our twocountries. Egypt  which does not change its position onsuch matters  clearly reaffirms its support for the unity andterritorial integrity of Sudan within its political borders.On the western borders of Egypt  we can state thatLibya now has the firm political will to put an end to theLockerbie crisis by accepting the trial of the accused andby working for practical solutions within the framework ofimplementing the relevant Security Council resolutions. Inthe interests of justice and fairness to the families of thevictims  any objective view of the problem wouldunderscore the importance of respecting internationallegality by accelerating the process of trying those accusedof perpetrating an international crime.On the other hand  the stability of the Middle Eastrequires the achievement of the security and stability of theGulf. In Iraq  the suffering of the Iraqi people continues asthat people lives under very cruel conditions. Even theterritorial integrity of Iraq is being threatened continuously a matter which we shall never accept or acquiesce in. Wedo look forward to the day in the near future when thesuffering of the Iraqi people will come to an end and Iraqwill resume exercising its rights and obligations as aresponsible member of the Arab family and theinternational community.Now that the Iraqi Government has recognized thesovereignty of Kuwait and its international borders inaccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions we hope that resolving the problem of the prisoners of warand the detainees  side by side with the fact that it hascomplied with the provisions of Security Councilresolutions on weapons of mass destruction will be the firstmajor step towards easing the sanctions imposed on Iraq asstipulated in resolution 687 (1991). We also hope that thiswill lead to practical steps by the Council towards theestablishment of a zone free of weapons of massdestruction in the Middle East in implementation ofparagraph 14 of the said resolution  the only paragraph ofthe resolution which has remained unimplemented.Across the gulf  we invite Iran  with which the Arabworld entertains well-known links and well-knowndifferences at the same time  to seek to settle the problemof the Arab islands in the Gulf  namely: Abu Musa andGreater and Lesser Tunb Islands and to respect thesovereignty of the United Arab Emirates. This will nodoubt serve the interests of stability in that part of theMiddle East and work in favour of normal Arab-Iranianrelations.Allow me to state candidly that we are finding itincreasingly difficult to promote moral support for theUnited Nations because of a general feeling of frustrationvis-à-vis what is going on in the world. Such frustrationwas inevitable in view of the destruction  killings and warcrimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the backdropof an unjustified dereliction of duty on the part of theinternational community vis-à-vis those atrocities. This very naturally  has led to a great deal of questioning aboutthe double standards which have come to be the maincharacteristic of the so-called new international order andhave deprived that order of credibility even before it tookconcrete shape.Allowing the United Nations-declared “safe areas”to fall has shaken the international order and raiseddoubts regarding the effectiveness of the peace-keepingsystem. The continuing deterioration of the situation inBosnia has led the Islamic countries to take a decision toreject the applicability of the arms embargo on Bosniasince it contradicts the right to legitimate self-defenceenshrined in the United Nations Charter  when necessary.However  we welcome the current internationalpeace efforts aimed at halting the bloody conflict inBosnia and Herzegovina  provided that such efforts andpolicies do not lead to Bosnia’s partitioning orfragmentation  and provided that the peace plans willprove to be honest in their formulations and objectives.We also welcome the parties’ success in reaching adeclaration of principles on a regional settlement andhope that the ongoing negotiations will lead to acomprehensive  just and viable solution which wouldrespect legality and help bring stability to the region.Proceeding from our constant support for the rightsof the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their justcause  we accept what their Government deemsacceptable  especially that  as the whole world has seen President Alija Izetbegovic has shown admirableflexibility and has responded positively to internationallegality throughout all the stages of the crisis. At thesame time  we underline the need for the negotiationprocess not to ignore the fundamental principles9established by the United Nations in dealing with thisproblem. In particular  we underscore here  the followingprinciples:First: Any attempt to treat the aggressor on the samefooting as the victim of aggression is unacceptable. Pressureshould not be brought to bear on the weaker party under thepretext of searching for applicable solutions.Second: The territorial map of Bosnia andHerzegovina should not be redrawn in a manner that wouldconsecrate the results of aggression  expansionism andethnic cleansing.Third: Recognizing an entity for the Bosnian Serbsinside the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina requires theinternational community to deal very carefully indeed withthe lack of political  military and institutional balancebetween the parties. It also requires international guaranteesto ensure the implementation of any eventual settlement.This highlights the importance of arming the government ofBosnia Herzegovina with the necessary defensive meansthat would enable it to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence in consonance with the Charter  so that thisMember State of the United Nations may not continue to beexposed to destruction or fragmentation should the Serbsrenege on the commitment to respect Bosnia’s territorialintegrity.Fourth: The measures of collective security measuresshould be applied  if necessary  to support the negotiationprocess until the plan for a regional settlement is put intoeffect.Fifth: War criminals must be punished for the crimesthey have perpetrated. Short of this  it will be farcical totalk of upholding human rights in any part of the world andexpect people to take such talk seriously.As we speak of the situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina  I must commend the efforts of the UnitedNations Protection Force and salute  in particular  the sonsof my country  the Egyptian officers and soldiers who arebravely carrying out their duties under very difficultconditions. I should like also  to stress in this connectionthe need for the United Nations Forces should continue tocarry out their mandate until the Bosnian Government armybecomes capable of shouldering its tasks in defence ofBosnia’s territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty.The fact that the Economic and Social Councilallocated the high-level segment of its last substantivesession to discussing the problems of development inAfrica is proof of the United Nations awareness of theserious challenges facing economic and socialdevelopment in the continent. It is essential to intensifyinternational efforts aimed at restructuring the economiesof African countries  diversifying their exports andstrengthening regional integration amongst the countriesof Africa  particularly since the Abuja agreement whichestablished the African Economic Community has enteredinto force.Egypt’s awareness of the seriousness and urgency ofthese challenges and of the need to face up to them led itto call for a special extraordinary ministerial session ofthe Organization of African Unity (OAU). The meetingtook place in March 1995 and adopted the Cairo Plan ofAction for economic and social development in Africa.Even a cursory look at the overall situation in Africawould reveal that the urgent need for a climate of peaceand stability  makes it necessary for the United Nations toincrease its contribution towards the creation of such aclimate  in coordination and cooperation with theOrganization of African Unity. This highlights theimportance of the efforts deployed by the Africancountries towards supporting and developing the OAU’smechanism for the prevention  management and resolutionof disputes in Africa. Such efforts require the financialand technical support from both the United Nations andthe international community.As I speak  tension persists in many parts of Africa.In particular  Rwanda and Burundi  Egypt’s sisterlypartners in great resource  the Nile  continue to be in thegrip of a situation that endangers the stability and securityof a large area of Africa. This calls for solutions thatwould allow everyone to live in a society based on justiceand equality. Egypt believes that the proposed regionalconference for the countries of the Great Lakes regionmust elaborate regional policies aimed at finding solutionsto the problems of the countries of the region from anoverall perspective that would take into account the plightof refugees  ethnic conflicts and other matters. Althoughthe primary responsibility for finding solutions to suchproblem rests with the countries of the region  whichmust manifest a spirit of tolerance and moderation if theyare to achieve national reconciliation and social peace  theUnited Nations is called upon to support all the effortsdeployed in that direction  in line with the Secretary-General’s oft-repeated pledge that the United Nationsshall pay attention on an equal footing to the problems ofall regions of the world.10In Somalia  Egypt hopes that all parties will adhere toAfrican values and listen to the voice of reason in order forthem to extricate the Somali people from its cruel plight.Such a review of the hotbeds of tension and crises inAfrica should not detract from the importance of thepositive developments that have taken place in Africa overthe past two years  particularly in Mozambique  Angola andmore recently in Liberia. These have been truly importantachievements which were made possible by good intentionsand through the effective role played by the United Nationsand the OAU. We do hope that all parties  especially inAngola and Liberia  will remain committed to theagreements to restore peace and normal life in these twosister countries.I turn now to the world economy. In this respect allow me to state that  although the responsibility forachieving development and improving economicperformance falls mainly on the shoulders of the Statesconcerned  we believe that the solidarity of the internationalcommunity — through the establishment of a propitiouseconomic environment and extending a helping hand — isa very important element in the area of development.The growing marginalization of the role of thedeveloping countries in an increasingly interdependentworld could adversely affect stability. We heartily welcomethe ideas which the Secretary-General set out in his Agendafor Development and hope that the General Assembly’sdeliberations on the Agenda will contribute to correcting thecurrent serious imbalances.There is a need  as a matter of priority that should beaddressed with courage and creativity  to reformulatepolicies and solutions to the problem of the external debt ofthe developing countries that would help create a climate ofequal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and makeuse of the latent potential of many parts of the world inpaving the way towards balanced and comprehensivedevelopment at the threshold of the twenty-first century.The liberalization of international trade is an essentialingredient of economic growth. However  this liberalizationrequires rationalization in the light of the present structuralimbalances and the huge and widening gap between thedeveloping and the developed countries. Moreover  theselective policies pursued by some developed countries inliberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionistpolicies which are put in place behind a façade ofenvironmental  human rights or other considerations contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing internationaltrade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchmentof the present imbalances.We welcome the World Trade Organization as itbegins its work. We hope that rectifying those imbalanceswill be one of its most important concerns in the future.We should also like to stress the need for the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development tocontinue to perform its role as the internationalnegotiating forum that is qualified to build consensus onissues relating to free trade and development and also asthe very valuable source of technical assistance andinformation on world trade for the developing countries.Changes on the international economic arena makeit necessary to embark on a broad review of the role  thecapabilities and the structures of international financinginstitutions with a view to enabling those institutions torespond to those changes and to the requirements ofcomprehensive and sustainable development in a mannerthat would reflect the spirit of democracy and reform.There is no doubt that the phenomenon of terrorismhas become cause for deep concern to many peoples whohave become fed up with criminal acts that aim atterrorizing whole societies and with the export ofterrorism by countries that  having allowed themselves tobecome safe havens for extremism and bases for assassinsand criminals  have hosted terrorists and provided themwith refuge  protection and assistance.In this connection  I should like to point out thatevents have shown that terrorism is not limited to anyspecific geographical area or to any culture or religion.Therefore  it is not wise for some to try to pretend thatIslam is synonymous with extremism. Also  it would beabsolutely unfair to ignore the fundamental differencebetween Islam  a religion of tolerance that upholds humanvalues  and the terrorism practised by certainfundamentalist  so-called religious groups that are deviantsfrom Islam. It is therefore incumbent upon us toimplement the Declaration on Measures to EliminateInternational Terrorism  which we adopted last year. Letus close the door in the face of those whose hands aresmeared with the blood of innocent victims and developa strict legal regime to prosecute terrorists and try themfor the heinous crimes they perpetrate to the detriment ofinternational stability and security.In conclusion  I should like to pay tribute to theoutstanding role and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  to enhance and revitalize the11United Nations so that it may cope with the realities of ourera and the expectations of our peoples for peace  security development  justice and equality. Egypt is proud to see oneof its prominent sons at the helm of the United Nations  atthis important juncture of its history and during this criticalera of the history of mankind.Now that we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations  we find ourselves still far fromachieving the noble goals and objectives enshrined in itsCharter. On the threshold of a new century and a newmillennium  we have to work together to support the UnitedNations and strengthen its capabilities. This is an absolutenecessity if we are to look to the future with confidenceand hope for a better life for everyone."
"48",2167,"ERI",50,1995,"Allow me first tocongratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election as thePresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.My Government is convinced that the wealth of hisexperience and abilities will prove vital at this crucialcrossroads as we search for new and innovativemechanisms and structures to enhance the effectiveness ofour Organization to meet the challenges of the comingcentury.Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Côte d’Ivoire  for the ability and commitmentthat he showed in presiding over the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly.We further wish to express our profoundappreciation of the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  and to commend him for his untiringefforts to ensure the effectiveness of our Organization.The multifaceted challenges that our globalcommunity will continue to face in the period ahead  andthe opportunities that exist — more than at any time inthe past — to promote equity and justice in a moreharmonious world will require a thorough review of16paradigms  methods and institutions that have functionedfor the past 50 years. Indeed  different realities from thosenow prevailing inspired the founding of the United Nationsin 1945 and shaped its operational mechanisms in thesubsequent decades. The situation now is very muchchanged  if not altogether new.The membership of the Organization itself hasundergone phenomenal change to increase almost fourfold.Moreover  while the threat of a major internationalconfrontation has receded with the end of the cold war  ahost of other problems  including an upsurge in inter-Stateconflicts  international terrorism  growing poverty andmarginalization of vast segments of humanity in thedeveloping countries as well as within affluent societies  arecoming to the fore. It is apparent that these problems andrealities will require novel theoretical and institutionalapproaches.It is in this context that my Government welcomes thedebates that have been provoked by the recommendationsof the independent working committee and other interestedparties on the future of the United Nations. Let me furtherunderline that  as one of the new Member countries of theUnited Nations  we are gratified to rejoin the worldcommunity of States and impart our views on its future especially as we have had the added advantage of gaugingits operations from without for most of the past 50 years.We share the view of many Member States on theimperative of restructuring the decision-making bodies ofthe United Nations — particularly the Security Council  ina manner that ensures adequate representation of its diversecomponents and interests. The process of restructuringshould not  moreover  consist of mere enlargement throughthe inclusion of a number of potential candidates aspermanent members through some selection criteria offinancial and economic clout  population size and othersimilar factors. As we all agree  the issue is more profoundand transcends a simple numbers game. We hold thatserious thought must be given to devising a suitablearrangement that guarantees the proper representation of ourglobal community in its rich diversity and that is amenableto periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changesin a dynamic world.In the same vein  we welcome the emerging consensusover rationalizing the development agencies and institutionsof the United Nations by eliminating overlapping functionsand mandates  and integrating these institutions into morepowerful and authoritative bodies. The numerous platformsunanimously adopted at the international Summits in Rio Cairo  Copenhagen and Beijing  aimed at environmentalpreservation  the reduction and elimination of poverty and the empowerment of women  cannot be realizedwithout the concerted efforts of these enhancedinstitutions. The new drive towards their increasedintegration is therefore both appropriate and timely.None of these ideals can come to fruition withoutthe essential prerequisite of peace. Representing a nationand people that have suffered the agonies of war andconflict for almost the entire lifetime of this Organization my Government cannot underrate the efforts and prioritiesthat the United Nations must accord to the prevention andresolution of conflicts. Past failures and inadequacies canonly reinforce the collective resolve of our globalcommunity to check forces of aggression anddestabilization and not to let down wronged parties.And yet we cannot hide our disappointment at theindecision and wavering we see over sending clear signalsto defuse potential time-bombs and conflicts that arebrewing. The age-old folly of arming belligerent andaggressor States in pursuit of narrow commercial andother mundane interests continues unabated. Thisanomalous left-over of the cold-war years must surely berectified  as it is the first step that we must take in ourquest for global peace and as we devise elaboratemechanisms for conflict prevention  management andresolution.If I have dwelt somewhat at length on what weaspire to see in the invigorated Organization in thedecades to come  this is due to my sincere belief that thetone we set here collectively will have far greaterinfluence in shaping the future of our planet than theisolated measures and endeavours we undertake in ourindividual countries.Allow me now  to briefly touch on issues of directimportance to my country and our subregion. After threedecades of agonizing war  my Government is today fullyengaged in healing the wounds of war  rehabilitating adevastated country and institutionalizing the rule of law.The constitution-drafting process  hinged on popularparticipation in all its phases  is progressing at asatisfactory pace and according to the schedule envisaged.We are also doing our utmost to contribute  togetherwith our sisterly partners  to the creation of a climateconducive to subregional cooperation and collectivesecurity on our part of the continent  which has seenmuch turmoil and commotion in the past. The precarious17situation in Somalia and the problems posed by thedestabilizing policies pursued by the National Islamic Front(NIF) regime in the Sudan only indicate the enormity of thetasks  which need persistent and concerted efforts by allregional and international actors concerned.The recent document signed in regard to theimplementation of the second phase of the peaceagreement between the Palestinian and Israeli parties canonly inspire confidence in all of us that this long-drawn-out conflict is heading towards a satisfactory resolution atlong last. We trust that these measures will contributetowards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in theMiddle East.In conclusion  I wish to restate our firm belief andhopes that our Organization will find the insight and innerstrength to reinvigorate itself to meet the challenges of thenext century. I can only reiterate my Government’s firmcommitment to play its small and modest part to advancethe ideals that bind us together."
"49",2213,"ESP",50,1995,"Ishould like at the outset to convey to you  Sir  my mostcordial and sincere congratulations on your election asPresident of the Assembly. Both Spain  Portugal’s sistercountry  and the European Union  on behalf of which Ihave the honour to address the Assembly today  areconfident that your work will meet with the greatestsuccess. I am firmly convinced that your experience as aneminent professor of international law and your thoroughknowledge of international relations will contributedecisively to the Assembly’s achieving its ambitious goals.I should like also to thank Minister Amara Essy ofCôte d’Ivoire for the excellent manner in which heconducted our deliberations during the previous session ofthe Assembly.Likewise  I wish to express my appreciation to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  togetherwith my congratulations on the work he has accomplishedthroughout his mandate.In order to speed up the work of the Assembly  Iintend to shorten my statement  the complete text ofwhich will be published in a separate document.I am addressing this Assembly on behalf of theEuropean Union  whose membership has increased to 15States since the beginning of this year  thereby reinforcingits capacity to fulfil its commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. TheEuropean Union  fully aware of the complex challengesfaced by the international community  wishes to reiterateits full support for our Organization as a universal forumfor realizing humankind’s aspirations to peace andsecurity and economic and social progress.Against this background  the European Council  atits meeting in Cannes on 26 and 27 June  paid tribute  ina solemn declaration  to the work of our Organization andto the half-century’s activities of the United Nations.In a few weeks the Heads of State and Governmentof the entire world will solemnly commemorate thefiftieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization.Although this occasion will give us an opportunity toassess the work accomplished by the Organization overthe course of its already long history  we must above allreflect on the best way of preparing the United Nations tomeet effectively the challenges facing us at the end of thiscentury. Let me recall  with regard to this moment in theexistence of the United Nations  a thought expressed byJean Monnet in respect of the European Community when the latter was taking its first steps:“This is only a stage towards the forms oforganization of the world of tomorrow.”Indeed  the disappearance of old rivalries has notmeant the end of conflicts. Today we are witnessing ethnicand nationalistic conflicts and humanitarian crises offrightening proportions; a worsening of economicinequalities; contempt for human rights; the systematicviolation of the rules of international humanitarian law;genocide; the risk of the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction; and the alarming deterioration of theenvironment. These are some of the most serious problemswe face today. They affect us all  and we must all make acommitment to solve them.Although  as usual  a number of issues of concern tothe European Union are dealt with in detail in thememorandum distributed as an integral part of thisstatement  I should like to highlight some questions that areespecially important to us: the situation in the formerYugoslavia  developments in Africa and the peace processin the Middle East.The European Union continues to attach priorityimportance to reaching a negotiated  just and lasting peacein the conflict that is ravaging the territory of the formerYugoslavia. In this regard  we express our full support forthe diplomatic process currently under way and oursatisfaction at its initial results at the meeting held inGeneva on 8 September last.We believe that the United Nations forces in theterritories of the former Yugoslavia have played  andcontinue to play  a fundamental role. Member States of theEuropean Union are among the main troop contributors tothese forces. I wish here to pay tribute to the UnitedNations forces and pay homage to the soldiers who havefallen in the cause of peace  many of them citizens of theEuropean Union.The European Union has contributed substantially toalleviating the tremendous suffering that the war in theformer Yugoslavia  and particularly in Bosnia andHerzegovina  has inflicted upon the population. I wish toexpress our firm commitment to continue providinghumanitarian assistance  both bilaterally and through therelevant United Nations organs and agencies.After more than three years of bloody conflict  thelatest developments in the peace process allow us to lookahead with more hope. In this process  which we hope isnear at hand  the European Union intends to play a rolecommensurate to its commitments in all aspects of theimplementation of the peace process  and in particularwith regard to reconstruction efforts. Violence hasdestroyed property  but above all it has taken human livesand destroyed peaceful coexistence. Our main task willthus be to restore hope and offer decent living conditionsto those who are still suffering the consequences of thiscatastrophe.The European Union is aware of the great challengesfacing Africa. Proof of our concern is that we areworking to find peaceful solutions to the conflict inRwanda and to the conflict in Burundi  beginning with thepriority problem of the return of refugees. We support theurgent convening of a conference  under United Nationsauspices  aimed at peace and stability in the Great Lakesregion.Likewise  we support the initiatives for social andpolitical reconstruction in countries such as Angola andMozambique  and we welcome the work accomplished byour Organization in Angola  which  following the Lusakapeace agreement  has allowed for the establishment of thethird United Nations Angola Verification MissionUNAVEM III.We also favour a more active role for theOrganization of African Unity in the prevention andsolution of conflicts in Africa  and we are consideringways of supporting the establishment of effectivemechanisms for preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping.The European Union is also following the spread ofand respect for human rights throughout the continent and we are very much aware of the dire need of someAfrican countries. Since the revision of the Fourth LoméConvention  the European Union has attached particularrelevance to humanitarian and food assistance  and wehave made an effort to update our various developmentcooperation programmes.The European Union has always strongly supportedthe peace process in the Middle East  initiated at the 1991Conference held in Madrid. We warmly welcome theInterim Agreement reached recently by Israel and thePalestinian National Authority  which represents a newand important milestone in this process  and we lookforward to the signing of the Agreement this comingThursday. Likewise  we are confident that in the comingmonths we will see significant progress in the Syrian andLebanese negotiating tracks  and that the whole region which has already suffered enormously  will finally enter2into the dynamics of a comprehensive  just  stable and long-lasting peace.The European Union attaches paramount importanceto the work carried out by our Organization in general  andin particular by the Assembly  in favour of peace in theMiddle East. That is why one of our objectives in thesession now beginning is to ensure that the variousresolutions adopted by the Assembly on the situation in theMiddle East contribute directly to the peace process following the guidelines established in previous years.I do not wish to conclude this first part of mystatement without a reference to the work of the UnitedNations in Latin America. Its presence in Nicaraguathrough the United Nations Observer Group in CentralAmerica (ONUCA)  the United Nations Observer Missionfor the Verification of Electoral Process in Nicaragua(ONUVEN) and the International Commission for Supportand Verification allowed for national reconciliation and theholding of elections.The mediation between the parties and the work of theUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador(ONUSAL) led to the historic achievement of ending thelong and terrible civil conflict in El Salvador  whichculminated in the Chapultepec Agreements of January 1992.Today the presence of the Mission  which has the supportof the European Union  contributes effectively toovercoming the obstacles that still persist.In Haiti  the multinational force and the UnitedNations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) played a fundamentalrole in the restoration of democracy and in thereconstruction of the country.In Guatemala  the United Nations role as moderatorand the work of the United Nations Mission for theVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with theCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on HumanRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) have brought aboutsubstantive agreements on such important issues as humanrights  displaced persons and indigenous populations  whichwe are confident will lead to a speedy solution to theconflict. The participation of international observers in thecoming elections in November  supported by the EuropeanUnion  seems to us an effective formula. All theseachievements have been realized with the invaluable helpof the various Groups of Friends and the support of theinternational community.Conscious of the universality of the challenges thatlie ahead for the Organization  the European Unionattaches fundamental importance to the adoption ofmeasures allowing for the success and proper functioningof the United Nations in implementing the mandatesentrusted to it by the Member States.In this respect  the Organization’s serious financialcrisis  unprecedented in its history  seriously endangersthe United Nations capacity for action and is a source ofgreat concern for the European Union. Our Organizationwill become powerless if it does not receive the necessarypolitical support from its Member States and the resourcesprovided by them  particularly through the full  punctualand unconditional payment of their financial contributions in accordance with the obligations established by theCharter.Therefore  resolving the Organization’s financialcrisis is a priority objective for the European Union which overall is the main contributor  both to the regularbudget and to the peace-keeping operations budgets.This constructive attitude is what led to theparticipation of the European Union in the work of theHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the FinancialSituation of the United Nations. Our objective is to reacha consensus as soon as possible — preferably during thissession — on the adoption of specific measures to bringabout an improvement in the Organization’s financialsituation.The European Union wishes to underline theincreasingly urgent need to adopt a global package ofmeasures to solve the United Nations grave financialsituation. These measures should contemplate  inter alia a possible review of the scale of assessments so that itwould reflect as accurately as possible the principle of thecapacity to pay  as well as the establishment of incentivesand disincentives to encourage all Member States tocomply with their financial obligations.The Agenda for Development (A/48/935)  submittedlast year by the Secretary-General  identified the fivedimensions of development: peace as the foundation  theeconomy as the engine of progress  the environment as abasis for sustainability  justice as a pillar of society anddemocracy as good governance.The European Union attaches the greatest importanceto the completion  before the end of the session that isnow beginning  of a substantial and innovative agenda for3development  in which it is made clear that peace cannot bebuilt without at the same time promoting the social andeconomic progress of the poorest people. Through thedecisions taken by the European Council held in Cannes  towhich I have already referred  the European Union hasmade clear its determination to contribute yet greaterfinancial resources for development aid  within theframework of both the Lomé Convention — in the case ofthe African  Caribbean and Pacific countries — and throughfinancial cooperation with our Mediterranean partners andfriends.Throughout this session of the Assembly we shall payspecial attention to the results of the important cycle ofmajor conferences held over recent years under the aegis ofthe United Nations for discussion of various subjects linkedto development and human progress.We need the Economic and Social Council to play amore vigorous and more central role within the system; wemust ensure that the work of the Assembly and of theCouncil are complementary  avoiding all duplication.During this session the results of the World Summitfor Social Development  held in Copenhagen  will besubmitted to the Assembly. The European Union firmlyintends actively to consider these results  with a view toidentifying appropriate measures to ensure the follow-upand implementation of the commitments undertaken atCopenhagen. We must not allow the platforms of actionadopted at United Nations conferences to remainunimplemented.The Fourth World Conference on Women ended inBeijing only a few days ago. The Declaration and Platformfor Action adopted at the Conference are a step forward backed by the results of previous United Nationsconferences  on the road towards the achievement ofequality  development and peace. These objectives were setout in the strategies for the advancement of women adoptedin Nairobi 10 years ago.The European Union has worked actively to achieveconsolidation of the results of the Vienna Conference onHuman Rights  in the field of human rights andfundamental liberties of women  and of the CairoConference on Population and Development. The Platformfor Action adopted in Beijing as a result of such concernincludes important progress in human rights  notably theright of women to control and decide freely and responsiblyon matters related to their sexuality  including sexual andreproductive health  without coercion  discrimination orviolence.Only three years before the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  theinternational community cannot yet be entirely satisfiedwith the progress achieved. This session will provide usonce again with an opportunity to take stock of thesituation regarding human rights and fundamentalfreedoms in the world  two years after the importantheadway made at the Vienna World Conference.It is increasingly evident that respect for humanrights and fundamental freedoms plays a critical role inavoiding potential conflicts. We must thereforeacknowledge the value of human rights in preventivediplomacy. Some of the serious conflicts which haverecently darkened the international scene are inflictinggreat suffering on the civilian population  as illustrated bythe alarming number of displaced persons and refugees.In this regard  the European Union wishes to reiterate itssupport for the immense task being performed by theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) in this field. At the same time  weare conscious of the harmful effects of ethnic andreligious discrimination on the emergence anddevelopment of such conflicts  and we reaffirm ourconviction with regard to the need to move further in theadoption of measures to fight racism  racial discriminationand xenophobia.The level of resources assigned by the Organizationto the promotion and protection of human rights — todaya mere 1.7 per cent of its regular budget — continues tobe totally inadequate. A significant increase in thoseresources would have a positive impact on related areas especially on activities designed to assist development. Itis increasingly clear that development  human rights anddemocracy are interlinked  as was stated in the 1986Declaration on the Right to Development.Furthermore  the European Union attaches greatimportance to the role and activities of the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and wishes onceagain to draw the Assembly’s attention to the pressingneed to provide that Office with the human and financialresources required for the proper accomplishment of itstasks. We likewise support the Organization’s efforts toenhance the role and functions of the Centre for HumanRights in Geneva  under the supervision of the HighCommissioner.4The International Tribunal for the Prosecution ofPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of InternationalHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of theFormer Yugoslavia and the International Tribunal forRwanda are essential factors in the struggle against theimpunity of those who violate human rights. The experienceof these ad hoc tribunals will undoubtedly help the work ofa future international criminal court  for which a draftstatute was drawn up by the International Law Commissionand submitted to the Assembly’s Sixth Committee at its lastsession.Mankind is facing a growing number of humanitarianemergencies that require an effective response from theinternational community in order to alleviate the tragedybeing suffered daily by tens of thousands of human beings.The establishment of the Department of HumanitarianAffairs has been an outstanding contribution to theinternational efforts for humanitarian assistance  a field inwhich the often hazardous work of non-governmentalorganizations is also of paramount importance. We deem itessential to implement the decision taken this year by theEconomic and Social Council on the need to review andreinforce the capacity of the United Nations system in thearea of humanitarian assistance.There is a need to enhance cooperation between allorganizations and people  in such a way that theirrespective contributions may be mutually complementedand strengthened  duplication of work avoided  and ahumanitarian continuum ensured.We have witnessed important events this year in thefield of the environment and in the implementation of theRio agreements of 1992. Special mention should be madeof the positive outcome of the Conferences of the parties tothe Convention on Biological Diversity and the frameworkConvention on Climate Change  the opening for signatureof the Convention to Combat Desertification  and theestablishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forestsunder the aegis of the Commission for SustainableDevelopment. We welcome those developments andreiterate our determination to continue working  within theOrganization  towards greater cooperation in the field of theenvironment.The United Nations Charter confers upon theOrganization the principal task of maintaining internationalpeace and security and entrusts that major responsibility tothe Security Council.The Security Council must continue to be the decision-making centre for issues that affect world security andmust constantly adapt to currently existing situations inorder to strengthen the mechanisms set forth in theCharter itself.The Open-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council continued its workduring previous sessions of the Assembly. The membersof the European Union participated actively in that work and will continue to do so in the future.The European Union holds the view that peace-keeping operations and missions of preventive diplomacyare and should continue to be the focal point of theSecurity Council’s action in favour of world peace andsecurity. We welcome the updating of the Agenda forPeace submitted by the Secretary-General at the beginningof this year.I would remind the Assembly of the EuropeanUnion’s commitment to United Nations peace-keepingoperations  illustrated by the fact that the Union as awhole is not only the main financial contributor to theseoperations  providing 37 per cent of the total budget  butalso the main provider of personnel. The European Unionstands firmly behind this substantial commitment to theOrganization’s peace-keeping endeavours. We have allsuffered heavy casualties in these operations  and it is ofthe utmost importance that every possible step be taken toensure the safety of United Nations personnel in peace-keeping missions.Cooperation between the United Nations andregional organizations in peace-keeping endeavoursshould continue to be explored to optimize the use ofmaterial and human resources and to put the mandatesentrusted to those missions into practice in the quickest most efficient and successful way.As an example of theactivity of the regional organizations in this field  let memention that on our continent the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe has alreadydeveloped a mechanism  still at an embryonic stage  forpreventive diplomacy  the establishment of confidence-building measures and the resolution of conflicts. Actingon an initiative of the European Union  the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) decided atthe Budapest Summit last year to reinforce cooperationwith the United Nations and with the trans-Atlanticorganizations.5Furthermore  the European Union is studying withinterest the proposal for stand-by arrangements. To thatend  the Union supports the proposals for headquarters ofa permanent nature  as well as for the United Nations stand-by forces system  and we are studying with interest otherproposals which aim at improving the rapid reactioncapability of the United Nations with a view to shorteningthe period for establishing a peace operation and facilitatingits subsequent deployment.The European Union welcomes the great step forwardrecently taken within our Organization by the decision toextend the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) indefinitely. Thisis fundamental progress in the entire disarmament processand the pursuit of nuclear non-proliferation. The decisionadopted and the strengthening of the inspection procedureand the principles and objectives of disarmament andnuclear non-proliferation constitute an enormous step in theright direction. We also welcome the steady pace of thenegotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty  which theEuropean Union hopes and is confident will be concludedin 1996 at the latest.We must now focus our efforts on the universalizationof the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The European Unioninvites all States that have not yet done so to becomesignatories of the NPT. Another European Union priority inthe field of nuclear disarmament is the finalization of atreaty banning the production of fissile material for themanufacture of nuclear weapons and explosives. TheEuropean Union regrets that the Conference onDisarmament has not yet been able to set up an ad hoccommittee to begin negotiations on this issue.Once again  we appeal to all States that signed theConvention of the Banning of the Development  Production Storage and Use of Chemical Weapons and theirDestruction to proceed to ratify it so that it may come intoforce as soon as possible.Furthermore  the control and limitation of the use ofcertain conventional weapons is also cause for concern forthe European Union. Through its common action  the Unionaims to continue to encourage the activities of the UnitedNations in its fight against the devastating effects of anti-personnel mines in many territories around the world. Alsoin the field of conventional disarmament  we will payspecial attention to the results of the Review Conference ofthe 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on theUse of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May BeDeemed to Be Excessively Injurious or To HaveIndiscriminate Effects  in order to render it more effectiveand to widen its scope.We believe in the United Nations. We believe in theuniversality  binding character and supremacy ofinternational law  which is the result of the developmentof relations among nations and consensus among peoples.The European Union gives its unconditional support tothe Organization’s ideals and actions.We are sure that these first 50 years are but the firststage in an unprecedented task that presents no otheralternative  given that its chief goal — that of assuringthat we all live together in peace  as well as thecomprehensive development of human beings — can beattained only through disinterested cooperation amongpeoples."
"50",2239,"EST",50,1995,"Allow me to begin bycongratulating the President on his election at this historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of theEstonian people  I wish him all the best this year.Fifty years ago this body met for the first time in aneffort to unite the community of nations to avoid arepetition of the carnage we saw in the Second World War.For my country  that war finally ended just last year  withthe withdrawal of foreign troops from our territory. I amhappy to note that tomorrow the final remnant ofoccupation  in the form of the former Sovietnuclear-submarine training facility at Paldiski  will beturned over to Estonian authorities by Russian civiliandismantling specialists. I take this opportunity toacknowledge Estonia’s satisfaction with the RussianFederation’s having fulfilled its commitment in thisregard  as mandated by the agreement signed by Russiaand Estonia on 30 July 1994.Turning to the work of the United Nations  thedeclarations and decisions produced by recentinternational conferences must be integrated into the workof the United Nations as a whole. Estonia placesparticular importance upon the implementation of Agenda21 and the Vienna Declaration. We welcome theextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and look forward to a successfulconclusion of negotiations regarding a universal andverifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty. The importanceof these and other recently concluded internationalagreements must be underscored through implementation.There are a number of ways through which theUnited Nations can improve its performance. One of themost extensive ways in which Member States relate to theUnited Nations system is by way of the activities ofvarious United Nations agencies and programmes. Forthis reason  reform of the Economic and Social Councilis crucial and should be addressed in earnest. MemberStates should have greater opportunities to ensure thatUnited Nations resources are used in an effective andefficient manner. I am referring not to a need for themicromanagement of agencies  programmes and projects but  rather  to participation in agency  programme andproject activities.I would like to single out and commend the work ofthe Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and otherregional commissions. The ECE has worked diligently toprovide practical and needed support for the integration ofcountries with diverse histories into a cohesive regionalwhole. As part of continuing United Nations reform Estonia once again urges greater cooperation between theECE and the United Nations Development Programme.Any discussion of United Nations reform mustinclude the composition and functioning of the SecurityCouncil. Estonia welcomes the report of the Open-endedWorking Group on Security Council reform  which among other practical suggestions  calls for developing31greater transparency and the inclusion of more MemberStates in decision making. Within the context of continuingdebate over Security Council reform  we reiterate oursupport for an expanded and more effective SecurityCouncil.In the 40 years from 1948 to 1988  the United Nationsdeployed 13 peace-keeping operations. In the seven yearsfrom 1988 to the present  16 operations were begun  ofwhich a significant number still continue. There are manysystemic reasons for such a dramatic increase in peace-keeping operations  and the issues of both peace-keepingand peacemaking call for further detailed examination.Regional peace-keeping efforts that are conducted under theauspices of the United Nations must remain under stringentUnited Nations control.The Security Council  in turn  must carefully defineand monitor any mandates granted to regional efforts andmust resist attempts by groups of States or individualcountries to wrest authority for such actions. Only in thisway can the United Nations ensure compliance with theprinciples of multilateralism and impartiality in order toconduct peace-keeping operations that are not onlyeffective  but also politically neutral.Estonia is proud to be taking part in peace-keepingefforts. Through generous support  especially that of theDanish Government  Estonian peace-keepers  for the firsttime ever  took part in United Nations peace-keepingoperations. Having participated in the United NationsProtection Force (UNPROFOR)  and now the UnitedNations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia(UNCRO)  we look forward to expanding our role inUnited Nations peace-keeping activities.I am gratified to support the working arrangementbetween the United Nations and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) in the former Yugoslavia. Estoniaregards the United Nations-mandated NATO air strikes inrecent weeks in Bosnia as an unfortunate but necessarymeans of bringing about an end to the fighting which is stilltaking place there. Recent cooperation between the UnitedNations and NATO shows that despite the inherentdifficulties in supporting peace in the former Yugoslavia differences can be overcome and a joint approach to peace-keeping can be agreed upon. We view this cooperation asa harbinger of greater effectiveness in future United Nationspeace-keeping efforts.An area to which Estonia attaches particularimportance is the work of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights  Mr. José Ayala Lasso  and the Centre forHuman Rights in Geneva. In keeping with its open-doorpolicy towards the work of human rights groups  Estoniawelcomes and supports the work done by the HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights. We believe that information about thework of the Commissioner and the Centre should be madeavailable to a wider audience through more frequentpublication of the results of investigations. This wouldhelp ensure that the efforts of partisan political concernsthat tend to rely on inaccurate information will becountered by factual  impartial reporting of the sort thatMr. Ayala Lasso and the Centre provide.During this United Nations fiftieth anniversary year it is important for every Member State to affirm itsfinancial commitment to the United Nations. Estonia  forits part  supports recent changes to the methodology usedto calculate assessments  changes which have led toreduced distortions and affirmation of capacity to pay asthe primary  transparent and universally applied criteriaby which assessments are calculated. Agreed upon regularbudget assessments and peacekeeping dues are collectiveresponsibilities for the functioning of the United Nations and should be put ahead of individual partisan interests.We face new challenges on this  the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. I wish all of us thebest in meeting those challenges  so that the next 50 yearsmay be even more constructive than the last."
"51",2285,"ETH",50,1995,"I would like first of all toextend sincere congratulations to the President on hisunanimous election at this historic fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. While expressing my delegation’s fullconfidence that he will steer our deliberations to asuccessful conclusion  I wish also to seize this opportunityto assure him of my delegation’s full support andcooperation in the discharge of this heavy responsibilityentrusted to him.It gives me great pleasure to commend my colleague your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  ForeignMinister of Côte d’Ivoire  for the very able and outstandingmanner in which he presided over the General Assembly atits forty-ninth session.Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for all theefforts he has been making to ensure that the UnitedNations is as effective and as efficient as possible.As we enter the second half of the last decade of thetwentieth century  there are two interrelated and vital issueswhich will continue to pose major challenges to theinternational community: peace and development. There canbe no doubt that the degree to which the United Nations iseffective in promoting peace and in ensuring developmentfor all is the most appropriate yardstick for judging howeffective and vital the United Nations has been and will bein fulfilling the purposes for which it came into being. Wepay tribute to the Secretary-General for having accordedthese two major concerns of the international communitythe importance they so rightly deserve in his Agenda forPeace and Agenda for Development.The few years that have elapsed since the end of thecold war confrontation have made us all realize that peaceand security can hardly be ensured through mere concordbetween and among the major Powers. The removal ofthe threat hanging over humanity that was the undesirablesymbol of the cold war is  and will remain  a majorachievement that can never be minimized. All thosedevoted to peace must and should  within the UnitedNations and other forums  continue to contribute their dueshare towards ensuring that humanity is absolutely securefrom the potential dangers posed by nuclear weapons  anoble task towards the achievement of which a genuinelycomprehensive test-ban treaty constitutes a major stepforward and a top priority. It is the earnest hope ofEthiopia and of Africa that this goal would be attained assoon as possible.However  as much as we derive satisfaction from theremoval of threats to peace and security associated withthe period of the cold war  what the past few years havemade abundantly clear is that the challenges we face inensuring peace and security are no less daunting  and noless of serious concern today  than they were in the coldwar period.The types of conflicts that have been manifestingthemselves in recent years  not only in Africa  but also inother parts of the world  have been more of an intra-Statethan an inter-State nature. The Secretary-General of ourOrganization has justifiably argued in a convincingmanner in his “Supplement to An Agenda for Peace'”(A/50/60) how difficult it has become for the UnitedNations  under these circumstances  to fulfil effectively itspeace-keeping obligations. No doubt  no matter howdifficult the task  the United Nations should and mustcontinue to assume major responsibility for internationalpeace and security in all parts of the world  includingAfrica.We  member States of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  have  in the course of the past few years been in the process of augmenting OAU’s capacity toplay a meaningful role in the area of the prevention management and resolution of conflicts on our continent.This effort will continue. But it is vital that theinternational community lend its support to this Africaninitiative as some have already done. Above all  it isimperative that a more effective cooperation be createdbetween the United Nations and the Organization of29African Unity in this area  and we are looking forward tothe consultation at the highest level between the two  whichis scheduled to take place soon. In this regard  on its partas the current Chairman of the Organization of AfricanUnity  Ethiopia is fully committed to the promotion of fullcooperation between the two organizations.It is the view of my delegation  however  that nomatter how effective the United Nations becomes inmobilizing resources for peace-keeping  no matter howrefined the techniques utilized are  the achievement ofpeace would remain as remote as ever as long as theunderlying causes of conflict  in Africa or elsewhere  arenot removed or mitigated. The search for peace  it is said is in our minds; but it also has to do with conditions underwhich people live.In Africa  certainly  and this could be true in otherparts of the world as well  the major sources of conflictsare in one way or another intertwined with economichardship and social problems confronted by the majority ofour peoples. It is impossible to assume that the difficultywe have had in freeing the African continent from thescourges of war is unrelated to the despair and the loss ofconfidence in the future on the part of the majority of ourpeoples - despair and lack of confidence in the future  theexplanation for which lies in the ever-deterioratingeconomic situation faced by the overwhelming majority ofour countries.It was largely as a result of the precipitous decline ofthe economies of African States in the 1980s - rightlycharacterized as a lost decade for Africa - that the GeneralAssembly adopted in December 1991 the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s asa framework of partnership between Africa and theinternational community. It is now obvious that thecommitments made by Africa’s development partners haveso far remained unfulfilled. However  the majority ofAfrican countries have made substantial progress towardsmeeting their commitments in political areas and incarrying out the functioning of their economies moreefficiently.In an era when the interdependence of nations is alltoo apparent and at a time when we all acknowledge thatpeace and security have become indivisible  the lack ofsufficient commitment to the removal of obstacles to thedevelopment of Africa and other areas experiencing asimilar situation  should be seen as a source of seriousconcern  with its immense implications for regional andinternational peace and security. To the extent that  in areasof the world such as Africa  peace can never be made tobe durable without development  the best approach to andthe most effective method for the prevention of conflictsis one that focuses on preventive measures in economicand social fields.As a minimum measure  developing countries particularly African States  which dominate the list ofleast developed countries  need to be freed from thevarious impediments retarding and stunting theireconomic growth and development. One such very criticalproblem faced by African economies is the debt burdenand the debt-servicing obligations  which continue tofrustrate the ability of African countries to pullthemselves out of the economic crisis that they have beenfacing for well over two decades. No part of the worldhas been as much affected by the debt burden as Africa.We do acknowledge some steps that have been taken  andthe promises made with respect to bilateral debt  includingat the Group of Seven Summit in Halifax. But themagnitude of the problem faced by African countries issuch that nothing less than the most determined effort political will and commitment by creditor nations to assistAfrica overcome this major constraint would suffice forAfrica to relaunch and revitalize itself for economicgrowth and development.On the eve of the twenty-first century  one-fifth ofthe world’s population is struggling amidst abject poverty.All the circumstances indicate that unless the problem ofmassive poverty is solved  it will be difficult for peopleto actively participate in development in any meaningfulway under conditions of freedom and democracy. Thus it is absolutely necessary to assist poverty-eradicationmeasures in African countries in an integral andmultidimensional manner. In this regard we emphasize theurgency of implementing the Programme of Action of theWorld Summit for Social Development  which aims at theeradication of poverty. We also appreciate the concernvoiced on the preponderance of poverty at the recentGroup of Seven Summit in Halifax  Canada.It is also imperative that Africa’s partners ineconomic cooperation take the necessary steps to ensurethat full access to their markets is ensured to Africa’sexports. We still have to contend with the paradox thatwhile liberalization is promoted as a condition forpartnership with Africa  the same nations that lay down30such prescriptions are often seen to be failing to live up tothose standards.The newly created situation in world trade followingthe establishment of the World Trade Organization hasmade the difficulty faced by Africa and other developingcountries in this area all the more complex and daunting and if flexibility in the application of agreements is notintroduced  in favour of African countries  the consequencescould be very serious.It is the conviction of the Ethiopian delegation that  inthe final analysis  each of our countries  including those ofAfrica  should assume full responsibility for the economicand political future of its peoples. The call on theinternational community to do the maximum possible forAfrica in the economic area is an appeal to help remove theobstacles hindering the development of the continent so thatAfrica can regenerate itself through the efforts of its ownpeoples.This is most particularly true with respect to foodsecurity  without which Africa  including my own country can never regain its self-respect and dignity and be takenseriously as an effective actor on the international scene. Iwish  in this regard  to commend the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) for its proposalto convene a world food summit in 1996  a move whichhas been fully endorsed by African Heads of State andGovernment.It is true that we in Africa also need to put our ownhouse in order. We cannot afford to look for externalexcuses for maladies that are sometimes of our owncreation. In this respect  Africa’s economic ills are nottotally unrelated to the mismanagement of its economies byits own leaders. Nor can it be denied that some of theconflicts in our continent have been caused byill-governance and by the denial of democratic rights to thepeoples of the continent. The path that my own country Ethiopia  has traversed during the past two decades is veryinstructive in this regard.It was little more than four years ago that theEthiopian peoples managed to get rid of a militarydictatorship that had for 17 years brutalized the society brought its social fabric to the breaking point  almostdestroyed the country’s economy through mismanagementand the imposition of stifling State control  and militarizedthe society. For our new Government  which wasestablished soon after the overthrow of the militarydictatorship  the responsibilities of restoring peace andsecurity to the country  introducing democracy and respectfor human rights  and rehabilitating and reforming theeconomy were daunting tasks that needed to be tackledsimultaneously and immediately. But we feel that we havepassed the test  and our success in putting in place in ourcountry the first-ever democratically elected Governmentin the long history of Ethiopia is a source of greatsatisfaction to our peoples.Our vision for Ethiopia is one in which all itspeoples would be proud of belonging to it. This is anEthiopia inspired by grass roots democracy and a genuinedevolution of power within a federal system as stipulatedin the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic ofEthiopia - a country which would be one of the pillars ofpeace and cooperation in its own subregion and in theAfrican continent as a whole. My country attaches greatimportance to full cooperation with countries of itssubregion with a view to promoting peace and laying thefoundation for joint efforts aimed at the economic revivalof our area.No part of our continent has suffered as much as theHorn of Africa in the past two decades  as a result ofcivil wars and instability. Some of the conflicts in oursubregion still remain unresolved. There are many reasonswhy the countries and the peoples of our subregionshould and must be preoccupied with the need to establishdurable peace. But this is by no means an easy task particularly when some find it difficult to live within thebounds of international legality  to respect the principlesof international law governing inter-State relations and toobserve the norms of civilized international behaviour.But no matter how challenging the task  Ethiopia willcontinue to be committed to promoting peace  stabilityand cooperation throughout Africa in general and in itssubregion in particular.This is a very historic session of the GeneralAssembly. We are preparing to celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the establishment of our Organization. Asa founding Member of the United Nations  Ethiopia takespride in its achievements. We also long for increasedcontributions to the promotion of the sacred principlesenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  whoseimplementation is so vital for ensuring peace  security anddevelopment for all.If the global community could not effectivelyrespond to the call for poverty alleviation  economic andsocial development  the achievement of peace and31stability  nothing less would be at stake than the survival ofour Organization itself.This unique opportunity should be seized to chart anew path for the Organization - a new beginning whosefeatures should be a more democratic and a morerepresentative United Nations. The various organs of theUnited Nations  including the Security Council  shouldconduct their business with absolute transparency andaccountability. It is my delegation’s earnest hope  therefore that at this session important steps will be taken to makethe United Nations more credible  more legitimate and moreeffective.I wish to close my statement by reiterating andreaffirming my country’s commitment to the UnitedNations and its devotion to efforts designed to protect andto revitalize the Organization."
"52",2331,"FIN",50,1995,"Let me begin bycongratulating Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on hiselection to the presidency of this fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. I am confident that under his wiseleadership we shall come to a successful conclusion of thishistoric session.My Spanish colleague  Minister Javier Solana  hasalready spoken on behalf of the European Union. I fullyassociate Finland with his statement.Fifty years ago the founders of the United Nationsestablished the maintenance of international peace andsecurity as the primary purpose of their new Organization.They also undertook to take effective collective measuresto that end. Fifty years later the condition of the world isdramatically different  but the United Nations is asindispensable now as it was then. Its role under Chapter VIIof the Charter continues to be a vital bulwark of worldsecurity  but its mission of peace now ranges much wider:the United Nations focuses on prevention of conflicts  itsustains development  it seeks to ensure the human rightsand dignity of every individual.The world needs a strong United Nations. Certainlythe small  the weak and the underprivileged among us needthe United Nations the most. But the United Nations  inturn  needs the full support of all its Member States.It is intolerable that while all of us here will onceagain reaffirm our faith in the United Nations  theOrganization is once more experiencing extreme financialdifficulties. In this context I should like to draw theattention of the Assembly to a statement adoptedyesterday by the Foreign Ministers of the Nordiccountries — Denmark  Iceland  Norway  Sweden andFinland — on the financial situation of the UnitedNations. The text of this statement will be made availablelater.We all agree that the United Nations needs tostreamline its work  set clear priorities and cut outactivities that have become obsolete. Yet the main reasonfor the difficulties is that the majority of the MemberStates  permanent members of the Security Councilamong them  do not pay their assessed contributions ontime  in full or without conditions.As a consequence  those who pay on time  in fulland without conditions — such as Finland — are in factpenalized for their behaviour. It is high time for allMember States to acknowledge that to pay one’s dues isnot an option  but an obligation  and that this obligationmust be fulfilled  and fulfilled punctually. When paymentsare not made on time  it is normal to charge interest. Thisshould be done also in the United Nations.It is also clear that the present scale of assessmentsneeds to be revised rapidly to take into account the realcapacity to pay of each Member State. Finland isprepared to support adjustments in cases where the painsof transition  natural disasters or other circumstances trulybeyond the control of the Government concerned justifysuch exceptional treatment. On the other hand  upwardadjustments should be the rule when economicdevelopment justifies them.A strong United Nations needs an effective SecurityCouncil  capable of acting on behalf of the entiremembership. Finland is pleased that the Security Councilhas assumed its role under the Charter after the paralysisof the cold-war years. We also welcome the steps theCouncil has taken to improve its working methods andthe transparency of its deliberations.To remain effective in the long run  the SecurityCouncil must be representative. There can be noeffectiveness without legitimacy. Legitimacy grows froma true reflection of the increase in United Nationsmembership as well as from a frank recognition ofchanging realities. Finland therefore supports an increasein Council membership by five to eight new members.16The groundwork for the reform of the Council hasbeen laid after two years of intensive debate in the WorkingGroup of the General Assembly. Now it is time to movefrom discussion to true negotiation between Member States.A strong United Nations does not mean that ourOrganization should do what we  as Member States  shouldin the first instance do ourselves. Under the Charter Member States themselves have an obligation to seekpeaceful solutions to disputes and to make every effort toprevent conflicts in advance. The United Nations assists but cannot replace  the Member States  nor should it beexpected to do so.The permanence of  and unfailing respect for universal norms is the basis of human security  whether inrelations between nations or within the nations themselves.The historic decision by the parties to the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty to make that Treaty permanentmeant that a cornerstone of international security was keptin place and that the prospect of the eventual elimination ofnuclear weapons became more attainable. The next stepshould be the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty by the summer of 1996. The negotiations inGeneva are proceeding well. Under these circumstances any testing is therefore a cause for concern. Finland hasexpressed its disapproval of the recent tests by France andChina.The breakthrough achieved in the Middle East peaceprocess two years ago will be followed by a new importantagreement  to be signed this week. I should like tocongratulate the negotiators on their courage andpersistence. The international community should continueto support the reconstruction that peace has made possible.Finland is encouraged by the recent turn towards apeaceful solution in the former Yugoslavia. Theinternational community has shown resolve in defendingSarajevo from persistent and cruel attacks on innocentcivilians. The international community must show equalresolve once the peace agreement is reached. It must helpto maintain peace on the ground and to reconstruct whathas been shattered by war. But  above all  it is necessarythat all parties to the conflict now finally committhemselves to peace.Some of the lessons from the conflicts in formerYugoslavia and elsewhere are clear. The capacity of theUnited Nations and the international community tocoordinate an international response is still inadequate andnot integrated enough  as so many speakers before mehave already mentioned here. The United Nations bearsthe main responsibility to prevent  to react rapidly to andto manage often very complex emergencies. It is thecentral actor in peace-keeping operations. We must notallow the lack of financial resources and organizationaldifficulties to stand in the way.A continuum of ideas based on a broad concept ofsecurity — from respect for the rule of law and humanrights to support for sustainable economic and socialdevelopment — is already available in the Secretary-General’s twin Agendas for Peace and for Development.It is now for the Member States to put the best of thoseideas into practice. Finland  together with its EuropeanUnion partners  will do its share.True international security begins with the securityof the individual  sometimes in relation to his or her ownGovernment. Violations of human rights  includingwomen’s rights  are not justifiable on any grounds. Thereare no cultural exceptions to universal human rights.The importance of mechanisms for the effectiveprotection of human rights is now widely recognized. Thisis manifested  inter alia  in the efforts to establishsystematic and organized judicial inquiry into  andpenalties against  violations of international humanitarianlaw and human rights. Finland supports the earlyestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.In addition to judicial mechanisms open mainly toStates  the question of the right of individuals to rely oninternational human rights instruments is worthy ofserious study and development. The very positiveexperiences gained during the 45 years that the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights of the Council of Europe hasbeen functioning illustrate the merits of this approach tohuman rights. I can speak to that.The Beijing Conference and other recent UnitedNations Conferences — Vienna  Cairo  Copenhagen —need active and integrated follow-up throughout theUnited Nations system. The platforms are there. Theyhave established beyond doubt that sustainable humandevelopment and human security can be realized onlythrough the empowerment of individuals and a strongcivic society under law. In the international follow-up ofthe Beijing Conference  the roles of the GeneralAssembly and of the Economic and Social Council are17crucial  not only for the efficient implementation of thePlatform for Action  but also for strengthening theOrganization in the social and economic fields. At the sametime  action at the grass-roots level — not new bureaucraticsuperstructures — is what is now required.The follow-up to the Rio Conference offers someencouragement. Environmental concerns are now part ofmainstream thinking on development. As a major forestrynation  Finland wants in particular to make sure thatprogress on forest issues is made in a solid and balancedmanner and on a global scale.The past five decades have demonstrated to the worldthat the United Nations is a vital centre for harmonizingactions for the common good. The future will bring newchallenges. Let us provide the United Nations with thepolitical support and the financial means that it desperatelyneeds to serve us for the future."
"53",2375,"FJI",50,1995,"Allow me first of all to expressvery warm greetings and congratulations to the Presidentfrom the Government and people of Fiji on his election topreside over the General Assembly at this historic fiftiethsession. We are confident that with his vast experienceand demonstrated leadership  the General Assembly willcomplete its deliberations at this important sessionfruitfully. I would also like to express the compliments ofmy delegation to His Excellency Foreign Minister AmaraEssy  whose presidency during the forty-ninth sessionbrought the work of the General Assembly to a successfulconclusion.I wish to join other speakers in warmly welcomingthe Republic of Palau as the one hundred and eighty-fifthMember of the United Nations.On 13 October 1970  a quarter of a century ago  Fiji a newly independent State only three days old  wasadmitted as this body’s one hundred twenty-sixthmember. Standing at this very rostrum  the PermanentRepresentative Designate of Fiji to the United Nations Ambassador Semesa Sikivou  said “Although I represent a small country far awayin the Pacific  my Government and people warmlycherish the principles and ideals which led to thefoundation of the United Nations and which havemade this great Assembly  in its 25 years ofexistence  one of the main hopes for the future ofmankind. And we are fully resolved to play our part however humble  in helping to maintain and fosterthe high purpose for which this Assembly wasestablished — the brotherhood of mankind.”(Official Records of the General Assembly  Twenty-fifth Session  Plenary Meetings  1863rd meeting para. 111)Today I wish to confirm that since that memorableoccasion  nothing has changed to diminish that resolve inany way. It has never been shaken. The intervening yearshave demonstrated that the high purpose to whichAmbassador Sikivou referred constitutes the very cementthat binds us together in the pursuit of a common globaldestiny. The principles and ideals which inspired thearchitects of the United Nations still endure as noblegoals that challenge us.Today is a special day for Fiji because it marks thetwenty-fifth year of our nationhood. While anniversaries18are appropriate moments for celebration  they are also afitting time for reflection  stocktaking and giving thanks. Inour particular case  Fiji owes a debt of gratitude to itsfriends in the international community who reached out toassist us over these years. Since that moment  over twodecades ago  when our frail canoe embarked on its longvoyage  with all its reefs and shoals  it has been comfortingto have so many friends ready to show us the beacons andlighthouses  enabling us to choose a course that wouldmake our independence meaningful for ourselves. On behalfof the Government and the people of Fiji  it is my solemnduty today to say thank you to our friends. As the canoecontinues its journey  we are confident that we will be ableto continue counting on the guidance and help of ourfriends. And this includes the United Nations — we highlyvalue our association with it and the assistance it provides.Half a century ago  the United Nations was establishedto end the scourge of war and build a better world forsucceeding generations. The cold war and its attendantsuper-Power rivalry have ended. However  despitedecreases in inter-State conflicts  recent history indicatesthat the much-promised peace dividend from the end of thesterile confrontations that characterized much of the life ofthe United Nations has not materialized. Conflicts withinStates continue to tear at the fabric of established societies.Can we truly say  looking around our world  that it is bettertoday than it was 50 years ago?During the last year  in particular  there has beenmuch soul-searching about the role of the United Nations.This has stemmed in part from a growing perception that inthe face of civil strife  the Blue Helmets have beenpowerless to save lives and prevent conflict. I believe thatthe seeming hesitancy of United Nations peace-keepersreflects our inability as Member States of the Organizationto develop a clear and confident sense of the new role ofthe United Nations in today’s changed global environment.We all have a collective responsibility to ensure thata more precise vision of the role of the modern UnitedNations is created. With political will  we can do it. In thisprocess  I suggest that the moment is right for us torededicate ourselves to the Charter  for it is the principlesenshrined in it that represent our best opportunity forfinding a clear direction ahead as we approach the newmillennium. No less important is that we  as MemberStates  should equip our Organization with the resources tocarry out its reinvigorated mandate.The United Nations must further enlarge itsinstruments of preventive diplomacy. The Secretary-General’s Agenda for Peace has clearly made anoutstanding contribution to discussions in this area. Fijiurges the Assembly to give earnest consideration toimplementing his recommendations on this issue. Fijiconsiders that there is much merit to proposals that aspecial department or unit be set up to deal with conflictprevention and resolution. This unit could coordinate theactions of a rapid-deployment force to be dispatched totrouble spots when conflicts erupt. More importantly  itwould collate  analyse and interpret information andintelligence and develop early detection capacities onpotential conflict situations. It would also work withStates in developing confidence-building measuresdesigned to minimize both intra- and inter-State conflicts.The financial position of the United Nationscontinues to be a matter of concern to Fiji. In this we arenot alone  I am sure. The sudden and huge increase inexpenditures for peace-keeping operations to a level morethan three times as high as that of expenditures fordevelopment is becoming difficult to sustain and justify.It has been our view for some time that the apparentimbalance between resources committed to security issuesand those committed to development is not justified.As regards peace-keeping  we all know that there arelarge-scale arrears in contributions. We do not object topeace-keeping operations. On the contrary  despite oursmallness and our relative lack of resources  we havebeen a consistent and active contributor of troops tovarious peace-keeping missions. Fiji has paid a heavyhuman and financial price for contributing troops  but ithas done so gladly and willingly and will continue to doso. Clearly  though  the United Nations has to rationalizeits peace-keeping expenditures and at the same timereimburse fully and in timely fashion monies that it owesto troop-contributing countries.It is now becoming clear that a large number ofMember States  if not the majority  wish the UnitedNations to devote more attention and resources to humanand social development. Ultimately  there can be nosustainable peace without development. Enduringsolutions to social and economic problems represent thebasic infrastructure for long-term peace. The UnitedNations cannot — indeed  must not — shrink from thisaspect of its mission.A greater rationalization of agencies andprogrammes within the United Nations and its agenciesmust be tackled with urgency and vigour. Fiji supportsefforts to establish a high-level working group on United19Nations reform  and we look forward to contributing toefforts within the Organization aimed at revitalizing andstrengthening the United Nations system. Of criticalimportance to this review process is the need for the UnitedNations to redirect its focus away from activities of limitedvalue and relevance and to strengthen those which theMember States identify as meaningful. This will require thetaking of some hard decisions which can no longer bepostponed.The end of bipolarism and the increased membershipof the United Nations have created new challenges for theOrganization. One of these is the reform of the SecurityCouncil. Fiji has followed with keen interest thedeliberations of the Open-ended Working Group on theQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council. We believe that thestructures of the United Nations should reflect changes inthe global political landscape. They should reflect theprinciples of geographical representation and equityconsistent with today’s global political and economicrealities. The arguments for an enlarged Security Councilreflecting these principles are compelling. Fiji also believesthat while questions as to the form of the Council areimportant  equal attention to the substance of the SecurityCouncil is crucial. In particular  we would urge that closerattention be paid to the “veto” power in the light of the newglobal realities to which I have referred.Fiji would like to register its strong view that thequestion of the protection and security of small Statesremains a central concern of the United Nations. Last year we joined in sponsoring a resolution on this issue in theFourth Committee  for as long as drug traffickers international arms dealers  money launderers andinternational white-collar criminals continue to ply theirtrade  and as long as mercenaries and terrorists and otheradventurers exist  the protection and security of small Stateswill remain vulnerable to acts of aggression from withoutas well as from within. Small States especially look to theprovisions of the Charter as regards respect for theirsovereignty and its preservation.Earlier this year  Fiji joined other States Members ofthe United Nations in agreeing to an unconditional andindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The Review and ExtensionConference was difficult and involved a willingness tocompromise on the part of many parties. During theConference  Fiji stated that the future viability of the NPTwould depend on the conduct of States in relation to theirrights and obligations. Fiji went along with the decision toextend the Treaty despite its imperfections because webelieved that it made an important contribution to globalpeace and security.We were therefore bitterly disappointed when Franceannounced its decision in June this year to resume nucleartesting in the South Pacific. Coming in the wake of theNPT Conference  the French decision displayed greatinsensitivity. Fiji has long been a consistent opponent ofnuclear testing in all forms and in all environments. Ifanything  we believe that rather than contribute to  theydetract from  national and indeed global security. As anoceanic State heavily dependent on the sea for food andsurvival  we maintain that nuclear testing in our regionhas a more immediate impact. It threatens one of ourmain sources of livelihood and our health  not only at thepresent time  but for generations to come. The Frenchdecision to resume nuclear testing at Mururoa has  as iswell known  met with worldwide condemnation. SouthPacific countries  as those most immediately affected have added their strong individual and collective voicesto the protests. In the light of the cessation of the coldwar  one might ask  What is the need for further testingof nuclear weapons?Fiji therefore urges France  even at this stage  afterit has already detonated two of its planned eight nucleardevices  to reconsider its decision. It is not too late to turnthe clock back. In recent years  thanks to the moratoriumon testing put in place by President Mitterrand  Francehas enjoyed cordial relations in the Pacific region  but allthat good will and the warmth of those relationships arenow being rapidly compromised by their recent decision.At their meeting in Madang last month the leaders of thePacific Forum expressed their extreme outrage at theresumption by the French of their nuclear testing in thePacific. They decided that  should France continue itstesting in the Pacific  the Forum would review the statusof France as a Forum dialogue partner. It is thereforesingularly disappointing that despite all these objections France went ahead and detonated a second nuclear deviceat Fagataufa  on 2 October 1995. We regard this as a slapin the face of the leaders of the Forum and a violentcrime against the people of the South Pacific.As the Assembly is aware  the Forum has now dulysuspended France as a post-Forum dialogue partner. Thiswill remain so until France changes its decision onnuclear testing in the Pacific. Fiji fully associates itselfwith the Forum decision.20Fiji would also like to express its deep regret at thecontinued nuclear testing by the People’s Republic ofChina. We see no justification for such tests. MyGovernment calls upon all States having similar intentionsto desist from taking any action that would threatennegotiations at the current session of the Conference onDisarmament taking place in Geneva. While presentindications are that negotiations to conclude a universal multilateral and effectively verifiable nuclear-test-ban treatyare on track  we cannot yet assume that the time forcongratulations and back-patting has been reached. Thatwill only come with the final conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty (CTBT) which takes intoaccount the security of all States  including non-nuclearStates. Fiji continues to place high priority on completionof the CTBT negotiations in 1996. We welcome PresidentClinton’s commitment to a zero threshold test-ban treaty.Fiji urges other nuclear-weapon States that have not yetdone so to give similar assurances. These States have aspecial responsibility in ensuring that the CTBTnegotiations remain on track. We believe that acomprehensive treaty covering all relevant concerns willmake a significant contribution to efforts towards nucleardisarmament and the prevention of the proliferation ofnuclear weapons in all its aspects.Within our own region  the South Pacific  we have anumber of conventions and treaties designed to keep theregion free from nuclear and other hazardous material.These include the Convention for the Protection andDevelopment of the Natural Resources and Environment ofthe South Pacific Region  of 1989  and its relatedProtocols — the Noumea Convention  the WaiganiConvention — which was opened for signature only lastmonth and which aims to ban the importation into Forumisland countries of hazardous and radioactive wastes and tocontrol the transboundary movement and management ofhazardous wastes within the South Pacific region — andthe South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty  the Treaty ofRarotonga  of 1985  and its three Protocols.With regard to the latter  we are pleased that two ofthe five nuclear Powers — China and the RussianFederation — have signed the relevant Protocols. But theremaining three have not done so as yet. We therefore urgethe United States of America  France and the UnitedKingdom to sign the Protocols as soon as possible as ademonstration of their commitment to a comprehensivenuclear test-ban treaty.From a global perspective  it had been predicted thatthe conclusion of the Uruguay Round would link economiesmore strongly through increased flows of trade andfinance based on trade liberalization and a concomitantstrengthening of multilateral trading systems. While tradeliberalization caused by the Uruguay Round has hadpositive effects on the trade and incomes of somecountries  the beneficial results of that process have beenfar from uniform. Nor have they been universal. Most  ifnot all  of the Pacific island countries are among thosethat have been adversely affected by the changed globaltrading regime  in part as a result of the removal ofcertain preferential trade arrangements of which theyformed a part. Small island developing economies haveborne the brunt of these changes  which have forcedsometimes painful adjustments.We would therefore urge our developed-countrypartners to assist efforts we are making at the nationaland regional levels to enhance our international economiccompetitiveness and to expand our trading opportunities.Last year  Fiji  along with other small island developingcountries  welcomed General Assembly resolution 49/100 which recalled the special economic vulnerability of thesmall island developing States. Fiji acknowledges the roleof the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the Department for PolicyCoordination and Sustainable Development of theSecretariat in research and policy analysis in thestrengthening of the capacities of small island developingStates to capture a larger share of world trade. Wewelcome the recent appointments of senior staff in boththose entities to provide greater focus on problems relatedto small island developing States. However  Fiji believesthat more tangible and concrete evidence of specificsupport measures to small island developing States mustbe put in place without further delay. We would urgentlycommend this as a matter to be studied in some detail bythe Commission on Sustainable Development at its high-level segment to be convened next year.Talk of peace and development enjoins all withinour global village  especially leaders  to recall and torededicate themselves to the commitments they agreed toat the World Summit for Social Development held earlierthis year in Denmark. If we as leaders in Governmentcommit ourselves to creating an economic  political andsocial environment that will enable people to achievesocial development  we will have gone a long waytowards creating an environment conducive to peace.Fiji would therefore renew its plea to the developedindustrialized countries to enhance their assistance todeveloping countries within the framework of the21Copenhagen Declaration to bring about improved standardsof living in the third world. In the long term  more stableand more affluent national societies comprising well-nourished individuals will be less of a threat to global peaceand stability than States whose citizens languish in abjectpoverty and the horrors of sectarian violence. At the sametime  we also recognize that since resources  particularlydevelopment assistance  are getting harder to come by  it isincumbent upon all of us to see that whatever resources aremade available are put to the best possible use.Indeed  proper management of resources isincreasingly becoming one of the major preoccupations ofboth the aid donors and the aid recipients in our region ofthe South Pacific. The South Pacific Forum had “Managingresources” as its theme in 1994. The Forum’s deliberationsthis year  which took place only last month in Papua NewGuinea  centred on the theme of “Securing developmentbeyond 2000”. As in previous years  the Forum islandmembers again had very useful discussions with aid donorsin the region in their post-Forum dialogue. We are deeplyappreciative of the opportunity to sit down together with thedonors and discuss regional issues of mutual concern. Thedonors included the United States  the United Kingdom France  Japan  Canada  the European Union  the People’sRepublic of China  Taiwan and the Republic of Korea.We believe that regional cooperation will play anincreasingly important role in the development of ournational economies. We therefore highly value ourincreasing contacts with the countries members of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and theeconomies of South-East Asia generally. This includesTaiwan  with which we enjoy very useful and close trade economic and technical cooperation  just as we do with thePeople’s Republic of China  with which we have strong andunequivocally clear official relations. We believe thatTaiwan  like the People’s Republic of China  has hugepotential to contribute in a practical way to the developmentof our region and to the world generally. We thereforewelcome the spirit of dialogue and cooperation betweenTaiwan and the People’s Republic of China and hope thatthe international community at large will also be able tobenefit from such cooperation. Their increased participationand cooperation in the activities of various international andregional forums would certainly be welcome.Fiji  as a member of the South Pacific Forum  ispleased that the Republic of Korea has now joined theForum as a post-Forum dialogue partner. We are confidentthat the Republic of Korea  a rapidly growing economicPower  can play a very significant role in the developmentof the South Pacific region. We welcome theopportunities that lie ahead. Further  we hope thatinitiatives for talks between the Republic of Korea andthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue.We hope that in due course there will be direct dialoguebetween the two Koreas  leading to their reconciliationand eventual reunification.Last month  the Fourth World Conference onWomen  in which Fiji also participated  was held atBeijing. We thank the Government and the people ofChina for acting as host to the Conference. Ourdelegation had high praise for the efficient organization ofthe Conference. We welcome the very useful deliberationsthat took place at Beijing. Fiji looks forward to earlyimplementation of the Platform of Action so that the ideascontained in it may be translated into meaningful activityfor the betterment of women.Preoccupation with economic progress should not beat the expense of continued protection of the environmentand sustainable development. Indeed  good environmentalhousekeeping will encourage economic growth rather thanhinder it.While the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seenas a defining moment in the quest for sustainability andenvironmental protection  Fiji regrets that a lack ofpolitical commitment  coupled with donor fatigue  hasbeen responsible for the failure of most developedcountries to allocate adequate financial resources toenable developing countries to tackle the plethora ofproblems associated with environmental degradation.If no increased official development assistance isforthcoming and if the international target of 0.7 per centis not met  there will be serious reneging on commitmentsmade at Rio. Fiji is especially concerned as a small islanddeveloping State that the more affluent industrializedcountries should recognize their responsibility towards theinternational community and take urgent steps to assistsmall island developing States in implementing theBarbados Programme of Action. Specifically  the need isfor international cooperation  technology transfer andfinancial resources.There is also a critical need for access to markets acquisition of new technologies  investments andinstitutional and human resource development by smallisland developing States to enable them to respond moreeffectively to the challenge of finding new paths to22sustainable development. My Government would urge allparties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change to move speedily towards the conclusionof an effective protocol that would ultimately bring aboutimprovements in the global climate system. For front-lineStates such as Fiji  vulnerable as we are to rising sea levels hurricanes and other phenomena associated with a worst-case scenario of climate change  politics has little to dowith the reality that our physical survival would be affectedif immediate action to remedy ailments in the world climatesystem were not taken. In this context  Fiji welcomes thecommencement of negotiations on the Berlin mandate tostrengthen the Framework Convention on Climate Change which got under way in Geneva last August.At the first Conference of the Parties to theConvention  Fiji had expressed its regret that the outcomeof the Conference was minimal. Fiji continues to believethat the protocol of the Alliance of Small Island Statesshould form the basis of any new instrument aimed atstrengthening the climate Convention. Further  at thepresent time  no new commitments should attach todeveloping countries  given that their overriding prioritywill remain the combatting of poverty. Recognizing that thepresent health of the world’s climate system is a result ofthe detrimental patterns of production and consumption ofthe industrialized countries  those countries should continueto take the lead in reducing the emission of greenhousegases.Fiji welcomes the successful completion of the UnitedNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks. The Agreement produced by theConference was the culmination of more than two years ofwork by Member countries that participated in it. It willform yet another important building block in theprogressive development of international law under theauspices of the United Nations. Fiji hopes that theAgreement will lead to the sustainable utilization of theliving resources of the sea. For its part  Fiji was bothhonoured and privileged to have played a small part infacilitating the work of the Conference. We have kept trueto the promise of Ambassador Sikivou that Fiji would playits part  however humble  in the affairs of this greatAssembly.At this time I would like to pay a special tribute toAmbassador Satya Nandan  under whose guidance asChairman the Conference completed the difficult task ofweaving together the sometimes competing interests thatunderlie the often complex and technical negotiations thatallowed for an agreement. Ambassador Nandan has done usproud  and Fiji is indebted to him for his enduringcontribution.Fiji has followed with keen interest the deliberationsof the Working Group on Indigenous Populations underthe brilliant stewardship of Mrs. Erica-Irene Daes  underwhose guidance a draft declaration on the rights ofindigenous peoples has been completed. Fiji believes thatthe draft declaration is comprehensive and contains thefundamentals that should be part of any instrument thatseeks to address the legitimate concerns and aspirations ofall indigenous peoples. We would urge all StatesMembers of the United Nations to support efforts toconclude work leading to early adoption of the draftdeclaration. However  while the draft declaration isimportant  Fiji considers that it is now time to give thefullest recognition at the international level to the rightsof indigenous peoples by commencing negotiations toconclude as soon as possible a legal covenant on thesubject. My Government believes that such an instrumentwould be a logical progression following the adoption ofthe draft declaration and would signal that the politicalwill to respect the rights of indigenous peoples exists.During the greater part of the life of the UnitedNations  the strong have dictated to the feeble  the big tothe small  the mighty to the weak. While there has beensome semblance of order  it has often been at the expenseof justice and equity. In this context  while the UnitedNations has been a symbol of hope for people from smallcountries such as mine  much more remains to be donebefore it can fulfil the promise of promoting humandignity  improved standards of living and social progressfor all. That said  however  Fiji’s view is that the UnitedNations remains the best and most imaginativeorganization mankind has yet devised for its survival inpeace  justice and progress.On this day  10 October  which is the silveranniversary of the independence of Fiji  and on the goldenanniversary of the United Nations  we want to share withthe international community the extraordinary opportunityto rededicate ourselves to fulfilling the aspirations of theCharter. The United Nations must continue to advance theinterests of all mankind by providing a meaningful forumfor genuine dialogue between the rich and the poor forthe establishment of conditions for development  and thusfor peace.Permit me to conclude with a final walk downmemory lane. When Fiji’s first Prime Minister  the RightHonourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara  now President 23addressed this Assembly on 21 October 1970  he ended hishistoric address with these words:“much of the effort of the United Nations has beenconcentrated on improving the material well-being ofthe peoples of the world  and I have just been readingthe far-reaching and imaginative report of the SecondCommittee setting out a blueprint for the seconddecade of economic development. It may then soundungrateful for a small country like Fiji  which has sooften been at the receiving end of the bounty  toquestion this priority. But so many of these schemes welcome as they are  are confined within theboundaries of one country. Spiritual and moral values on the other hand  know no frontiers  and byupholding and encouraging these  we are following acourse which is truly international  and which iscalculated more than anything else to give reality tothe concept of one world. We do not live by breadalone  and it is only from the firm base of soundmoral and spiritual standards that we can go on tomeaningful economic progress”. (Official Records ofthe General Assembly  Twenty-fifth Session  PlenaryMeetings  1876th meeting  para. 210)I would suggest that this advice  given withcharacteristic humility  as it was then by the architect ofmodern Fiji  is no less powerful today than it was 25 yearsago. I recommend it for the further consideration of thisgathering."
"54",2422,"FRA",50,1995,"Mr. President  I should like to say first howpleased France is to see you personally presiding over thework of the General Assembly. Beyond your personalmerits  which I acknowledge with pleasure  your electionunderscores the important contribution to the activities ofthe Organization of Portugal  a member of the EuropeanUnion with which France feels particularly close.The United Nations is 50 years old. As the Heads ofState and Government of the European Union solemnlyemphasized in Cannes last June  the collective work sincethe Second World War has been considerable. TheEuropean Council on that occasion paid tribute to themajor contribution of the United Nations to this collectivework and gave some examples: decolonization  themaintenance of international peace and security disarmament  development  humanitarian aid and  ofcourse  the protection of human rights.But the successes of the Organization do not belongsolely to history. This year has shown the vitality of theUnited Nations. In Copenhagen  the social dimension ofdevelopment  the struggle against exclusion and forproductive employment  which are both major challengesfor all our societies  are now within the domain of ourOrganization. In Beijing  the principle of strict equalitybetween men and women and the right of women todecide freely about their lives in all matters have finallybeen endorsed once and for all as universal values. InNew York  the United Nations has begun preparatorywork towards the establishment of a world criminal court.This project signals decisive progress for internationalhumanitarian law.In Vienna  at this very moment  a conference on thescourge of inhumane weapons is being held. France isworking in particular to eradicate the scourge of thespread of anti-personnel mines. In 1993  it decided upona unilateral moratorium on the export of these mines.Now the time has come to go one step farther.Accordingly  I wish to confirm that France has decided toadopt a unilateral moratorium on the production of allcategories of anti-personnel mines. It is therefore12imposing upon itself a ban on the manufacture of suchweapons. France also pledges from this point on to destroygradually its stock of anti-personnel mines. I call on allMember States to join with us and do the same thing.This year has also been marked by the success of theNew York Review and Extension Conference of the Statesparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. This success was a major step towardsdisarmament. France proposes that this coming year shouldbe a time for further progress in this domain: disarmamentshould be our common goal and it should encompass allaspects of disarmament. France calls upon the States thathave not yet adhered to this Treaty to do so without furtherdelay. The struggle against the proliferation of nuclearweapons must be universal. I suggest that all the Stateswhich have already signed this Treaty multiply concertedefforts to persuade the States which have not yet signed tojoin them.In addition  it is important to follow through on thenew objectives decided by the review Conference of theNon-Proliferation Treaty in May. Among these  the mostimportant is the conclusion  no later than 1996  of thecomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty now being negotiatedin Geneva. The President of the French Republic Mr. Jacques Chirac  most solemnly reaffirmed on 13 June1995 France’s determination to achieve this goal and toensure that the ban is total. France is pleased that othernuclear Powers have in turn made the same commitment.It calls on all nuclear Powers to ensure  together with allthe Member States of the Organization  that this pledge isduly confirmed in the text of the future treaty and that thenegotiation of the treaty is completed before the autumn of1996.I take this opportunity to recall the reasons that ledFrance to complete the programme of nuclear tests that wastemporarily suspended in 1992. The final series of testsnow under way has no other purpose than to enable us tosign the treaty banning nuclear tests definitively. Therewere some who imagined and others who wished to makebelieve that we might reconsider such a decision. This willnot happen. Once again I repeat  this is a final test series limited to what is strictly necessary and held underconditions that have been proved to be harmless. It willenable us to adhere as early as possible to the future treatybanning tests definitively.The disarmament effort must of course be directedtowards reducing existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons.Substantial progress has been achieved over the past fewyears with the destruction of a significant number ofwarheads by the two main Powers. I would recall thatFrance for its part  although it has never contributed tonuclear overarmament  reduced the nuclear warheads ithad deployed by 15 per cent between 1991 and 1995.Disarmament  however  does not apply solely tonuclear weapons. With regard to chemical weapons  I callupon all the Member States to ratify  or for those whichhave not yet done so to adhere to  the 1992 Conventionbanning chemical weapons. I regret that France is theonly permanent member of the Security Council that hasratified this Convention. I hope that the other permanentmembers will do so in the coming months.We must continue the effort to reduce conventionalforces in Europe. France took its full part in theagreement on conventional force reductions in Europe. Itproposes that the conference which will be held in May1996 to examine the implementation of this agreementshould focus on compliance by all States with a treatythat is the keystone of security in Europe. This conferenceshould also be the occasion for further progress.There remains the highly sensitive issue of theConvention banning biological weapons. A seriousverification system has to be set up. I hope that theworking group responsible for this matter in Genevaquickly establishes such a system.My country cannot accept the argument put forwardby some that the Organization has failed in its task. Wereject the accusations of passivity and helplessness thatare sometimes made against it. Nevertheless  we cannothide the fact that the celebration of the fiftieth anniversarywill not be as joyful and as optimistic as we would haveliked. The image of the Organization in public opinion isconfused  even negative at times. We should try togetherand with a clear head to identify the reasons for such asituation. I am convinced they have nothing to do withany disaffection with the Organization. Never have theaspirations of our peoples  especially the youth of theworld  so matched the objectives of the Charter: peaceand disarmament  environmental protection  solidaritywith the very poor  aid to those who suffer  the promotionof democracy  of liberty and basic human rights  and thecollective struggle against the major scourges of the endof the century  namely drugs  terrorism and AIDS. In thelast few years  we have witnessed the emergence of abody of common values on a world scale. These are thevalues which the United Nations  like France  upholds;they are the values of peace.13In Europe we built with our neighbours a Communityand then a European Union  and in doing so we turned apage of a history that had so often led us to confrontationwith each other. Since 1945 Europe has known a period ofunparalleled peace. The European Union is on the verge ofbeing enlarged again. France warmly welcomes theforthcoming membership of its neighbours in Central Eastern and Mediterranean Europe  and will do everythingto make it a great success. In this way  the unity of ourcontinent is gradually being organized.The extension of the boundaries of the EuropeanUnion does not lead it to close in on itself. Quite thecontrary  Europe is opening up to nearby neighbours fromthe South  as the Euro-Mediterranean Conference inBarcelona will demonstrate. I should like to emphasize thefundamental importance of that Conference. Europe alsowants to develop its relations with Asia; in this regard  thefirst Europe-Asia Summit  scheduled for March 1996  willbe a clear illustration. Lastly  Europe is deepening itspartnership with Russia as well as enhancing its close tieswith the United States and other partners.I would like to insist on the fact that the EuropeanUnion  under the impetus of the French presidency  hasconfirmed its privileged relationship with the African Caribbean and Pacific countries in the context of the LoméConvention and its special place in North-South relations asthe leading donor of development assistance.In all those areas  Europe has set the example.These values of peace are also at work in the MiddleEast. France welcomes the important results that havealready been achieved under the peace process. I amthinking of the Declaration of Principles of 13 September1993 and the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 26 October1994. But  above all  I am pleased to see that the principlesagreed upon in Oslo have at last borne fruit with the long-awaited initialling of the interim agreement this Sunday.With this  a major turning-point  manifested by thedeclaration of principles  has been given concrete form. TheIsraeli-Palestinian peace process is now irreversible. I alsohope that the talks between Israel and Syria will soonresume and that negotiations will start between Israel andLebanon so that a just and lasting peace  in accordance withSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and425 (1978)  be guaranteed throughout the region.As the French President  Mr. Jacques Chirac  stated atthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary at Geneva  theworld needs the United Nations. And it knows it  as provedby the increasing number of tasks Member States haveentrusted to the Organization.Therefore  today’s doubts have another origin. I seetwo major causes. First  the United Nations is not shownsufficient respect  probably because of a lack of politicalwill and resources. Secondly  the Organization has yet todemonstrate its ability to reform itself.Let me speak of respect first. One will never be ablelay sufficient stress on the devastating effect of the sightof the Blue Berets of the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) held hostage last spring  in chains andhumiliated in their dignity as men and soldiers. InSomalia  in Rwanda prior to Operation Turquoise  in theformer Yugoslavia since the outbreak of the conflict  thesoldiers of peace had already found themselves insituations that the United Nations accepted but that noMember State would ever have tolerated. It is notsurprising that the image of the Organization has therebysuffered.I want to make myself clear. It is not a matter ofquestioning the enormous work that has beenaccomplished by the United Nations peace-keeping forcessince the end of the cold war: Namibia  Cambodia Mozambique  El Salvador and Haiti owe to those forcesprogress that would have been impossible without theUnited Nations. In Somalia  the United Nations savedthousands of lives. Its intervention in the countries of theformer Yugoslavia made it possible to prevent the warfrom spreading to Macedonia  to contain and dampen theconflict within central Bosnia and Croatia  and  above all to ensure the survival of the populations in certain safeareas  in Sarajevo in particular  for three years. However we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptablesuffering  to shameful operations of so-called “ethniccleansing” and to crimes against humanity  which theinternational community was unable to prevent and beforewhich it remained passive.These tragic events have shown the dangers ofmixing humanitarian and military missions and the risksincurred when the mission conferred by the UnitedNations is lacking in clarity. The Organization needs tomake itself respected when it intervenes in a conflict. Lastspring  France proposed to its partners that the time toreact had come at last. It suggested a change in attitudeand policy  with the formation of a powerfully armedRapid Reaction Force. We have since begun  in liaisonwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decisive action to lift the siege of Sarajevo. This has14enabled the United Nations to recover the respect of allparties.This strengthening of the United Nations capacities foraction has no other objective than to place force at theservice of law. Only a political solution can truly settle theconflicts brought about by the dissolution of the formerYugoslavia.That is why France  together with its partners in theEuropean Union and within the Contact Group  has takena clear position in favour of a settlement based on twomain principles  namely  respect for international law andthe support of the settlement by all the populationsconcerned.Respect for international law entails a rejection of anysolution which  imposed by force  would mean breakingwith the founding principles of our Organization. Bosniaand Herzegovina is a recognized State and a Member of theUnited Nations. Its territorial integrity and sovereignty mustbe preserved. There is nothing to discuss or negotiate onthose two matters.Those who have chosen to break the law and whohave committed the crimes of which we are all aware willbe held responsible individually. The International CriminalTribunal  whose creation was proposed by France in 1992 must fully exert its jurisdiction.It is also important that all the citizens of Bosnia andHerzegovina should be able to assert their specific characterthrough representative entities. Let each entity have directmanagement of its own affairs and even be able to maintainspecial relations with States whose populations share thesame affinities. All this is legitimate so long as themanagement of common interests and the exercise of thefunctions of sovereignty are not brought into question.The agreement on the principles of a settlementproposed to the protagonists in this conflict by the ContactGroup at Geneva on 8 September of this year and acceptedby their representatives  meets these two criteria. This iswhy France has welcomed it  approves it and will supportit. The agreement and subsequent actions represent anencouraging step  but they are only a first step. The extentof what remains to be done to end the tragedy of Bosniaclearly shows the major role that the United Nations willhave to take. In that mission  it can rely on France’sunwavering support. It must also rely on the support of theinternational community. Peace will be the work of all.The decline in the respect shown the Organization isevident in another domain that also affects its survival namely  its financing. It is not normal for the Secretary-General of the world’s largest Organization  faced withthe threat of imminent bankruptcy  to have fewer avenuesof recourse in dealing with his debtors than the smallestof our businesses. It is not acceptable for MemberStates — and I am not thinking here only of those thatare experiencing real economic difficulties — to showsuch scant respect for the Organization by ignoring thelegal obligations they have freely accepted.France would like to see the United Nations strongerand more respected. For this to occur  however  it is alsoessential that the Organization be reformed and adapted.The Secretary-General has spared no effort to openthe way to reform. Under his aegis  significant progresshas been made in the management of the Organization.All the debates in these past few years were undertakenat his initiative and have been based on his proposals inthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.France is awaiting with the greatest interest the Agendafor Democracy  which will complete this triptych in afield in which the United Nations is called on to take theleading role. The Organization has need  more than ever of its Secretary-General in order to adapt to the demandsof the twenty-first century.However  it also requires the political will of itsMember States  and this is not sufficiently in evidence. Atthe opening of this fiftieth session  my wish is a simpleone. Let us concentrate on the projects that have alreadybeen begun so that they can be completed soon  withinthe coming year. France will contribute to this  and Ishould like in this respect to submit a few proposals.One of our main objectives will be to reach anagreement on enlarging the Security Council. Enlargementwill be successful only if the Council continues in alasting way to be representative of the community ofnations through a reasonable increase in the number of itsmembers.I should like to reaffirm this today: the SecurityCouncil will have to welcome Germany and Japan aspermanent members  as well as some major States of thedeveloping world. It would also be desirable  naturally for the Council simultaneously to be opened to some newnon-permanent members.15The negotiation on the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil now can and should be concluded quickly. Let uswait no longer. It is equally imperative for the discussionon United Nations financing to produce results in the nextfew months.But we must be honest with ourselves. Thisnegotiation depends in part on the response to the UnitedStates’ request for a reduction in its assessed contributionto the budget for peace-keeping operations. I shall not tryto disguise France’s genuine doubts as to the legitimacy ofthis request.None the less  for the higher interests of theOrganization  my country is ready to examine this questionwithout any a priori conclusions. It does  however  setcertain imperative conditions. The first condition is that anynew scale must respect fully the real capacity of MemberStates to pay. On this point I should like once again to paytribute to your country  Mr. President. Portugal decided thisyear  of its own accord  to increase its contribution to thebudget for peace-keeping operations. The second conditionis that the agreement must make it possible for theOrganization to start off again on sound bases. All existingarrears will therefore have to be paid up. The thirdcondition is that automatic sanctions should be applied tothose who do not pay appropriately in order to prevent arecurrence of the current crisis.This is the modest price of enabling the UnitedNations to devote itself less nervously to its two principalmissions: peace-keeping and development.Peace-keeping is the domain of the Security Council the only body empowered to decide on the use of force andto determine the principles and mandate of operationscarried out in the interest of international peace andsecurity.We have to learn the lessons of the experiences ofrecent years. Aside from traditional peace-keeping  theUnited Nations may find itself obliged  in accordance withthe mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council  toresort to force  within the limitations of its means  in orderto preserve whatever can be preserved. United Nationsmilitary action is often the sole recourse available to theinternational community.It is therefore essential to increase the efficiency of theUnited Nations in the service of peace. Among the mostpressing matters  I wish to underline the need to set upcapacities for rapid intervention  in the framework of thevital process begun two years ago concerning stand-byforces. I wish also to mention the need to improve thecommand of operations and the interest in a still greateruse of preventive diplomacy.I would like to say a few words about a situationthat is of grave concern to France and that callsspecifically for urgent action in preventive diplomacy ona large scale. I am referring to the situation in the GreatLakes region of Africa.Since the assassination of Burundi’s President Mr. Ndadaye  and the unprecedented tragedy that struckRwanda  this entire region has been deeply destabilized.More than 2 million Rwandans and Burundis are livingoutside their country in terrible conditions  with thedifficulties that all this entails for the host countries. Theabsence of lasting political solutions  the climate ofinsecurity and fear that is kept alive by all the extremists the suspicion reigning on all sides  the risk of newtragedies — all this compels us to address together and indepth the fundamental problems in this area  taking intoaccount their extreme complexity and the trauma causedby the genocide that has plunged Rwanda into mourning.France remains convinced that only a comprehensiveregional approach that is political in character will makeit possible to do this. The principle of a conference onpeace  stability and security in the Great Lakes region isnow accepted  and we welcome the recent appointment ofa Special Representative by the Secretary-General. Buttime is of the essence.This conference must be carefully prepared  with theactive participation of the States most directly involvedand interested in its success  and it must lead to theestablishment of a stability pact for the African GreatLakes region. There are three elements that I believe tobe essential in this respect: first  the adoption ofprinciples for the return of the refugees and for nationalreconciliation  along with a commitment by States not totolerate any activity hostile to their neighbours on theirterritory; secondly  the conclusion of bilateral ormultilateral agreements among the States concerned toenshrine these principles and commitments and to givethem substance; and  finally  the organization of a follow-up mechanism under the aegis of the Security Council.France holds the conviction that developmentassistance is the second  or perhaps the first  raison d’êtreof the United Nations. Here  too  the balance sheet invitesreflection. How can we not have questions about the16feebleness of results  the persistence of extreme poverty  orat times even famine  these crises that erase all prospects ofdevelopment and bring indescribable suffering topopulations? How can we not have questions about thereduced contributions of the world’s richest countries?These failures have gone onto the record. Now wemust act  reform and take the best advantage of theexperience we have acquired. The institutions of the UnitedNations and their network of representatives in the field arestrong points. The development agencies have to refocustheir activity specifically on their objectives. They have toset real priorities aimed at addressing real needs — in otherwords  first and foremost the needs of the least developedcountries.But it would be shocking if  as I sometimes predictwill happen  reform were boosted for the sole purpose ofreducing still further the contribution of the richest Statesin the struggle against human poverty.France  together with its partners in the EuropeanUnion  hopes to bring about  through An Agenda forDevelopment a mobilization for development on newfoundations. The situation is too disturbing to set theinterests of the States of the North and South in oppositionto each other. We are all bound by a higher duty: the globalstruggle against poverty.If  before this session comes to a close  we are able toenlarge the Security Council  to place United Nationsfinancing on solid bases  to give the Organization themeans to intervene rapidly and effectively to maintain peaceand  finally  to modernize the modalities and institutions fordevelopment assistance  we will truly have celebrated thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  above andbeyond all the speech-making  in a fitting manner: by ouractions.Allow me finally to mention a project that isparticularly dear to me: to re-establish  on the occasion ofthis anniversary  the universality of our Organization  whichis reflected in the diversity of cultures and languagesmanifested here.Linguistic pluralism is essential. It reflects the right ofeach Member State to understand the others  but also itsduty to make itself understood. A draft resolution on thissubject will be submitted to the Assembly; it will deal withthe use of languages in the Assembly’s deliberations and inthe Secretariat  and I hope it will enshrine the need to retainsufficient resources to ensure the provisions of translationand interpretation services. I am convinced that we willreach a consensus in this regard.Our Organization has deliberately taken its actionsfor the long term. Recent events may obscureachievements that are nevertheless solid  the results ofcollective  patient  courageous work. But the gains arethere. It is up to each of us to make them known andconsolidate them so that the United Nations may continueto fulfil the indispensable role entrusted to it 50 yearsago."
"55",2448,"FSM",50,1995,"I amhonoured to address the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish at the outset to extend to HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral mycongratulations on his election to preside over the GeneralAssembly. We are pleased that the stewardship of thisanniversary session is entrusted to a distinguished andseasoned diplomat. I wish to express my confidence in hiscapable leadership and assure him of the cooperation ofmy Government in the discharge of the mandate of hisoffice.In this connection I wish to thank his distinguishedpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy ofCôte d’Ivoire  for his dedication and excellent guidanceof the work of the Assembly during its forty-ninthsession.I also wish to convey my Government’s gratitude tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for histireless efforts in the search for peaceful solutions to themany volatile situations and humanitarian anddevelopment issues around the world that are challengingthe Organization’s attention.My Government takes this opportunity to extend awarm welcome to our neighbour  the Republic of Palau the newest Member of the United Nations.A few weeks from today  Member States of theUnited Nations will join together to celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization  taking note of itsaccomplishments and its share of failures with a view tocharting an effective role for its future.The new global map before us today presents theOrganization with a unique opportunity as the primaryglobal institution. The challenge of leadership is beforeus. However  this opportunity will be missed if financialresources and the political will of its Member States arelacking.In this connection we wish to support the statementmade by the Chairman of the Group of 77 and by Chinalast week with respect to the progress report of the High-24level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situationof the United Nations.I also wish to express my Government’s strongsupport for the ongoing programme of reforms within theOrganization. We support institutional reforms that willeliminate duplication of work  waste and fraud and therebyenhance the effectiveness of the Organization.With reference to the scale of assessments  myGovernment finds merit in the argument that the principleof the capacity to pay seems to have fallen by the waysidein the determination of assessments. Studies point outdisturbing disparities in the existing scale as compared withindividual Member countries’ share of the global economy.Naturally  it is the smallest Member States that are beingpenalized by such disparities. My Government associatesitself with the report issued by the Committee onContributions at its fifty-fifth session  held in June of thisyear  which called for a lowering of the floor.The issue of human rights  implicit in the UnitedNations Charter  has been the topic of many debates andinternational conferences in the context of the work of theUnited Nations. We welcome the programmes of actiongenerated by these meetings and hope that the internationalcommunity will find the determination to allocate thenecessary resources for their implementation.My Government joined in the consensus of the partiesfor the unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) five months ago.With regard to the ongoing negotiations with respect to acomprehensive test-ban treaty  my Government welcomesthe commitment by the United States to a zero- yieldthreshold  and we urge similar assurances by the othernuclear-weapon States.On the other hand  during the past few months wehave been deeply troubled by the occurrence of nuclear-testexplosions in China and the South Pacific. These events canbe seen only as detrimental to the principles of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andendangering the prospects for success in negotiating acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.In the important area of development  my Governmentfully supports the ongoing work on the Agenda forDevelopment and the call for new approaches that wouldelevate development and economic policy to their deservedplace  on a par with world peace and security. In theSecretary-General’s recommendations of 11 November1994  he stated that the“United Nations cannot be a strong force for peaceunless it is also a strong force for development.”(A/49/665  para. 9)My Government fully associates itself with the declarationof the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77 calling forrestoration of the issue of development to the heart of theUnited Nations agenda  the centrality of the UnitedNations in promoting international cooperation fordevelopment and the creation of a balance betweenUnited Nations activities for development and its otheractivities.My Government welcomes the entry into force ofthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea inNovember of last year  as well as the establishment of theInternational Seabed Authority. While there is much workahead in months to come with respect to the SeabedAuthority and the International Tribunal for the Law ofthe Sea  we are confident that the spirit of compromisethat brought us to where we are today will continue toprevail and guide our efforts.In this connection  my Government is also verypleased with the successful outcome of the negotiationson straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocksthis past July. My Government looks forward to thesigning of the relevant agreement in December of thisyear. At this juncture  allow me to express myGovernment’s appreciation to Ambassador Satya Nandanof the Republic of Fiji for his excellent leadership asChairman of the Conference on that subject. As Pacificislanders  we take pride in the immense contributions ofone of our own sons.The Government of the Federated States ofMicronesia is firmly committed to environmentallysustainable development. We urge all members to followclosely the crucial work of the Commission onSustainable Development this year and to support theimportant work of Under-Secretary-General Nitin Desaiand the Secretariat in this difficult but essentialendeavour. In this connection  we continue to place greatimportance on the implementation of the Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States.At its meeting last month the South Pacific Forumadopted the Convention to Ban the Importation into25Forum Island Countries of Hazardous and RadioactiveWastes and to Control the Transboundary Movement andManagement of Hazardous Wastes within the South PacificRegion  also referred to as the Waigani Convention. It is animportant arrangement that strengthens and supplements theeffect of the Basel and London Conventions within ourregion.The subject of climate change and global warming phenomena that are influenced by mankind’s emissions ofgreenhouse gases into the atmosphere  remains of deepconcern to the people of the Federated States of Micronesia.Unfortunately  though  it seems that much of the worlddoes not at present share our feeling of urgency regardingthe continuing debate over this problem.The developments during the past year relating to theFramework Convention on Climate Change have to someextent been encouraging  but the process still suffers greatlyfrom the strong political and economic forces that obscurethe Convention’s clearly stated objective: the stabilizationof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at safe levels.Everyone agrees that this objective can be reached onlythrough difficult adjustments within the industrializedcountries and assistance to the developing world inacquiring environmentally clean technologies. It is alsounderstood that this must be done in stages over a certainperiod of time. But the first steps must be initiated at once.The First Conference of the parties of the Convention held in Berlin earlier this year  made the very crucialdetermination that the initial undertakings by industrializedcountries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions wereinadequate. Regrettably  the Conference did not see fit toadopt as a next step the protocol formally submitted by theAlliance of Small Island States  which would have applieda reduction formula endorsed by scientists back in 1988 asreasonable and necessary. Instead  the best the Conferencecould do was to mandate a working group to developduring the next two years a protocol or other legalinstrument requiring specific future reductions. At the firstmeeting of this working group  held recently in Geneva  itwas clear that powerful forces remain dedicated todefeating this process by whatever means they can apply.Opponents of the Framework Convention have beenvery ingenious in casting doubts over scientific knowledgerelating to climate change  but we hope that the upcomingsecond assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change will establish once and for all the clearlegitimacy of this concern and the need for action. ThePanel has found  among other things  a likelihood ofcontinuing sea-level rise of more than 18 inches  or halfa metre  by the year 2100 if nothing is done. Besides theobvious disastrous effects upon islands and theirpopulations  many heavily populated river deltas and theircities would be made uninhabitable.The eminent Director of the University ofMaryland’s Laboratory for Coastal Research recentlydescribed the measurement of sea-level rise as the“dipstick of climate change”. I would respectfully suggestthat while sea-level rise is certainly the indicator  it is ourislands and low-lying coastal areas that are the dipstick but we are helplessly fixed and immovable.I therefore call on this body at this session to takedue notice of the accumulating knowledge relating toclimate change and to reaffirm the urgent need formeaningful greenhouse gases emissions-reductionmeasures within the context of the FrameworkConvention.I am pleased to inform this Assembly that theGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia hasrecently ratified the Convention on desertification  and myGovernment will deposit its instrument of ratification indue course.The Federated States of Micronesia sees aninterrelationship between the three environmentalConventions — on biological diversity  climate changeand desertification  respectively. And only through acollective approach and support can we have a chance torestore  protect and sustain our global environment. MyGovernment joins in solidarity with all Members to worktowards solutions through global cooperation.The current series of underground test explosionswhich France has carried out in the South Pacific  andwhich it is continuing in the face of unprecedentedinternational outrage  is regrettable for many reasons  butI focus here on the particular danger which these testspose to the environment of our Pacific region.The history of nuclear testing in the Pacific region both north and south  is an ugly chronicle of willingnessto gamble with the lives and homes of millions of islandinhabitants. In the region of Micronesia  and in particularthe Marshall Islands  despite broad assurances that testingwas safe  we are learning only now  years later  that thedisastrous effects on the health of island peoples havebeen far worse than science could have predicted at thetime.26An established principle of international law prescribesthat a State must ensure that its actions within itsjurisdiction or control do not cause damage within otherStates or within areas beyond the limits of its nationaljurisdiction. That principle is embodied in article 4 of theConvention for the Protection of the Natural Resources andEnvironment of the South Pacific Region  otherwise knownas the Noumea Convention. Together with nine Pacificcountries and the United States  France is a party to thatConvention. It is also an expressed principle in theConvention on Biological Diversity  to which France is alsoa State party.The Noumea Convention and the Convention onbiological diversity also contain clear requirementsregarding advance  transparent environmental impactassessments of projects which might have harmful effectson the environment. No in-depth  comprehensiveenvironmental impact assessment of France’s undergroundnuclear testing programme in the South Pacific has everbeen carried out.France has sought to reassure the world by saying thatthe test area will be open to any assessment desired  assoon as its present tests are over. Without question  Francewill bear a heavy responsibility to ensure against futureleakage  the probability of which is very high. Picture theshattered substratum of a small atoll which has undergoneover 120 nuclear explosions  one of which caused a tidalwave. Surely  each succeeding explosion increases thelikelihood of leakage from the accumulation of radioactivematerials concentrated below. In my Government’s view the proposition deserves assessment before further testsproceed  especially since France’s obligation under both ofthe treaties I have mentioned includes observance of the“precautionary principle”.We hope that the collective voice of this body at thissession will finally convince France that it must respect theinterests of the Pacific region and the world by ending thenuclear degradation of Polynesian atolls and taking thenecessary actions to prevent future radioactive leakage fromthem.A common thread throughout these remarks has beenone of hope because  at its fiftieth anniversary  more thanever  this Organization is the greatest hope for a future inwhich nations  in cooperation with one another  can addressthe bewildering array of problems whose implications while local in their effects  far transcend nationalboundaries.Our small  relatively young nation  remote andunderdeveloped  joins with many others in similarcircumstances in feeling blessed that  at this juncture inhistory  there is a sense of universality within thecommunity of nations. At a time when the earlier“doomsday mentality” no longer lies at the foundation ofinternational relations  it gives us hope that the passing ofthat phase will now make room for more seriouscontemplation of the future of the planet we all mustshare.It is good that we are celebrating this importantmilestone in human history  this fiftieth anniversary ofour forum for the world’s nations  but if it is to be morethan just a forum  we must all keep a vision of ourpurpose in coming here each year and in expending somuch effort throughout the year at conferences and athome to exchange our respective views.In the end  we must find ways to transcend thenational assumptions about each other and determine tocreate a level of real cooperation which will consolidatethe effectiveness of our individual efforts. That is whytoday the United Nations is more important than ever —indeed  why it is crucial. It is through this Organization and through no other  that the breakthrough to which Irefer can be achieved.And so I close  as I opened  with reference to theopportunity that makes this Organization our strongestbasis for confidence and our hope for the future. Weknow that we are not alone in these views  and we lookforward to working very hard during this  the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  to do our part inmaking it  not only a well-deserved celebration  but aspringboard to a bountiful future to which ourdescendants will look back and say  “They did not let usdown.”"
"56",2490,"GAB",50,1995,"As I address the General Assembly on behalf of theGabonese Republic  I wish first of all to discharge theduty of sincerely congratulating you  Sir  on behalf of mydelegation and on my own account  on your unanimouselection to the presidency of the fiftieth session. TheAssembly’s choice reflects the appreciation of all StatesMembers of the United Nations for the contribution ofyour country  Portugal  to the quest for solutions to theproblems besetting the world. Your election highlightsyour talents as a diplomat and statesman and your wideexperience.It gives me pleasure also to express our gratitudeand admiration to your predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire. TheGabonese Republic hails that fine diplomat and thankshim for the dedication and readiness to act he placed inthe service of the world Organization at the forty-ninth12session; his work was a source of pride for the entireAfrican continent.I cannot fail to mention the Gabonese Republic’sstaunch support for the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in his tireless efforts in theservice of peace  security and development.I wish now to say a few words about the uniquenature of this session  during which the Assembly willconvene in special meetings to mark the fiftieth anniversaryof the Organization. At those special meetings  Heads ofState or Government will have an opportunity to assess theimpact of some of the action we have taken pursuant to thepurposes and principles of the United Nations. True  thosepurposes have not been completely fulfilled  but in allfairness we must acknowledge that there has beenconsiderable progress  especially on respect for humanrights  fundamental freedoms and peace  without whichnothing is possible. Yet development remains a majorconcern  despite the efforts that have been devoted to it.Every nation represented here is a reflection ofmankind  whose common values the founders of the UnitedNations evoked. Among those values I would highlightthose of greatest concern at the end of the twentiethcentury: peace  freedom and development.Gabon’s dedication to the ideal of peace is a constantelement in its foreign policy and its diplomacy. Theinclusion of that ideal in the Charter was most appealing tothe leadership of Gabon and eased our accession tomembership of the United Nations  on 20 September 1960.Hence  as a Member of the United Nations we took ourproper place alongside other nations  in the harmony of ourrespective differences.I wish to pay tribute to the founders of non-alignment who were the first to reflect in deeds  through the doctrineof peaceful coexistence  the principles enshrined in the SanFrancisco Charter. Twenty-five years later  the relevantresolutions of the General Assembly confirm thatinterpretation. We are duty-bound to go back to the sourcein order to respond to the need — the urgent need — fornew  creative thinking in favour of peace.It is an honour and a duty to recall that Gabon’sexperience in the settlement of conflicts has its living rootsdeep in Bantu civilization. Our view of solidarity amongpeoples gives a role to Gabon’s commitment to cooperatewith all States Members of the United Nations whatevertheir ideology or the nature of their political regime. Thispromotes the virtues of dialogue and tolerance amongpeoples and nations  virtues we practice in our homes andwithin our families  virtues that  through the internationalaction of President Omar Bongo  the Gabonese Republichas built into a principle of our diplomatic and politicalculture.Our idea of peace  then  is primarily functional innature. It reminds us every day that the state of peaceamong nations is a continuous process  one whichrequires at all times vigilance  courage and consistency inour efforts. Gabon can state with pride that it is dedicatedto the peaceful conduct of its relations with all thecomponents of the international community.“We are judged by our actions”  a great thinker quiterightly observed. Those actions that we have been able toinscribe in the registry of peace  both bilaterally andmultilaterally  follow the path traced by the Charter of theUnited Nations. They illustrate  first of all  ourunswerving loyalty to the Organization  which makes usautomatically involved in all the missions and all theactions it has undertaken anywhere in the world wherepeace has been threatened or might be threatened. Theefforts made quite recently by the internationalcommunity to heal the open wounds in Rwanda have hadour full support. The efforts made by the sameinternational community in Angola have often beensupplemented by our direct or indirect involvement. Itgoes without saying that with regard to these situationsmy country appeals to the community of nations tocontinue its multifaceted assistance for the reintegrationand rebuilding of those two countries. This appeal isaddressed also to all the other areas of tension in Africaand in the rest of the world.These actions are also illustrated by our appreciationof and satisfaction with the progress achieved in the questfor peace in the Middle East with the signing of the TabaAgreement in Washington; and in Central Europe as aresult of the new atmosphere brought about bydiscussions that made it possible for all the partiesinvolved in the situation in the former Yugoslavia to meettogether in New York. In our view  all these factors bearwitness to the fact that the international community isprepared to attenuate as much as possible the anguishcaused our peoples by the risks of war in the world.Nevertheless  every one of us would readily agreethat real threats to peace in international relations still13exist today. The outline of a new world order is still hardfor us to grasp; it shows us the paradoxical picture of afragile peace. Yet our expectations of the establishment ofthis new world order are not fruitless. For the time being Gabon gives due value to the dynamics which led  at theglobal and regional levels  to the creation of themechanisms designed to prevent conflicts.While peace has the virtue of making us feel safer freedom can open up prospects for individual and collectivedevelopment. In the view of the founders of the UnitedNations  freedom is a decisive element for the establishmentof an environment and an overall spiritual frameworkallowing for the emergence of social progress and theestablishment of better living conditions. Those who signedthe Charter received a mandate  as it were  to create theconditions for this  to the benefit of the people in their care.The results of this commitment to implement the principleof the right of peoples to self-determination and theprinciple of respect for human rights are known to all  justas we all know of  and regard highly  the actions taken byour Organization to inspire  to support and even to initiatepolicies undertaken in these fields. In this context  anypolicy contrary to this which calls these achievements intoquestion will give rise to the reactions necessary to preservethe balance between States and to restore everyone’s rights.Therefore  our dedication to the principle of theinviolability of borders in Africa is a guarantee of ourindependence and our freedom  since it shows that weaccept freedom for other States as well.My country’s experience in promoting and protectingbasic political  cultural and social human rights in recentyears has been outstanding. The establishment of a Statebased on the rule of law with a transition from a single-party system to a pluralist democracy has taken placesmoothly. The results of this transition  and the promisesborn of this experience for democracy in our country flowed from the fact that they dovetail with our culturalvalues  whose spiritual foundations favour the individual’splace in society  as the founder of and justification for ourcities.In Gabon  dialogue is valid only for human beingssince it is human beings who initiate it and carry it out fortheir own benefit. An example of this Gabonese practice ofdialogue was the results achieved barely a year ago at themeeting held by representatives of the majority andopposition political parties in Paris in September andOctober 1994 to define together the ways and means for theconsensual governance of our democracy that was thenbeing threatened. These results will be reflected in thesigning of the so-called Paris Agreements in the presenceof international observers.Social conflicts and confrontations between opposingpolitical forces can be overcome by rational discussionsand tolerance of the opinions of others. We are trulyconvinced that coups d’état are not relevant in presenttimes. That is why Gabon  through its President  OmarBongo  firmly condemned the unfortunate events whichoccurred in Sao Tome and Principe  and more recently inthe Comoros.Freedom  security and peace are in our view thevery bases of our democracy. To be sure  this democracyis only taking its first steps  but it will undoubtedly enablethe Gabonese people to reach a new stage in its historyand its political life.Another dimension of the political and socialproblems in Africa and everywhere in the world is thestatus of women in society. In my country  women havethe same rights as men. Our educational system ensuresfree access by all school-age children to instruction; thatis in the interest of the entire Gabonese nation. In socialterms  then  taking into account the recent concernsrelating to the status of women and children  as illustratedin the World Summit for Children in New York in 1990 and the Beijing Conference in 1995  the Republic ofGabon has made choices that are in line with the spirit ofthe actions initiated by the United Nations.Once again  I would mention the founders of ourOrganization and praise their generosity of spirit inplacing the happiness of peoples in the context ofextending freedom.The solidarity advocated for States as the absoluteprerequisite for defining ensuing strategies was designedto discourage them from any inclination of selfishness inthe implementation of those strategies.Unfortunately  however  we must admit that thislegacy has  instead  come to look more like “every manfor himself”  a standard that has been set up as providingthe ways and means to find happiness. The differencesamong nations have revealed the gaps between peoplesthe world over at the level of their development.However  in this sphere  the United Nations has triedto create a range of instruments and mechanisms designedto provide our Governments with the assistance theyexpect. Whatever the allegiance of the peoples represented14here  each and every one of us will acknowledge andappreciate  for example  the role of UNESCO in education science and culture; of the World Health Organization onthe basis of its contribution to the eradication of majorendemic and pandemic diseases; or that of the UnitedNations Development Programme in carrying outdevelopment projects.Nevertheless  the overall verdict is still mixed. Webelieve that although our actions have allowed humanity tosurvive  they have not fully succeeded in improving thequality of life for most people. In both the South and theNorth  our world is still littered  not just with pockets butwith vast tracts of poverty. All our States  small or large are being eaten away  to various degrees  by the cancer ofabject poverty.The United Nations recent decision to hold a worldsummit in Copenhagen devoted to social development waswelcomed by Gabon  which was an active participant.President Bongo himself said that that Summit was theresult of an in-depth analysis of the state of extremepoverty in which a large part of humanity was living today.Consequently  for our country  the programme ofaction drawn up at the end of the Summit — which  we arepleased to say  follows up the major guidelines alreadyfound in the United Nations programme of action for theestablishment of a new international economic order  on theone hand  and the major principles of “An Agenda forDevelopment”  on the other — should be translated intoaction  as hoped.We are all aware that  by the same token  thisendeavour will require the mobilized contribution of all ofthe countries and bodies that constitute the internationalcommunity.At the close of the twentieth century  Africa alone willhave broken all records for underdevelopment. By way ofexample  it has three quarters of the least developedcountries; it has the lowest level of growth; it is practicallynon-existent in international trade. Unfortunately  Africa istoday a continent apart  despite its enormous potential.It  nevertheless  accepts the fact that responsibility foreconomic recovery is largely in its hands and that this taskdepends above all on its own efforts. But it is still obviousthat the enormity of the crisis it is going through and thelevel of resources needed make international support for itsefforts necessary.For Africa in general and for Gabon moreparticularly  a more appropriate approach to the debtburden would favour a solution to this issue  given thesubstantial inverse capital flows going to our creditors asa result of paying back our debt.Africa wishes to remind the world of its commitmentto face its responsibilities with regard to debt and debtservicing. This was the position adopted by our Heads ofState at the most recent Summit of the Organization ofAfrican Unity. Gabon supports this. However  it looks tothe shrewdness of its creditors and in the understandableinterest of all parties concerned in this issue  to help usobtain favourable treatment in conditions for repayment.Gabon effectively devotes more than half of itsannual budget to debt repayment  thereby crippling itsdevelopment efforts — this in spite of the fact that themachinery for debt reduction advocated in recent yearshas discriminated against us by excluding us from the listof beneficiaries. We suggest that the reason given  basedon the high per capita gross national product  is unfair.This strange singling out of Gabon  which is stillalmost the only country in the so-called middle-incomecategory in the southern Sahara  is not justified in reality.This situation places a burden on our economy andthereby affects our economic relations abroad.This appeal to the international community for fairertreatment of my country is not a case of begging — nomore for Gabon than for the rest of Africa — because  asOmar Bongo stated at the Copenhagen summit: “Africa isnot asking for charity”.In reality  helping our credibility and viability ineconomic and financial terms  actually strengthens theinternational trading system for the common good. Thisis not a matter of philanthropy but rather of commonsense: helping the South means helping the North  andultimately the entire world.At the end of this rapid reading before thisAssembly  dealing with the themes of peace  freedom anddevelopment  my appeals to our Organization will beclear to all. It is expected to respond to the concerns Ihave just expressed.On the eve of the special meeting to celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of our Organization  I hope that all ofits Members will realize the enormous import of thisopportunity  for the world is changing before our very15eyes. The countries represented here are also changing  atdifferent rates. Obviously  I cannot accept the idea that theUnited Nations itself could fail to keep up with this trend.For this reason  the measures advocated along theselines by the Secretary-General of the United Nations couldbe supplemented by others that my country would like tosee  from the point of view of restructuring  and thereforereadapting the United Nations system to the realities oftoday’s world.The present context is conducive to this. An overallreform of the system is required  for the security of ourpeoples  and of the States that comprise it  and in the finalanalysis  in the interest of renewing the United Nationsitself.I conclude my speech  therefore  on this note of hope."
"57",2537,"GBR",50,1995,"May I firstcongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidencyin this most important year for the United Nations.It is nearly half a century since the General Assemblyof the United Nations first met  in London. King George VItold the visiting representatives of 50 countries that no moreimportant meeting had ever taken place there. The foundersof the United Nations had taken on themselves a heavyresponsibility and a noble work.Today we must pay tribute to those founders andtheir efforts. Earlier models of collective security hadsoon crumbled. The League of Nations collapsed afterless than two decades. The United Nations has provedmore durable. Over 50 years it has helped spread peacein place of war. It has worked to push back hunger anddisease and to advance democracy and human rights.Without the United Nations we would have a bleakerworld.I am delighted to add Britain’s voice to thesecelebrations at the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. After five decades it is timely to recall whatthe United Nations has achieved. At the start of a newhalf-century it is right to weigh the lessons of pastexperience.The United Nations is a means to an end. Its valuelies not simply in the shared principles and ambitionsenshrined in the Charter  but in practical results. Itssuccesses are real.The United Nations has been a force for peace.From Korea in the 1950s to Kuwait in the 1990s  it hashelped check and reverse the tides of aggression. In theNear East and Cyprus  United Nations troops haveworked for decades to sustain a measure of stability. InCambodia the United Nations mounted its most complexoperation ever to rebuild a country shattered by 13 yearsof war. In Mozambique United Nations peace-keepershave helped demobilize 100 000 combatants  allowingdemocratic elections and the creation of a unified army.The United Nations has been a source of relief fromsuffering. Since 1951 the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has providedfood  shelter  medicine and education for over 30 millionrefugees. United Nations programmes have immunized 80per cent of the world’s children against disease. UnitedNations sanitation and nutrition projects have halved childmortality in developing countries.The United Nations has been a motor for democracyand sustainable development. It has given electoral helpto over 40 countries. Its charters and covenants setinternational standards of human rights. It has brokeredagreements to conserve world forests and fish stocks.9The United Nations has done good work for fivedecades. My country  the United Kingdom  has been at itsheart from the start. From the drafting of the Charter  as thefirst host  in London  of the General Assembly and of theSecurity Council  we have been a staunch supporter of theUnited Nations. From the first stirrings of environmentalconcern in the 1960s  to the fight against AIDS since the1980s  through to management innovation and financialreform in the 1990s  Britain has been a driving force for thechanging agenda of the United Nations. In 1947 we werea party to the first case to come before the InternationalCourt of Justice. This year a British judge became theCourt’s first ever woman member.Even before the end of the cold war  British forceshad served the United Nations cause for decades. For 30years the United Nations operation in Cyprus has dependedon British troops and logistics. In the last five years Britishforces have served in Kuwait  Cambodia  Rwanda  Angola Georgia and  of course  Bosnia. Today Britain commitsmore troops to United Nations peace-keeping than any otherMember State — with 10 250 out of a total of 69 000.Near the end of its first half-century  the end of thecold war opened a new chapter for the United Nations.After years of super-Power stalemate  it again becamepossible to take effective action in the Security Council including by authorizing the use of force to reverseaggression. Almost immediately a rash of ethnically basedregional disputes began to break out  from the formerYugoslavia in the West to Central Asia in the East.Early experience brought a sense of exhilaration.When Saddam Hussein made his foolish miscalculation andsought to wipe Kuwait off the map  the United Nations wasthe means chosen to stop him  and it worked. Talk of anew world order did not seem empty.Five years on  the record looks more diffuse. Theinternational community could do little to halt disintegrationin Somalia or to avert bloody collapse in Rwanda. The warsof secession in the former Yugoslavia have dragged on forfour years.But those who speak of United Nations failure arewrong. The pendulum that swung too far towards euphoriaafter the Gulf War has swung too far towards despair. Lookat the facts.Alongside the torment of Bosnia and Rwanda are thedemocratic revolutions that have swept South Africa  SouthAmerica and Central and Eastern Europe. We live in apost-apartheid world  with a Europe of free nations andthe Middle East peace process a reality rather than aslogan. The United Nations has helped bring about peacein Namibia  Cambodia  El Salvador  Mozambique and atlast  perhaps  in Angola. Even in Bosnia  the real goodthe United Nations has done has been obscured by unrealexpectations. The reality of the past five years is not oneof spreading world disorder  but of painstaking  steadyefforts to build peace.Compare this record to the grim setting for the firstGeneral Assembly meeting in 1946  when whole regionslay in ruins after five years of world war. The truth is thatthe history of serious attempts at international cooperationis still quite young. The United Nations is by far its mostsuccessful expression. There is today no one country orgroup of countries ready and able to cope with new worlddisorder all alone  and since regional instability andeconomic dislocation affect all our interests  we need astrong and effective United Nations.This is not to deny the need for change. But it is nogood simply blaming the Organization. We  the UnitedNations Members  must meet our obligations to helpimprove the system. We have done much in recent years.The United Nations is better able now to plan  mount andconduct missions. Britain and others have secondedmilitary officers to New York to develop the planning andoperational capability and funded secondments by othernations. Last year Britain helped launch a new initiativeon African peace-keeping. That is bearing fruit now  inUnited Nations regional training  in closer cooperationbetween African countries and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Conflict Resolution Mechanism andin products like the Anglo-French Peace-keepingGlossary  developed by the Ghanaian Staff College.The process of reform must continue. The moreseriously the United Nations addresses issues like pre-planning  logistic support and command and control  themore confidence troop contributors will have  the moreforces will be put at the disposal of the United Nationsand the more effective the operations will be.Changing procedures is not enough. We must learnto be more realistic in what we ask of the United Nations.That means not setting aspirations we cannot provide themeans to meet. Sometimes a declaratory statement isuseful to put the international community’s views onrecord  to underpin a consensus. At other times it may bebetter for the Security Council to remain silent than toissue unrealistic pronouncements.10Bosnia and Somalia have shown the limits of peace-keeping. They offer a clear lesson. The United Nations isnot yet suited to fight wars. Peace enforcement is betterleft  perhaps  to a coalition of the willing acting underUnited Nations authority. We must not send in the UnitedNations to keep a peace which does not exist and thenblame the United Nations for failure  nor send it inmandated and equipped to keep the peace and then blameit because it does not enforce the peace.Whatever the blemishes of recent years  there isgreater scope today for effective international action thanever before. The United Nations should be the centre-pointof such work. I suggest we should focus greater effort infuture on two areas.First  preventive action is better than cure. Far betterthan containing or extinguishing a fire is stopping it fromigniting. Bosnia is the most tragic example. Today theprospects for peace look a little stronger. I commend theefforts of Dick Holbrooke  supported by the Contact Group to mediate between the parties  and the agreement reachedin Geneva on 8 September. Many hard choices lie ahead forall sides before a final settlement is achieved. But we havemade a start. It is vital that all parties seize this chance forpeace. Only political negotiations  not military force  cansecure that.But the war has dragged on for three and a half yearsnow. Tens of thousands of people have been killed;millions more have been made homeless. It will take yearsfor the wounds inflicted on that country to heal. Certainlythe suffering would have been many times worse withouta United Nations presence. When I was in Sarajevo lastweek  the Bosnian Government told me how much it valuesthe work done by British and other forces to help thepeople of Bosnia. But how much better for all these peopleif war had been avoided from the start. Perhaps much ofthe damage and destruction might have been prevented bycloser international attention to the problems and tensionsarising from the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.We have started to learn that lesson. The earlydeployment of a small United Nations force in The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia has helped to stopconflict from spreading there. Elsewhere the quietdiplomacy of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe has helped defuse tension in Ukraine andAlbania; has nudged adversaries toward peace talks inGeorgia  Moldova and Chechnya. There are few headlinesfor successes that avert fighting and save lives. But theheadlines of war carry a heavy price. Preventive action isa wiser investment.Many routes exist. Britain and France have sketchedout one model: to use the skills of diplomats  of soldiers of academics and others to defuse tension and promotedialogue. The presence of aid workers  human rightsmonitors  or United Nations envoys can help contain abrewing crisis; and all credit to the United Nationsrepresentative doing that in Burundi. We strongly supportthe efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) towork with the United Nations in preventive diplomacyand conflict resolution. The initiative on African peace-keeping will help.So many different actors can play a part. The crucialpoint is not who acts but when. Early warning of a crisisand prompt action by the international community are thereal key to avoiding further tragedy of the kind we haveseen in Bosnia.My second proposal is for a new approach to peace-building. To provide lasting security requires more thandiplomacy and military force. To build real peace wemust bridge the gap between our humanitarian work andour long-term development work.Aid workers have grown used to coping with thedebris of war. In the past five years the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) has given help to millions fleeing conflict:Rwandans in Tanzania and Zaire  Afghans in Iran andPakistan  Liberians in Côte d’Ivoire and in Guinea. Buttoo often we treat short-term humanitarian needs inisolation. Huge sums have been spent in humanitarianefforts in Rwanda  for example. But Rwanda’s long-termstability depends on rebuilding the structures of societyand on civil rights; helping local communities to helpthemselves  in areas from health and housing through toan effective judiciary.I suggest that two elements are key to a newapproach.First of all  we must adopt a longer-term perspectivein tackling immediate crises. Even when a cease-fire isholding  or elections have taken place  if the frameworkof society is shaky  a continued international presence canoffer it stability until a government can cope. An abruptend to a mission  by contrast  can be very destabilizing.In El Salvador  for example  a small human rights teamstayed on after the United Nations troops had left  to11provide further advice and monitoring. Peace-keepersthemselves can help begin the work of reconstruction. TheUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the aidagencies have been doing that for over a year in centralBosnia  underpinning reconciliation between Muslim andCroat communities by rebuilding roads and hospitals andschools.I strongly support the thesis of the Secretary-General’srecent report: that we must go beyond electoral assistance to preparing the social and institutional ground in whichdemocracy and civil society can put down firm roots. Thetask of rebuilding Bosnia could be a model for the future.Secondly  we need far better coordination in what wedo. If funds are to be gathered and used quickly andeffectively  donors themselves must make a greater effortto meet their promises of help. Before operations begin  asplanning gets under way  the international financialinstitutions must be involved from the start  as they were inCambodia. All the actors in the United Nations system mustbe working together  military and political  humanitarianand development  crossing the traditional boundariesbetween rival baronies. Such a coalition of interests couldplug the gap we see too often now  until the majorreconstruction programmes can begin.My proposal is to build on these principles in UnitedNations programmes for stabilization and transition. Thereare many areas where international expertise can helprestore a society; creating judicial systems; training anarmy; developing a finance ministry or a diplomatic service.To fulfil these needs  we should be prepared to loan ourexperts to countries emerging from conflict  as Britain’sKnow-How Fund does for countries in Central and EasternEurope emerging from communism. United Nationsprogrammes for stabilization and transition could be thegreatest contribution we could make to internationalsecurity.The demands on the United Nations have grownenormously. To meet them the United Nations needschange at the centre too. I welcome work under way to cutcosts and reduce waste in New York. The whole UnitedNations system must learn from that example. We needbetter planning and budgeting  an end to fraud andmismanagement. More subcontracting can help  using non-governmental organizations  even private companies  fortasks like mine clearance and logistics in Angola. And thereis still too much duplication between the United Nationsagencies. Rhetoric is not enough. Reform has to be real and it has to be soon.This is not a side issue. It is not a narrow interest.If we are to do the United Nations work effectively —peace-keeping  aid or humanitarian — we must use itsresources better. No one  G-7 or G-77  benefits fromwaste. Recent experience has shown the United Nationsis in some ways ill-fitted for its tasks; under-powered insome areas  like peace-keeping and preventive diplomacy;but  however  still bloated in other parts of the system.United Nations Members must pay their dues. But theUnited Nations must justify those funds  and get the mostfrom them  by hard decisions on duplication and over-staffing  and diverting resources to the top priorities.Britain supports enlargement of the Security Councilto broaden its base without reducing its effectiveness.Permanent membership is the key issue. Permanentmembers of the Security Council must be both willingand able to make a significant contribution through theUnited Nations to international security. That is what theSecurity Council is about. That is what it must remain ifit is to be effective. Germany and Japan are playing anincreasing part across the range of United Nationsbusiness  and are among the top three financialcontributors. It is right that they should benefit from anexpansion of the permanent membership  with the widerrights that entails  but also with the wider responsibilitiesto contribute to security and peace-keeping. Broadgeographical balance in an enlarged Council also needs tobe maintained.But the United Nations system will never work if wedo not fund it properly. The United Nations is on theverge of financial collapse. It is owed over $3.7 billion inunpaid contributions. Troop contributors are owed nearly$1 billion. Last year 39 countries failed to pay at all. TheUnited Kingdom favours tightening of penalties for non-payment  including the charging of interest on latepayments. We find unacceptable cross-funding of regularbudget deficits from the peace-keeping budget. Perhaps anappropriate policy could best be entitled: NoRepresentation without Taxation!The financing arrangements must change. Somemembers pay too much. Others  like the new economicgiants of the developing world  now pay less than theyshould. We need a scale that is simpler and reflects acountry’s real capacity to pay  and without the additionalanomalies and distortions of the present system. Britain12and Sweden have put forward ideas. We need progresssoon.But the problem is not solved by turning the tap off.This year we have all reaffirmed our support for goals andwork of the United Nations. But empty words will not paybills.The final lesson from the last 50 years may be themost important: the case for a strong  effective UnitedNations.In conclusion  may I say that the United Nations todayfaces a crisis of confidence. United States Congressmenmay be the most vocal sceptics. They are not alone. The airof optimism  of a fresh start after the cold war  is overtakenin some quarters by gloom at the instability andfragmentation around us  and pessimism at our ability tocope. This despair is dangerous.Multilateral action is not an add-on to national policy.It gives wider legitimacy to principles we value  such ashuman rights and democracy. It spreads the cost of aims weshare  such as freeing Kuwait from invasion or restoringdemocracy in Haiti. It lets us work with others to fightcommon threats  such as greenhouse-gas emissions or theinternational drug trade.The price is not high. The bill for all United Nationspeace-keeping  all aid and development work last year  wasslightly over 3.5 per cent of the United States’ defencebudget  or less than the United Kingdom spends on policeand public administration. One day of Operation DesertStorm cost as much as all that year’s United Nations peace-keeping. The price of disengagement and disorder would begreater. Public support is there. Even in the United States polls are clear: people support the United Nations  and theysupport international peace-keeping. We have a duty to ourelectorates to continue the United Nations work.It is easy to forget the United Nations successes over50 years. It is easy to turn away from disorder and chaos.But the world is too small. Crises in distant countries affectus too; our commerce  our citizens overseas  ourneighbour’s security — ultimately it is our own. It is in ourinterest to play what part we can to build a more decentworld. If the United Nations were not here to help do that we would have to invent something else.The experience of five decades offers lessons for thefuture. I know the Secretary-General is committed tochange. Getting the United Nations we need for the twenty-first century requires the support and participation of allMember States. The United Kingdom has played a fullpart in the United Nations for 50 years  and we willcontinue to do so."
"58",2561,"GEO",50,1995,"Allow me to begin byextending my warmest congratulations to the President onhis assumption of his functions at this remarkable sessionof the United Nations General Assembly in its fiftiethyear. It is without a doubt a fitting recognition of his richpersonal experience and of his outstanding contribution tothe world community.I should like to address words of deep appreciationto the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  forhis dedicated efforts aimed at creating a more secure peaceful and coherent world for future generations but above all  for the close attention  constant concern andpersonal compassion that he has demonstrated with regardto the fate of my homeland.On behalf of the Head of State  Mr. EduardShevardnadze  and the people of the Republic of Georgia I should like to express our gratitude to all Member Statesfor their support of Georgia in one of the most dramaticmoments of its long history. I should like to assure theinternational community that despite a very difficultpolitical landscape  which of late has included savage actsof political terrorism  the Georgian nation continues tostrive towards its goal of democracy and stability.I have been fortunate enough to have had the honourof addressing this unique gathering on previous occasions and have always found that  although some of theproblems facing our individual countries and ourcommunity as a whole persist from year to year  theunique nature of this world body provides an incentive tolook at problems in a more optimistic light and to seek18new and innovative solutions. This holds especially true inthis anniversary year.This Hall has witnessed different times and events some of them full of tension and stress  when the worldwas teetering on the brink of catastrophe. One can saywithout exaggeration that the history of mankind has beenwritten within these walls for the last 50 years.Fortunately  the tense cold-war confrontation hassubsided  clearing the way for the forming of mechanismsof cooperation and partnership. These mechanisms needtime to mature and prove their vitality — but time is aluxury that few can afford in our day.This fledgling process is also hampered by a varietyof other factors. Foremost among these factors is theexistence of a number of countries that are  at the sametime  struggling to make ends meet and to reform theirimpoverished economies. This creates a very difficulteconomic and social situation  which  in turn  leads topolitical instability  ethnic or civil conflict and  in the finalanalysis  to additional threats to regional peace  making theproblems of individual countries a matter of concern to theentire world. For Georgia  this most difficult factor isfurther complicated by the country’s detachment from theglobal opportunities of commerce  technology  investmentand information.No developing country — and Georgia is undoubtedlyamong them — has the means to pull itself out of itscurrent difficulties by its own bootstraps. And if left to theirown devices  these countries will inevitably follow the samescenario and become additional “bleeding wounds” on thebody of the world.The international community is providing significantassistance to Georgia and to the other new independentStates  for which we are very grateful. I should like tomake special mention of the additional funds allocatedrecently for development and of the extensive activities ofthe United Nations Development Programme in thecountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.This problem is of a greater magnitude  however  andits solution  we believe  lies in devising a comprehensiveplan for the economic and social development of a numberof fledgling States  involving vigorous actions on the partof the international community and a considerableexpansion of the role of the United Nations in promotingdevelopment and in the allocation of additional possibilitiesto support the countries transiting to a market economy.One specific option could be to elaborate generalprogrammes of development for individual countries.These programmes would be targeted at the main spheresof the economy  based on a thorough assessment ofindividual needs  assets and possibilities. They would setthe dates  define the sources of financing  and integrateinternational assistance and the efforts of nationalGovernments. The programmes would include theactivities of the United Nations and of national andinternational non-governmental organizations in eachspecific country. Such a general programme of acoordinating nature would enable us to clearly identifypriorities  set goals and effectively harness the untappedreserves of each nation. It would also make much moreeffective use of international assistance and goodwill which  we all understand  are not infinite.The creation and implementation of suchprogrammes would have a very important additionalbenefit: by helping to create the basis for a sound growing economy  they would simultaneously beeliminating the breeding ground for internal wars andconflicts in a manner much more effective than anypeace-keeping operation.The cruel and merciless flame of war raging on theterritory of the former Yugoslavia is a vivid example ofthe discrepancy between the realities of our world todayand the means that international organizations have attheir disposal. Death  unbearable suffering and misery fortens of thousands of people are the price of thisdiscrepancy.While the attention of the entire world is drawn toextinguishing the fire in the Balkans  the territory of theformer Soviet Union has become the scene of events noless dramatic and equally threatening to internationalsecurity. Many of them bear an uncanny resemblance tothe Balkans in their train of events and in their destructivepotential for regional and international stability.A timely and just resolution of even one of theseconflicts would provide a brilliant example and a strongmotivation for settling the other ones.In the past era — and I use this word on purpose since we have witnessed a veritable change of eras —Georgia was often referred to as a laboratory of boldexperiments. Though Georgia hardly has time forexperimenting  this trend continues to this day with anunprecedented case. I am referring to the joint activitiesof United Nations military observers and the19Commonwealth of Independent States peace-keeping forcesin the Abkhazia region of Georgia. So far  this novelapproach — or experiment  one could say — has yieldedprecious few results. Logically  this would prompt us tosearch for new forms and methods  but it should not at allexclude a more effective use of the existing and testedpossibilities.The interminable plight of Abkhazia and of the300 000 displaced persons scattered throughout Georgiacontinues to weigh heavily on the entire country andconstitutes another major factor in Georgia’s inability toengage fully in the process of consolidating  rebuilding andmoving the nation forward.A fair settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia is madeup of two equally important aspects: the unconditionalreturn of the displaced persons to their homes and thedefinition of the political status of Abkhazia within aunified Georgia. This is not somebody’s wish  it is not evensolely a matter of principle; this is a fact of life  and onethat will be implemented  sooner or later.Despite the bitter experience of repeated treachery  theGeorgian Government has never attempted  or threatened toresort to military force in order to solve this problem. Wehave always been committed to the peaceful and negotiatedresolution of the conflict. It is extremely difficult  however to carry on peaceful negotiations with a party that resorts toblatant “ethnic cleansing” and genocide as a means ofconsolidating its ill-gotten gains.Moreover  the Abkhaz side has recently gone so far asto practically stall the negotiating process by demonstratingmore than their usual intransigence. It is obvious that theseparatist regime is determined to make no compromises and prefers to maintain the status quo in the zone ofconflict. Each round of negotiations has proved that theAbkhazian separatists seek to win time  while pretendingthat they are committed to a negotiated settlement of theconflict.The separatist leadership is impatiently awaitingparliamentary and presidential elections in Russia. Theyattach great importance to the results  assuming that theywill bring about a revision of policy priorities there towardsa more pro-Abkhaz orientation.Such is the nature of “aggressive separatism”  whichpursues its dark schemes with little regard for law international public opinion  or elementary norms of humandecency.“Aggressive separatism” is a relatively newphenomenon which emerged on the ruins of thecommunist system and is being nurtured by variouspolitical forces. The peculiarity of “Abkhaz separatism”lies in its seeming usefulness for the larger political aimsof these forces. This fact makes it possible for a minorityof the population of an autonomous republic to drive outthe majority indigenous population of the land by force.This aspect of “aggressive separatism”  making it atool in larger political schemes  has internationalramifications and represents a danger for world securityas a whole.The special role and possibilities of Russia inbringing about the resolution of the Abkhazian conflictare recognized by all  not least by relevant United Nationsdocuments. Some recent developments encourage us tohope that Russia may finally decide to use this potentialin order to bring about a comprehensive settlement of thisproblem.The international community has applied much effortto promoting a peaceful  fair solution to the conflict inAbkhazia. In the past two years the Security Councilalone has adopted 13 resolutions on Abkhazia. Onehundred and thirty six United Nations military observersare situated in the conflict zone. The Secretary-General’sSpecial Envoy has undertaken numerous trips to the areaand has consulted repeatedly with all the parties.In December 1994 the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OCSE) adopted a Declaration atits Budapest summit in which the participating Statesexpressed their deep concern over “ethnic cleansing” “massive deportation of the population” and “numerousdeaths of innocent civilians”  having included thesespecific terms in the declaration.Add to this several declarations and statementsadopted at CIS summits in Almaty and Minsk  whichdenounce any form of separatism. Member States of theCIS assumed the obligation not to support in any form ormanner separatist movements and regimes on theterritories of other countries  and not to establish political economic and other relations with them. Neither wouldthey provide their territory and communications facilitiesfor use by separatists  nor render them economic financial  military or any other kind of assistance.At the CIS summit in Minsk the mandate of thepeace-keeping forces in Georgia was expanded to include20wider rights in order to facilitate the orderly return ofdisplaced persons and protect vitally important structures.The mere enumeration of all these measures andactivities would seem to indicate that sufficient political andlegal foundation has been created to finally resolve thisfestering crisis. However  the displaced persons are stillwaiting to return to their homes  there continue to be noguarantees of a secure life and normal living conditions and the separatist leaders in Abkhazia persist in their aimof turning Abkhazia into a land uninhabited by Georgians.Should we regard all the above-mentioned resolutions decisions and statements as futile efforts that carry littlebeyond moral support? Or consider that the adoption ofSecurity Council resolutions and their implementation aretwo separate and unconnected acts?I recall an emotional intervention by the PermanentRepresentative of the Czech Republic  AmbassadorKovanda  at one of the Security Council meetings  in whichhe suggested that the time had finally come to “call a spadea spade”. As I have mentioned  this was done in the OSCEDeclaration in Budapest last year  but this has yet to appearin any United Nations document on the situation inGeorgia.Also  the process of enforcing the implementation ofthe provisions of adopted documents is slack and  with veryfew exceptions  brings no results. I realize that I amtouching on some sore points in United Nations activities but the lack of movement on the Abkhazian conflictcompels us to present the undisguised truth and begin thetransformation from words to deeds.In this regard  I should like to present somesuggestions which  we believe  could contribute to theeffectiveness of both the words and of the actions of theUnited Nations.In our view  the resolutions emanating from the UnitedNations  as well as from other international organizations must clearly assign personal responsibility to individualpersons  organizations or regimes  guilty of disrupting theprocess of the peaceful resolution of conflicts. They shouldclearly state that these actions will inevitably entailadequate punitive measures.First among them should be an introduction of severeeconomic and other sanctions according to Articles 41 and42 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Thespecific form of sanctions intended for the territories underthe control of criminals should also be defined clearly atthe outset  as well as the fact that the population of theseterritories will be entitled to receive only humanitarian aidunder strict international control. The case of Abkhazia isa relevant example. The Georgian Government hasinformation indicating that weapons and heavy armamentsare being stockpiled in some areas of the territory underthe control of the United Nations Observer Mission andthe CIS peace-keepers. The systematic commuting ofships between Abkhazian ports and regional States withthe intention of supplying criminal gangs  the freemovement of foreign nationals and the illegal operation ofcommercial entities cannot be tolerated either.Secondly  during its history  the United Nations hasnot been energetic enough in taking compulsory measuresagainst violators of international peace and stability. In arecent document devoted to the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  the Secretary-General describes such anapproach as desirable in principle and enumerates thepositive and negative aspects of entrusting this task to theMember States. Much room exists also with regard to thepossibility of achieving the same objective by regionalorganizations  especially at a time when the coordinationof action between international organizations has acquiredmore and more importance. Cooperation between theUnited Nations Observer Mission in Georgia and the CISpeace-keeping force  as an example  could benefit fromsome additional elements.With regard to this  I would like to point out that theestablishment of a permanent representation of the CIS atUnited Nations Headquarters  headed by a dynamic andexperienced diplomat  would be highly beneficial anddesirable.Thirdly  we consider the establishment and operationof the international criminal court a priority. The UnitedNations would be contributing greatly to promotinginternational law and justice and the court could quicklydevelop into a potent tool of preventive diplomacy  whichin itself would be a major factor reinforcing internationalstability.More often than not we are reduced to dealing withthe effect  rather than the cause  of events. In otherwords  we put much less stock in United Nationspreventive diplomacy than is prudent or practical. In thecase of the Abkhazian conflict  this point  naturally  hasno practical significance any longer  but conclusions canbe drawn from it that would be relevant for the future.Preventive diplomacy must have real mechanisms and21levers which would enable the international community toimpose its will  rather than expose the futility of itsinitiatives.In my intervention at the meeting of the SecurityCouncil on 12 May 1995  I requested an expansion of thefunctions of the United Nations observers in order toaccelerate the repatriation of refugees. We felt that it wasimportant to register and control the breaches of humanrights. This would deter lawbreakers and keep theinternational community better informed about the situationin the region. Since military observers would beinappropriate for this type of specialized work  wesuggested the establishment of a small team of competentprofessionals working alongside the observers to undertakethis mission. The Government of the Republic of Georgiawelcomed the decision to establish such a human rightsmonitoring mission in Abkhazia  Republic of Georgia  aswell as its objectives  as presented in theSecretary-General’s report of 7 August 1995.I should like to take this opportunity also to conveyour satisfaction with the decision of the Secretary-Generalto appoint a deputy to his Special Envoy  who would beresident in Georgia and would thus provide a continuouspresence at a senior political level.I have another suggestion of a more administrativenature. I know that I am expressing the opinion of anumber of newly independent States in requesting that somemechanism be found to allow the hiring of representativesof these States by organizations and programmes of theUnited Nations system — primarily  the United NationsDevelopment Programme and the United Nations Children’sFund  as well as others. The problem lies in the fact thatmost programmes and organizations have instituted a hiringfreeze  which came into effect before the newlyindependent States became independent. So  in reality  thishiring freeze  as necessary and as useful as it may be fromthe point of view of internal administration  represents forour States a roadblock to the normal representation of itscitizens. We would be very grateful if such a mechanismcould be found.Three years have passed since the Head of State of theRepublic of Georgia  Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze  laid out aset of very sensitive points at the forty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly. The creation of a global monitoringsystem for the early prevention of potential conflicts; theestablishment of special units of Blue Helmets  after theexample of Interpol teams  in order to control and combatthe flow of conventional weapons; and the establishment ofa rapid reaction force were among the proposals. Theproblems that prompted him to make these suggestionshave  unfortunately  grown more acute today and need tobe urgently addressed. We are aware of the manydifficulties in implementing some of these measures  notleast the financial difficulty  but the costs inevitably growastronomically when problems are left to fester.Recently a forum was held in Tbilisi under theauspices of the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization  entitled “Solidarity AgainstIntolerance  For Dialogue Between Cultures”. It was heldin the framework of the Year for Tolerance declared bythe United Nations. The main aim of the forum was tofind ways out of the situation in which the countriesinfected by the virus of intolerance had found themselves.It is symbolic that Georgia  a country known historicallyfor its tolerance  hosted the forum. I am sure thateveryone shares the opinion expressed in Tbilisi  that“we cannot afford to overlook intolerance  sinceindifference and complacency equal complicity”.The contribution of the United Nations to theprocess of maintaining international peace and stability isenormous. And yet numerous open wounds remain in theworld. Conventional wisdom would hold the UnitedNations solely responsible for not being able to closethem. There are  however  deeper reasons for this.At the root of the problem of the United Nationsineffectiveness  we see the current situation in the world.The system of coordinates into which the United Nationswas born 50 years ago has been drastically andprecipitously altered by the rapid disintegration of thebipolar world and the emergence of newinterrelationships  new problems and new threats to worldsecurity  as well as to the security of individual MemberStates. In this situation it is all of us Member States expressing the collective will of the United Nations  thatneed to determine what kind of United Nations we wouldlike to see at the turn of the century and  indeed  in thenext 50 years  and what means we would be prepared toprovide to the United Nations in order for it to beeffective in the new situation.As the representative of one of the many nationscaught up in the vortex of these changes  I am confidentthat I express the opinion of all Georgians when I say thatmy country looks upon the United Nations both withdisappointment  for the failure to contribute meaningfullyto resolving some of our most burning problems  but also22with hope and optimism that the United Nations will finallybring itself into conformity with the changes in the worldand find the resolve and the means to impose its will andinternational law.This hope is based on the fact that the United Nationsis at its half-century mark and regards this not only as atime for celebration and commemoration  but  moreimportantly  as a time for stock-taking and mapping out itsfuture activities  in order to be able to rise to the challengesof the next 50 years and of the twenty-first century."
"59",2608,"GHA",50,1995,"We are very pleased that Mr.Freitas do Amaral is presiding over this important occasion not only because of our confidence in his sterling qualitiesand acknowledged capabilities  but also because of the longhistoric links between Portugal and Ghana — links goingback 500 years. We wish him every success in conductingthe affairs of this fiftieth session of the General Assembly.To his predecessor  my brother and colleague fromCôte d’Ivoire  we say “thank you” for a job well done. Heled us through very complicated and difficult issues  suchas the restructuring and reform of the United Nations particularly the enlargement of the Security Council. Thepatience  equanimity and skill which he displayedthroughout his presidency won the admiration of us all.To Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  we say a special wordof thanks and appreciation for his indefatigable energy  hisremarkable commitment to the independence of the UnitedNations and his steadfast resolve to help carry theOrganization forward on a sounder footing.Fifty years of life  be it of a person or an institution is an appropriate occasion for celebration and we are alllooking forward to the festivities planned for the latter partof this month in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. It must also  however  be anoccasion for a sober assessment of success and progressattained  as well as an in-depth analysis of the shortcomingsexperienced and how best to overcome them.In 1945  51 States  by signing the United NationsCharter and setting up the Organization  ushered in a newera in international affairs. I recall that only four Africancountries were Members of the United Nations at itsinception. Today  the United Nations comprises 185Member States  of which  perhaps  Africa is the continentwith the largest representation.The very fact that the United Nations has grown inthe past 50 years to encompass in its membership almostall sovereign States of the international communityindicates a positive development. This is importantbecause of the growing interdependence of States and thecommon interest of the international community in thesolution of the complex and myriad issues ofcontemporary life.To those who criticize the United Nations and theGeneral Assembly in particular as a mere talking shop  Iwould say that the tradition of discussion and debate  oflistening to and appreciating the views of others is ofgreat value. This is precisely the rationale for setting upthis forum. It is only through such a process that diverseviews can be harmonized and compromises struck. Buteven the sceptic will admit that the United Nations has anappreciable record of humanitarian and socialimprovement throughout the globe  in decolonization andin the settlement of disputes and conflicts.Our hope that the end of the cold war would bringin its train a new era of enduring peace and internationalharmony has been rudely dispelled. Much has indeedchanged but much remains the same. The perennialconflicts of the past are taking new and troublingdimensions with “ethnic cleansing”  genocide and stridentforms of nationalism threatening international tranquillity.This fiftieth anniversary is the appropriate occasion for allStates to ponder carefully how these problems can beeffectively contained. We are encouraged by recent eventsto hope that the ugly conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovinacan and will be solved  and we must pay tribute to theUnited States for this development.We also note with appreciation the recent Israeli-Palestinian accords signed in Washington as anothermilestone in the progress towards genuine peace in theMiddle East. We would  however  urge all parties to showmore flexibility and understanding in ensuring acomprehensive solution to the Middle East problem which  inter alia  would include full self-determination forthe Palestinian people and the restoration of occupiedArab lands.No conflict can be resolved without the willingnessof the parties to be reasonable and ready for compromise.13The Afghans  the Somalis and others stand in danger ofneglect and they must wake up to this reality. The leadersof the warring parties in these countries must appreciate theenormous responsibility on their shoulders not to condemntheir compatriots to senseless slaughter in perpetuity.The developing countries generally find themselves indifficult economic circumstances as a result of anunfavourable international economic climate. The need forconcerted international action to restructure the internationaleconomy in order to meet the challenges of absolutepoverty  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy  among others in the developing countries cannot be overemphasized. Inthis context  we appreciate the limited success of theimportant global conferences of the past year  especiallythat on population and development in Cairo  the WorldSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen and  lastbut not least  the Fourth World Conference on Women inBeijing. The very fact that the international community hasbeen able to improve and agree on a set of guidelines forfuture action in each of these vitally important social areasis in itself a remarkable achievement. We trust that thenecessary political will to implement what has been agreedupon will be exercised by all.Allow me to say a few words about last April’sreview and extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We note with regret that  sosoon after the indefinite extension of the NPT  the veryfears which made some of us question the wisdom of anindefinite extension have been fulfilled by the resumptionof nuclear testing in the Pacific. We had argued that anindefinite extension would leave the nuclear Powers with noreal incentive to make further progress on the arms controlagenda. We must condemn in no uncertain terms the breachof the underlying implications of the consensus reached onthe indefinite extension of the NPT. Let us hope thatlessons will be learned from the almost universalcondemnation of the French tests and that there will bemovement towards a rapid conclusion of a comprehensivetest-ban treaty and action on the other major issues in thearea of disarmament.United Nations peace-keeping continues to assumegreat prominence in the range of United Nations activities.This has been in clear response to urgent needs in variousparts of the world  and we in Ghana continue to try tomake a modest contribution through participation in suchmissions as that in Rwanda. We are pleased to note that alot of thinking is going on about how to improve andstrengthen the United Nations peace-keeping role. We willcontinue to take an active part in these discussions and wehope it will be possible to agree on new arrangementsthat will be to the benefit of us all.Allow me  on this issue  to express my delegation’sprofound regret at the delay of the United Nations inreimbursing troop- contributing countries  such as mine for expenditures incurred in United Nations peace-keepingoperations. We urge that every effort be made to resolvethis matter as speedily as possible. Of course  it will helpgreatly if Member States in arrears in their contributionshonour their obligations and pay up. We urge them to doso without further delay.While on the subject of peace-keeping  may I say afew words about what we in West Africa have tried to doin Liberia. In the spirit of the relevant provisions of theUnited Nations Charter and the Treaty setting up theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  ECOWAS countries took the initiative to setup the cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to stopthe bloodshed in Liberia. Today we are pleased to seethat the Abuja and earlier agreements have made possiblethe restoration of relative peace in that country. Thechallenge now is to see through the implementationprocess. That will require a considerable increase in troopstrength  logistics for ECOMOG and for the encampment disarmament and resettlement of rival forces engaged inthe civil war. International assistance is greatly needed tomeet these objectives. It is hoped that a ready responsewill be forthcoming at the pledging conference envisagedfor later this month.What ECOMOG has done in Liberia is a goodexample of how subregional and regional organizationsshould support the United Nations in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. But the United Nationswill need to overcome doctrinal obstacles and to developprinciples that will facilitate hybrid operations involvingsubregional initiatives and United Nations financing inwhole or in part.On Rwanda  Ghana has again demonstrated thedepth of its commitment to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security by sending troops to thefront line. Our actions speak louder than words. Liberiaand Rwanda are the latest in a long history of Ghanaianparticipation in peace-keeping operations. We willcontinue to make a contribution whenever and whereverwe are called upon to assist. That is why Ghanasponsored the preparation of the Anglo-French glossary ofpeace-keeping terms  which provides precise terminologyfor vital words regularly used in the actual theatre of14operations. Our gratitude goes to the British  French andSenegalese Governments  who all helped make the exercisea success.Africa’s economic problems are too well known forme to recount. Allow me to state that some of us arebeginning to wonder about the seriousness of theinternational community in helping Africa help itself.Conference after conference and seminar after seminar havebeen held in the past few years on this issue. Study afterstudy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the WorldBank and numerous other institutions and distinguishedpersonalities have been published  dissecting everydimension of the continent’s problems.African countries have committed themselvesrepeatedly to carry out far-reaching economic andinstitutional reforms  on the express understanding that theirefforts would be fully complemented by the requisitematerial support of the international community  particularlythe advanced countries.While not down-playing the assistance Africa hasreceived in the past few years  I must register the profounddisappointment of many of us on the continent that theexpected volume of assistance has never been forthcoming.Moreover  the requisite action on the debt and aid fronts which would have completed the picture  has also not beenadequate.This is all the more regrettable because of theprofound political risks that many Governments in Africahave run by faithfully implementing painful structuraladjustment programmes that have had a severe impact ontheir peoples. It is also unfortunate because Africa has seena tremendous upsurge of popular empowerment which hasfound expression in the establishment of constitutional rulein country after country. Let it not appear that theinternational community deliberately wishes to marginalizethe African continent. The problem of poverty of theAfrican continent  if not tackled seriously  could pose gravedangers to international peace and security. Many conflictsin Africa are occasioned by the strains of development andthey could easily take on international dimensions.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  let us seek to fight against the arrogance of powerand the return to the habits of colonialism as exhibited inthe unjustified economic blockade against Cuba and thesanctions imposed on Libya. Such actions  particularlywhen sponsored by the United Nations  will serve toundermine the integrity of this Organization. The collapseof the cold war must make us more vigilant against anyattempt to turn the United Nations into an instrument ofthe foreign policy of any one country or group ofcountries. When that happens  regional and subregionalorganizations will be tempted to question and/or disobeythe decisions of the United Nations. This will be a tragicdevelopment that must be avoided at all costs. That iswhy Ghana  like other members of the OAU  calls uponthe Security Council to lift the sanctions imposedunjustifiably on Libya and seek a peaceful solution to theLockerbie affair and other related matters. We must ofcourse forever maintain an uncompromising resolve tofight mindless terrorism.Let me conclude by reaffirming Ghana’scommitment to the United Nations as the best hope forpeace and international cooperation. Long live the UnitedNations."
"60",2654,"GIN",50,1995,"It is a great pleasure and  indeed  an honour forme  to convey to the General Assembly the fond greetingsof the people of Guinea  its Government and its President General Lansana Conté  at the opening of this session which so fortuitously coincides with the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of our Organization.The President returned to the Chair.I am very pleased to extend to you  Mr. President my warm congratulations on your brilliant election to thepresidency of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. Your election and the outstanding efforts byyour country  Portugal  within this great family of nations are a cause of satisfaction to my delegation. I believe thatwith your experience and your abilities as a greatdiplomat  you will guide our deliberations with greatsuccess.I would join other delegations in paying a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy ofthe sister Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  whose dynamism andgreat qualities as a sophisticated diplomat helped us moveforward as our Organization sought answers to thechallenges facing our world today.Also  I would here extend my Government’sappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the enormous amount of work he hasdone and for the resolve and wisdom that he demonstratesin seeking solutions to all the fundamental issues 16particularly those relating to peace  security  developmentand democracy throughout the world.I should like to congratulate the people of Palau ontheir admission to membership in the United Nations as the185th Member State. The presence of their delegation herewith us confirms once more the universality of ourOrganization.It is clear that the last few years of this century arebeing played out against a background of crisis andconflict  creating an impression of uncertainty as to thefuture of the human race. But we must recognize that theinternational community has made considerable efforts inpreparing global strategies for peace and securitythroughout the world  taking into account the environment sustainable development  the emancipation of women andthe protection of children.Despite these efforts  many parts of the world  sorelytried by poverty and backwardness  do not yet havesufficient food or enough drinking water  education ormedical care. Civil war and natural disaster continue toendanger the economies of those same areas  which arealready afflicted by a widespread world crisis.Entire nations  such as my own  the Republic ofGuinea  pay a heavy price because of their geographicallocation. More than 600 000 refugees and displaced personsfrom Liberia and Sierra Leone are now living in ourcountry. The Republic of Guinea will never abandon itshumanitarian duty to its Liberian and Sierra Leoneanbrothers  and continues to suffer the consequences of afratricidal war which has lasted for six years in one ofthose neighbours and three years in the other.It is true that relative calm  showing a clearer desirefor peace in Liberia  has been noted since the agreementsbetween the factions were signed on 19 August 1995 atAbuja.In the view of my delegation  this new choice of peacein Liberia also requires a clear-cut effort on the part of theinternational community. In this connection  one has toensure better control of weapons flows in the region. TheGovernment of the Republic of Guinea is resolved to takeaction to that end.Clearly  peace in Liberia will help to unblock thecrisis in Sierra Leone and to establish in our subregion ofWest Africa an atmosphere of peace  security and lastingstability  which are all essential to our programme foreconomic integration.My Government also welcomes the LusakaAgreements and we support all the efforts being made toimplement those Agreements with a view to ending thecrisis in Angola. It is our belief that if the political willshown on both sides is sustained  then the people ofAngola will come to know the peace and stability theyhave yearned for so long and will be able to work fornational reconstruction and economic and socialdevelopment.Here we would pay tribute to the joint efforts madeby the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and by the international community forpeace and reconciliation in that brother country.On the question of Somalia  my delegation deploresthe current blockage in the peace process. We would urgeall parties to the conflict to demonstrate wisdom andmutual understanding with a view to finding a peacefulsettlement to the crisis.Turning to Rwanda and Burundi  my delegationbelieves that to encourage major efforts by theinternational community  those involved in those societiesmust triumph over hatred  cultivate a spirit of forgivenessand promote love and dialogue.Today  the conflict in the Middle East is on apositive footing. In this regard  the advent of Palestinianautonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho  continuingnegotiations for extending that autonomy to territories stillunder occupation  the Jordanian-Israeli agreement onborders and the Israeli-Syrian talks on the Golan are allsignificant advances that augur well for a comprehensive just and lasting settlement of the question.United Nations resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir on recognition of the border between Iraq and Kuwait andon the situation in Afghanistan should  we believe  benefitfrom mutual understanding between those involved. Thesame holds true for the question of Western Sahara.In the Korean peninsula  we are pleased to see aneasing of tension. My delegation would encourage theNorth and the South to pursue their efforts towards theindependent and peaceful reunification of their countryinto a confederated republic in keeping with the principleof one State  one nation  two regimes and twoGovernments. Moreover  my Government is pleased that17the talks between the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States of America have led to anegotiated solution of the nuclear issue on the peninsulaand to an improvement in the relations between those twocountries.In the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina the multicultural and ancient civilization  born of thecontributions of diverse peoples throughout the Balkans  isbeing jeopardized by human fury. My delegation believesthat what is happening there  and indeed everywhere should remind the international community of itsresponsibilities for peace and reconciliation among thepeoples and their component groups.All the wars that are ravaging entire regions of theworld today share  along with their countless dead  thephenomenon of an endless flow of displaced personsseeking  over mountains and through valleys  a place ofrefuge. Despite the international community’s spirit ofsolidarity  refugees and displaced persons experience thevery worst deprivations. These days  their problem hasgrown to unprecedented proportions of gravity andcomplexity. Their numbers have increased from year toyear  making it ever more difficult to manage the problemappropriately. In my delegation’s view  the crises thatspawn refugees constitute genuine threats to regionalstability and world peace.Guinea  which is participating in the United Nationssecurity mission in the Rwandese refugee camps in Zaire in keeping with a framework agreement signed with theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  and taking account of its own experience withLiberian and Sierra Leonean refugees  believes that noeffort should be spared to calm extremism everywhere. Thatis why my Government supports all initiatives to strengthenthe intervention capacities of the High Commissioner forRefugees. Guinea also supports the drafting of an agendafor humanitarian action along the lines of “An Agenda forPeace” and “An Agenda for Development”.Despite the end of the East-West conflict  nuclearweapons remain the greatest threat to international peaceand security  in spite of the remarkable progress made inbilateral and multilateral disarmament negotiations. Manydangers still threaten our efforts to achieve a collectivesecurity that would include the related issues ofdevelopment  environment and human rights.In certain key areas  there is an evident and growingtrend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionablematerials in conflicts  as well as the hidden or overtdesire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons.These facts represent dangers that increase theresponsibilities of the United Nations  which is calledupon to take rigorous verification measures.That is why the Republic of Guinea welcomes thepositive outcome of the New York Conference which ledto the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This wasundeniably an important step towards nucleardisarmament and confirmed the special responsibility ofthe nuclear Powers. However  if it is to be effective  thisachievement must be complemented by the immediateconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. Allnuclear tests must be prohibited.It is obvious that this quick overview of the majorconcerns of our age — those relating to internationalsecurity — amply demonstrate the importance today ofUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. My Governmenttherefore welcomes the special attention given by theUnited Nations to the settlement of conflicts in the world.We support the relevant views expressed by theSecretary-General in his Agenda for Peace.None the less  while welcoming United Nationsinvolvement in various theatres of operation throughoutthe world  we must also recognize that over the past fewyears the peace-keeping operations have  for the mostpart  yielded somewhat meagre results. This requirestoday  in the light of our experience  a reformulation ofthe entire issue of such operations.If they are to be effective  peacemaking and peace-keeping operations must be the subject of broaderagreement and dialogue among all the States Members ofthe United Nations  without discrimination. It is in thatcontext that Guinea welcomes the establishment and workof the mechanism of the Organization of African Unityfor the prevention  management and settlement ofconflicts in Africa. We urge the United Nations and theinternational community to give it all the necessaryassistance.Economic and social development is a prerequisiteof lasting peace and security. In developing countries particularly in Africa  a sense of insecurity arises out ofuncertainty in the future. It can thus be easily understoodwhy we often see a collapse of political and socialbalances  leading to civil disorder and ethnic and religiousconflicts.18Despite United Nations efforts in the economic andsocial field  the results remain meagre in some regions ofthe world  particularly Africa  which is still deeply affectedby inequality  poverty and other serious problems that oftenweaken the social fabric and undermine the foundations ofour States.Recent trends in the world economy have helped toworsen this already precarious situation. Thus  the debtburden remains the main obstacle to development in poorcountries  forcing them to devote a major share of theirscarce resources to it. The collapse of the prices ofcommodities  which are their main contribution to the worldmarket  has added to their poverty.On top of these harsh conditions come the effects ofthe implementation  by some of our States  of structuraladjustment programmes that are sometimes poorly preparedand often poorly implemented. If all of these variousreforms undertaken by our countries are to bear fruit  all ofthe partners  national and foreign alike  will have to supportAfrica’s development efforts in an effective way. If theyare to be mutually beneficial  the proceeds of all public andprivate assistance will simply have to take account ofeveryone’s respective requirements for well-being.Within the framework of the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  Guinea welcomesthe Marrakesh Agreements that gave rise to the WorldTrade Organization. Those Agreements will be viable however  only if they take genuine account of the need topromote the integration of the African economy into theworld economy by developing its capacities and making itmore dynamic. In this connection we strongly support theidea of setting up a commodities diversification fund.My delegation greatly appreciates the special attentiongiven to Africa at the summer session of the Economic andSocial Council in Geneva  which considered the conditionsfor implementation of the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s.Bilateral initiatives must be supported in order tostrengthen South-South cooperation on the one hand and tocontinue the North-South dialogue on the other hand.Moreover the Agenda for Development must focusprimarily on Africa  where much of the population lives inpoverty. Implementation of that Agenda  complementing theAgenda for Peace  will make it possible once again tomeasure the new political will that has emerged at recentinternational conferences on social development population and development  and women.The Secretary-General’s Agenda for Developmentoffers an appropriate framework for North-South dialogueand it must also enable the United Nations to providebetter coordination for  and to make more operational  thepolicies and programmes implemented by its specializedagencies and institutions  which have had a very limitedpositive impact on the economies of developing countriesso far.In this connection my Government notes with realinterest and much hope that the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations will be organizing aworld summit on food security in November 1996. Thatworld-wide meeting will make it possible we believe toformulate specific and appropriate solutions to the seriouseconomic problems facing developing countries.Of course  all these hopes will be in vain if theStates of the world are unable to crush drug-traffickingand abuse.While reconfirming our support for Agenda 21 andall the agreements on sustainable development  we believethat it is only greater political will that will make itpossible to translate into action the decisions that emergefrom these various meetings.At the Halifax Summit  held from 15 to 17 June last the Group of Seven quite rightly recognized thatsustainable development was one of the major challengesof the twenty-first century. At that meeting it was alsosaid that better quality of life for all was the objective ofsustainable development  the foundations of which aredemocracy  human rights  transparent and responsiblemanagement of public affairs  investment in the humanindividual and protection of the environment. Guineawelcomes the commitments entered into by the Group ofSeven to support national efforts in this area.Protecting fundamental human rights  meeting humanneeds  achieving social justice and human developmentare still the focus of concern of the Government ofGuinea in its ambitious economic and social reformprogramme  which has been under way since 1984.Guinea is party to several international conventionsrelating to human rights because it is firmly committed topromoting and protecting these fundamental rights andfreedoms.19Today I am happy to be able to tell the internationalcommunity that my country completed instituting itsdemocratic republican institutions in June this year whenwe organized our multiparty legislative and municipalelections.The successful completion of this process ofdemocratization  the establishment of a State of law  andthe liberalization of the economy in the Republic of Guineaall benefited from the support and understanding of theinternational community as a whole and I should like tothank you all for this.The United Nations and its specialized agencies  as theparamount instrument for cooperation and multilateralagreement  see their responsibilities increased today morethan ever before. Today this universal Organization hascertainly acquired a certain prestige. Its help is requested inevery area.To strengthen its effectiveness on this fiftiethanniversary of its founding  the United Nations mustrestructure and revitalize its principal organs in the light ofthe changes that have taken place in the international arenaand taking account of the challenges facing mankind in theforthcoming millennium.The reforms must be based on the principle of equalityamong Member States at the level of decision-makingbodies and also within the various organs.It is only in this way that our common heritage  thisirreplaceable tool  this United Nations  will be ablesuccessfully to discharge its mission of preservinginternational peace and security and promoting a fairerworld  more equitable and more prosperous world.The success of this institution does depend of courseon an improvement in its financial situation at a time whenits responsibilities are constantly increasing in this ever-changing international situation.The United Nations has existed for half a century now.The solemn celebration of its first 50 years coincides withthe twilight of the twentieth century and it offers its 185Members an opportunity to try to revitalize its activities andto agree on equitable representation within its principalorgans. In Guinea commemoration of this historic event istaking place with the full support of our Government.May the decades to come bring greaterunderstanding among people and among nations so as toensure the greater happiness of mankind."
"61",2693,"GMB",50,1995," Let me begin by congratulatingyou  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. Our confidence inyour stewardship is further strengthened by yourdistinguished career at home and  indeed  yourunderstanding of international affairs. I should therefore liketo assure you of my delegation’s full support andcooperation as you carry out your important mandate.I should also like to pay tribute to your illustriouspredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  for a job welldone. Indeed  he has honoured his country and  byextension  the entire African continent by succeeding ingiving the presidency of the General Assembly a newimage.As for the Secretary-General of the Organization Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  we can hardly thank himenough for his work  including the excellent arrangementsmade for this session  which takes on particular importancethis year. The Secretary-General deserves commendation forall his commitment to development  social justice andinternational peace and security — objectives on the basisof which this Organization was founded.Having said that  I should like to take this opportunityto welcome the one-hundred-eighty-fifth Member of theUnited Nations. Palau’s recent admission is a true reflectionof the universality of the Organization.It is regrettable  though  that it has not been possibleto discuss the readmission of the Republic of China onTaiwan on the basis of the same principle. Considering itspopulation of 21 million and the fact that it is one of theworld’s leading economies  my delegation sincerelybelieves that the Republic of China on Taiwan  readmittedas a full Member  would make significant contributions tothe work of the United Nations. It is hoped that such amove would also facilitate the process of reunification.About the same time last year we informed thisAssembly of the establishment of an Armed ForcesProvisional Ruling Council and a new Government in theGambia  under the chairmanship of His ExcellencyCaptain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  following the militarytakeover on 22 July 1994. The factors that compelled theArmy to take over the reins of power have already beenexplained in sufficient detail. Prominent among thereasons was rampant corruption.In this regard  let me inform the Assembly that thevarious commissions of inquiry established to probe theactivities of the former regime have so far made shockingrevelations about the degree of corruption andmismanagement that was the order of the day in theGambia during the last 30 years. The most devastatingrevelation of all has been made by the Crude OilCommission  which uncovered the embezzlement ofmillions of dollars meant to finance development projectsin the country.Equally breathtaking are the findings of theCommission concerning Government Departments andline Ministries. The work of the Public Assets andProperties Recovery Commission  also chaired by aSuperior Court Judge  is progressing steadily. Here againwhat has been unfolding leaves no reasonable doubt thatthere was widespread abuse of public office under theprevious regime.Meanwhile  the Commission of Inquiry into LandAdministration is currently examining the evidence that ithas been gathering since its creation  and it will submit itsreport soon. By all accounts  the findings so far of theCommission of Inquiry into the Financial Activities ofPublic Corporations are also earth-moving.Strenuous efforts are being made to recovereverything stolen. But the important thing is the lessondrawn from all these Commissions  which  basically  isthat public office is essentially for the service of one’scountry  and not to be used as a vehicle for self-enrichment. Even members of the general public are nowmore responsive to their tax obligations  as evidenced bythe record tax collections since the setting up of theCommissions to which I have referred. More important 11General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995the principles of accountability  transparency and probity inpublic life are gradually taking root in Gambian society.All these facts speak for themselves  and we nowunderstand why the Gambia is poorer today than it was atthe time of independence. The country’s meagre resources which should have been utilized for development purposes were grossly mismanaged — to say the least. This is whynot a single hospital or high school had been built after 30years of independence. It was deliberate policy to keep ourpeople ignorant and  therefore  no serious attempt was madeto build a television station or  at least  to improve thenational radio station so that it could be heard all over thecountry.Can this  in all honesty  be called democracy? And  toperpetuate themselves in power  the authorities of theformer regime brought in truck-loads of foreigners to votefor them during elections. In the absence of an independentelectoral commission it was easy for them to indulge insuch malpractice.The Armed Forces Provisional Ruling CouncilGovernment has since adopted a Programme ofRectification and Timetable for Transition to DemocraticConstitutional Rule by July 1996. Mindful  however  of thefact that democracy and development are inextricablylinked  we have also drawn up a development agendafocusing mainly on the social sectors. The two programmes contained in one document  were formally submitted to ourtraditional partners-in-development for assistance. To ourgreat surprise  however  and despite all the hullabaloo overthe need to speed up the democratization process  very littleor no assistance at all was forthcoming to complement ournational efforts.Despite the fact that the Timetable was reduced fromfour years to two years after nationwide consultation  theEuropean Union and its allies still maintain sanctionsagainst the Government. None of the efforts made toimplement the various activities in the transitionProgramme have been acknowledged by them. I amreferring to the Constitutional Review Commission  theCivic Education Programme  and the Electoral Law ReviewCommittee. Our traditional partners in development allreneged on their promises. This unfounded scepticism hasnot deterred us from forging ahead with our plans to builda new society. That is why we have decided to finance theoperations of some of these activities to demonstrate ourcommitment to the transition Programme.As a serious-minded Government we cannot abdicateour responsibility  or our duty  towards our people. It isfor that reason that two high schools and three juniorsecondary schools are being built. They should be readywithin the next few weeks.Plans are also well under way to build at least athird referral hospital. In addition to the building ofschools our national education policy is currently underreview with the aim of making education more accessibleto all  notably to girls  and tailored to suit our nationaldevelopment objectives. Recently  too  we have embarkedon the building of a university. All these efforts clearlydemonstrate once more the importance attached to thedevelopment of human resources. This  we are convinced will rescue our people from the darkness of ignorance illiteracy and deprivation.In the area of infrastructural development  not onlyare roads being built  but His Excellency the Chairman ofthe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council and Headof State recently laid the foundation-stone for the newBanjul International Airport complex. In fact  work hascommenced on this project  which is on a turn-key basis.As agriculture is the backbone of the economy  theArmed Forces Provisional Ruling Council Government isgiving this sector all the attention that it deserves. That isin line with our thinking that a nation that cannot feeditself can hardly be called independent. A hungry nationcannot concentrate on nation-building. Besides  food isused as a weapon.It is said that the youth of today are the futureleaders of tomorrow. Guided by this adage and theprinciple of good citizenry  the Armed Forces ProvisionalRuling Council has introduced a National Youth ServiceScheme  the basic purpose of which is to inculcatediscipline and to reorient the thinking of Gambian youthtowards nation-building while harnessing their potentialfor future adult life. The first group of volunteers will besworn in in the new year.It may be said without fear of contradiction thatGambians have now become more aware of their rightsand duties and that for the first time in many years theyface the future with renewed hope and confidence. Onthat fateful Friday of 22 July 1994  His Excellency theChairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling12General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995Council  Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  woke a nationthat had been slumbering for 30 years with a new vision totransform the Gambia into a highly developed modelcountry. In this way the Government will have bequeathedto the present and future generations a legacy worthy of allthe sacrifices that are being made today.History teaches us that once in a while at some pointin a country’s history a visionary leader will emerge witha mission to transform that society for the better. We in theGambia are fortunate that in the hour of need  HisExcellency Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  a soldier witha difference  took centre stage  and now provides thequality of leadership commensurate with the challenges ofthe times. Since the advent of the Armed Forces ProvisionalRuling Council to power under Chairman Jammeh’sguidance we have learned within a short period of timewhat effective leadership means  and have come to theconclusion that there is no gainsaying that a leadership withvision always has the nation’s interests at heart.Similarly  at the international level when the world’sleadership is characterized by statesmen with a vision  thecollective interests of mankind always have primacy overother considerations emanating from narrow-mindednationalism. As great minds think alike  and as a bitterlesson had been learned from two world wars  the need wasfelt to create the United Nations. It is interesting to notethat in the Preamble to the Charter we do not find the usualphrases that appear in other international legal instruments such as “We the contracting parties” but instead we havethe words“We the peoples of the United Nations”.The concept of international solidarity and the unity of thehuman race immediately come into play with the expresseddetermination not only“to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar”but also“to employ international machinery for the promotionof the economic and social advancement of allpeoples”.It is in this spirit that my delegation views the WorldSummit for Social Development held in Copenhagen lastMarch as a significant turning-point in the internationalcommunity’s persistent efforts to improve the quality of lifeof peoples all over the world. The Summit  including thenon-governmental organizations forum  facilitated abroader exchange of views by the internationalcommunity on social development issues  with emphasison poverty alleviation  the generation of employment  andhealth care.The adoption of the Copenhagen Declaration onSocial Development and Programme of Action conveysour collective concern over the world’s social ills andindeed the commitment to a concerted effort to findviable solutions to these problems.Of particular relevance to my delegation are thecommitments made by the said forum concerning thesocio-economic development of Africa  and of the least-developed countries in particular  and the provision of thenecessary financial and other resources. Thesecommitments should serve as the basis for Africa’ssustained economic and social development.The political will and resources necessary for theeffective implementation of the Programme of Action ofthe World Summit for Social Development should bedemonstrated not only in the full application of the 20/20initiative but also the channelling of substantialtechnological  scientific and other resources aimed atachieving our objectives.The Fourth World Conference on Women held inBeijing  which has just ended  highlighted gender equalityand gender needs  including the participation of womenin the economic and political decision-making process  theelimination of all forms of discrimination and violenceagainst women  adequate recognition and support of thecontribution of women to the management of naturalresources and the safeguarding of the environment.Indeed  as ably stated by the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations:“The empowerment of women is the empowermentof all humanity!” (Press Release SG/SM/5732)The Platform for Action  which focuses on the roleof women in development  should provide importantguidelines for realizing the goals that we have set. In theGambia  women have been playing an indispensable rolein national development. Today 4 out of 14 Ministers arewomen  responsible for important sectors such as healthand social welfare  education  youth and sports  andtourism and culture. Our participation in the WorldConference with our First Lady as Head of Delegation13General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995was inspired by the Government’s commitment to women’sissues  including gender equality and the encouragement ofwomen to participate in national development.It goes without saying that women and childrenconstitute the most vulnerable group in society  and we willnot be doing justice to our children if we do not renew thecommitments made during the World Summit for Childrenand acknowledge the preponderant role played by theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in mapping outstrategies for the greater welfare of children all over theworld. We in the Gambia have made considerable progressin the implementation of the mid-term decade goals notably in the area of the Expanded Programme onImmunization.At this juncture  my delegation would like to paytribute to the memory of the late James P. Grant  theformer Executive Director of UNICEF  for his outstandingperformance in increasing international public awareness ofthe plight of children and his total dedication to the causeof children the world over. It is our fervent hope that thenew Executive Director will build on the achievements ofher predecessor.An issue related to the question of women andchildren is population and development. It will be recalledthat at the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  held in Cairo in September 1994  far-reaching decisions were taken  as outlined in theProgramme of Action that was adopted. What is importanthere is that what should be done at the national level shouldbe complemented by a concerted international effort  asagreed in Cairo.The interrelationship between population and theenvironment cannot be overemphasized. In fact  in theProgramme of Action adopted at the InternationalConference on Population and Development  it is stated that“Pressure on the environment may result fromrapid population growth  distribution and migration especially in ecologically vulnerable ecosystems.Urbanization and policies that do not recognize theneed for rural development also create environmentalproblems.” (A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1  annex  chapter III section C  para. 3.26)In this regard  it is gratifying to note that following theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992  it hasbeen possible  under Agenda 21  to successfully concludethe Convention to Combat Desertification in thoseCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification  Particularly in Africa.In the same vein  we are mindful of the needs of ourpeoples for better living standards and improvement ofthe rural and urban environment through the provision ofadequate shelter and sustainable human settlements. Mydelegation therefore anxiously looks forward to theSecond United Nations Conference on Human Settlements(Habitat II)  to be held in Istanbul  Turkey  in June nextyear.All these world conferences on various issues ofconcern to the international community should be seen asour collective endeavour to give concrete expression tothe pledge enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations“to promote social progress and better standards oflife in larger freedom”.In pursuit of these objectives  we should also bestrengthened in our resolve  as also stated in the Charter “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  inthe dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand small”.This leads me to recall the World Conference onHuman Rights  held in Vienna a few years ago. We in theGambia have always maintained that human rights shouldnot be viewed only from the narrow perspective of civiland political rights  but also from the perspective of theright to development. In the Gambia  over the last 30years  we have had the experience of elections being heldat regular intervals  but we all know that it was only afacade.There is no point in overemphasizing civil andpolitical rights in a developing country at the expense ofmore pressing needs in other areas  such as health education and agriculture. Before people can think ofcasting a vote they first of all want to make sure that theyhave enough food to eat  can send their children to schooland have access to health care. In any case  let there beno illusion about this  for democracy cannot flourishunder conditions of abject poverty.The greatest threat to international peace andsecurity today is the ever widening gap between rich andpoor. And since we live in a world of interdependence 14General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995the North-South dialogue that has been dormant for so longneeds to be revived urgently to put the emphasis on theeconomic development of third world countries.It is true that the world economic situation hasregistered notable improvements in the economies both ofindustrialized and of some developing countries. It is to benoted  however  that the various growth rates in differentdeveloping countries reflect their limitations and lack ofadequate incentives and resources.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round is expected togenerate an increase in merchandise trade of 12 per cent bythe year 2005. As far as developing countries areconcerned  however  any benefits to be derived from thisagreement would depend largely on their accessibility tomarkets through the removal  of course  of tariff as well asnon-tariff barriers.It is feared  though  that in the case of sub-SaharanAfrica any gains from the Uruguay Round will be seriouslylimited by the low proportion of manufactured goods in itsexports. The case is even more serious for least developedcountries.The Economic and Social Council’s high-level meetingon the development of Africa within the context of thereview of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the l990s  held from 4 to 6 July1995 in Geneva  was indeed very timely. None the less  themapping out of all these strategies for development willhave little meaning unless they are matched by thenecessary resources to achieve the desired results  especiallywhen the resources generated through structural adjustmentare paradoxically diverted to service our debts. And weknow that it is indeed an excruciating burden.All these issues have been adequately addressed in theUnited Nations Agenda for Development. In the Agenda forPeace  however  there is still the need for greater efforts tofind solutions to the various protracted conflicts around theworld. There have been a lot of criticisms and reservationspertaining to peace-keeping operations — notably withregard to the huge costs involved — but peace is priceless.What has happened to the peace dividend  anyway which was talked about so much during previous sessionsof the General Assembly? The head of the Australiandelegation made some interesting proposals regarding thefinancing of peace-keeping operations. There is a lot ofsense and merit to what he said  and we should be doingjustice to ourselves if these proposals were consideredseriously. We must never relent in our collectiveendeavour to find lasting solutions to all the conflictsbesetting the international community  whether inSomalia  Rwanda  Burundi or Afghanistan  to name afew.In our subregion  we welcome the signing of thePeace Agreement by all the warring factions in theLiberian civil war and the establishment of Council ofState to oversee the transition to a democratic  freelyelected civilian Government. It is our fervent hope thatthe cease-fire will hold so that the people of Liberia willonce again live in the environment of peace and stabilitythat has been denied them for so long. Let me take thisopportunity to commend the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) for its timely initiativeand persistent endeavour to finally put together thisimportant peace package. This clearly demonstrates thatregional arrangements  as stipulated in Chapter VIII of theCharter of the United Nations  could play a preponderantrole in conflict resolution.We have been following with great attention theprogress made in the Middle East peace process  and mydelegation would like to take this opportunity tocongratulate both Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) on these achievements and toencourage them to maintain the same commitment in thequest for a just and lasting peace.With regard to the situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina  my delegation notes with cautious optimismthe recent peace deal between the parties concerned. Itwould not have been possible  however to bring the Serbaggressors to the negotiating table without the limited useof force against them.The situation in Jammu and Kashmir has also beenof concern to my delegation. We therefore urge all theparties to the conflict to try to resolve this long-runningdispute through dialogue.We in the Gambia have always maintained that wewill never condone the use of force by a bigger Power toimpose its will on a smaller country. I am referring to thelingering problems resulting from the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait  such as the question of prisoners of war  paymentof reparations and  indeed  the return to Kuwait of allproperties taken away during the invasion. In short  Iraqshould comply with all Security Council resolutions.15General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995Meanwhile  though  ways and means should be found toease the suffering of the innocent Iraqi civilian populations.Fifty years is a relatively short period in the life of aninternational organization such as the United Nations  butit has been a period full of important and eventful activities with successes and setbacks.For 50 years now the United Nations has beenworking for global development and the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Its Charter has become thelegal and moral foundation of international relations.Through the United Nations we have witnessed theproclamation of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  the enactment of the Convention on the Law of theSea  the holding of global conferences on the environment development  population  children  women  and soon  onhuman settlements.The United Nations should be commended primarilyfor the broader role it played during the cold-war periodand for championing the concerns and interests ofdeveloping countries. It has always provided a platformwhere big and small nations meet and discuss issues ofcommon concern.At this juncture  when we are celebrating the goldenjubilee of the United Nations  my delegation believes thatthe time could not be more propitious to lift the economicblockade against Cuba. This dynamic island nation hasmade remarkable progress in the area of medicine andgenetic engineering  achievements that Cuba would sharewith the rest of the international community.As a small developing country confronted with uniquechallenges  the Gambia is keen to ensure that the ongoingreforms aimed at restructuring and revitalizing the UnitedNations remain on course. The strengthening of the role ofthe General Assembly and the office of its President as wellas the improvement in the performance of the Secretariatshould be commended. Any reform of the United Nationssystem should emphasize the need for more coordinationbetween agencies and the development of new proceduresfor the accelerated implementation of programmes andactivities.The challenges facing the United Nations today willcontinue well into the twenty-first century. In thisconnection it is imperative to restructure the composition ofthe Security Council as soon as possible to reflect therealities of today and in that restructuring Africa’s interestmust be taken into account. In other words  Africa mustbe represented permanently on the Security Council.Let me conclude by renewing the Gambia’scommitment to the ideals of the United Nations. TheOrganization is far from being perfect  but  at the sametime  we do recognize that it is indispensable  for it is therepository of the hopes and aspirations of mankind."
"62",2733,"GNB",50,1995," On behalf of my country and myGovernment  Sir  may I first of all extend warmestcongratulations to you on your election to the presidency ofthis session of the General Assembly  which coincideswith the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations. Your assumption of the presidency of thissession is a crowning event in a long and brilliantpolitical and diplomatic career  and will undoubtedlyensure the success of our deliberations. It is all the moregratifying for us to emphasize this fact  since we sharewith your country  Portugal  a historic past of deeplyrooted links of culture and cooperation  which today uniteour peoples and our countries.We also extend our congratulations to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire  a countrywith which we have excellent relations of friendship andcooperation  on the brilliant way in which he guided theproceedings of the forty-ninth session.We also want to take this opportunity to express tothe Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  our appreciation for the dynamic way inwhich he is leading our Organization.As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization  and one year after the holding of the firstmultiparty elections in Guinea-Bissau  I feel particularlyhonoured to have the privilege of representing my countryat this historic session of the General Assembly. Thisevent offers the international community a specialoccasion and an appropriate framework for reaffirmingour full adherence to the principles of the United NationsCharter. A half century after its creation  the UnitedNations must  more than ever before  be able to confrontnew challenges.Guinea-Bissau is of the opinion that in order to bestrespond to the needs of the day  our Organization mustundertake urgent and appropriate reforms. I am convincedthat the political and socio-economic changes taking placeon the international scene have repercussions for thefunctioning of our Organization. It is our profoundconviction that the end of the bipolarization ofinternational relations and the cold war promises betterconditions for the future of our Organization.The broad prospects opening up for the process ofthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in many parts of theworld are not just a matter of circumstance  but are ratherthe expression of the international community’sunequivocal will to establish lasting peace.24It is in this context that we note with satisfaction thatafter so many efforts made by the international community the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) inparticular  significant progress has been made in Liberia.As far as Angola is concerned  we welcome the wayin which the negotiation process and the implementation ofthe agreements signed in Lusaka have developed. Wecongratulate the people and leaders of the fraternal countryof Mozambique for the exemplary way in which the firstmultiparty elections took place there.The situation in Somalia continues to be of seriousconcern to Guinea-Bissau. We urge the parties concernedto put an end to hostilities  and to continue negotiationswith a view to achieving national reconciliation.In the Middle East  the peace process deserves thesupport of the international community. We thus welcomewith satisfaction the progress achieved.As regards Jammu and Kashmir  my country urges theparties to the conflict to find a just and lasting solution.My country continues to support the initiativesregarding negotiations in East Timor  under the auspices ofthe Secretary-General of the United Nations  with a view toa just solution.In connection with the question of the embargoaffecting Cuba  which has an impact on the population ofthat country  Guinea-Bissau encourages dialogue betweenthe parties concerned with a view to a definitive andsatisfactory solution.In the former Yugoslavia  where the internationalcommunity has been witness to acts of inhumanity  we canat last welcome with optimism the progress achieved in thecourse of negotiations.As the international community celebrates the fiftiethanniversary of the establishment of our universalOrganization  may I  on behalf of my Government  reiterateour firm conviction that the Republic of China on Taiwanshould form part of the United Nations on the basis of theapplication of the principle of the parallel representation ofdivided countries. In this context  it would be desirable forthe two countries to participate simultaneously ininternational activities  with a view to promotingconstructive contacts and negotiations. Respect for and theexercise of human rights and pluralist democracy arefactors in producing national unity and peace  and inpreserving international stability. Guinea-Bissau continuesto endeavour to defend and safeguard this concept  whoseconstant application is vital to development.Guinea-Bissau continues to work to improve themanagement of its economy. The proper implementationof a structural adjustment programme reflects the constantconcerns of my Government. I am convinced that in spiteof our own efforts of macroeconomic management toimprove the well-being of our populations  my countryneeds the support of the international community  with aview to confronting the many development challenges weface. The poverty and social injustice suffered by most ofmankind constitute root causes of the conflict  threateningthe peace and stability of the world; the ideologicaltensions of the cold war could  indeed  be replaced byother crises  especially crises of an economic andfinancial origin  if urgent measures are not immediatelytaken.The threat to the environment is a reality which mustbe urgently combated. The protection of the ecosystemrequires continued support for the development process ofthe poorest countries. It is for this reason that we believethat underdevelopment poses a serious threat to theenvironment of the African continent. The countriesmembers of the Permanent Inter-State Committee onDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) are facing graveproblems of draught and other natural disasters that couldseriously compromise their social and economicdevelopment.More than ever before  international cooperation isbecoming imperative for world peace and for theprotection and strengthening of human dignity in order toensure full enjoyment of the rights and aspirations ofpresent and future generations. The social developmentactivities of the United Nations should focus in particularon the most vulnerable groups  such as women  children young people  the aged and the disabled.Guinea-Bissau  which is loyal to the principles of theCharter  reaffirms its determination to contribute to themaintenance of international peace and security andsolemnly reiterates its firm resolve to persevere in thatdirection. In this context  we welcome with pleasure theresults of the World Summit for Social Development andof the Fourth World Conference on Women.Guinea-Bissau’s contribution to the attainment of thepurposes and principles of our Organization is well25known. Our participation in different peace-keepingoperations around the world is the clearest illustration ofthis. We are convinced that the maintenance of internationalpeace and security is the collective responsibility of allMemberStates  large and small  in accordance with the principleof the sovereign equality of States. In this context  mycountry  Guinea-Bissau  submitted its candidature for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council  which hasbeen endorsed by the African Group. In this regard  Irequest the support of all Member States."
"63",2772,"GNQ",50,1995,"I take great pleasure today inaddressing this distinguished world audience on behalf ofthe delegation of Equatorial Guinea in the context of thefiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Iwish first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Freitasdo Amaral of Portugal on his election to preside over ourwork. I wish him every success in the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. He can always relyon the cooperation and solidarity of my delegation.This fiftieth session of the Assembly is taking place ata time when we are seeing a radical change of course — aneeded one  in our opinion — in the life of the UnitedNations in today’s world.In its first half-century  as a speaker has already saidin this Hall  the United Nations has been a child of its time the time of the aftermath of the Second World War. Itcame into being to work for peace  world security anddevelopment. Now we must determine whether theseobjectives have been achieved. Peace meant avoiding warand military conflict. Global security meant preventing theescalation of conflicts. Development meant mobilizing thefinancial resources required for the reconstruction of theworld and to redress its underdevelopment.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations we are bound to acknowledge that although theOrganization has achieved certain successes in the area ofpreventing disputes among nations and has taken measuresand initiatives to promote the resolution of certain conflicts peace  security and development are not yet permanentfeatures of daily life in our earthly home.The fall of the East-West ideological barriersartificially imposed by the cold war aroused expectationsof an age of peace in the world. The spread of democracyand the new world-wide awareness of the importance ofrespect for human rights further heightened theseexpectations at the beginning of this decade.In this context my country  the Republic ofEquatorial Guinea  has striven to achieve these objectivesof peace  security and development.Following the ousting of the dictatorship and theone-party system  our Government  as early as 1979 adopted a consistent and comprehensive strategy whichwas a reflection of a national consensus in favour of amodel of society for the future of our nation that wouldbe based on peace  democracy and development. In thiscontext we have undertaken a series of political reformsfully supported by all forces and currents of opinion inour society.Since 1992 the Government  following the lead ofHis Excellency  Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  Presidentof the Republic and Head of State of Equatorial Guinea has been responsive to the people’s aspirations tofreedom  democracy and participation in the managementof public affairs. With a population of only 420 000 thecountry has 14 legal political movements. Thisprogramme was established and has been satisfactorilyimplemented since 1993  with municipal elections havingbeen held on 17 September 1995. The Constitution andthe electoral timetable that has been established providefor the holding of presidential elections in the comingyear  1996.However  despite these endeavours and despite myGovernment’s resolve to secure fundamental freedoms forour people on a firm foundation  foreign interests  fortheir own unavowed purposes  want to see the democraticprocess in my country shaped as the saying is “in theimage and likeness” of those alien interests.Since the beginning of the political transition thetreatment meted out to Equatorial Guinea by certainStates Members of the Organization has been utterlydifferent from that granted to other countries in CentralAfrica and in the rest of the continent  whose politicalevolution has been similar to our own  involving in somecases tragic consequences; that leads us to suspect that the23disinformation and defamation campaign wagedinternationally against the Government of Equatorial Guineais the manifestation of hegemonistic ambitions and strugglesfor influence that threaten not only the peace and socialharmony that prevail in the country but also its territorialintegrity.We do not understand how Equatorial Guinea’sdemocratization process differs from what is going on inother countries in our area. We have said yes to pluralism democracy and participation. We have said yes to humanrights  and we practise respect for human rights. We do notunderstand why different types of measures are applied tomy country. We regret that instead of receiving moralsupport and solidarity to help us consolidate ourachievements  we are subjected to economic blockades andthe unilateral suspension of cooperative programmes agreedby convention. Instead of receiving understanding for whatcould be the result of deficiencies of structure or ofdemocratic culture in the society of Equatorial Guinea as awhole  we are subjected to reproach  intimidation  threatsand a humiliating and intolerable interference in ourcountry’s internal affairs.We do not believe that a tragic breakdown of socialand economic structures  such as has taken place in thebrotherly countries of Liberia  Rwanda  Angola  Somaliaand other countries and regions of the African continent represents the best form of cooperation with and assistanceto African peoples.I wish to declare before this forum of the internationalcommunity that outside influences are engineering andinstigating an internal conflict in my country that wouldhave unforeseeable consequences.Indeed  some political circles and communicationsmedia are waging a campaign from Spain  the old colonialPower  to intensify the differences between the people ofEquatorial Guinea  supporting some and harassing others thus provoking divisions and antagonisms. Even graver isthe support offered to the Self-determination Movement ofthe Island of Bioko  a secessionist group. In addition  astation of Radio Exterior de España has been created andaimed expressly at Equatorial Guinea to carry out apoisonous disinformation campaign deliberately intended todistort the socio-political reality of the country. Thebroadcasts of Radio Exterior de España are the mostdisruptive element in the country’s democratization processand constitute a Petri dish that spawns acts of violence andthe destabilization of Equatorial Guinea’s social structures.We wish to apprise the international community ofthis matter  and we ask it to request the SpanishGovernment to put an end to this aggression perpetratedfrom its territory by the public entity Radio Exterior deEspaña and by certain political circles. Under the pretextof supporting the democratic process under way in ourcountry  those political circles  consisting ofParliamentarians  party and labour leaders  associationsand pressure groups  clandestinely support  coordinate andfinance secessionist movements and political partiesstanding in radical opposition to the legitimateGovernment of Equatorial Guinea. This overt interferenceis intended to bring about violent political changes in mycountry.Clear evidence of this interference can be seen in thecurrent disinformation and discreditation campaign beingwaged from Spain by those political circles andcommunications media following the municipal electionsheld in my country on 17 September last. Those circlesplanned and illegally financed the electoral campaign ofthe radical opposition  banded together in the JointOpposition Platform (POC). They have created confusionby trying to manipulate the electoral results.Those same Spanish political circles are today tryingto manipulate international public opinion by falselyaccusing the Government of electoral fraud and violationsof human rights. The recent report of the United NationsSpecial Rapporteur  Mr. Alejandro Artucio  suffices togive the lie to these accusations. My Governmentcomplies with the programme and recommendations ofthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights.One cannot credibly claim to be supporting politicalreform in my country by stirring up antagonism anddisputes between the political sectors of my country. Onecannot credibly claim to be helping the people ofEquatorial Guinea by suspending cooperation in theeducational  health and agricultural sectors. One cannotcredibly claim to be helping the people of EquatorialGuinea by inciting the donor community to block projectsof proven social effectiveness. We sincerely believe thatone cannot help any people by depriving it of theresources and opportunities to improve its livingconditions.My country lives in peace and order. We just needa friendly  sincere and respectful helping hand. We aretold that there can be no development without democracy and we agree. But our experience  which we believe hasbeen shared by other developing countries  is that24democracy amid poverty and underdevelopment is a pipedream. Poverty and underdevelopment breed violence andsocial and political instability.We therefore sincerely seek international relationscharacterized by mutual support and solidarity  not partisanpressure  in order to consolidate this climate that makesdemocracy and the development of our peoples possible.My second request  in accordance with what thedeveloping countries have been asking for for over adecade  is that the current unfair international economicsystem be replaced. Nevertheless  all these globalagreements — such as those of the recent World Summitfor Social Development  the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  the Fourth WorldConference on Women  held in Beijing  and the latestagreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) — have served only to bring us to today’s sadimpasse  which reveals the radical and irreconcilableattitudes of both sides. The so-called developed countries ofthe North and the developing countries of the South divided by selfishness  ambition and intolerance  deprivefuture generations of a better world.A few days before celebrating the fiftieth anniversaryof our Organization  there still persists in the UnitedNations the spirit of a bipolar world dominated bysuspicions on both sides  mistrust  discrimination  attitudesof superiority  a lack of political will to develop frank andsincere cooperation and a desire for hegemony ininternational relations.The response of the United Nations to the questionsasked by those who spoke before me and to the challengesof the new changes on the international stage must containtwo indispensable elements. The first is that the UnitedNations should represent the interests of everyone  byintroducing certain structural reforms making it possible toattain the objectives for which it was created. Secondly  wemust provide the United Nations with a deeper-goingcapacity for genuine dialogue between the nations thatmake it up and speak to the world in a language ofunderstanding.The necessary dialogue must be global and mustencompass all aspects of international relations  be theyeconomic  political or cultural. It is impractical to limitdialogue between nations  regardless of their size andpower  since all the countries of the world must take anactive part in the dialogue process in order to arrivetogether at a common and secure destiny  abandoning noone to the abyss of underdevelopment and abject poverty.This is the challenge of the next 50 years for ourOrganization. May God bless the United Nations."
"64",2818,"GRC",50,1995,"Allow me at the outsetto extend to the President of the General Assembly thewarmest congratulations of the Greek Government on hiselection to the presidency at this historic fiftieth session which is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualitiesand his distinguished international career. I would alsolike to thank His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy for thehighly constructive and efficient manner in which heperformed his duties as President of the GeneralAssembly during its forty-ninth session.I wish to take this opportunity to address my sincerecongratulations to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who is striving withcourage  energy  political will and vision for a new worldin which law and ethics will prevail  and for therestructuring of the Organization  so that it may meet thechallenges of our time. He has our full support in hisefforts to fulfil his mission.Let me also welcome Palau  the new Member thathas been admitted to the United Nations this year. Itspresence among us is a renewed expression of ourOrganization’s desire to welcome in its midst all thoseStates that undertake the commitment to adhere to the20purposes and principles set out in the United NationsCharter.The Foreign Minister of Spain  in his capacity asPresident of the Council of the European Union  delivereda statement earlier this week on behalf of the Union and itsmember States. My Government fully subscribes to thecontent of that statement and of the memorandum of theUnion. I would like  however  to elaborate further on someissues which are of particular interest to my country.This fiftieth session of the General Assembly providesus with an opportunity  not only for an annual exchange ofviews between the States Members of the United Nationson the state of international affairs  but also for thecelebration of a milestone in the life of the Organization.This celebration should not  however  be just a token tributeto the great undertaking of 50 years ago. It is only naturalthat  on this occasion  Governments should endeavour toanalyse the successes and failures of the United Nationsover five decades  to ask themselves whether we have comecloser to fulfilling  in the practice of international relations the principles proclaimed in the Charter  and to look to theyears ahead in order to try to chart our new priorities in arapidly changing world.This Organization was brought into being by thevision  the hope and the determination of men and womenwho experienced at first hand the lethal dangers ofnationalism  economic depression  lost freedom anddevastating war — men and women who realized the needto create mechanisms that would allow States to embarkupon a collective effort in dealing with a wide range ofcomplex international issues.Looking back over the 50 years since the guns of theSecond World War fell silent  one notes with satisfactionthe valuable work performed by the United Nations as aforum for debate on matters of international concern  andas a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in theeconomic  social  cultural and humanitarian fields.The United Nations has played a vital role as aframework for the historical process of decolonization  bysecuring international recognition for the new countries andby helping them improve their economic and socialconditions. It has defined human rights for the globalcommunity. It has defeated the shameful practice ofapartheid. It has provided the basis for an intensivedevelopment of international law. It has monitored electionsin countries where elections have seldom been held. It hasassisted in the drafting of constitutions  and has trainedindigenous police forces. It has moved forward consensuson global problems such as disarmament  theenvironment  the status of women  human rights development and many other fundamental issues.Furthermore  the specialized agencies of the UnitedNations system have achieved major successes in theirdifferent spheres of activity  and have provided invaluablehumanitarian and other assistance in distressed areas ofthe world.Despite this creditable record  it is the shortcomingsof the United Nations that receive the greatest attention.I will certainly not argue that the achievements of thosepast 50 years yield any ground whatsoever forcomplacency. However  while disappointment has beenfrequently expressed at the Organization’s performance no credible alternative is offered by those who criticize it.Moreover  little regard is given to the innumerableconstraints under which it operates  as well as to the factthat it can be only as effective as Governments allow it tobe. The United Nations has indeed structural deficiencies which it urgently needs to overcome. But it is too oftena useful scapegoat for the mistakes  the failings and theunfulfilled promises of Member States.The Secretary-General  in his highly acclaimed andvery timely report entitled “Supplement to an Agendafor Peace'”  issued earlier this year  has underlined thegreat problems presented to the United Nations by thenew generation of post-cold-war conflicts  for which theOrganization was obviously unprepared. He has pointedout that  for instance  in the framework of its peace-keeping activities  the Organization has had  in somecases  to juggle efforts to combine mandates  includingthe use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter  withthe basic principle of neutrality and impartiality of theUnited Nations and the lack of adequate resources toeffectively implement that mandate. In the same context shortcomings in the unity of command which we havewitnessed in the case of some peace-keeping operationshave also contributed to undermining the effectiveness ofUnited Nations action.The financial crisis in general has also beenparticularly debilitating as regards the activities of theOrganization in all areas. The Secretary-General has oftenquestioned the credibility of those Member States thatsupport the ends  by actively participating in the decision-making process  but not the means  by failing to pay theirassessed contribution. Nobody denies the fact thatconsiderable progress can still be achieved with regard to21the effective use of resources that are already available. Butunless the necessary financial means are provided  it wouldbe folly to expect miracles from the Organization.Eliminating waste and inefficiency  through bettermanagement and accountability  essential though it may be will never be a substitute for ensuring adequate and regularfunding.The increasing resort to  and use  of sanctions regimeshas brought to light another series of difficulties which havealso undermined the credibility of the United Nations. Asthe Secretary-General pointed out in his report  theobjectives for which specific sanctions regimes wereimposed and the criteria for their lifting have not beenclearly defined  or have seemed to change over time  as hasbeen the case for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(Serbia and Montenegro) and Iraq. This situation is all themore worrying because experience has proved that theimposition of sanctions results in the infliction oftremendous suffering upon vulnerable groups of thetargeted country  rather than in the modification of thebehaviour of its Government.Furthermore  the role of those countries that shoulderthe main burden of the implementation of the sanctionsregimes  despite the considerable collateral damage whichthey suffer in terms of economic and social costs  needs  atlast  to be appropriately acknowledged  for theircontribution to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity is  in some cases  no less important than that oftroop-contributing countries. It should be clear that if  in thelong run  the difficulties of those Member States that havethe misfortune to be neighbours of the targeted countriesare not dealt with in a satisfactory way  inter alia  throughthe appropriate implementation of Article 50 of the Charter then general support for the use of sanctions as an effectiveinstrument will not be easily maintained.Regrettably  one would have to acknowledge that theprimary purpose of the United Nations — that ofestablishing a pattern of world order and internationalsecurity — has been achieved to a much lesser degree thanhad been expected  or is indeed required by the growingneeds of the international community. The threat and theuse of force are still a recurrent feature of internationalrelations  contrary to the expectations raised in 1945. Theterritorial integrity or the sovereign rights of States arefrequently threatened or compromised by the practice ofpower politics  in contravention of the purposes andprinciples that govern our Organization.In this context  allow me to observe that a charter isof value in so far as each member that subscribes to itconducts itself in accordance with the commitments it hasundertaken of its own free will  without guile orreservations. It is also of paramount importance that theUnited Nations should not be perceived as resorting todouble standards when it comes to military aggressionand other blatant violations of international law.The guiding principle of Greek foreign policy is theestablishment of good-neighbourly relations with allcountries of the region  on the basis of respect forinternational law  national sovereignty and human rights and on non-interference in the internal affairs of otherStates. This principle has always constituted thecornerstone of our foreign policy and applies fully to ourrelations with neighbouring Turkey. It is the sincere wishof my Government that Greek-Turkish relations benormalized  on the basis of the principles of internationallaw and the relevant international treaties  and inconformity with the Charter of the United Nations  theHelsinki Document and the Charter of Paris for a NewEurope. Greece has never raised any claims againstTurkey. On the other hand  we have made it absolutelyclear that we categorically reject any idea ofcompromising our sovereign rights  which we aredetermined to protect by all legitimate means.Unfortunately  Turkey is following a differentapproach in its policies vis-à-vis our country. To cite justone example  I wish to refer to the resolution adopted on8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly authorizing the Turkish Government to use military forcein case Greece exercised its legal right to expand itsterritorial waters to 12 nautical miles  according to theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Thesaid resolution was obviously endorsed by the TurkishGovernment  since it was forwarded to the Secretary-General on 23 June 1995 in a letter addressed to him bythe Permanent Representative of Turkey to the UnitedNations.Turkey is in fact attempting to intimidate Greeceinto forfeiting a right acknowledged to all signatoryparties  by article 3 of the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea of 1982  and already exercised by alarge number of States. Furthermore  it is beyond anydoubt that the above-mentioned resolution constitutes adirect violation of Article 2  paragraph 4  of the Charterof the United Nations  which stipulates that22“All Members shall refrain in their internationalrelations from the threat or use of force against theterritorial integrity or political independence of anyState” as well as of many similar provisions of internationaltreaties and conventions.It is self-evident that an essential improvement ofGreek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lastingsolution of the Cyprus question and the re-establishment ofinternational legality in Cyprus. Unfortunately  during thelast 21 years  the Turkish forces  defying a series of UnitedNations resolutions  have occupied a large part of Cyprus despite the assiduous efforts of the Secretary-General. Theircontinuing presence has resulted in the division of theisland by force  the brutal violation of human rights andfreedoms  and the systematic plundering of the island’scultural and religious heritage.The Greek Government strongly supports the effortsof the Secretary-General with a view to a just and viablesolution of the Cyprus problem  on the basis of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions  including the most recent one resolution 939 (1994)  which calls for a bi-communal andbi-zonal federal State of Cyprus with single sovereignty andinternational personality and single citizenship  with itsindependence and territorial integrity safeguarded. TheGreek Government believes that the prospect of theaccession of Cyprus to the European Union  which wasfurther promoted by concrete actions taken by the Union inthe course of 1995  will create conditions that would makeit possible to tackle the current deadlock and  thus  assisteffectively the Secretary-General’s efforts for the reversalof the unacceptable status quo.One should also bear in mind that no progress towardsa settlement is possible as long as the Turkish occupationforces remain on the island. The Greek Governmentconsiders the proposal for the total demilitarization of theisland  put forward by President Clerides  as mostconstructive. It also feels that it is imperative that countrieswhich are in a position to back the efforts of the Secretary-General and wish to do so should exert the necessarypressure so that the side which is responsible for theimpasse will be forced to abide by international law andUnited Nations resolutions.The signing of the Interim Accord  on 13 September1995  in New York  constitutes an important step towardsestablishing a new era in relations between Greece and theformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It also paves theway for bilateral cooperation for their own benefit  aswell as for the sake of peace  cooperation  stability andprosperity throughout the Balkans  which has been soaffected by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.We do hope that this preliminary significant step inthe relations between the two countries will lead to adefinite settlement of the dispute over the name  whichconstitutes the main difference existing between them andwhich will be dealt with in the context of furthernegotiations  in accordance with the conventionalcommitment of the parties concerned and the relevantSecurity Council resolutions.Greece attaches great importance to its relations withAlbania. For this reason  we constantly follow a policy ofgood- neighbourliness and cooperation with that countryand continue to support  in many ways  its efforts topromote political and economic reforms and thuscontribute to the establishment of a modern anddemocratic society.Greece has been offering substantial economicsupport to Albania  which has enabled it to face the manydifficult problems that arose after the former regime wasoverthrown. Today  Greek investments in Albaniacontinue to contribute substantially to the country’seconomic development and to the strengthening of itssocial stability.Furthermore  a large Greek minority lives inAlbania  contributing positively to the country’sdevelopment. Under the previous regime  this minoritywas subjected to persecution and harsh treatment. Greeceis convinced that the Greek minority in Albaniaconstitutes a bridge of friendship between the twocountries and helps further their rapprochement andcooperation. For this reason  we believe that the humanrights of the members of that minority should be fullyrespected  so that they are able to stay in their homelandand live there in a safe environment. Moreover  theyshould be proportionally represented in the administration the State institutions and the armed forces  and beallowed to exercise their religious and educational rightsfreely and fully.Unfortunately  notwithstanding some improvements considerable restrictions continue to apply to the freeexercise of these rights  particularly in the field ofeducation. We sincerely hope that the AlbanianGovernment  in conformity also with its international23commitments  will secure full respect for the human rightsof the Greek minority.During the current year  the tragedy of the formerYugoslavia has continued to unfold relentlessly  imposingtremendous suffering and hardships on the civilianpopulation. Greece  as a country neighbouring the formerYugoslavia  has been directly subjected to the negativeconsequences of this bloody conflict  as regards both itseconomy and its security.My country has always advocated that  as has alreadybeen pointed out by the presidency of the European Union a fair and viable solution to the conflict in Bosnia can befound only by political means  and not on the battlefields.This is why from the beginning of the crisis we havespared no effort to ensure that all the parties involvedmoved in the direction of trying to promote a peacefulsettlement  in cooperation with our European partners andRussia  which has played  and is to play  a significant rolein this issue. Furthermore  the Greek Government fullysupports the current diplomatic initiative and the ongoingnegotiating process based on the Contact Group plan.Recently  there have been encouraging developmentsregarding the future shape of things in the formerYugoslavia. The parties have begun to show signs ofrapprochement and willingness to talk. Thus  we warmlywelcome the Basic Principles  agreed in Geneva on 8September 1995  and the Further Basic Principles  agreedthree days ago in New York  which are very importantsteps on the long and difficult road to peace. Much remainsto be done  but if the parties display the necessary politicalwill and with the assistance of the international communitya comprehensive and viable peaceful settlement should nolonger be a fictitious objective  whose attainment wouldtake a very long time.Greece  for its part  is ready to contribute to thefulfilment of this objective through the good relations thatit has developed with all the parties involved in the conflict.Furthermore  my country  fully aware of the intricacies ofthe Balkans and having actively participated in theinitiatives for regional economic cooperation  will do itsutmost  both on a national basis and in the framework ofthe European Union  to promote efforts aiming at thereconstruction of the former Yugoslavia.Concerning the situation in the Middle East  Greececonsiders as a matter of utmost importance the early andunimpeded implementation of the recent Erez and TabaAgreements and the speedy conclusion of the talks onredeployment and elections  together with the solution ofthe two outstanding problems  namely security for all  andsocial and economic development.We welcome the signature yesterday in Washingtonby Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)of the interim agreement on the second stage ofPalestinian autonomy  which constitutes additional proofof determination and political courage. We congratulatethe Israeli Government and Chairman Arafat on theircommitment to peace.Greece believes that the international communitymust exert consistent efforts  in which we are willing toactively participate  aiming at the creation of a solid basisfor the political and economic survival of the PalestinianNational Authority  thereby providing a source of hopefor the Palestinian people.Greece is of the view that the peace process couldbe substantially promoted if the States of the regiondirectly involved in it joined forces with those activelyparticipating  and we welcome all recent indications tothis effect. The peoples of the region should beguaranteed a secure life  within internationally recognizedand safe boundaries.We urge the implementation of Security Councilresolution 425 (1978) on Lebanon.Greece  which has actively participated in the MiddleEast peace process since it began in Madrid  will continueto offer full support and assistance to the bilateral andmultilateral negotiations towards a comprehensive  finaland just peace.Greece believes that an increase in the number ofmembers of the Security Council has become animperative necessity. Such an increase  which should bemoderate so as not to undermine the effectiveness of theCouncil’s action  must reflect the current number ofStates that are Members of the United Nations  therealities of the new international situation and anequitable distribution among all existing regional groups.While recognizing that any formal definition of criteriafor new permanent members could not be easilyformulated  we consider that new members of thiscategory should be selected from among States that exerta major influence in world affairs and are in a position tomake an essential contribution to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.24Greece welcomes the indefinite extension of theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the commitment madeby the States parties to its universalization and fullimplementation. We emphasize the importance ofstrengthening the review process and adopting a set ofprinciples and objectives for non-proliferation anddisarmament. We also stress the need to complete withoutdelay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissilematerial for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosivedevices.We are deeply concerned at the continued dangersposed by the excessive transfer of conventional arms  andwe support putting the United Nations Register fully intoeffect. Furthermore  the continuing injuries to civilianscaused by anti-personnel mines demonstrate the need tostrengthen multilateral controls in this regard.Growing economic and social gaps breed violence.The need to bridge the differences between rich and poor both between nations and within nations  is of the utmostimportance for our efforts and opportunities to preservepeace. This fundamental truth was recognized and stressedby the founders of the United Nations and  subsequently  byall members of the Organization  who pledged to “employinternational machinery for the promotion of the economicand social advancement of all peoples”.In responding to the changing needs of theincreasingly interdependent world economy  we have toreinforce the coherence and effectiveness of the competentinternational institutions and to complete without delay ourconsideration of the “Agenda for Development”  thussetting out a new impetus to international cooperation inthis field and defining the particular contribution expectedof the United Nations system.There is an increasing realization worldwide that inmajor denials of human rights  which breed antagonismsand deep resentments  there lie the seeds of internationaldiscord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries andterritorial ambitions. In this regard  Greece stronglycondemns all forms of discrimination and intolerance  andreaffirms its full support for the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and his coordinating rolethroughout the United Nations system  as well as for thestrengthening of the Centre for Human Rights. Theprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and also those of the Vienna Declaration and Programme ofAction  as well as of the other international acts andinstruments  should guide the actions of all MemberStates in this respect on a daily basis.Industrialization and the technological revolution while bringing benefits to the human race  have alsogiven rise to side effects  namely the problems of thedevastation of the natural environment. In this context  theimportance of meeting the commitments we made at the1992 Rio Earth Summit  and the need to review andstrengthen them  where appropriate  cannot beoverstressed. Strengthening national institutionsresponsible for environmental management  andsupporting international organizations that focus onenvironmental issues  will be vital in maintaining andincreasing the momentum for the protection and theimprovement of the environment.Troops and civilian personnel engaged in UnitedNations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities havebeen carrying out their most important tasks underconditions of extraordinary personal risk  and very oftenat the expense of their own lives. I would like tocondemn  in the strongest possible terms  the abhorrentand unacceptable harassment of and attacks againstUnited Nations peace-keepers  to whose relentless courageand determination we pay tribute. I should also like tostress the need for measures which will ensure theirsecurity  including the early entry into force of therecently adopted Convention for the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel.These past 50 years of United Nations existencehave been a time of unparalleled human advancement andof the fundamental enlargement of human expectations.As I see it  it will be the principal task of theOrganization  which has done so much to give voice tothose expectations  to take the lead in bringing them evercloser to realization.Greece  as a small country  has always had a strongvested interest in the strengthening of the commoncapacity to deal with threats to international peace andsecurity and  in general  in the success of the UnitedNations. The Greek people will always be supportive ofa collective approach to global and regional problems. Formy part  I can only reaffirm our resolve to extend our fullcooperation to the efforts of the Organization as it strivesfor the realization of its noble objectives  and ourcontinued dedication to its purposes and principles."
"65",2859,"GRD",50,1995,"The world is aware that thefiftieth session of the General Assembly marks a majormilestone in the global events that have charted and guidedinternational affairs. My delegation is pleased to be a partof this world Organization.My delegation wishes to congratulate His ExcellencyMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his electionto the presidency of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. We take this opportunity also to thankMr. Amara Essy  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côted’Ivoire  for his exceptional performance in the conductof the proceedings of the forty-ninth session.My delegation wishes to make due mention of theefforts and achievements of the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His optimism ashe confronts the challenges that face this Organizationand his determination in his will to find solutions to manyof the daunting problems of a world fraught with political economic and social changes have contributed  in a largemeasure  to the successes and gains recorded by theUnited Nations.The success of the United Nations Mission in Haitiis one achievement to celebrate  when the duly-electedPresident  Jean-Bertrand Aristide  was reinstated followingthe removal of the military almost a year ago. Democracyand the rule of law and order are of paramountimportance to the peoples of the Caribbean region whocherish freedom  justice and law and order. Grenadacontinues to support United Nations initiatives undertakenin collaboration with other hemispheric organizations tobuild on the processes that are being put in place toensure sound social and economic development wheredemocracy can flourish.Grenada applauds the ongoing process ofdemocratization in South Africa and supports the initiativesundertaken by the South African Government  assisted bythe international community  to enhance the lives of itsentire population.Grenada welcomes  too  the building of the peaceprocess in the Middle East with the expansion of Arabcontrol over Arab settlements within the West Bank although it is recognized that much work has yet to be doneif we are to see lasting peace in that region.My delegation is hopeful that similar attempts atpeacemaking in the Balkans will result in bringing thewarring parties together to work out a negotiated settlementto the conflict.The world stands at the threshold of a new era  a timeof great challenges and a time of significant promise. Thechoices that we make will determine whether we experienceeconomic  social and political successes or failures. Theinternational economic environment is rapidly beingtransformed as new centres of economic power and newpartnerships are established. Indeed  these new economicrealities have important implications for the survival ofsmall and vulnerable economies such as Grenada’s  whichare so heavily dependent on a favourable externalenvironment.It can hardly be disputed that the traditional economicand trade relations on which Grenada relied for so long arenow being threatened and could shortly cease to exist. Theprocess of adjustment to the new hemispheric challengesresulting from the entry into force of the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement on 1 January 1994; the conclusionof the Uruguay Round agreements of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade; the establishment of theWorld Trade Organization; the call for the establishment ofa free-trade area of the Americas by the year 2005; and theformation of the Association of Caribbean States willundoubtedly pose challenges which will require adjustmentson the domestic level  particularly on the part of ourmanufacturers.Furthermore  these recently formed and soon to beestablished trading blocs will significantly transform thetrade policy framework in which developing islandeconomies will have to operate into the twenty-first century.While these will offer us new trading opportunities particularly in the medium to long term  they will in theshort term cause us to face many transitional problems mainly because of the erosion of preferential access thatwe now enjoy in major markets of the developed world.It is in this context  therefore  that Grenada issues acall to the developed world to work with us as weformulate appropriate policy responses to realize thebenefits from and adjust to the changes in the globaltrading system. It is to be emphasized that the newEuropean Union regime for bananas  though not inessence an effect of the Uruguay Round  will result inmajor losses in export revenue for all the WindwardIslands in the Caribbean. Moreover  the challenge of thislimited preferential arrangement by some of our closestallies in the developed world is cause for serious concern.I must remind this distinguished gathering that theissue of bananas has much more than economicsignificance. Indeed  the heavy dependence on thisagricultural commodity by thousands in our islandsmust — I repeat  must — be underscored.In fact  the destruction of the banana industry wouldlead to serious hardships and could constitute a threat toour traditionally sound democratic process. Sustainablehuman development in our small island States could beseverely threatened.My delegation wishes to make it clear that  whileGrenada embraces the philosophy of trade liberalization tolerance and an understanding of our cause on the partof larger economies are necessary. We cannot hope todevelop without a significant inflow of technicalassistance  foreign capital and technology.We therefore call on the countries in the developedworld to provide us with this much-needed assistance inorder to ensure that we can participate effectively in thisemerging “New World Trade Order”.My delegation will continue to argue that movestowards global trade liberalization and reciprocity shouldcomplement and not obstruct the efforts of less developedcountries to implement positive structural reforms.Grenada  for its part  has already commenced the processof substantially reducing import tariffs and other barriers.What is now sought is a recognition of theseinitiatives and a negotiating framework in which ourability to achieve greater market access is enhanced while our economic and financial restructuring can takeplace in a manner and time-frame appropriate to ourspecial circumstances.2Grenada continues to support the view that special andpreferential treatment cannot continue in perpetuity. But itmust be recognized that the special needs of the relativelyless developed countries must be taken into account. Thechallenge  therefore  is how to design an acceptablereciprocal arrangement among unequal partners that willpromote prosperity through free trade and integration in ourworld without endangering the process of sustainable socialand economic development. It is crucial  therefore  that thedeveloped countries assist the developing world to createdomestic capabilities that will enhance its capacity to drawbenefits from trade liberalization and will soften the burdenof adjustment to the new requirements of global free trade.The question of the environment and of sustainableeconomic development remains at the heart of our concerns.It is also a central issue for small island developing Statesin particular  and developing countries in general.If we continue to reaffirm that human beings are at thecentre of sustainable development and that they have a rightto a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature action must be taken at all levels and  all the more so  atthe international level  to facilitate the process. This wouldensure that developing countries  and particularly smallisland developing States  are provided with the know-howand the resources to enable the implementation of thedecisions and recommendations arising out of the UnitedNations Conference on the Environment and Developmentin Rio in 1992  the United Nations Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates in 1994 in Bridgetown  Barbados and the many othersignificant global Conferences.The vulnerability of small island States and the threatto our fragile ecosystems were recently manifested by thepassage of hurricanes Iris  Luis and Marilyn. Our economicviability and sustainable economic growth are indeed atstake. In this regard  Grenada looks forward to thefulfilment of pledged commitments by developed countriesto assist small island developing States achieve sustainabledevelopment.The role of science and technology in developmentmust be underscored. My delegation calls upon developedcountries to provide developing countries with the necessaryaccess to biotechnologies to promote and facilitatesustainable economic growth.Information technology and human resourcedevelopment are key elements towards social and economicprogress — elements which would enable us to improveour productivity and competitiveness in priority areas aswe move into the twenty-first century.The United Nations was created by men of vision courage and foresight who understood the need forcooperation among nations and for hope over despair.Undoubtedly  the United Nations  in its “Agenda forDevelopment”  has succeeded in bringing to the world’sattention the need for a re-evaluation of the role of theUnited Nations in development  taking into account suchcritical issues as the empowerment of women  thealleviation of poverty and hunger and the link betweendevelopment and population  human rights and thecreation of an environment for world peace and security.The social forces of poverty are among the leadingcauses of environmental degradation and a significantcontributor to the loss of biological diversity. Poverty andunemployment also contribute to greater social problems among which is the illicit traffic in narcotics. Efforts toeradicate the traffic in illicit drugs can have little effect atthe national and international levels unless commitmentsare made and agreements are entered into to developprogrammes aimed at the alleviation of poverty.My delegation is hopeful that the follow-up to theWorld Summit for Social Development  held inCopenhagen in March this year  will embrace thoseprinciples which call for social inclusion and whichfacilitate the development of strategies to ensure thatyouth  the disabled and the elderly play a moremeaningful role in social and economic development.Indeed  the Fourth World Conference on Women which ended only last month in Beijing  has givenimpetus to the need for programmes that speak to theissues of women in development and  most critically  theempowerment of women in local communities  enablingtheir full participation at all levels in the process ofnational development.Grenada is encouraged by the new spirit ofinternational cooperation built on a shared partnershipbetween multilateral financial institutions andGovernments. However  the models suggested foreconomic development have not been sufficiently testedand are often ill-suited to meet the needs of the society inwhich they are applied  sometimes resulting in disastroussocial and economic consequences.While we seek to put in place all the necessarymeasures to ensure the efficient and effective management3of our domestic affairs  we strongly urge multilateralinstitutions to include in these models for development acomponent that provides skills training and  in particular training in the use of technologies to enable young peopleto find productive employment in the private sector and tofacilitate the process towards equitable social and economicdevelopment.My delegation also supports the United Nationsresponse to security and international humanitarian needsand encourages greater emphasis on human-rightsmonitoring.We live in an era of changing norms and of emergingnations and democracies  where no institution or countrycan stand alone. In this connection  the reforms currentlybeing undertaken within the United Nations system shouldyield more positive results — greater collaboration andcooperation on issues  rather than confrontation anddisunity. New  emerging economic nations or Powers areeager to take their rightful place in institutions and agenciesonce dominated by traditional super-Powers.Grenada also believes that in this era of reform andrestructuring within the United Nations due considerationshould be given to a composition of the Security Councilthat reflects the geopolitical and economic realities of ourtime.On this auspicious occasion  as we celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  let us reaffirmour commitment to the principles of the Charter whichguides this Organization. Grenada not only wishes toemphasize adherence to these principles  but has worked toestablish conditions under which all peoples may exercisetheir equal and inalienable rights.In his opening statement the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fiftieth session stated:“the United Nations has ceased to be anintergovernmental organization with a limitedmembership and has become the only internationalorganization that is universal. Efforts must be made toensure that all States that are not yet Members shouldseek to be admitted in the near future. For the samereason  the most serious penalty imposed on aMember State should never be expulsion  but rathersuspension”for an indefinite period“  for the United Nations must  as a matter ofprinciple  include all the world’s countries.” (OfficialRecords of the General Assembly  Fiftieth Session Plenary Meetings  1st meeting  p. 7)But as we meet today the Republic of China onTaiwan and its more than 21 million people remainexcluded from participation and representation in theUnited Nations. It is on the basis of that principle ofuniversality that Grenada urges all Members to considerthat  in renewing our oaths  we should forthwith seek toright this wrong. The inclusion of the Republic of Chinawill be an added contribution to global cooperation infields such as trade  economic development environmental protection  sustainable development andmultilateral efforts to fight drug trafficking. Moreover  theRepublic of China is committed to the promotion ofinternational development assistance to developingcountries.Grenada wishes to urge again that an ad hoccommittee be set up at the earliest possible time toconsider the special case of the Republic of China onTaiwan and respond positively to its wish to join thisworld Organization.My delegation is confident that improvedcooperation between developed and developing countriesand the consolidation of related agencies and programmeswould lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery ofsolutions to global problems and for the promotion ofsustainable economic  social and cultural development.As we look forward to celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the Untied Nations  and as individualnations formulate plans and strategies to move into thetwenty-first century  which poses as many challenges asit presents opportunities  let us recommit ourselves to thenoble principles of the Charter  guided by the spirit ofpartnership and cooperation  ever united in our efforts toachieve peace  democracy and prosperity for all ourpeoples."
"66",2906,"GTM",50,1995,"It is a pleasant duty for mydelegation to welcome the election of Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral to the presidency of the General Assembly atthis especially solemn session. He will be presiding overa session which for the first time will hear statements byvirtually all the world’s leaders. We are convinced thathis experience will guarantee the success of our work.I wish also to convey our appreciation toAmbassador Amara Essy for the exceptional ability andefficiency with which he guided the work of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session.Nor can I fail to convey to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  my Government’s gratitudefor his tenacious efforts for peace during a time when hisoutstanding diplomatic talents have been put to a hardtest.Any institution tends to shape its own life  which isnot always consistent with previous models. Thus however much those who carry out the provisions of afounding document may venerate that document  theycannot prevent an organization from transcending to some45extent the founders’ original wishes. Moreover  the olderthe founding document the greater the disparities betweenthe original conception and the institution’s functioning andpractices. Obviously  the great changes that have takenplace and the new hopes for the end of a century can onlyintensify this phenomenon.For the United Nations to have escaped this trendwould have been impossible  especially when it wasdictated by circumstances. A half century has passed sincethe founding of the United Nations; none of the founderscould have imagined the spectacular  dizzying changes thathave come about since the San Francisco conference. Wemust remember that  as a legal constitutional instrument the Charter needs a contemporary purpose-orientedinterpretation in order to be properly understood.With respect to the operational activities of theOrganization in the economic and social spheres  few couldhave thought in 1945 that these would have acquired theirpresent scope. Nor would anyone have thought thatArticle 2 (7) of the Charter would permit the Organizationto become a legitimate champion of respect for humanrights throughout the world.We pay a well deserved tribute to the extraordinaryskill of the representatives of Member States in devisingnegotiated formulas that have made it possible to snatchfrom what seemed to be imminent failure global agreementsof great importance — and all the more sound for theirhaving been achieved through a balanced consensus.Although we might have certain reservations aboutsome specific elements of the functioning of theOrganization  in general my Government hails the UnitedNations system’s great ability to adapt to circumstances asit addresses problems calmly and with realism. While wepay tribute to these noteworthy virtues of adaptability productive pragmatism and the ability to scale high politicalhurdles  our admiration should not blind us to the need forreform  a need we are already beginning to face up to. Suchreform would enable us to remove the Organization’sfailings and shortcomings and thus make it more efficientand democratic so it can resist the unilateral practices thatwould supplant it.Among the most striking features of today’s world arenearly incredible disparities and paradoxes. Althoughspeaking of these is a commonplace here  we cannot fail tonote that the wealth of most inhabitants of a tiny minorityof countries is in marked contrast to the great difficultiesand deprivation endured by three quarters of theinhabitants of the planet  who are prevented fromcompeting on the international market  even with theircommodities  by administrative restrictions  subsidies anddiscriminatory policies. There are places where the mostsophisticated products of modern technology are thecommon tools of the worker; there are other places whereyou can travel great distances without seeing anytechnology more advanced than that used in biblicaltimes. It is hardly necessary to note the contrast betweenthe extreme poverty of so many human beings and thevast expenditures on weapons. As to democracy andhuman rights  we acknowledge the increasing worldawareness of those ideals — although we share concernsabout the relativism with which they are applied andabout the way they are used to exert political pressure andeven to trade in influence.It will unquestionably be necessary to overcomethose contradictions. We are sure that if that goal isachieved  even partially  the credit will belong largely tothe United Nations  which by the terms of Article 1 of theCharter is“a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations inthe attainment of ... common ends”.No Guatemalan can hear or utter the word that is atthe very core of this Organization — “peace” — withoutimmediately thinking of the most important problembesetting my country. Because of a fratricidal strugglepromoted largely by a cold war that was alien to us  astruggle that for more than 30 years harmed thousands offamilies  endangered democracy and unleashed humanrights violations by parties to the conflict  today the mostfervent desire of the people of Guatemala can only bereconciliation and a firm and lasting peace. If this has notyet been achieved  it is not because of any lack of effort patience and great tolerance by the democraticGovernment and  as is known  by the internationalcommunity  which has acted principally through theGroup of Friends and through the United Nations specifically through the Secretary-General.The Government of Guatemala thanks all who havecontributed to the functioning of the machinery set up tohelp further our national goal of peace  reconciliation anddevelopment  especially the Secretary-General  theGuatemala Unit of the Department of Political Affairs  theUnited Nations Moderator and the United Nations46Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and ofCompliance with the Commitments of the ComprehensiveAgreement on Human Rights in Guatemala. We are alsograteful to the six Governments that form the Group ofFriends of the peace process in Guatemala for theirinvaluable contribution to this arduous and painstakingwork.The Government of Guatemala has spared no effort torealize the aspiration of our entire nation to bring an end tointernal armed conflict. In the sphere of human rights  theGovernment of President Ramiro de León Carpio is facinga situation deriving from the armed confrontation that hasgripped our country for three decades  so the tasks beforeus are intimately linked with peace-building. This promptedPresident de León Carpio to sign the ComprehensiveAgreement on Human Rights of 29 March 1994  by whichhe reaffirmed his commitment to principles and normsaimed at guaranteeing and protecting full observance ofhuman rights by the parties  and his political will to ensurethat those principles and norms are respected.As a result of that Agreement  the United NationsMission for the Verification of Human Rights and ofCompliance with the Commitments of the ComprehensiveAgreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA)was set up in our country. It has been accorded the fullestfacilities and guarantees for its activities on our territory.The implementation of some of the recommendations ofMINUGUA has met with difficulties owing to institutionallimitations; we are endeavouring to resolve these  althoughit must be recognized that some provisions do not have theimpetus that would secure compliance in the short term.Also  a Counsel for Human Rights is now at work inmy country; this is a post formerly filled by President deLeón Carpio. This office retains and is enhancing itsprestige within the country and its international credibility.The Presidential Human Rights Committee (COPREDEH)is making ever greater efforts to ensure that therecommendations are duly complied with. Reflecting myGovernment’s political will  there are also preventivemechanisms to avoid human rights violations.I turn now to the process of Central Americanintegration  which gave rise to the signing of theTegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization ofAmerican States. The Central American Integration System(SICA)  founded as an intergovernmental organization  hasbeen working successfully since the beginning of 1993 withthe purpose of strengthening integration in the economic social  cultural and political spheres.Guatemala hopes that — bearing in mind theimportance of the Central American Integration System which encompasses virtually all activities of theGovernments of its member States and which covers acontiguous area of some 425 000 square kilometresinhabited by nearly 30 million people — the GeneralAssembly will accede to the request made by Guatemalaalong with the other members of the System and Panamato grant SICA observer status in the General Assembly.The Central American region founded the Alliancefor Sustainable Development to strengthen integrationbased on democracy  improvement of the quality of life respect for and development of the vitality and diversityof the land  and the multicultural and multiethnic natureof our isthmus. We supported the establishment of theAssociation of Caribbean States  and we are participatingin the World Trade Organization; these  we feel  areproper forums to foster values that enrich society andpromote fair rules of trade. For similar reasons we shallattend the Ibero-American summit to take place atBariloche  Argentina  and the summit of non-alignedcountries to be held at Cartagena  Colombia. We will beat the upcoming Tuxtla II meeting and at talks betweenCentral America and other countries and regionalgroupings.Recently  we attended the Fourth World Conferenceon Women  where my delegation supportedrecommendations promoting the material and moraladvancement of women in keeping with ethical conceptsthat respect women and grant them dignity andparticipation with the right to complete equality.Our contribution to United Nations efforts towardsthe democratic rehabilitation of Haiti have taken the formof a contingent of army specialists in peaceful operations.This is the moment to refer to Guatemala’scontribution to two important General Assemblyinitiatives with respect to the development of legalprinciples set out in the Charter: the well knownDeclaration on Principles of International Law concerningFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations  whichwas adopted by the Assembly on the occasion of thetwenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of theCharter  and which my country introduced on behalf of its41 sponsors; and our second contribution aimed atpromoting the use of conciliation as one of the means ofpeaceful settlement of disputes between States set out inArticle 33 of the Charter. Guatemala submitted the first47version of these proposed rules to the General Assembly in1990. At its 1995 session  the Ad Hoc Committee on theCharter endorsed the final version of the proposed rules byconsensus and recommended that the General Assemblybring them to the attention of States.Consistent with our devotion to law and firmlyconvinced of the benefits of peace and the importance ofmutual cooperation  Guatemala gives priority to thepeaceful settlement of disputes. Hence  in connection withthe territorial dispute with Belize  my country hopes thatthere will be a decisive solution through a more realistic constructive and forward-looking dialogue  unconstrainedby any limits other than the principles of good faith and thedignity of the parties.Guatemala is vastly pleased at the indefinite extensionof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and at the fact that this was achieved through a trulyhistoric decision  without a vote. Together with oursatisfaction at the indefinite extension of the Treaty  wealso feel pride  because Latin America is the least heavilyarmed region in the world and  thanks to the Treaty ofTlatelolco  is the only region that has become a nuclear-weapon-free zone forever. We regret the resumption ofnuclear testing and therefore urge the adoption of newinitiatives to forge a new world order that would eliminatenuclear weapons and in which security would be overseenby international institutions sustaining the force of law.That is why my delegation is among the sponsors of a draftresolution to be submitted to the General Assembly byStates parties and signatories of the Treaty of Tlatelolcoand the Treaty of Rarotonga.Guatemala has had the tragic and painful experienceof the laying of mines by outlaw groups  and we vigorouslycondemn the use of mines and support all proposalsintended to prohibit them.We note with satisfaction that the Middle East peaceprocess is moving forward. Guatemala hopes that wisdomwill prevail  which after so many decades of struggle andviolence will make it possible for peace to reign forever ina land of such deep significance to three great religions.Guatemala is pleased that greater use is now beingmade of the International Court of Justice than ever before.We are pleased too at the wide geographical range of thecases before what can rightly be known as a World Court.Recalling the precedent-setting creation of a CentralAmerican international court  which is now being restored my country will venture to propose the candidature of anexperienced Guatemalan jurist for a seat on theInternational Court of Justice; we are convinced that hecould make a most important contribution to the work ofthe Court.Following careful consideration of the items on theagenda of the World Summit for Social Development Guatemala participated in that conference with thegreatest interest and with high hopes; the Summit wasaddressed by President de León Carpio.We are convinced that unless the fundamentalprinciple of universality is fully observed  ourOrganization will be unable fully to attain its purposes.We therefore urge consideration of the situation of theRepublic of China in Taiwan so that this country mayhave a forum in which to discuss its future peacefullywith its historical brethren.Fifty years after post-war statesmen conceived theplan for a world organization intended to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war  poverty andignorance  we must be optimistic in our assessment of theresults  for they have saved the world from the irreparableharm of total conflagration. Although it is true that attimes the cold war flared up in local armed conflictsencouraged by the rivalry between opposing super-Powerswhich at the time seemed irreconcilable  today we breathea more tranquil atmosphere with respect to militarysecurity. But that atmosphere is less secure with respectto cooperation for development  because the rules of theeconomic order sometimes forget that economic weaknessis not only an internal matter for States but is also aresponsibility for those who have achieved a more thandignified standard of living and who have an obligationto transfer resources and technology for the sake ofworld-wide justice.We close with the well known phrase of HisHoliness Pope John Paul II  which we invite members toponder: “The new name for peace is development”."
"67",2949,"GUY",50,1995,"In another two weeks we willbe commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of thisOrganization. We shall do so with much ceremony. Iwould hope  however  that we will go beyond theceremonial to take the opportunity which the occasionprovides us to reflect further on the role of theOrganization and on the ways and means by which itsperformance can be enhanced to serve better the needs ofits Members in the coming twenty-first century.We offer Mr. Freitas do Amaral our warmestcongratulations on his election. We are confident that with his demonstrated ability and skills  he will advanceus even further in our task of reforming and restructuring4the Organization so that it may successfully confront thechallenges which the post-cold-war era has brought. Hemay be sure that we will fully cooperate with him to makethe deliberations of the fiftieth session of this Assembly asconstructive as possible.My Government is grateful to the outgoing Presidentof the Assembly  Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  for theinitiatives which he took during his term of office toimprove the functioning of the institution at this criticaltime of its existence.We would also wish to say a special word ofappreciation to the distinguished Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and his staff for theircontinuing devotion to the servicing of our manyrequirements. Their support for our efforts will undoubtedlyguarantee our ultimate success.It is vitally important that the dynamism andeffectiveness of the United Nations be increased if it isadequately to discharge its many tasks. Since theOrganization was founded almost five decades ago  theworld has changed considerably and international problemshave become much more complex. The United Nationstoday bears a heavier load of responsibility than everbefore. Ironically  at the same time  it is saddled with adeepening financial crisis which makes its effectiveness andits very future highly uncertain. This situation cannotcontinue without adverse consequences for the worldcommunity.The expanding nature of many peace-keepingoperations not only places an added financial strain on thefinances of the United Nations  but is especiallyburdensome for small developing countries  such as mine which are finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil ourfinancial obligations to the Organization. Support for theseoperations represents a continuing drain on our limitedresources and hampers our own efforts at development. Yetas conflicts multiply the United Nations will be called uponto mount more operations to keep the peace.Given the urgency of these demands  we have nochoice but to try and meet them. The time has thereforecome for us to put the financing of these undertakings ona more reliable footing. We urge all States  especially themajor defaulting countries  to honour fully their obligationsto the Organization.It must be a matter of growing concern to theinternational community that the peace and prosperityexpected in the aftermath of the cold war have notmaterialized. The world continues to face some of theworst threats to international stability. Violent conflictsarising from resurgent nationalisms and religiousintolerance between and within States have proliferated.The unresolved situations in Afghanistan  Rwanda  partsof the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslaviahave caused severe loss of life and destruction to propertyand have given rise to humanitarian crises of immenseproportions.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remainsuncertain. The suffering of the Bosnian people  the totaldisregard for the safe havens and the constant threat tothe international peace-keeping force demands that theinternational community take effective measures to endthis senseless conflict. We welcome the prospects of apeaceful settlement which have resulted from the latestdiplomatic initiative. With the international Tribunal forthe former Yugoslavia now established  we hope thatthose responsible for the atrocities committed against theBosnian people will be brought to trial.We are equally concerned with the situation inCyprus which  despite the efforts of the Secretary-General  appears to be worsening. There are reports ofescalating tensions. We urge both sides to the dispute torespond urgently to his call for a negotiated solutionwhich would preserve the island’s sovereignty andterritorial integrity.Although the Middle East continues to be volatile we have reason today to believe that a comprehensivepeace can be a reality in the not-too-distant future. Theaccords already signed between Israel and the Palestinianson the one hand and Israel and Jordan on the other showa willingness to reach a just and lasting solution. Theseachievements should serve as a catalyst for newinitiatives. Many issues such as the refugee problem security arrangements and borders  fundamental to thePalestine question  remain to be settled. The recent high-level negotiations between the Prime Minister of Israeland the President of Palestine must be considered apositive development. We hope that all remainingdifficulties can be resolved in good faith by both sideswith the help of this Organization and the internationalcommunity.In our own region we are pleased to see that peaceand stability have been restored to a large degree in Haiti.Much has been accomplished since the return of thedemocratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in5October 1994. We note in particular the practical stepstaken by the Government of Haiti to organize free and fairlegislative elections  as called for in Security Councilresolution 940 (1994). The first of these elections hasshown that more has to be done in terms of establishing aneffective electoral machinery. The role of the InternationalCivilian Mission and the United Nations Mission in Haiti(UNMIH) in assisting the Haitian authorities to reinforcedemocracy remains crucial. The sustained commitment ofthe international community is indispensable to theprospects for long-term progress in Haiti. My Governmentis ready to provide whatever assistance it can to achievethis goal.Today more than ever  the people of the world aremaking the United Nations the repository of their hopes.The Organization must therefore do its utmost to satisfythese expanded expectations. It must undertake whateverinstitutional reforms are necessary for adapting itself to thenew international context. The urgency of our agendamakes it imperative for us to conclude as early as possiblethe work under way in the many Working Groups to securethe rationalization of our agenda  as well as the reform ofthe major organs of the United Nations. These reforms which we believe to be essential and urgent  must becarried out with transparency and on a consensual basis.They must be realistic and be aimed at increasingefficiency. Above all  they must be in full accordance withthe democratic purposes and principles of the Charter.In so far as the reform of the Security Council isconcerned  my Government supports an appropriate increasein membership. Such an increase should take account of thesize of the current membership of the Organization and bereflective of the principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation. The discussions in the Working Group thatwas set up in accordance with resolution 48/26 haveproduced several interesting proposals for reform. Theseshould now be more closely examined and evaluated todetermine their feasibility. It is possible  we believe  to findan arrangement that would respond satisfactorily to the needfor enhancing the Council’s capacity to preserveinternational peace and security in the post-cold-war era.A major responsibility of any reformed Council shouldbe to give further impetus to the disarmament process. Thedecision taken by the 1995 Review and ExtensionConference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) to extend the agreementindefinitely reflects the commitment of all parties involvedto work towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. Theextension of the Treaty  however  is not an end in itself. Itmust be followed by further steps towards completenuclear disarmament  the dissemination of nuclear know-how for peaceful purposes  adequate security assurancesto non-nuclear-weapon States and the establishment ofnuclear-weapon free zones. Especially important is theneed to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty in orderto preclude nuclear-weapon States from undertakingfurther hazardous experiments. We urge the Conferenceon Disarmament to proceed as expeditiously as possibleto the elaboration of a universal and effective treatywithin a fixed time frame.The nuclear threat  as well as other hazards to whichwe are exposed  must make us all actually aware of ourobligation to protect our fragile environment. Since theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  we have made some progress in a numberof areas with regard to the implementation of Agenda 21.We have seen the coming into force of the Convention onBiological Diversity  the Convention on Climate Changeand the Convention to Combat Desertification  as well asthe holding in Barbados of the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and the adoption of the Barbados Programme ofAction. Much more  however  remains to be done if weare adequately to honour the commitments made in Rio.The terrible destruction inflicted recently bypowerful hurricanes on several sister States in theCaribbean Community shows how vulnerable small Statesare to environmental disasters. Only two months ago myown country suffered major ecological damage as a resultof severe leakages from the tailings pond dam at theOmai Gold Mines in the Essequibo region  causing some1.2 million cubic metres of cyanide slurry to bedischarged into the environment. Aquatic life in the riverwas endangered  while the inhabitants of nearby villageswere exposed to serious health hazards. Fortunately  theGovernment of Guyana was able  with the assistance offriendly Governments and agencies of the United Nationssystem  to contain the danger. These disasters  bothnatural and man-made  point to the need for urgentinternational action to protect small countries such asours.Yet  three years after the Rio Conference  thecommitments to provide financial resources to implementAgenda 21 remain largely on paper. The target of 0.7 percent of official development assistance is still to berealized. New resources have simply not been available toundertake some of the programmes specified in theAgenda. Nor have we witnessed any significant transfer6of suitable technology to developing countries. While thedeveloping countries are ready to discharge theirobligations  developed countries balk at making theircontribution. The global partnership  which was so highlyadvocated and praised at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  is yet to be formed.We are nevertheless encouraged by the adoption lastAugust of the Draft Agreement for the Implementation ofthe Provisions of the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to theConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocksand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. We hope that thisAgreement  which will be opened for signature on4 December 1995  will ensure the long-term conservationand sustainable use of the living resources of the high seasidentified in Agenda 21. This Agreement and the largerUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  whichcame into force in November 1994  are important to thesustainable development of the fishing industry in smallStates such as ours. We urge their full observance andimplementation.Overall economic development remains the singlemost important challenge facing Member States and consequently  the United Nations. At various conferences including the World Summit for Social Development  whichwas held in Copenhagen  Denmark  last March  we haverepeatedly expressed our political will to address ourdiverse economic and social problems. We came away fromCopenhagen ready to act  but we remain uncertain as to theway forward. Now that the Beijing Conference on womenis behind us  the international community needs to summoneven greater determination if it is to translate into action thebold decisions we have taken in this series of importantsummit meetings. These decisions should now beconsolidated  and specific machinery set up for theirimplementation. It would indeed be a great pity if thepainfully negotiated results of these high-level deliberationswere left to evaporate.The great divide between rich and poor  both amongand within nations  must be considered a threat to worldpeace. The plight of developing countries  particularly theleast-developed countries  compels urgent action. Theproblems of development  or rather of underdevelopment can no longer be dealt with adequately on an ad hoc andpiecemeal basis or through questionable structural-adjustment measures. What is required is fundamentalreform of the international economic system  whichcontinues to marginalize developing countries into aposition of perpetual dependence. It is necessary to definenew strategies and to agree on new modalities to reversethe present inequities in international economic relations.The developing countries are willing to do their partin providing an environment favourable to growth.However  they urgently need significant debt relief greater financial investment flows  the transfer ofappropriate technology  the elimination of tariff andnon-tariff barriers and just remuneration for commoditiesand raw materials. These are not new prescriptions; theyare generally known to be essential for development.Thus far  however  developed countries have evincednotable reluctance to follow them  preferring instead todispense small amounts of bilateral aid. Most of themhave now further reduced this limited assistance. The rootproblems therefore remain unresolved.The signing  in Marrakesh in 1994  of the UruguayRound agreements has provided some hope that theplaying-field for international trade will be levelled toinduce the participation of developing countries. Therecently created World Trade Organization  if properlyoriented  may be able to provide a rule-based system thatcould encourage such participation. There is much to besaid for the introduction of predictability into internationaleconomic relations  and we should therefore work toensure that it is provided in whatever agreements wereach. The “Agenda for Development”  which we are inthe process of elaborating  must embody the rights andobligations accepted by the parties.In this context  Guyana attaches great importance tothe conclusion of work on the Agenda. We view theAgenda as an overarching framework for internationalcooperation for development. We are therefore concernedthat  while we work to establish the framework  weshould also secure the necessary commitment of resourcesfor effective implementation. In this regard  we believethat South-South cooperation should be considered as anintegral and important element of internationalcooperation for development. International support forgreater South-South cooperation cannot but enhance theprospects for world development  thereby increasing thepotentialities of interdependence and partnership.Economic growth cannot be sustained for longunless each individual citizen and each individualcommunity has a stake in that growth and is empoweredto take an active part in the development process.Moreover  economic growth would be meaningless if itwere not equitably distributed. A society cannot findfulfilment in growth. Indeed  the development process7itself is severely hampered if a society does not takeadequate care of its vulnerable groups: women  children ethnic minorities  the handicapped and the homeless.Development must therefore have a social dimension.Conscious of this need  the President of Guyana His Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan  has advanced the conceptof a new global human order. An essential feature of thisorder would be the consensus that has now emerged inrespect of development and governance  the role of theState and the market and sustainable environmentalism.While this consensus is to be welcomed  it is attended bynew social  economic and political problems which willeffectively prevent it from taking us forward. The solutionof these problems calls for a new global commitment tohuman ideals and universal human development. In his ownaddress to the Assembly  President Jagan will expand onthis proposal with a view to securing an appropriatedeclaration on a new global order to which all States cansubscribe.As I said at the outset of my statement  we must notbe content with merely celebrating the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. The critical situation in which theworld now finds itself demands from us a supreme effort tomake full use of the opportunities which this historicalconjuncture offers. The possibilities of interdependence andinternational cooperation have never been greater. We oweit to ourselves and to future generations to grasp the chancewe now have for creating a truly just and humane societyof nations."
"68",2995,"HND",50,1995,"I wish to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral on his election to the presidency of the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. His experience andproven diplomatic skills will guarantee the success of thisimportant event. I wish also to congratulate hispredecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  for the brilliant way inwhich he guided the work of the Assembly at its forty-ninth session.I take this special opportunity also to acknowledgethe extraordinary work of the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to promote peace development and understanding among peoples.In conformity with the premises of the moralrevolution led by the President of the Republic Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina  today’s Honduras is making aunique effort: to consolidate a State truly based on law;to fight corruption at all levels; to encourage activeparticipation among all citizens in a framework ofnational convergence that will define the guidelines for anew country; to emphasize absolute respect for humanrights; and  in the context of a dynamic process ofmodernizing the State  to adopt substantive institutionallegal measures and changes  with a view to strengtheningour democratic  pluralistic system of government.Those changes include strengthening the judicialbranch; placing the national police under civilianjurisdiction; transforming our compulsory military serviceinto voluntary  educational and humanistic service;allocating 35 per cent of the national budget to health education and social welfare  which reflects the interest ofthe State in combating poverty  overcoming socialproblems and establishing a system of governmentmarked by justice  solidarity and participation; adoptingfiscal correction measures to decrease the negative impactof serious long-standing macroeconomic imbalances;beginning the privatization of State-owned enterprises;undertaking financial reform; and taking the action neededto attract direct foreign investment and encourage jointinvestment.Those are some of the most relevant actions takenby the Government of Honduras; they show that  althoughour democracy was painfully stricken by the Central27American crisis of the 1980s  it has had the courage to faceup the unique challenges of today and of tomorrow.Today  Central America is seeking true participationin the new international economic order with an agenda ofintegration firmly based on the Alliance for the SustainableDevelopment of Central America. This endeavour is rootedin history  tradition  solidarity and  above all  an awarenessof the common destiny of our Central American homeland.In that connection  we were pleased that last year theGeneral Assembly recognized“the importance of implemented  updated and pendingprogrammes  and  in view of the fact that theresources assigned to the Special Plan of EconomicCooperation for Central America have been used up request[ed] the agencies of the United Nations system in particular the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  and international institutions to mobilizethe necessary resources to set in motion new nationaland regional programmes in support of the content ofthe Declaration of Guácimo  the Alliance for theSustainable Development of Central Americaconcluded at the Managua Summit  and theTegucigalpa Commitments on Peace and Developmentadopted at the International Conference on Peace andDevelopment in Central America”. (resolution 49/137 para. 23)We were grateful for the adoption of that resolution  andhope that its mandate will be renewed at this session of theGeneral Assembly.In pursuance of our efforts at integration  my countrywill host the next summit of Central American Presidents where the central topic will be the establishment of aregulatory framework for the security of individuals andtheir belongings  and the signing of a treaty on CentralAmerican democratic security.In our region we can no longer delay the creation ofshort-term programmes of direct investment  industrialrevitalization  transformation of technology and foreigntrade  with the necessary support of developed countries.That support can come through the alliance of Statesfriendly to the Alliance for the Sustainable Development ofCentral America  as was the case initially with the CentralAmerica-United States agreement (CONCAUSA).Central America supports open regionalism; as set outin the plan of action of the Summit for the Americas  webelieve that free trade is the most appropriate way toestablish the world’s most extensive free-trade area.The Central American Integration System (SICA) which resulted from our own efforts and from importantcooperation by the international community  hopes thatthe General Assembly will grant it the status ofpermanent observer in accordance with relevantprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Thatstatus would facilitate and broaden cooperation betweenthe United Nations system and the Central AmericanIntegration System; I am grateful for the support for thedraft resolution that Central American countries havejointly submitted to the Assembly for consideration.It is my country’s tradition always to try to solve itsinternational conflicts by peaceful  diplomatic means. Iam therefore pleased to announce that  in compliance withthe opinion of the International Court of Justice at TheHague concerning the boundary dispute betweenHonduras and El Salvador  a binational commission hasbeen established to resolve the humanitarian implicationsof its implementation; its work is being carried outparallel to that of boundary demarcation. It is the honestwish of the people and the Government of Honduras toconclude these priority tasks without delay.Nor is Honduras indifferent to the problems of oursister Republics  especially those of Guatemala. We wishto acknowledge the achievements and commitments of theGovernment of that country and of the UnidadRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) towardspeace. We urge them to persist in a peaceful  negotiatedquest for a solution to their internal differences.My country endorses all the principles set out in theSecretary-General’s “An Agenda for Development” which recognizes that equitable development removesmany of the social and political conditions that result inthreats to peace. Most important  it stresses that thehuman being is the ultimate beneficiary of all effortstowards development and international cooperation.Clearly  “An Agenda for Development” mustencourage the implementation of agreements reached inthe economic and social sphere. In that context  mycountry has decided to endorse the principles andimplement the commitments set out in the Declarationadopted by Heads of State or Government at the WorldSummit for Social Development  held at Copenhagen Denmark  in March this year. We consider thatimplementation of the Programme of Action is urgent 28with a view to establishing a framework for economicgrowth and sustainable development  and a national andinternational climate favourable to social development  tothe elimination of poverty  to increasing productiveemployment  to reducing unemployment and to fosteringsocial integration.Only by attaining these goals can we achieve lastingpeace and security  economic progress and the socialemancipation of all mankind. We therefore appeal to theinternational community  and especially to developedcountries and international organizations  to fulfil theircommitment to transfer significant economic andtechnological resources to developing countries.Similarly  the Government of Honduras gives highpriority to speedy compliance with commitments andrecommendations made at the United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development  held at Rio de Janeiroin 1992. We note  however  the lack of adequate resourcesto implement the programmes and projects adopted as partof Agenda 21. We hope that developed countries will meettheir commitments  to enable developing countries to meettheir own.Honduras reiterates its commitment to meet the goalsof the World Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at theWorld Summit for Children. My country is a signatory ofthe Convention on the Rights of the Child  and  as part ofits national programmes  has adopted policies aimed atattaining the goals set in the Plan of Action. OurGovernment considers that all boys and girls must enjoyfundamental human rights such as access to education andto health services. One of our priorities is to eliminatefamily poverty  which is a principal cause of theexploitation of children and infant mortality.The Government of Honduras also participated in theFourth World Conference on Women  held at Beijing. Weare convinced that the Declaration and Plan of Actionadopted there will make a further contribution to women’sparticipation in political  civil  economic  social and culturallife and in sustainable development.The recent conference on review and extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)came at important time in history: when the internationalcommunity is marking the end of the cold war  an eventwhich eased international tension and strengthenedconfidence between States. My country reiterates itscommitment to the principles and objectives adopted at thereview Conference. We remain convinced that the ultimategoal is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons andthe adoption of a treaty on general and completedisarmament under strict  effective international control.The Government of Honduras attaches greatimportance to preventive diplomacy and to the peacefulsettlement of international disputes. We believe it is betterto prevent conflicts through early warning machinery andgood-offices diplomatic efforts than to use political andmilitary action to try to stop them once they have started.We attach equal importance to the building andmaintenance of international peace and security  especiallythrough humanitarian activities that involve the urgentsolution of the tragedy of thousands of persons displacedand uprooted from their homes and land. Hence  wereiterate our support for the proposals andrecommendations made by the Secretary-General in “AnAgenda for Peace” and in the Supplement to “An Agendafor Peace”.The Government of Honduras considers that thestrengthening of peace  the fundamental objective of theUnited Nations  can be achieved only through completerespect for the provisions of the Charter. For peace-keeping operations to be successful  they must be basedon the principles of international law: non-intervention inthe internal affairs of States  and the non-use of forceexcept in self-defence. Moreover  they should becontrolled by the United Nations; peace-keepingoperations and their mandates must be clearly defined.They should be funded in a timely way and must aboveall have the consent of the States involved  which in turnmust not raise obstacles and must cooperate fully withthese operations.In the context of the peaceful solution ofinternational conflicts  it is vital to encourage greatercooperation and coordination between the United Nationsand regional organizations. International crises can beresolved effectively if we strengthen the variousmechanisms and procedures through which suchcooperation takes place.We know that the United Nations continues to facefinancial problems with a direct impact on peace-keepingoperations. Hence  the current machinery for financingmust be reformed  taking account of the capacity of Statesto pay and ensuring that the availability of resources foreconomic and social development is not endangered.In January this year  with particular interest and ina constructive spirit  we began participating for the first29time in the work of the Security Council. Our participationis shaped by respect for sovereignty and for the principle ofthe self-determination of peoples  and by our commitmentto the defence and promotion of human rights and peace.Aware of its responsibilities and within its modestmeans  Honduras has from the outset contributed to theUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in WesternSahara (MINURSO). We have also sent an infantrycontingent to help with the humanitarian activities of theUnited Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). We aredetermined to continue our participation in such missions insupport of peace  security and international humanitarianlaw.In the Security Council we have given our full supportto the Middle East peace process. We hope that the ongoingnegotiations will lead to the establishment of lasting peacein the region.We are deeply saddened by the situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina in particular  and in neighbouring countries aswell. We condemn the attempts at “ethnic cleansing” andgenocide against the civilian population. We therefore hopethat recent peace efforts in the region will bear fruit especially following the agreement reached at Geneva onbasic principles for the peaceful settlement of the conflict.Progress in Angola  Liberia and Rwanda makes usoptimistic about peacemaking in those countries. UnitedNations participation has been vital in that progress  and wetherefore unreservedly support it. We hope that in the endthese countries will achieve the reconciliation that willenable them to begin their tasks of national reconstructionand development.On 26 June 1945  50 nations  including my own  withhigh hopes  signed the Charter of the United Nations at SanFrancisco. In 1995 we are full of joy at commemorating thefiftieth anniversary of the founding of an Organization thathas unquestionably served the interests of universalitythrough its gradual expansion. This is also an apt occasionto ponder why all the expectations and dreams of thefounders have not yet been met  and to define the missionthe United Nations must carry out on the threshold of anew millennium.To address the question of the efficiency andeffectiveness of the United Nations system with greaterdynamism and realism  the international community hasmade unprecedented demands for redefinition of the tasksof the system in the areas of international security and thepromotion of the economic and social development ofMembers.The end of the century approaches; a newmillennium awaits us. We must therefore assess all thathas come before; make an in-depth analysis of theweaknesses and strengths  the successes and failures ofthe Organization; and with realism and fairness set anagenda for the future that will topple injustice exterminate poverty and throttle warlike tendencies andthat will bolster the foundations of a truly unified humanistic and fair world order.It is painful to see the weakening of the highexpectations created by the collapse of bipolar relations.There have been no substantive changes in the behaviourof highly developed countries towards the less developedareas of the planet. We note with concern a wish toreplace the old order with a new  ominous bipolar world:a world of countries that enjoy plenty  and of countriesthat are enmired in poverty and destitution. We must notpermit this fatal design to be carried out. Let us show thatwe can still imagine and create a different  prosperousworld that will include us all.Let us hope that the new millennium will see themiracle of international coexistence based on peace brotherhood and universal well-being. Otherwise  therewill be no further chance to see the light of hope for abetter future; to use the words of the Honduran poetRoberto Sosa  we will live forever in “a world divided forall”."
"69",3019,"HRV",50,1995,"Let me first extend my heartfeltcongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on hiselection to the distinguished office from which he willguide the work of the fiftieth session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly. I am confident that his experience andcommitment to the noble principles of the United NationsCharter will guarantee that this session will be marked bynew vigour  commitment and determination. I wish toexpress our gratitude also to his predecessor  Mr. AmaraEssy  for the fine  skilful manner in which he presided overthe work of the last session of the General Assembly.The world we live in has been deeply and positivelyaffected by the end of the cold war and nationalemancipation in Central and Eastern Europe  and WesternAsia. Many hotbeds of crisis have been extinguished or areon the way to being resolved  from Eastern Asia and SouthAfrica to the Middle East.However  many problems having a negative impact oninternational relations remain unresolved  including thecrisis in south-eastern Europe. Most disquieting are thedangers of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction especially nuclear weapons. The world is still faced withvarious forms of terrorism. There is a grave dangerresulting from the illicit trade in narcotics. Widespreadabuses of human rights continue as do the problems ofracism  anti-Semitism  xenophobia  and national andreligious intolerance. The solution to the problem ofunderdevelopment requires more concerted and coordinatedefforts.In order to be able to deal with the many problemsfacing the world  it is necessary to have a vital and efficientUnited Nations.Following the end of the cold war there was a periodof optimism  renewed hope and expectation that the UnitedNations would finally play the role which had beenenvisaged for it at the time of its founding  almost 50 yearsago. However  we have recently experienced severedisappointment at the inability of the United Nations tofulfil all these expectations; this has resulted in the loss ofcredibility by the United Nations.The causes for its loss of credibility are many andvaried  and among the most important is the failure ofmany United Nations peace-keeping operations to achievetheir assigned goals. This is not to say that there have notbeen successful United Nations peace-keeping missions; thisis evident from the operations in Cambodia and southernAfrica.One way in which the peace-keeping orpeacemaking missions of the United Nations could beimproved is by the establishment of a United Nationsmilitary force of a more permanent nature or one thatcould be assembled quickly  consisting of contingentsfrom specific countries or regional arrangements. Such aforce should be constructed in such a way as to makesure that its national contingents acted to implementSecurity Council resolutions and not to promote thepolicies of their States. In this regard I wish to expressthe Republic of Croatia’s interest in providing troops forUnited Nations peace-keeping operations.However  in order to make the peace-keepingfunctions of the United Nations more effective it isnecessary to reform the body which is primarilyresponsible for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity — the Security Council. It is also important thatthe composition of the Security Council reflect the newpolitical and economic realities which have emerged sinceits formation after the Second World War. Due regardmust also be given to proper geographical balance as wellas to the increase in the membership of the UnitedNations. Making the Security Council more representativeand democratic will also enhance its credibility as it willthen be a more legitimate body representing the will ofthe international community. This will no doubt serve tofacilitate the implementation of its resolutions.In this regard  the Republic of Croatia supports anincrease in the number of both the permanent andnon-permanent members of the Security Council to apoint which will not negatively affect its effectiveness. Iwish to reiterate Croatia’s support for the admission ofGermany and Japan as permanent members of theSecurity Council due to the actual  as well as potential contribution of these two countries to the cause ofinternational peace and security and to other aspects ofthe work of the United Nations. Additionally  seriousconsideration should be given to the possibility of one ormore developing countries from Asia  Africa or LatinAmerica being granted permanent-member status.Despite the various setbacks which I have alreadyreferred to  the United Nations still has a critical role toplay in resolving many of the world’s problems especially in regard to the environment and sustainabledevelopment.17In addition to economic well-being  equal attentionshould be paid to respect for the human rights of each andevery individual. In this regard  Croatia reiterates itssupport for the work of the High Commissioner for HumanRights  Mr. José Ayalo Lasso  and commends the mannerin which he has been performing his duty. As a furthermethod of combating gross violations of human rights andinternational humanitarian law  Croatia supports theestablishment of an international criminal court in the formof an apolitical legal organ of the international community.By its geographical position  history  socio-culturalfeatures  and political and economic orientation  theRepublic of Croatia is a part of both Central Europe andthe Mediterranean. As a European country in transition Croatia has already achieved significant progress in thedevelopment of democratic institutions and adherence tointernationally accepted standards concerning the rule oflaw and protection of human rights. It is also worth notingthat the economic situation has been stabilized and evenimproved during the past two years  despite the extremelydifficult conditions caused by Serbian aggression. Ournational development strategy is outward-oriented  while thesocial policies and legal framework are based on theprinciples of pluralistic democracy  including anopen-market economy.As a country of European civilization and tradition Croatia’s strategic  political  economic and social orientationis clearly focused on active participation in the process ofEuropean integration. Croatia’s harmonization withEuropean legislation and criteria represents a crucial part ofits national development. While Croatia is already amember of various European intergovernmental andinterregional organizations  the forging of closer relationswith the European Union  as well as full membership in theCouncil of Europe  are the basic pillars of Croatia’sEuropean policy. However  Croatia will seek to adopt anapproach to reflecting a balance between its Europeanorientation and its wider global cooperation on amultilateral and bilateral basis.The Republic of Croatia endeavours to contribute tolasting peace and durable stability in south-eastern Europe which can be achieved only by the normalization ofrelations among all States based on full and strict respectfor and adherence to the principles of the inviolability ofinternational borders  the territorial integrity of all Statesand the rights of minorities.Croatia has effectively assumed its role as anindispensable factor in the search for peace  stability andsecurity. In this sense  Croatia will continue to cooperateconstructively with the relevant international forums andleading institutions or countries with a view to finding apolitical solution to the present crisis in the region.In this respect — and bearing in mind the nature ofthe crisis and that its underlying cause has been andremains Serbian aggression — Croatia will continue tocooperate closely and coordinate its political  military anddiplomatic activities with the Republic and Federation ofBosnia and Herzegovina  on the basis of the WashingtonAgreements and other bilateral agreements andarrangements such as the Split Declaration. This isbecause one of the prerequisites for ensuring long-termstability and progress for Croatia is the settlement of thecrisis in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.Thanks to the clarity and transparency of its nationalagenda  the decisiveness of its political leadership and itscooperation with the international community in pursuitof its vital national interests  Croatia has succeeded overthe course of several years in reintegrating most of itsoccupied territories  paving the way for the return ofsome 110 000 displaced persons and refugees to theirhomes  as well as in revitalizing energy and transportcommunications throughout the country.Croatia has also managed in very difficultcircumstances to reach reasonable stability and to enjoyincreased prospects for further development and thestrengthening of the democratic system and institutions combined with a significant level of economicstabilization.Since the outbreak of the crisis in south-easternEurope Croatia has constantly advocated a negotiatedpeaceful solution  with the active support and fullparticipation of the international community  and on thebasis of the principles of the United Nations Charter andinternational law.Special emphasis has been placed on the imperativeof fully regulating and normalizing Croat-Serb relations.Future relations between these two States are ofparamount importance for lasting stability in south-easternEurope. At the same time  Croatia is actively contributingto the quest for a solution to the issue of theBosniac-Muslim people  one that would ensure theirnational rights and provide stability for the region.Furthermore  in the interests of ensuring long-termsecurity and stability  Croatia has advocated the need forthe introduction of the confidence- and security- building18measures of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE).Croatia has always done its utmost to enable theinternational community to pursue its peace efforts and hasconsistently demonstrated utmost restraint in resorting to theuse of force. When we had to use force  our militaryalways strove to minimize the loss of life and the extent ofdestruction and to enable the international community topursue its peace efforts. Croatian military operations havealways been in self-defence and in response to theintransigence and non-cooperation of the rebel Croatian-Serb leadership  to the inability of the United Nationspeace-keeping forces to fulfil their mandate  to completedeadlock in international mediating efforts  or to directprovocations and terrorist attacks against civilians from therebel Serb side.In the aftermath of the liberation of almost one fifth ofour country in August  isolated instances of unlawfulbehaviour and human rights abuses have been recorded. MyGovernment strongly condemns all such individual acts andhas initiated proceedings against the perpetrators.Croatia believes that its military operations during thefirst week of August  on both sides of the Croatian-Bosnianborder  have substantially changed the balance of powerand in so doing have created a window of opportunity forrevitalization of the ongoing peace process. Croatia is of theopinion that the joint effects of Operation Storm  thecoordinated activities of the army of Bosnia andHerzegovina and HVO (Croatian Defence Council) units and the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) rapid reaction force against the Bosnian Serbs coupled with diplomatic efforts  have finally opened theway to serious and comprehensive peace negotiations which will eventually lead to a realistic  balanced andlasting solution to the crisis.Croatia fully supports the current United States peaceinitiative and the increased decisiveness of the internationalcommunity  manifested particularly by the United Nationsand NATO rapid-reaction force operations and pressureagainst the Bosnian Serbs.Croatia’s major interest with regard to Bosnia andHerzegovina is in achieving a lasting peace and justsettlement of the conflict that would be satisfactory to theconstituent peoples and that would ensure stability alongCroatian borders; the survival  safety and dignified life ofthe Bosnian Croats; and mutually beneficial relations andcooperation between the two friendly neighbouringcountries.Therefore  Croatia strongly supports theimplementation of the Washington Agreements and theSplit Declaration and the strengthening of the Federationof Bosnia and Herzegovina and its association withCroatia at various levels and in various areas ofcooperation.The prerequisites for lasting stability  security andcooperation in the region include a just and lastingsolution to the crisis  reconstruction and development ofthe countries in the region  normalization of relationsbetween all successor States of the former Yugoslavia onthe basis of equal succession and introduction of a newregional order as an integral part of the new Europeansecurity system.It is Croatia’s firm position that the solution for thepeaceful reintegration of the remaining occupiedterritories of Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and WesternSrijem and the former United Nations ConfidenceRestoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) Sector Eastmust be an integral part of the overall peaceful resolutionof the crisis in the region  in both Bosnia andHerzegovina and Croatia  within the time-frame of thecurrent peace initiative and the expiration date of theUNCRO mandate. Without progress in the solution of thisissue  progress in the settlement of the crisis in Bosniaand Herzegovina cannot be envisaged  and neither canany real stabilization of the situation in south-easternEurope.Deeply committed to peaceful reintegration  Croatiais willing to immediately open meaningful andconstructive talks with the representatives of the Serbpopulation in Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and WesternSrijem that should lead to the re-establishment ofCroatia’s full sovereignty  the return of forcibly displacedpersons to their homes and respect  in accordance withhigh European standards  for the minority rights of theSerbs and other minority ethnic or nationalcommunities — Slovak  Hungarian  Ukrainian andothers — in this area.To this end Croatia has already proposed to the localSerbs and the Government of the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  through the good offices of the internationalmediators  a comprehensive  elaborate and concrete peaceplan in the form of a draft agreement on the peacefulreintegration of Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and Western19Srijem into the constitutional and economic system of theRepublic of Croatia.Implementation of the proposed agreement must beginwith the immediate withdrawal of all military andparamilitary groups not originally from this region  to befollowed by the disarming and disbanding  under UNCROsupervision  of the military and paramilitary groupscomposed of persons who reside in the area.Upon signing the agreement on the peacefulreintegration of the remaining occupied areas  the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia wouldrecognize each other within their internationally recognizedborders and diplomatic relations between these two Stateswould be established at the ambassadorial level. This wouldbe followed shortly by the reopening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway and railways  the river traffic along theDanube and Sava rivers  the Adriatic pipeline’s outlet toSerbia and telecommunications between Croatia and theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.The proposed draft agreement provides ample evidenceof Croatia’s sincere will and disposition to find a negotiatedand just solution to the reintegration of the remainingoccupied territories  providing for the legitimate rights ofCroatia as a sovereign State and of all its citizens  includingits minorities. Along these lines  Croatia participated in theContact Group negotiations in Geneva and New York.Following these negotiations  I am moderately optimisticthat the resolution of the crisis and peace in the region canbe achieved in the near future.However  there is no doubt that progress towards alasting  just and comprehensive peace is contingent on thecontinued  determined and coordinated efforts of theinternational community in the maintenance of a globalapproach to the current peace initiative and the continuationof the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime.In the next several weeks the parties and the internationalcommunity have to work out a framework  in the form ofa package  for the peace accord  which should includeseveral interrelated steps: a solution for Bosnia andHerzegovina; a resolution of the issue of Eastern Slavonialeading to its reintegration into Croatia; mutual recognition within their international borders  between Bosnia andHerzegovina  Croatia and the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia; and changes in the sanctions regime against theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia as the internationalcommunity deems appropriate. Upon the acceptance of sucha plan  the road to lasting peace and stability will beopened.On behalf of my Government  I would like to thankagain all the countries contributing troops to the UNCROoperations in Croatia and underscore our appreciation oftheir efforts to aid the peace process. Croatia deeplyregrets the loss of life and the injuries sustained bymembers of the United Nations force during their missionin Croatia. Their noble sacrifice will always beremembered and cherished by the Croatian people.In the name of my Government  I am particularlyproud to thank the General Assembly for havingsupported the cause of Croatia  most of all by adoptingresolution 49/43  concerning the occupied territories ofCroatia. I kindly ask the Assembly to remain steadfast inthe contribution it has made through this importantresolution and through the individual and collectiveengagement of most Members’ Governments to the searchfor a just and lasting peace for Croatia and Bosnia andHerzegovina  as well as for the whole of south-easternEurope."
"70",3064,"HTI",50,1995,"With 15 October 1995 only a few days away — the firstanniversary of the restoration of the democratic process inHaiti — I am pleased on behalf of the Government andpeople of Haiti to extend our greetings to the internationalcommunity gathered here and our wishes for a long life tothe United Nations  which is playing an ever more decisiverole in the lives of our peoples.I should like to extend my warmest congratulations toHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal onhis election to the presidency of this fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly and extend my best wishes for hissuccess in the exercise of his important duties.I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister for Foreign Affairsof Côte d’Ivoire  for the wisdom and ability he showed inconducting the work of the forty-ninth session.Allow me also to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his effective management as Secretary-Generalof our Organization. His thorough knowledge of theissues and his proposals contained in the Agenda forPeace and the Agenda for Development have enabled himto make a significant contribution to the thinking onreforming the Organization with a view to making it morecapable of facing the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury.This session of the General Assembly coincides withour commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations. More than any other  thissession is destined to affect the history of ourOrganization because of the reflection this anniversarywill certainly inspire with regard to its future.Fifty years have elapsed since 51 States  includingmy own  the Republic of Haiti  recognizing the absoluteneed to take collective action to work for peace development and social progress  decided to found theUnited Nations. From its inception  the United Nationshas been a focus of the aspirations and hopes of peoplesworld wide for a more peaceful future and a morepromising tomorrow.Throughout the half century of its existence theOrganization has exerted great efforts to achieve the goalsset forth in the Charter. It has addressed a broad range ofcomplex international problems and has  in many cases been able to find a satisfactory solution to them.Thus  the United Nations has distinguished itself in thedecisive role it has played in the decolonization process  inthe strengthening of international security and in therestoration of peace in many parts of the world. It has alsocontributed to the development of international law.Through a series of global conferences  it has progressedtowards an international consensus on such world problemsas the environment  population  human rights  the status ofwomen  the rights of the child  sustainable development andmany other fundamental questions.Quite recently  United Nations activities in support ofpeace have taken on added scope with the increase inpeace-keeping operations  some of which have met withoutstanding success — operations in Cambodia  in ElSalvador or in my own country  Haiti  where the jointaction of the United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States brought about a return of constitutionalorder and thereby provided eloquent testimony to thissuccess.In that connection allow me on behalf of the peopleand Government of Haiti to express to the internationalcommunity our gratitude for its support and its contributionto the restoration of the democratic process in Haiti. Thanksto you  Haiti now has a valid peace; political stability is onthe verge of becoming a reality; and the security of Haitiansociety is a virtual fact.You helped us to emerge from a period of turbulenceand to create in our country conditions favourable to peaceand development  replacing the repression under which wehad lived for the three years of coup d’état. Once again  Iwish to express the deep gratitude of the Haitian people tothe great family of the United Nations and to each of thenations that  in one way or another  provided support forthe return of constitutional order.In this connection I should like to share with theAssembly the work our Government has accomplishedsince its restoration.One year after the return of President Jean-BertrandAristide to Haiti  significant progress has been achieved inall spheres of national activity. The Government has madeit a point of honour to draw the Assembly’s attention to thefact that the rights of all Haitians are scrupulouslyrespected  freedom of expression and association isguaranteed  our institutions have resumed their normalfunctioning  the scheduled legislative and municipalelections have been carried out  and insecurity in bothtowns and countryside has noticeably diminished.In achieving that result the Government had to adoptmeasures that were vigorous but welcomed by the vastmajority of the population. Among others  I would citethe dismantling of the corps of section heads and theirauxiliaries  the demobilization of the armed forcespending approval by Parliament of their dissolution  theestablishment of a new national police force in keepingwith the wishes expressed in the 1987 Constitution  thecreation of the National Magistrature School and theNational Penitentiary Administration. All of thosemeasures enjoyed the wholehearted assistance of theUnited Nations Mission in Haiti  which has been aninvaluable partner in the restoration of democraticprocesses in Haiti.To strengthen the population’s confidence in theprocess of national reconciliation the Government has setup a National Commission for Truth and Justice to shedlight on the atrocities committed during the three years ofcoup d’état  and that Commission has made greatprogress in its work.In addition  the Government has understood the needto go further in making reparations and combating theacceptance of impunity. In a Decree of 29 September1995  the Government decided to allocate 20 per cent ofthe budget of the Ministry of Justice to victims of thecoup d’état and to provide them with legal aid in bringingcases and prosecuting criminals. Such measuresdemonstrate a determination to put an end to impunityand to render justice to those to whom justice is due.Thus  we are firmly and irreversibly committed todemocracy. There are still some problems to be solved but no one can question the enormous progressaccomplished since 15 October 1994. The struggle for theestablishment of a democratic State in Haiti continueswith ever-greater determination. However  there can be noviable democracy without sustained economicdevelopment. In Haiti  the link between democracy anddevelopment is fundamental  affecting as it does the verysurvival of our nation.In this connection the Haitian Government has givenpride of place to two major approaches that define thenational development policy  namely  regeneration of thespace some 8 million inhabitants will share before the endof the century  and universal education.Natural resources — restored  revived and protectedfrom continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation —must be managed by citizens  families and communities 2who shall learn to acquire know-how  to share knowledge to spread information  and to tap both the vast  excitingstockpile of human knowledge and their own rich nationalculture. Through formal and non-formal education and byusing all training and information technologies  we mustmeet the needs of our population  from elementaryeducation to command of the high technology appropriateto our development.It is easy to see that  because of their importance those two fundamental decisions will involve redefining allsectoral and non-sectoral policies and programmes. It isalong these lines that we shall define policies of direct Statemanagement  fiscal  monetary  budgetary  public-investment  public-administration  public-enterprisemanagement  credit and other policies  as well as policiesthat demand a degree of partnership with various sectors ofthe nation. When the conditions are met we will be able toengage in a process of restoring social balance through animproved sharing of national wealth. From there we shallmove gradually to narrow the gap between the individualincomes of different groups. If the State uses the means andthe tools at its disposal  especially fiscal and creditmeasures  it should be possible to hasten this movement.With the support of the international community ournation is working with high hopes to build a State based onlaw and to restore the fabric of our national economy.The example of Haiti  which I have just described along with other successes achieved by the United Nationsover the past 50 years  must not hide the reality of a worldfar from fully achieving the objectives of peace and socialprogress for all that were the dream of our forerunners.Despite the end of the cold war  which has lessened theprobability of nuclear conflict  the Earth continues to be anarena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakablesuffering and vast humanitarian tragedies. In Bosnia andHerzegovina  Rwanda  Burundi  Georgia and Liberia toname but a few  wars born for the most part of ethnic religious or tribal antagonisms seem to resist any attempt atsolution by the international community. It is true that therehas been significant progress with respect to certain crises such as those of the Middle East and Angola  and myGovernment joyfully welcomes this. But the persistence ofsuch conflicts dampens our hopes for the establishment ofa lasting peace.In that context  I want to recall the threat that mankindstill faces from stockpiles of nuclear weapons and otherweapons of mass destruction. My delegation hopes that thenuclear-weapon States will keep the promises they made atthe 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Partiesto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  with respect to ridding the planet ofnuclear weapons. The conclusion of a nuclear-test-bantreaty  next year we hope  would be an important steptowards that goal.One of the ideas developed by the Secretary-Generalin his “Agenda for Peace” is that peace cannot be viablewithout development. It is acknowledged that a basiccause of instability and conflict throughout the world isincreasingly flagrant social and economic disparities andthe destitution afflicting a large part of mankind.In many speeches  the Secretary-General has saidthat the globalization of problems requires globalsolutions  whether in the sphere of the environment migrations  development or international security. It isalso time to adopt a comprehensive approach to thecollateral effects of inevitable structural adjustment. Atimid step in that direction was taken at the Halifaxsummit of the seven most highly industrialized countries but what is needed most is greater participation by thecountries of the South in the international economicsystem with a view to defusing the fearsome “socialbomb” described at the Copenhagen World Summit forSocial Development.Let us remember how vulnerable our countries —especially small island States — are to natural disasters.This year  the Caribbean region has been the victim of anunprecedented number of hurricanes and tropical storms which have caused significant damage to theinfrastructure of a number of countries  which have seenyears of effort shattered in a few hours or less. We extendour sympathy to our brother countries  and appeal to theinternational community to mobilize all the resourcesneeded for their rehabilitation. Clearly  small island Statesare not equipped to deal with such situations. Perhaps weshould consider a multilateral instrument that could limittheir effects on the lives and property of affectedpopulations. In that connection  we welcome the “WhiteBerets” initiative inspired by Argentina  of which Haitiwas the first beneficiary.In a world where the burden of globalization in allof its forms is increasingly being felt  the need for a newglobal contract is becoming more and more imperative  asa means to guarantee international peace and security. Atthe present time  many countries  including my own  arenot able to satisfy the most elementary needs of themajority of their population. With the increasing3globalization of markets  and the political  economic financial and cultural environment of the world  somecountries are achieving a degree of success  while othercountries continue to slip towards deterioration. The resultis that millions of men  women and children are living insubhuman poverty  without access to health care or toadequate nutrition.This is a timely occasion for our Organization to playits role as an instrument of solidarity and internationalcooperation  in keeping with the mandate that wasconferred on it 50 years ago. The implementation withoutdelay of the Copenhagen decisions would be desirable. Itshould be of concern that  otherwise  these situations wouldspill over national borders and become a source ofdestabilization on a world-wide scale. In that regard  let usrecall that sustainable development is the process thatguarantees economic  social  political and cultural progressfor the present population  and survival with happiness dignity  peace  democracy and justice for future generations.To the Bretton Woods institutions  we would say thatstructural adjustment programmes are useful only to theextent that they lead to actual development programmesbased on growth  full employment and equity  designed andcarried out primarily for the benefit of the mostdisadvantaged classes of society.This awareness  which implies the will to put forwarda new global contract  also prompts us  on behalf of theHaitian Government  to call upon the relevant forums  notonly to define and articulate once and for all the areas ofcommon interest in the various activities of theOrganization  but also to seek out the ways and means torelease the financial resources necessary to make theactions of our Organization more relevant.In the context of increased interdependence  which ischaracteristic of national policies — especially those ofthird world countries — the instruments used byinternational institutions and bilateral agreements determineany experience of a certain scope. For that reason  it is notjust support that we are requesting from our partners: weare asking them to share with us the experience ofaddressing these challenges. Let them have a stake andinvolvement — which is possible and even probable — inthe redefinition of their own instruments  which shouldchange if those instruments are to be equal to thechallenges which  for decades  have faced the world’sefforts to improve the world order.We can understand that changes in institutions of acertain size may give rise to much reluctance. And we ask:What are the risks to the international community if itengages in an experiment sufficiently limited not tofrighten us  yet sufficiently important to test thedesirability of extending it to more determining situationsand bringing about a significant institutional change?Our Organization is at a decisive crossroads in itshistory. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of itsfounding  we are faced increasingly with the problem ofthe financing of the Organization’s budget for theoperation of the system. From the experts’ reports  wehave already learned that the core resources of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) have shrunkby 15 per cent  and we have noted  with some fear  thatcontributions to various United Nations trust funds havebeen undergoing some decline for at least four years. Inthe long term  this process of regression in the area offinancial contributions will constitute a definite threat tothe various operations conducted by the United Nationssystem  whether it be in the field of peace-keeping or inthe area of development activities properly speaking.These considerations prompt us to ask the questionthat concerns all of us on this fiftieth anniversary  thequestion of the reform of the United Nations system. Atthe dawn of a twenty-first century that is so filled withpromise — but also so disturbing in certain respects —our Organization will increasingly be called upon to facecertain major challenges in the fields of ecology population  economics  information and the fight againstorganized crime. Faced with those daunting challenges some of which are as yet unknown or unimagined  it isimportant to restructure and to strengthen the basicframework of this universal Organization.The strengthening of the United Nations structureshould  we believe  be built around a legal  administrativeand institutional reform. In that respect  my Governmentwould ardently wish to see a reform of the SecurityCouncil  with respect both to its mode of operation  whichshould be more democratic  and to its membership  whichshould better reflect the diversity that characterizes thegreat family of the United Nations.In this regard  we invite all States to look into themost effective ways and means to cooperate with non-governmental organizations. We must acknowledge thefact that  increasingly  these organizations are serving asforums for reflection and initiatives in civil society andare becoming essential partners in the quest for a newworld of more human and integrated development.4One area of great concern to the Government of Haitiis the precarious nature of the present situation of manyrefugees  especially women and unaccompanied children who deserve special attention. Also  I take this opportunityto state our increasingly resolute opposition to any forcedrepatriation of refugees in violation of international legalinstruments that govern this question  including the 1951Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967Protocol. Discriminatory policies  racism and xenophobiawill only inflame an already tragic situation which has longtroubled our conscience. It is time for barbarism to giveway to civilization and for respect for human rights to beenjoyed by all  men and women  without distinction.The Government of the Republic of Haiti supports theplan to create an international criminal court to give effectto the principle of individual criminal responsibility in casesof serious and unacceptable violations of human rights.My Government is deeply alarmed at the scale of theillicit production of  trafficking in and abuse of narcoticsaround the world. In order to protect ourselves against thisscourge  it calls on producer and consumer States  transitcountries and those laundering drug money to give their fullsupport to the fight against this evil.Since the end of the cold war  a war that actually wasonly cold on the territories of the great Powers  the limitedconflicts that seemed to go along with the inherent situationthere have multiplied constantly. We must recognize thatonly the pretexts have changed. The real reasons for thoseconflicts  we repeat  are the maintenance of an excessivelyprofitable trade in conventional weapons.Today  the standing of a nation is not measured  andshould no longer be measured  by its economic power or itsmilitary arsenal. Today  a great nation must apply itself tosolving the problems of its people and those of mankind asa whole.In 1945  51 States created the United Nations  whoseintrinsic purpose was to maintain international peace andsecurity and to promote the economic development of all itsMembers. Fifty years later  as we take stock  the changesthat have taken place in the international arena only bearout the validity of these ideals of the founding fathers.The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations is an occasion for us to recognize thecapacities of this Organization and the need to reform it inorder to turn it into an increasingly effective instrument thatcan face the challenges of the twenty-first century to builda better world."
"71",3110,"HUN",50,1995,"May I extend ourcongratulations to you  Sir  upon your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at this historic fiftieth session. Thedelegation of Hungary stands ready to do its fair share inassisting you in the fulfilment of your importantresponsibilities.The 50-year-old United Nations is a living witness toour successes and failures. In many quarters  the questionis raised whether the United Nations has a credibilityproblem at this important juncture of its history. We haveto remind ourselves that the capacity of the United Nationsto act is nothing but the reflection of the will anddetermination of its Member States. With the euphoria overthe end of the cold war gone  we ought to take a hard lookat the role the United Nations is called upon to play in adramatically altered  often fluid international environmentwhere shared values may not automatically yieldconverging interests.The Charter provides us with valuable guidance fordistinguishing sound international order and stability fromthe expedience of appeasement. The question is whether theinternational community is always ready to act accordinglyby taking a firm stand against aggression  heinous crimesagainst humanity and flagrant infringements on the humanrights and fundamental freedoms of millions of individualsaround the globe.We believe that there can be no place for complacencywhen we witness devastating wars  lawlessness  thesuffering of civilian populations and widespread humanmisery. There is no positive answer to the questionwhether  in spite of the absence of the threat of a newworld catastrophe  we can keep our planet safe and secure.A fundamentally changed global political environment  asbipolarism fades away  cannot prevent the outbreak of localwars  internal conflicts or ethnic strife. The values andprinciples we hold so dear seem to be distant dreamsagainst the backdrop of horrors occurring in places remotefor some  but dangerously close to others.We have come to realize the growing importance ofeffective regional tools in addressing this new type ofmostly internal conflicts  where the rule of law andaccountable national administrations are often non-existent  where warlords and other unscrupulous leaderslead campaigns of intimidation  “ethnic cleansing” andgenocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred.Throughout the years  the United Nations has achieved anumber of important successes by brokering peaceagreements  conducting peace-keeping operations improving humanitarian situations and promoting nationalreconciliation.The world Organization is better equipped to dealwith traditional conflict situations. However  it has yet toprepare itself for meeting all the new and alarmingchallenges. While the United Nations cannot realisticallymanage all the crises occurring world wide  because of itsunique role and responsibility in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  it should seek tostrengthen global political consensus on the principles ofthe Charter  assist  through its preventive capacity  in theformulation of regional strategies and efforts and takedecisive action when regional or global security isseriously challenged.Today’s conflicts call for a more coherent yetdecentralized United Nations response capability.Streamlining and rationalizing the Organization should bethe order of the day  not only to eliminate waste andoverlap  but also to make the best use of existing politicaland financial resources. We also fully support theSecretary-General’s efforts to improve coordinationbetween United Nations organs and agencies with a viewto enhancing the early-warning  stand-by and rapid-reaction capacities of the Organization  which shouldfocus on all the political  security  social  economic-ecological  humanitarian and human rights areas of UnitedNations activity.As regards the reform efforts in general  one shouldbear in mind that agreement on such diverse issues as theelimination of the enemy-States clause from the Charteror the reform of the financing of peace-keeping operationscannot be achieved overnight. We hope that the9establishment of an open-ended working group of theGeneral Assembly  chaired by its President  will be animportant milestone in this highly complex endeavour. Wewelcome the important measures already implemented andare looking forward to others which are designed toenhance the transparency and effectiveness of thefunctioning of the Security Council.The main mission of the United Nations is to make theworld a safer place for all. After a series of United Nationsconferences on the most important global problems  such asenvironment  human rights  population and socialdevelopment  and the recently concluded World Conferenceon Women  we ought to focus our attention on the practicalimplementation of their recommendations.Earlier this year the international community extendedfor an indefinite period the validity of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Hungary hadsupported from the very beginning the idea of indefiniteextension  for we are convinced that this major internationalinstrument promotes stability by preventing the spread ofthe nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderlydevelopment of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes.We hope that the security guarantees given to thenon-nuclear States by the permanent members of theSecurity Council  as well as the prospects of a thoroughreview of the operation of the Treaty — including theobligations in the field of nuclear disarmament  especiallythe early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty —will open up further possibilities for progress in this area.The tragedy in the former Yugoslavia has revealed not only where brutality and the trampling of elementarynorms of international law and human behaviour can lead but also the devastating consequences of unwillingness toenforce the legitimate decisions of the internationalcommunity. What we have seen was that the SecurityCouncil  and consequently the United Nations as a whole was either unable or unwilling to follow through its ownresolutions  thus leaving the initiative to those whose onlyargument was and is naked force and the policy of the faitaccompli. The crisis in the Balkans is a serious and tragicreminder that the Security Council can preserve itsauthority and credibility only if there is a unity of actionwhich ensures the full and timely implementation of itsresolutions. Another important lesson to be drawn from thehandling of this crisis is that adequate early-warning andpreventive machineries should be put in place to forestallthe eruption of further tragedies and conflicts.The Republic of Hungary  being a neighbouringcountry to three of the new States that emerged on theterritory of the former Yugoslavia  is vitally interested inpeaceful and good-neighbourly cooperation with all ofthem and in the early settlement of the conflict bypolitical means  on the basis of the purposes andprinciples of the Charter  international law and theresolutions of the Security Council. In our view  a visibleand credible international presence  backed up byinternational resolve to guarantee the implementation ofdecisions taken  is essential for this purpose. We believethat no comprehensive and lasting arrangements can beworked out for this conflict if two  so far quite neglected factors are not taken fully into account.First  any solution should incorporate the humanrights dimension  including effective guarantees forminority rights in accordance with international standards.In this regard  I would like to pay tribute to the formerSpecial Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki  for his untiring effortsconsistently to uphold the values of our civilization.Neither massive economic assistance  nor a hugeinternational presence can make a real difference if thehuman rights questions are left unaddressed.Secondly  the security of the subregion  and  indeed of Europe as a whole  is threatened by massive armsstockpiles  mostly left over from the previous period when the former Yugoslavia — not being a party to theTreaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) —maintained significant armed forces  in fact  one of therelatively largest in Europe. It is of vital importance therefore  to work out  in the context of the settlement arrangements to reduce conventional armaments on theterritory of former Yugoslavia.The acquisition of territory by force and theaccompanying abhorrent phenomenon of “ethniccleansing” in the former Yugoslavia led to the destructionof entire regions. It triggered a forced populationmovement unseen in Europe since the Second WorldWar. Today  when we are about to enter the fifth year ofthe war and the diplomatic efforts to find a solution arecontinuing  we should not lose sight of politicalresponsibilities and personal accountabilities for theinitiation of this drama. The sick ideas of ethnically pure homogenous  single-nation States had started a viciouscycle of vengeance that claimed the lives of over 100 000people and forced millions of others to flee  many ofthem seeking refuge in neighbouring and other countries.In this regard  the settlement of refugees in new areas10traditionally inhabited by other national minorities in orderto change their century-old ethnic composition is contraryto international law. It is even more so if it is beingconducted by forcible means and through intimidation  ashas happened to the Croat and Hungarian minorities in theVojvodina province of Serbia.The Government of Hungary has  on severaloccasions  expressed its grave concern about the negativeimpact of the conflict on the ethnic composition of thepopulation concerned. From this rostrum  I should like tocall the attention of the international community again tothe need to elaborate a comprehensive settlement  in theframework of which the question of the refugees should beso resolved as to respect the interests of each and everyethnic community. Any settlement must include thedevelopment and implementation of agreements that ensurethe survival of these communities  respect their humanrights and fundamental freedoms  including minority rights and encourage the establishment of institutions thatguarantee those rights in the long run.The issue of human rights and fundamental freedomsremains in the forefront of our attention. Protection andpromotion of these rights is not only a voluntarilyundertaken obligation of all Members of the UnitedNations  but a responsibility the implementation of whichcan be legitimately scrutinized by the internationalcommunity. In Vienna  we closed the debate on theuniversality of human rights by adopting the document ofthe World Conference on Human Rights and restatinguniversality in its own right as our guiding principle sincethe proclamation of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The legitimate role of the United Nations acting indefence of human rights should therefore be supported andstrengthened.With renewed waves of human rights violationsoccurring worldwide  mostly in internal conflicts or ethnicstrife  our Organization has to step up its early-warning andpreventive capacities  develop an integrated responsemechanism encompassing field visits and monitors  a closerintegration of the human rights element in peace-keepingactivities and ensuring effective interaction in theimplementation of political  peace-keeping  human rightsand humanitarian mandates. International presence particularly preventive protection  is a most efficientdeterrent in curbing violations and preventing theirescalation.The establishment of the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) was builton the premise of giving more coherence and visibility tohuman rights activities within the United Nations system.However  our commitment to human rights rings hollowwithout constant efforts to improve the efficiency of theUnited Nations human rights machinery  focusing onprevention  on-site monitoring and developing a rapid-response capacity.May I now address the General Assembly in mycapacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).The cooperation between the United Nations and theOSCE has significantly developed on both political andoperational levels since the December 1994 Budapestsummit. As the OSCE  a regional organization in thesense of Chapter VIII of the Charter  embarks on so-far-uncharted waters in conflict prevention and crisismanagement  the advice and assistance of the UnitedNations proves to be an important asset  for which Iwould like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General.Based on the agreement concluded between the twoorganizations  we have indeed developed flexible formsof cooperation  not only in the political area  but in ourjoint efforts on humanitarian issues  human rights sanctions-monitoring and operational presence.At present  the OSCE has missions in Georgia Bosnia and Herzegovina  the Former Yugoslav Republicof Macedonia  Moldova  Ukraine  Tajikistan  Nagorno-Karabakh  Estonia  Latvia and Chechnya. We are alsoabout to establish one in Croatia. We find it indispensablethat the OSCE mission to Kosovo  Sandjak and Vojvodinain the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia andMontenegro) resume its activities  in accordance with therelevant resolution of the Security Council.Though the mandates of these OSCE missions vary they still point in the same direction  namely assisting theparties involved in finding a political solution to theirdifferences on the basis of OSCE principles andcommitments. OSCE helps to monitor and verify cease-fire accords  supervise troop withdrawals  establishnegotiating structures and principles for talks on nationalreconciliation and respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms. It has to be added that in somecases the OSCE has to work hard to obtain the necessarypolitical endorsement of the parties to engage in apeaceful and structured political process and offer mutualconcessions.11I wish to express our appreciation of the peace effortsin Bosnia and Herzegovina which  in this very city of NewYork only two days ago  yielded the so-called “furtheragreed basic principles”. As its Chairman-in-Office  I cansee that it is extremely important that the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe may soon find itself ina new  important and challenging role as an activeparticipant in the course of the implementation of the long-awaited Bosnian peace accords.In making use of the mutually reinforcing capabilitiesof the United Nations and the OSCE  the HungarianChairmanship-in-Office of the organization for 1995 isdetermined to strengthen both organizations. I remainconvinced that the further development of this cooperationin the vast area from Alaska to Kamchatka will  with theactive support of Members  bring us closer to therealization of the noble ideals set forth in the Charter 50years ago."
"72",3157,"IDN",50,1995,"On behalf of the Indonesiandelegation I should like to offer our congratulations toMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election asPresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.We are confident that under his able guidance we willmake substantive progress in our work.To his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy ofCôte d’Ivoire  I should like to convey our deepappreciation for the exemplary manner in which hepresided over the Assembly at the last session.I also wish to pay tribute to our esteemed Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedicatedendeavours in pursuing the objectives of the UnitedNations Charter and for his untiring efforts for the causeof peace and development.We observe the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations at a most crucial time in the history ofhumankind. In this post-cold-war era  we have beenconfronted by global changes so profound and massivethat we are just beginning to understand some of theirramifications. These changes have generated challengesand contradictory trends in international relations whichhave cast a dark shadow on our contemporary world andintensified our sense of uncertainty as we stand on thethreshold of a new century. On the other hand  adeepening sense of interdependence has prompted nationsto devise more equitable and mutually beneficial patternsof cooperation — and this has provided us with a newsource of hope. Fittingly indeed  on this fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  hope is the dominantfeeling in the world today just as it was hope  for a morepeaceful and tolerant world  which inspired the foundingof the United Nations in San Francisco half a centuryago.6With the Second World War barely over  theinternational community of that time sought to establish aworld organization which would “save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war” by instituting asystem of collective security based on the repudiation of theuse of force “save in the common interest”  and on thebasic principles of sovereign equality  freedom  justice andthe rule of law. This splendid vision was not to be realized for soon the cold war set in between two rival military andideological blocs locked in a struggle for dominance. Powerpolitics and the quest for hegemony and spheres ofinfluence paralysed the collective security system. That maybe why the United Nations has not been able to prevent themore than 150 armed conflicts which  since its founding have erupted in various parts of the world  taking a horribletoll in human lives and material devastation. And that alsopartly explains the persistence of inequities and imbalancesin international economic relations.The United Nations was but a decade old when thefirst generation of leaders of Asia and Africa  reacting tothe debilitating effects of the cold war and the problemsbesetting the world at the time  met in Bandung toarticulate a new ethos which would reaffirm the ideals andprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter andgovern relationships between and among nations  great andsmall. Thus in 1955 the leaders of Asia and Africa laiddown the “Dasa Sila of Bandung” — the “Ten Principlesof Bandung” — which embodied fundamental principles ofinter-State relations in accordance with the spirit of theUnited Nations Charter.The seeds that germinated in Bandung took firm rootsix years later in Belgrade with the formal institution of theNon-Aligned Movement. Since then  the Movement hasserved as a moral and political force that provided analternative vision to the bloc politics of the cold war.Pursuing that vision  the Movement contributed to thetriumph of such causes as the world-wide struggle againstcolonialism; the drive against institutionalized racism particularly apartheid; the advocacy for nucleardisarmament  which is finally under way; and  lately  thelaunching of a global partnership for development. It is nocoincidence that these are the very same issues as those onthe agenda of the United Nations  for it is precisely withinthe United Nations and through its processes andinstitutions that the Non-Aligned Movement has waged itsstruggles for  and pursued its advocacy of  the principlesand ideas enshrined in the United Nations Charter andreiterated in the Dasa Sila of Bandung. There is no doubtthat the United Nations has served as the principalinstrument for the amelioration of the human conditionthrough the pursuit of peace and development.In spite of the constraints to its system of collectivesecurity  the United Nations has nevertheless undertakena large number of peace-keeping and peacemakingoperations. Admittedly  not all United Nations peace-keeping efforts have been regarded as successful  but theyhave consistently promoted progress in negotiationsbetween the parties in conflict. In the process the UnitedNations has expanded the meaning of peace-keepingbeyond mere impartial interposition to include theprotection of humanitarian aid  refugees and displacedpersons as well as assistance to countries holdingelections. Even the set-backs and difficulties encounteredin peace-keeping operations have yielded useful insightsthat could help secure the success of similar undertakingsin the future.With the implementation of “An Agenda for Peace”and its Supplement  further progress may be expected  notonly in peace-keeping but also in preventive diplomacy peacemaking  post-conflict peace-building and thecomplementary role of regional organizations inmaintaining peace and security.We are heartened that the Agenda for Peace hasbeen complemented with “An Agenda for Development” which would not only enhance the capability of UnitedNations to do its work in the economic and social spheresbut which will also facilitate the forging of a globalpartnership for development.However  the United Nations is much more than aforum for maintaining security  resolving conflicts andkeeping the peace. The Organization  its specializedagencies and related institutions have been engaged in animmense array of activities that touch every aspect ofpeople’s lives all over the world.It is therefore most regrettable to note that theseverest financial crisis in the history of the UnitedNations casts a dark shadow over the fiftieth anniversary.In particular  the failure of one major Member State tomeet its obligations by withholding legally obligatedcontributions is not only contrary to Article 17 of theCharter but has also driven the Organization to the verybrink of insolvency. This aggravating situation has forcedthe Secretary-General to try to resolve the crisis throughpostponing reimbursements to the troop-contributingcountries. This places an unfair burden on those countriesand penalizes especially the developing countries among7them. If the situation were to continue without urgent andeffective measures being taken to resolve it  peace-keepingoperations would grind to a halt and all our endeavours tomaintain peace and security would be endangered. Thefiftieth anniversary presents us with an opportunity toaddress this fundamental issue of the United Nationsinsolvency at the highest political level  including possiblerecourse to innovative global taxation schemes.The achievements of the United Nations over the pastfive decades make a compelling case for the furtherstrengthening of multilateral cooperation  and we believethat the United Nations can be an even better instrument ofmultilateral cooperation if we act with greater purpose anddetermination in rectifying its inadequacies andshortcomings through a comprehensive process ofrestructuring  revitalization and democratization.My delegation is therefore gratified that steps havebeen taken to revitalize the role of the General Assembly including the reorganization of its Committee structures andthe streamlining of its agenda for greater efficiency andefficacy.Indonesia also believes that the membership of theSecurity Council  including its permanent members  shouldbe increased so as to reflect the changed internationalsituation since 1945 and to accommodate the interests andconcerns of developing countries  which comprise theoverwhelming majority of the Organization. It is a glaringanomaly that on the roster of permanent members of theCouncil Europe is overrepresented  Asia is underrepresentedand Africa and Latin America are not represented at all. Weare also of the view that additional permanent membersshould be chosen on the basis  not only of equitablegeographical representation  but also of such objectivecriteria as the political  economic and demographic weightof a country  its capability and proven track record ofcontributing to the promotion of peace  security anddevelopment  both regionally and globally  and itscommitment to assume the responsibilities inherent inpermanent membership. It may also be timely and pertinentto review the manner in which the veto is exercised atpresent with a view to mitigating its arbitrary use and toensuring a more democratic decision-making process.One central challenge not yet fully met by the UnitedNations in its fiftieth year is that of general disarmament particularly in its nuclear dimension. The 1995 Review andExtension Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) adopted threedecisions  namely  to extend the Treaty indefinitely  tostrengthen its review process and to agree on certainprinciples and objectives for non-proliferation anddisarmament. Yet the Conference failed to address theinequalities inherent in the Treaty. Issues long identifiedas crucial components of the non-proliferation regimewere marginalized. The indefinite extension of the NPTremoved the element of urgency from obligations underarticle VI of the Treaty  which may legitimize existingnuclear arsenals and perpetuate their furthermodernization. Hence  our priority agenda in thedisarmament field should continue to be one of seekingfurther deep reductions in those arsenals with a view totheir ultimate  total elimination  curbing the horizontal andvertical proliferation of nuclear weapons  banning theproduction of fissile materials for weapons purposes ensuring the peaceful applications of nuclear technologyon a predictable and long-term basis  initiatingnegotiations towards an international convention onsecurity assurances to non-nuclear States  and concludingthe ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive test-bantreaty.It is in this context that we have deplored theunderground testing by France and China  not onlybecause of health and environmental considerations butprecisely because it contravenes the spirit of the 1995Review and Extension Conference of the NPT andundermines the ongoing efforts to conclude acomprehensive test-ban treaty. While urging the nuclearPowers to desist from conducting further tests  we believeit is imperative that concerted efforts should now bedirected at achieving a treaty banning nuclear testing inall environments and for all time  without any loopholesor exceptions  by 1996.Perhaps the greatest tragedy of recent times is thatwhich has befallen the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.The brutal aggression perpetrated again this independentMember State of the United Nations and the slaughter and“ethnic cleansing” of its people have shocked the wholeworld. Denied its legitimate right to defend itself as aresult of an unjust arms embargo  Bosnia andHerzegovina faces the prospect of the forcible dismantlingof its multicultural  multi-ethnic and multireligious societyand the erosion of its internationally recognizedsovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.The major Powers  which early on could have put anend to this tragedy  have failed the cause of justice and ofa principled solution  offering instead rationalizations forwhat clearly amounts to a policy of appeasement. Onlynow  after an excruciating wait  have the United Nations8and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finallytaken firm action. On the ground  the tide of battle seemsto be turning  while at the same time a new peace processis unfolding which appears to have some viability.Indonesia welcomes the accords recently reached betweenthe Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina  the Republic of Croatia and the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia  comprised of a set of broadprinciples that are to govern a peaceful settlement of theconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Developments havethus entered a crucial stage  and it is of paramountimportance for the international community to ensure thatneither an unjust nor an unworkable peace be forced onBosnia and Herzegovina.In this regard  President Soeharto has offeredIndonesia’s good offices to facilitate a peace process basedon direct negotiations among the leaders of the Statesdirectly involved in the conflict. These negotiations shouldbe conducted on the basis of certain basic principles  suchas peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internalaffairs. Any settlement should take into account existingUnited Nations resolutions and existing proposals forsettlement and should entail mutual recognition by theStates that were components of the former Yugoslavia respect for internationally recognized boundaries andprotection of minorities. Furthermore  the process shouldproceed in stages  from direct negotiations between theleaders themselves to an appropriately structuredinternational conference  to be held when agreement hasbeen reached on the basic elements of a settlement.In the Middle East the pursuit of peace has continuedto gather momentum. The historic Declaration of Principlessigned two years ago was bolstered by the agreementreached last week between the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) and Israel  which calls for an extensionof Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories  phasedwithdrawal of Israeli forces and free elections for aPalestinian Council  thereby paving the way for a finalsettlement of the Palestinian-Israeli dimension of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Indonesia welcomes the agreement as animportant watershed in the Middle East peace process. Butthe path to a lasting peace still faces major hurdles andchallenges  including those posed by Israeli settlements inthe West Bank  the unresolved question of Palestinianrefugees 50 years after they were forced to flee theirhomeland and the status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. At the sametime  progress must also be achieved on the other tracks ofthe Arab-Israeli negotiations  which is a sine qua non for acomprehensive settlement of the Middle East question. Theultimate guarantee for a durable and just peace is Israel’swithdrawal from all occupied territories  including theSyrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.The global economy today is reportedly at itsstrongest in many years. According to the WorldEconomic and Social Survey of 1995  it has attained anaverage growth in output of 3 per cent per year. But therising tide of production has not lifted all economies.Thus  notwithstanding the promise of global recovery over 2 billion people remain poverty-stricken  often undercircumstances of extreme deprivation. Up to 18 milliondie annually from hunger  malnutrition and poverty-related causes. The gap between the haves and the have-nots continues to widen  doubling in size over the pastthree decades between the richest 20 per cent and thepoorest.Policy decisions affecting the developing countriesare increasingly being made by international agencies orgroups  such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the World Bank  the World Trade Organization (WTO)and the Group of Seven. It even seems that the UnitedNations itself is being marginalized  as decision-makingon international economic and financial issues continuesto shift to the Bretton Woods institutions  where theparticipation of the developing countries is less equitable.It is no secret that some countries would like toinaugurate a global system in which finance andmacroeconomic management become the exclusivedomain of the IMF  development strategies that of theWorld Bank and international trade matters that of theWTO.I submit  however  that given the expanding role ofthe developing countries in the world economy and thegrowing interdependence between States  the participationof developing countries should be enhanced rather thancurtailed. The solution of global economic problemsrequires a global partnership for development  and thatpartnership cannot be forged without sustained dialogueand cooperation on key economic issues between thedeveloped and the developing countries. This is why  afterthe Jakarta summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  whereeconomic development was restored to the top of itsagenda  the Movement sought to relaunch a constructivedialogue between the North and the South based onmutual interest  common benefit and equitably sharedresponsibility. That kind of dialogue has been welcomedin this Assembly  and it is our hope that other key playersin the globalization process  such as non-governmentalorganizations  transnational corporations and internationalfinancial institutions  will in time also join that dialogue.9Just as important is the revitalization of the institutionswhich the United Nations Charter set in place 50 years agoto lay the social and economic foundations for peace. Wemust ensure  however  that in the process we willstrengthen the role of the developing countries in decision-making and enhance the democratic character of the UnitedNations.It is in this context that I have opposed the idea ofestablishing an economic security council to take the placeof the Economic and Social Council  because it is bound tofrustrate our efforts to democratize the functioning of theUnited Nations. As to the attendant suggestion to wind upthe work of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization (UNIDO)  I believe  to thecontrary  that these two bodies are vital to the achievementof accelerated  sustainable and equitably spreaddevelopment  especially for the developing countries. Sinceits establishment 30 years ago  UNCTAD has consistentlyendeavoured to redress the inequities and imbalances in theworld economy and to give a greater voice and role to thedeveloping countries in its management. UNIDO  too  hasproven to be of concrete benefit to the developingcountries  in particular in their efforts to accelerate theirindustrial development. Both UNCTAD and UNIDO therefore  should be strengthened rather than be allowed tobe whittled down or eliminated.We believe that the problems now plaguing manydeveloping countries could have been forestalled if they hadadequate access to international markets  to financialresources and to appropriate technologies. And while weexpect that the results of the Uruguay Round will alleviatethe crisis by liberalizing the international trading system we also know that the lion’s share of the benefits willaccrue to the developed countries. This imbalance is due tothe significant loss of differential treatment in trade for thedeveloping countries  the limited progress achieved inlifting restrictions on agricultural exports and the impositionof trade conditionalities based on labour codes eco-labelling and so on. If the new trading regime is tohave a positive impact on the developing countries  theseproblems and imbalances should be squarely addressed  andthe rights and interests of the developing countries particularly the least developed among them  should beupheld.Amid such trends as increasing globalization  theintegration of global financial markets and speculationduring periods of national adjustment to privatization  thedeveloping countries have become increasingly vulnerable.Among the developing countries  those in Africa areparticularly disadvantaged because their external-debtproblems have virtually excluded them from investmentflows — they must rely on official developmentassistance (ODA)  which continues to decline. At thesame time  negative financial flows continue to hampertheir development efforts. In 1994 alone the continent’sindebtedness was double that of other developingcountries. It is therefore incumbent upon the internationalcommunity to give its priority attention to the criticalsituation in Africa.The World Summit for Social Development convened earlier this year in Copenhagen  underscored thedetermination of the international community to raiseglobal standards of living and to address the problems ofpoverty  unemployment and social integration. ItsDeclaration and Programme of Action offer a pragmaticand feasible course to alleviate mass human suffering andto elevate the human condition. Now we must translaterhetoric into action  and realize the true potential forglobal prosperity.An integral part of that process is theimplementation of the Declaration and Platform forAction adopted at the Fourth World Conference onWomen  recently concluded in Beijing. For only throughthe empowerment and advancement of women by suchmeans as access to economic resources  to education andto the decision-making processes in all fields and at alllevels can the social and economic welfare of humankindprogress. It is essential  therefore  that we create anenvironment conducive to women’s full participation inthe development process  as both its agents and itsbeneficiaries  if we are to move forward in our efforts toachieve sustained economic growth  sustainabledevelopment and social justice.The observance of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations is particularly significant to us inIndonesia  for it takes place while we celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the proclamation of our independence. Tous  this is not a mere coincidence in time but aconvergence of ideals and values. Neither is it acoincidence that the Charter of the United Nations and theConstitution of Indonesia embrace the same principles andobjectives  such as independence  social justice  equalityand abiding peace. For the United Nations and Indonesiaemerged from the crucible of the Second World War andthe struggle for independence yearning and hoping for theuniversal peace that can only be derived from a sharingof the fruits of freedom and justice by all humankind.10Since then  the United Nations and all of us  thepeoples who are its constituents  have gone through anothercrucible  that of the cold war and the massive globalchanges that attended its wake. And  again  we haveemerged with a yearning and a hope that the peaceenvisaged in the United Nations Charter 50 years ago willbe attained in our time. The difference is that this time wehave 50 years of experience to illuminate our endeavoursand to sharpen our perspective of the future. On thisoccasion  as we rededicate ourselves to the vision of theUnited Nations Charter  let us resolve to use our collectiveexperience in our continuing efforts to revitalize andstrengthen the Organization that is the vehicle of our hope."
"73",3204,"IND",50,1995,"It gives me great pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session during which he will guide our discussions on what thefuture of the United Nations should be. May I also conveymy thanks to the President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session  Mr. Amara Essy  who  as it were  tilledthe ground which the new President will sow.A fiftieth anniversary is a climacteric  usually joyousbut not necessarily so. In ancient India  this was around thetime in a man’s life that he would be expected to withdrawinto a forest  to spend the rest of his days in contemplationof past and future  it being the assessment of our ancestorsthat anything a man could usefully do he would have doneby then. No such drastic measures are needed for theUnited Nations  not least because it has spent much of itsfirst 50 years meditating in a concrete jungle. And theshadow of the woods of Bretton always loom over it. I dothink  however  that as we celebrate  which we should  thesurvival of the United Nations  we should judge what it hasdone and what it now needs to do. The United Nationssystem has had remarkable success in helping to defeatcolonialism and apartheid  on social issues like universalhealth care and women’s rights  and in banning  throughglobal  non-discriminatory treaties  two of the threeweapons of mass destruction. These are considerableachievements. But a clear pattern emerges from them.Whenever the United Nations has acted on principle responding to the felt needs and priorities of the majority ofits membership  it has done well. When it has pursuednarrow agendas or succumbed to special pleading  it hasnot.If we were setting out tasks for the United Nationstoday  what would be the major trends and challenges wewould expect it to address? The first is the internationaleconomy  transformed by global movements of trade capital and labour; driven by forces which can breakdeveloping economies; regulated — if they can be at all —in forums outside the United Nations  which is thereforemarginalized in this most momentous of contemporarydevelopments. The second is an opening up of politicalsystems  with democracy the norm of nationalgovernance. The United Nations welcomes this and urgesthe recalcitrant to change  but is itself sapped byundemocratic systems and institutions. The third is thescourge of war increasingly replaced by the scourge ofterrorism  which  for the countries that sponsor it  is warby other means. The United Nations  set up to savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war  ignoresit  as the League of Nations  to its fatal peril  ignored thethreat of xenophobia.These are complex and titanic forces. We  therefore cannot accept  either as a statement of fact or as a basisof policy  the view that all this meant was that the daysof absolute sovereignty were over. Sovereignty has neverbeen absolute. Most Members of the United Nationsjoined immediately after emerging from colonial rule with their economies destroyed  and dependent on foreignlanguages for communication  on imperial capitals forsupport and on donors for subsistence. This is hardly thestuff on which absolute sovereignty is built. It was  infact  one of the great virtues of the United Nations that itgave fledgling nations space to exercise the sovereigntyso cruelly circumscribed elsewhere. Therefore  the UnitedNations should not claim a unilateral right to intervene inthe affairs of its Members. Sovereignty can be dilutedonly with the voluntary consent of nation States acceptingobligations that are non-discriminatory or  in exceptionalcircumstances  where State authority has collapsed. Farfrom enfeebling sovereignty  it is the task of the UnitedNations to nurture it in a world that has made thepowerful more dominant and the weak increasinglypowerless. We must never forget that this Assembly is anassembly of our nations united. The United Nations restson the commitment to it of sovereign nations.There is clearly an enormous need for global actionto deal with complex issues which have no territoriallimits or borders. This is the task of the United Nations.Developing countries which represent the majority of theUnited Nations  obviously want it to focus on the issuesof most pressing concern to them. That is not only fair:that would be the democratic thing to do. For us  thesingle most important task is development  and we expectthis to be the highest priority on the international agenda as it is on our domestic agendas. Sadly  it is not. TheAgenda for Development looks lamentably like anappendix. Can we  at this session  pledge ourselves tohonour the commitments  freely negotiated but neverimplemented  which will make development possible in13the South and make the world  for all of us  a better andmore peaceful place?It is just as important for the United Nations to havea say in the decisions that guide the international economy.Chapter IX of the Charter gave it the task to promotehigher standards of living  solutions of internationaleconomic  social  health and related problems  and universalrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Likethe United Nations  the World Trade Organization givesequal weight to the votes of all its members  but it wouldbe a pity if the World Trade Organization cut even thetenuous links between the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) and the United Nations and  decidedinstead that global economic policies would in the future becoordinated between it  the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund  where the system of weightedvoting makes the voice of the developing countriesirrelevant. At the same time  several studies commissionedto coincide with this anniversary claim that the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)no longer has a useful purpose. This can either mean thatthe problems UNCTAD addresses — developmentstrategies  poverty alleviation  resource transfers and debt and the transfer of technology — have been settled  or arenow irrelevant. Neither is true. These continue to beburning issues for developing countries  and if the UnitedNations chooses to ignore them it will not serve the needsof its Member States.The United Nations must assume its Charterresponsibility to supervise and coordinate global economicpolicies. In the World Trade Organization efforts have beenmade to link trade to environment and labour standards.The World Bank  in its World Development Report 1995 warns about“the proliferation of protectionist demands  many ofthem under the guise of demands for fair trade and alevel playing field”.If  indeed  there is a genuine interest in protecting theenvironment and the interests of labour in developingcountries  why are the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) and the International LabourOrganization (ILO) being sidelined in this exercise? Theanswer must be that there is no provision in these bodiesfor the coercive  retaliatory action which would be availableunder the sanctions regime of the World TradeOrganization.However  the industrialized countries say thatenvironmental and labour standards must be harmonizedupwards  because otherwise transnational corporationswould go where these standards were the lowest. This ofcourse implies that transnational corporations have anappalling and exploitative standard of behaviour  butwhen  in the 1970s and 1980s  the United Nations tried todevelop a code of conduct for transnational corporations we were told that transnational corporations were modelsof virtue. How do these two views cohere?The problem posed by these global economic forcesis enormous. Trade is the oxygen of our economies  butcross-border trade between transnational corporationsconstitutes one third of world trade and almost 15 percent of gross global product. No developing country  orgroup of developing countries  can match this commercialstrength  augmented  of course  by the enormous weightof financial flows  which can make or break a country’sfinancial structure.The third element in the trinity of mobility in theinternational economy is migration. At present 125million people live outside their countries  but more thanhalf of them move between developing countries; this isnot  therefore  as it has so often been misrepresented  onlya problem for the developed world. It is disturbing however  that those who insist on unfettered and trulyglobal flows of capital and trade also insist on restrictionsbeing placed on the movement of labour. Economicarguments are given to justify this  but there are alsoclaims that large migrations disturb the way a societythinks of itself as a unified cultural or ethnic entity.The President returned to the Chair.It would be honest to recognize these fears as racist.India is a model of how these fears can be overcome. Onthe one hand  over the past decade several million illegalimmigrants have come into India. We know to our costthe political  economic and social strain this causes.However  we do not accept a racial basis fordiscriminating against legal migrants. We do not acceptthat nationhood is based on race  any more than it isbased on religion or any other exclusive attribute. Thewaves of migration that have washed over India havemade us a multi-ethnic society; we have been culturallyenriched  not impoverished. We urge the internationalcommunity not to let the forces of xenophobia rise again.Sovereignty has never been threatened by fresh bloodfreely welcomed; it has been threatened by the forces ofracist intolerance.14This brings me naturally to the other force that nowthreatens the sovereignty of so many nations. Terrorism isthe black plague of our times and it has been made moredangerous by the mystique with which the media hasendowed it. It is argued sometimes that one man’s freedomfighter is another man’s terrorist. This is specious logic. In1922 Mahatma Gandhi suspended for several years thefreedom struggle in India because  in an incident in thesmall village of Chauri Chaura  a mob burnt somepolicemen to death. In Gandhi’s view  the view of theultimate freedom-fighter  the means must sanctify the ends.What ends could possibly justify the barbarism oftaking an innocent foreigner in India hostage and beheadinghim in cold blood? Foreign mercenaries did this to theNorwegian Hans Christian Ostro last month. An empire ofterror is being built up with arms and money sent acrossborders; its foot soldiers are drawn from the bigoted  itsleadership from ruthless  unprincipled men and  regrettably some women.At every summit in recent years  whether of the non-aligned  the Group of Seven  the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  or the Commonwealth Heads of State and Government have reaffirmed theirresolve to defeat all forms of terrorism. However  in theUnited Nations  where we are all represented  we have beenunable to speak in such forthright terms. We must do so atthis fiftieth anniversary. To appease terrorism now will beas dangerous as appeasing xenophobia was in the 1930s andultimately as destructive of both peace and democracy because terrorism  as I said earlier  is war by other means.Whether it tries to violate the territorial integrity of acountry  as in India  in our State of Jammu and Kashmir  orto unseat duly constituted Governments  as in Afghanistan the acts of States sponsoring terrorism are  in fact  acts ofwar.Democracies  as open societies  are particularlyvulnerable to terrorism. The United Nations welcomes theglobal trend that has made democracy the norm ofgovernance  but has done nothing to defend democraciesfrom extremist and other threats. Instead  it comforts itselfwith the mantras that democracy is development  anddemocracies do not wage war. These neatly package all theworld’s problems and absolve the United Nations of anyfurther responsibility: establish democracy everywhere and automatically  development and peace will follow.Both propositions are historically untrue. Democraciesthat developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centurieseither suppressed democratic rights until they became rich or grew rich on the ruthless exploitation of colonies.When they shed their empires after the Second WorldWar democracy became development in Europe only inthe uniquely generous embrace of the Marshall Plan. Themyth that democracies do not wage war is destroyed bythe history of colonial rule and its wars  leading to theconflagration of the First World War. The United Nationsshould  therefore  take these propositions as objectives not as givens. Democracy should lead to development;democracies should be peaceful.I want to touch briefly upon two other global issueswhich affect our lives — disarmament and human rights.After Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Mahatma Gandhi said thatthe use of the atom bomb for the wholesale destruction ofmen  women and children was the most diabolical use ofscience. We were therefore appalled that  instead ofstepping back from the road to nuclear ruin  the nuclear-weapon States sped faster and faster down it. As theyaccelerated  India tried unsuccessfully to put on thebrakes. In 1954 we called for an end to nuclear testing. In1965 we proposed principles for a non-proliferationtreaty. In 1982 we called for a convention to ban the useof nuclear weapons and for an end to the production offissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1988 we proposedto the United Nations a comprehensive action plan for aworld free of nuclear weapons.Our goal — shared  I believe by most of us here —is a world from which nuclear weapons have beeneliminated. The nuclear-weapon States claim to share thisgoal  but their present objective is to retain nuclearweapons while making sure others do not get them.The logic of this is hard to understand. It cannot beargued that the security of a few countries depends ontheir having nuclear weapons and that that of the restdepends on their not having them. What makes the NPTsuch a pernicious document is that it legitimizes thisillogicality  and now that it has been made permanent ithas made the possession of nuclear weapons by thenuclear-weapon States immutable and has made the goalof global nuclear disarmament that much more difficult.It is useful to recall that when India and otherdeveloping countries proposed the NPT  a global balanceof responsibilities was envisaged. Those who did not havenuclear weapons would not seek to acquire them; thosewho had them would not try either to refine or developthem or to increase their arsenals. This balance was neverhonoured  with the result that 25 years after the signingof the NPT the world is a much more dangerous place 15made so by the proliferation of nuclear weapons in thearsenals of the nuclear-weapon States.I recall this background because two years ago theinternational community at last agreed to negotiate acomprehensive test-ban treaty. We are glad that negotiationsare in progress  but we also note that nuclear-weapon Statesagreed to a comprehensive test-ban treaty only afteracquiring the know-how to develop and refine their arsenalswithout the need for tests. In our view  the comprehensivetest-ban treaty must be an integral step in the process ofnuclear disarmament. Developing new warheads or refiningexisting ones after a comprehensive test-ban treaty is inplace  using innovative technologies  would be as contraryto the spirit of the comprehensive test-ban treaty as theNPT is to the spirit of non-proliferation. The comprehensivetest-ban treaty must contain a commitment binding on theinternational community  especially the nuclear-weaponStates  to take further measures within an agreedtime-frame towards the creation of a nuclear-weapon-freeworld.The existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat topeace and security. Only global nuclear disarmament canguarantee that there will never be a nuclear war. Therefore despite the unfortunate legitimization of nuclear weaponsthrough the indefinite extension of the NPT  India willcontinue to work with like-minded countries for the earlyelimination of all nuclear weapons. We hope that at thissession the Assembly will finalize dates for the fourthUnited Nations special session on disarmament  in 1997.Human rights have always been a preoccupation of theUnited Nations  but their protection and promotion of suchrights in each country is the primary responsibility of thegovernment. The universality and interdependence of allhuman rights are also beyond question. That is preciselywhy the United Nations system cannot promote and protecthuman rights by a unilateral prioritization of individualfreedoms or a proliferation of intrusive mechanisms  or bydiverting funds from development activities to human rightsactivities. The priorities of nations will differ. The UnitedNations must balance the promotion of all human rights —civil  cultural  economic  political and social — preserveand propagate the values of every society and promotetolerance for diversity and cross-cultural interaction.Politicizing the human-rights agenda and using it to targetcountries is undesirable.The United Nations will become responsive to theseglobal issues and effective and efficient only if it alsobecomes more democratic in its functioning. Developingcountries find it hard to identify with the agendas andpriorities of the United Nations; they feel that it nowrepresents the privilege of a few rather than the interestsof the many. If the majority of its Members becomedisenchanted with it  what role can the United Nationseffectively play? For the United Nations to be moreeffective  the General Assembly must be given new lifeand breathe that life into the other bodies of the system.The legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Councilmust be enhanced. An expansion of both permanent andnon-permanent members is a must if the Council is tobecome a truly representative body acting on behalf of theMembers of the United Nations for the maintenance ofpeace and security.The members of the Movement of Non-AlignedCountries have put forward a comprehensive proposal forthe reform and restructuring of the Security Council. Indiabelieves that  to truly reflect the expanded membership ofthe United Nations  developing countries must be includedas permanent members. New permanent members shouldbe chosen not arbitrarily  but on objective criteria. In theLeague of Nations it was argued that one country had aspecial right of entry into the Supreme Council. Whenthat was forced through  one or two of the other aspirantsleft the League  starting its decline. We should not repeatthat tragedy. On objective criteria  some countries willclearly qualify for permanent membership. We believeIndia will be among them.The United Nations has in recent years devoted itselfalmost exclusively to peace-keeping  which is important but not the central issue of our times. It is judged naturally  by its record in these operations. There havebeen successes and failures  and both provide the reasonand the need for introspection. India believes that UnitedNations peace-keeping operations must be based on theprinciples evolved over the last 50 years. Operationsguided by these principles have usually done well. Wherethese have been abandoned  failure has been common.Over the past year this truth has gained broad acceptance and the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operationsis now trying to collate these principles. It would bedesirable for the General Assembly at this fiftieth sessionto agree on them. India will contribute to this work.India has consistently supported the peace-keepingactivities of the United Nations. Indian troops haveparticipated in all major peace-keeping operations  rangingfrom the Congo to Cambodia  Somalia and Mozambique.We are currently participating in United Nationspeace-keeping operations in Rwanda  Angola  Haiti 16Liberia and Kuwait. We have also offered a brigade oftroops to the United Nations stand-by arrangement. Indiawill continue to contribute to United Nations efforts tomaintain international peace and security.If the United Nations is to become a leading player onthe world scene  it must be given the means needed to dothe job we entrust to it. Clearly  setting out on a second 50years with a crippling financial crisis is not the best way todo so. In India we make considerable efforts to pay ourcontributions promptly and in full. We believe that allMembers must pay their assessed contributions in full andon time. Further  those in arrears must announce a schedulefor settlement. There can be no progress in the on-goingefforts for financial reform unless this is done.The fiftieth session of the General Assembly is ahistoric one. It is our responsibility to rejuvenate the UnitedNations  give it the tasks we want it to do  and the meanswith which to do them. We set up the United Nationsbecause we felt that all of us stood to gain from it. In thedark days of the cold war and in the friction between Northand South  we seem to have lost this vision.Since the inception of the United Nations  India hasbeen committed to the principles and objectives of theCharter. In the last five decades we have played animportant role in shaping the United Nations agenda  takingthe lead on the crucial issues of decolonization disarmament  human rights and environment  among others.On this historic occasion we pledge our continuingcommitment to the United Nations efforts to chart a newcourse for the collective benefit of all humanity. As weattempt to do so  I am reminded of Jawaharlal Nehru’sspeech to the General Assembly in November 1948  inParis. He said:“The objectives are clear; your aim is clear; and yet in looking at that aim  we lose ourselves often  if Imay venture to say so  in smaller matters and forgetthe main objective that we were looking at. Sometimesit seems that the objective itself gets a little clouded”.(Plenary Verbatim Records  Third Session  GeneralAssembly  154th meeting  p. 16)We must ensure that we set aside smaller matters  thatwe do not allow the objective to get clouded and that wemove forward together in harmony and for the benefit of allthe people of the world."
"74",3250,"IRL",50,1995,"I warmly congratulate thePresident on his election to preside over the fiftieth sessionof the General Assembly. We take confidence from the factthat his experience and distinction will be available to guideus in our deliberations at this historic session. I amespecially pleased to extend my congratulations to therepresentative of a country with which we have the closestand most friendly relations as a fellow member of theEuropean Union.I wish at the outset to congratulate the parties to thelatest peace accord in the Middle East  which will be signedin Washington tomorrow. It has required greatstatesmanship  courage and perseverance on the part ofPalestinian and Israeli leaders alike to reach this agreement.We in Ireland will continue to play our part in supportingthe peace process  together with our partners in theEuropean Union.In the same spirit  we warmly welcome the agreementreached yesterday in New York  which we all hope will laythe foundation for a lasting peace in Bosnia andHerzegovina and throughout the region.If I choose to highlight two issues at the verybeginning of my remarks  Sir  you will understand  I amsure  that it is because these two issues have created sucha resonance around the world. The first issue to which Irefer is the Fourth World Conference on Women. Irelandstands committed to the principle that human rights areindivisible — the rights of one are the rights of all. Nosystem based on a universal commitment to human rightscan survive if the rights of women are not seen as anintegral factor in the equation.Women suffer disproportionately from the effects ofwar and armed conflict  whether it be as casualties fromland-mines or as the victims of systematic rape. Womenand children form the great majority of the more than 1billion people living in poverty around the world today.Women in most societies are prevented from participatingfully in the decision-making processes and have unequalaccess to power. Women continue to be prevented fromfully exercising their sexual and reproductive rights including the newly recognized right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on  matters related totheir sexuality  free of coercion  discrimination andviolence.The Fourth World Conference on Women  heldearlier this month in Beijing  addressed these and otherissues of relevance to women. The Declaration and thePlatform adopted by the Conference pose a majorchallenge to Governments and the internationalcommunity to overcome the obstacles which continue toface women around the world. They also represent asolemn commitment by Governments and the wholeUnited Nations system to take all necessary measures toeliminate all forms of discrimination against women andto remove all obstacles to gender equality and theadvancement and empowerment of women. On behalf ofthe Irish Government I pledge here that we will doeverything in our power to ensure that this commitmentis honoured and implemented.The second issue to which I must refer is theresumption of nuclear testing by the French and ChineseGovernments. It would be wrong if I were to address thisgathering and ignore decisions that have — almostliterally — sent shock waves around the world.We in Ireland  confronted as we are by theever-present anxiety posed by ageing nuclear facilities onour neighbouring island  have had many occasions overthe years to know the worry caused by the potential ofnuclear power. The great majority of the Irish people therefore  easily understand and share the deep concern ofthe peoples of the South Pacific. Nor can we fail torecognize the dismay and dejection caused by theresumption of nuclear testing in the immediate aftermathof the successful outcome of the Non-Proliferation TreatyReview and Extension Conference. The finalization of thecomprehensive test-ban treaty early next year remains anabsolute imperative.The President of the General Assembly is takingoffice at an exceptional time in the history of the United23Nations. Next month the Heads of State or Government willmeet here in special session to commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization. The General Assembly inspired by this anniversary  should mark a decisive newphase for the United Nations.The world faces a daunting array of new problemswhich require the United Nations to adapt and revitalize itsresources. The representative of Spain  Foreign MinisterSolana  speaking on behalf of the European Union  set outthese challenges in his speech here yesterday to thisAssembly. Ireland associates itself fully with these remarks.The fiftieth anniversary coincides with a more criticalattitude towards the United Nations in many countries.There is a growing readiness to highlight shortcomings andfailures rather than the longer-term record of real andsubstantial success. We cannot ignore this criticism particularly when it comes from many who are ordinarilythe strongest advocates of the United Nations. The UnitedNations  like any other organization  can only benefit fromrigorous examination and adaptation.But no organization can of itself provide wholesaleremedies for removing the hatred  the fear  the distrust andthe divisions in the world. Many of the shortcomings forwhich the Organization is frequently criticized have moreto do with a flagging of the collective will to demonstratethe determination  generosity  courage and tolerance to liveup to the obligations of the Charter.The Charter remains the bedrock for what lies ahead as it has been for all that has been achieved over those 50years. The United Nations has a remarkable record onwhich to build: it has enshrined the universal obligation ofrespect for law and good conduct between States as thecentre-piece of international relations; it served in numerousways during the long years of the cold war to dull the edgeof great-Power rivalry and reduce the dangers of globalconfrontation; it provided an indispensable framework forthe negotiation of crucial arms-control agreements whichhold the promise of a world free of weapons of massdestruction; it facilitated the process of decolonization andhelped bring about the dismantling of apartheid; itprevented numerous conflicts through its peace-keepingoperations and restored stability to many parts of the world;it set the basic international standards for human rights andmonitors their observance; it has sustained efforts toeliminate poverty  alleviate distress and deprivation  andimprove the health and living standards of millions of theworld’s most vulnerable citizens.We may ask  what of the recent past? The UnitedNations has seen great recent achievements — inMozambique  in Cambodia  in Haiti  in El Salvador  totake some examples. The peoples of those countries canbear witness to new hopes for a better and more securefuture.In other local and regional conflicts  however  theUnited Nations experience  in the face of extraordinarilycomplex and painful circumstances  has seen serioussetbacks. The human misery resulting from the wars informer Yugoslavia  Rwanda and Somalia has shocked theworld.Almost 50 years after the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration  human rights violations remain a majorwidespread problem. With a resurgence of regionalconflict and ethnic tensions in many parts of the world we have been confronted with virtually every imaginablehuman rights abuse. In contemporary warfare  more than90 per cent of the casualties are non-combatants who areoften directly targeted because of their ethnic or religiousaffiliations.Children  like women  are especially vulnerable.During the last decade  nearly 2 million children havedied in wars and more than 5 million have been forcedinto refugee camps. More children die in wars thansoldiers. At the present time throughout the world thereare almost 30 million refugees and displaced persons inneed of assistance. In the Great Lakes region of Africa as the refugee nightmare deepens  we require urgent andconcerted action to avert any danger of new tragedies.The scale of all these problems has already stretchedto the limits our ability to respond  and has heightened theproblem of United Nations credibility. It is against thisbackground that we the Member States must revitalize theUnited Nations in its mission and equip it with the meansto react with vigour and determination to the new criseswhich constantly arise. This means improving theresponse to humanitarian emergencies. But it also meanstackling more effectively their root causes  poverty anddeprivation  preventing conflicts before they arise  andmore quickly containing and resolving them when theydo.The Secretary-General’s Agenda for Peace andAgenda for Development are landmark documents that setout clear priorities and a programme for action.24One of the many bitter lessons that we have to drawfrom recent experience in Rwanda and Bosnia is that thetraditional deployment of peace-keeping units is no longer on its own  a sufficient response to the type of crises whichwe face. In the past  peace-keeping operations wereprimarily concerned with policing cease-fires betweenMember States  pending diplomatic efforts to resolve thesubstantive political issues. That  unfortunately  is no longerthe case: 11 of the 13 operations established since 1991have involved internal conflicts. Peace-keeping contingentsincreasingly find themselves operating in situations wheregovernment and civil order have broken down. There are nolonger clear points of reference for such operations whichhave become politically and logistically more complex  andfinancially more onerous.There are a number of ways in which the managementand conduct of peace-keeping operations must be improved.Perhaps most urgent is the need to improve the responsecapability of the United Nations in dealing with sudden orcomplex emergencies. Important initiatives have alreadybeen taken in this regard with the development of theUnited Nations stand-by arrangements system. Sucharrangements might perhaps be extended to other areas toensure that a full range of humanitarian  logistical and civildefence as well as military options is available to theUnited Nations in dealing with the many crises which it iscalled upon to address. In Ireland we are actively exploringthe possibility of bringing together a humanitarian liaisongroup comprising experts from a wide range of fields whichcould be deployed at short notice when emergencies occur.Command and control of United Nations operationsalso needs to be improved. Greater attention needs to bepaid to ensuring that the distinction between peace-keepingand peace enforcement is not blurred in devising mandatesfor operations  if the confidence and willingness of troop-contributing countries to continue providing troops is to bemaintained.Regional organizations can also play a valuable role insupport of United Nations peace-keeping activities. It is ofcourse essential that such organizations in carrying out theirrole do so strictly in accordance with the mandate whichthe Security Council has laid down. The United Nationsshould benefit from the support of regional organizations as the Charter envisages  but should not in doing sorelinquish its overall control and responsibility.My delegation shares the concerns which theSecretary-General has expressed about the safety of UnitedNations personnel in the field. We would like to see theUnited Nations Convention on the safety and security ofUnited Nations personnel enter into force as soon aspossible.Our concern extends to all personnel who findthemselves in dangerous situations  includinghumanitarian experts working with non-governmentalorganizations  who are frequently the first to arrive in thefield in the early  and often most dangerous  stages of anemergency.On the basis of the recommendations of theSecretary-General  we need to look again at how we candevelop the United Nations capacity for preventivediplomacy  early warning and mediation  and for timelyintervention in disputes before they escalate out ofcontrol.Ireland continues to believe that the task ofpreventing conflict would also be facilitated by thecreation of a mediation body which would work closelywith the Secretary-General and the Security Council.The dispatch of special teams of advisers andmonitors to areas of crisis and tension should be placedon a more assured and regular basis than in the past. Ibelieve that a small investment here would be amply andquickly repaid.There is a growing acceptance that violations ofhumanitarian law are a threat to international peace andsecurity. The case for the establishment of a permanentinternational criminal court is therefore more obvious thanever before. It is only through such a body that theinternational community can effectively demonstrate thatmassive human rights violations will never gounpunished.The international community is attempting to breakthe pattern of violence in Rwanda and the formerYugoslavia by ensuring that those who are guilty ofhuman rights abuses are punished and that minimumstandards of accountability are set so as to deter futureoffenders. We have rightly responded by establishingteams of United Nations human rights monitors as well asad hoc tribunals to try the perpetrators of war crimes.This is a good beginning. It is also necessary to devisemeasures which would extend vigilance and provide earlywarning of potential situations of human rights abuse. TheUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights supported by human rights monitors  is already playing a25key role in meeting this objective. He must be given ourfull cooperation and adequate financial support.The promotion of the universality of human rightsachieved a significant breakthrough with the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action. However  ourconcerns are that implementation will suffer unless there isa significant increase in the proportion of the regular budgetdevoted to human rights activity. As a demonstration of ourown national commitment  the Irish Government has thisyear increased substantially its contribution to the variousUnited Nations voluntary funds in the field of human rights.It is now time for the United Nations to pay moreattention to constructing the foundations for peace throughdevelopment. As part of the process of renewal  we need towork in partnership to pursue a new approach tocooperation for development — a cooperation whichredresses the imbalances and has as an objective therealization of sustainable human development for all.Ireland has consistently supported the elaboration of“An Agenda for Development”  and we look forward to asubstantive and relevant outcome.Most of the zones of insecurity in the world are to befound in developing countries  and the Charter clearlyrecognizes that lack of development is one of the rootcauses of conflict between States.This year is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversaryof the Great Famine in Ireland  a catastrophe of enormousproportions  which has had a lasting and searing impact onIrish life. Its memory is still very much alive  and it hasreinforced the Irish commitment to the prevention of similarcatastrophes in other parts of the world.While many areas of the world  including my owncountry  have seen great economic and social progress overthe past 50 years  the developing world  especially inAfrica  has not enjoyed the benefits of this progress. Howcan we explain the fact that  in a world of plenty  one fifthof the world’s population still goes to bed hungry?Earlier this year the World Summit for SocialDevelopment agreed on a consensus approach to thedevelopment of international norms in the economic  socialand related spheres. We now need to act at both theinternational and the national levels to implement thecommitments and consolidate the achievements.In recent years new opportunities have opened up fordisarmament; we should now move decisively to graspthem. Never has the continued presence of huge arsenalsof mass destruction been so out of step with the hopesand aspirations of the international community. Never hasthe logic underpinning nuclear deterrence been so muchin need of fundamental and critical reassessment.There has been progress in some areas. The Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) hasbeen made permanent and its Parties have been mademore accountable. Renewed commitments to nuclearnon-proliferation and disarmament were accepted by allparticipants at the NPT review and extension Conference.My country looks to all nuclear-weapon States  and inparticular the five permanent member States of theSecurity Council  to keep faith with the spirit and letter ofthese commitments.We welcome the progress being made in thenegotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Theirconclusion next year would be warmly greeted by publicopinion in our countries and would facilitate new steps inthe field of nuclear disarmament  in particular thesuccessful conclusion of a treaty which would ban theproduction of fissile materials for weapons purposes.Ireland is deeply committed to stemming theexcessive flow of conventional arms worldwide  and wesupport the objective of a ban on anti-personnelland-mines  which have caused civilian suffering on ahuge scale. The elaboration of a United Nations code ofconduct on conventional arms transfers  which I haveproposed to the Assembly  remains a valuable practicalpriority in developing greater international controls overthe flow of conventional weapons.In conducting its mission and fulfilling itsresponsibilities under the Charter  the United Nationsmust also begin a process of institutional reform andrenewal. This should begin with the Security Council. TheSecurity Council needs to be enlarged in order to increaseits effectiveness and its ability to act  both clearly andunambiguously  as the expression of the common will ofMember States.Enlargement should enhance the representativecharacter of the Security Council  taking into account theemergence of new economic and political powers as wellas the increase in United Nations membership. It shouldalso enhance equitable geographic representation  and itshould not diminish the possibility for smaller Member26States to serve. Enlargement should take place in both thepermanent and non-permanent categories of membership.After two years of discussion we have now reached thepoint where we should begin to clarify the elements of abalanced solution.The Secretary-General has made it very clear to usthat the Organization is now facing an unprecedentedfinancial crisis. How can we expect the United Nations todischarge the responsibilities given to it by Member Statesif the Member States themselves are unwilling to meet theirbasic obligations under the Charter to provide the necessaryresources? Unless urgent steps are taken  what we say herewill be no more than empty words.My delegation fully understands the reason why theSecretary-General has found it necessary to take variousmeasures to reduce costs. We support the thrust of hisproposals. However  as the European Union has made clear we view with considerable concern the decision of theSecretary-General  as part of these cost-saving measures  tosuspend payment of all troop reimbursement costs. Even asa short-term measure  this imposes a heavy and unfairburden on troop-contributing countries  particularly thosewhich  like Ireland  have fully discharged all their financialobligations to the Organization.If all Member States were to declare here theirintentions to pay assessed contributions in full  on time andwithout conditions  both for peacekeeping and the regularbudget  this single commitment would do more than anyother to strengthen the United Nations capacity to acteffectively.When I spoke last year to the Assembly about theNorthern Ireland situation  I stressed the importance of theannouncement  a few weeks earlier  of the completecessation of military operations by the IRA. This wasfollowed  some weeks afterwards  by a similarannouncement by representatives of the loyalistparamilitaries. Thankfully  the guns have now been silent inNorthern Ireland for the past year. This has brought the giftof peace  and the gift of hope  to a situation where both hadbeen sorely lacking.The gift of peace has been profoundly welcome. Theunremitting toll of death and destruction which disfiguredNorthern Ireland for the past generation has been halted.The economic opportunities offered by peace have rapidlybegun to be exploited. Freed from the shadow of terrorism human contacts have multiplied across the divide inNorthern Ireland and between both parts of the island.The paramilitary leaders  through the maintenance oftheir cease-fires  have made an important firstcontribution to the climate of hope. However  only thetwo Governments and the political leaders in NorthernIreland can consolidate the hope implicit in the cessationof violence by underpinning it with an agreed politicalsettlement which can enjoy the consent and allegiance ofall. That is now the paramount goal.In the Joint Declaration of 15 December 1993  theBritish and Irish Governments acknowledged as their goal“to remove the causes of conflict  to overcome thelegacy of history and to heal the divisions whichhave resulted”.This task can now be addressed free of thepolarizing and distorting influences which terrorism  andthe countermeasures it calls forth  exert on the politicalprocess. It is vital that this unprecedented opportunityshould be grasped.A settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict requiresthe engagement and cooperation of both Governments andof the political leaders of both communities in NorthernIreland. The close cooperation of the two Governmentshas been the enabling condition for the progress to date.The Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and the JointDeclaration of 1993 are landmark documents in thatprocess. Last February we published the New Frameworkfor Agreement  setting out the shared assessment of thetwo Governments on how a balanced and honourableaccommodation could be envisaged across all the keyrelationships. While this is not a blueprint to be imposedon the parties  it reflects long and careful considerationbetween the two Governments on how the underlyingrealities should be addressed and is designed to giveimpetus and direction to the process of negotiations.The role of the two Governments is crucial becausethe Northern Ireland conflict is primarily about the widerBritish or Irish allegiances resolutely cherished by the twocommunities there. For that reason  there can be no purelyinternal solution. Innovative thinking and potentiallydifficult decisions will be required on both sides of theIrish Sea if the two Governments are to create the contextand conditions where the conflicting allegiances can atlast be reconciled.The success of these intergovernmental efforts will however  be measured ultimately by attitudes of the twocommunities within Northern Ireland. The attitude of the27nationalist tradition has been characterized by an evergrowing acceptance of the principle that there would be nochange in the status of Northern Ireland without the consentof a majority of the people there.They look in turn to the unionist community for anacknowledgement that the principle of consent  as well asbeing a rightful protection for unionists against theimposition of a united Ireland against the wishes of amajority of the people in Northern Ireland  also implies therights of nationalists in Northern Ireland to be governed bystructures which are relevant and responsive in terms oftheir allegiance and aspirations. The denial of the principleof consent  and of mutual respect  has been costly in thepast. The relative weights of the communities withinNorthern Ireland  as in Ireland as a whole  mean thatcoercion is quite simply impossible  even if anyone werefoolish enough to attempt it. Cooperation and consent at alllevels are not just the best policy  but the only possiblepolicy.Because of this reality  the politics of the peaceprocess must be resolutely inclusive. Any viable settlementmust deal with each community as it defines itself  not asothers would find it convenient for it to be. For that reason I welcome the fact that the new leader of Ulster unionismis among the most forceful and assertive representatives ofhis community’s philosophy.The test of statesmanship for any leader in NorthernIreland and the kind of solution we seek are not aboutabating the rights of either community. They are aboutfinding ways to respect them which are compatible withequally important rights on the other side. We know thattalks can succeed only if both communities in NorthernIreland are reliably and authentically represented at thosetalks. Nationalism should be represented in its integrity atthose talks  and so also must unionism. Both have to spellout how they propose to accommodate satisfactorily atradition and an identity which is not their own.Both Governments have explicitly set inclusive andcomprehensive negotiations as their goal  yet these have notyet begun. That failure is frustrating and threatens todissipate the momentum towards a lasting peace. It wouldbe ironic and dangerous if those who have been persuadedto abandon violence were now to be denied the chance tomake their case politically. It is vital  therefore  thatobstacles in the way of comprehensive negotiations shouldnow be overcome.One of the most difficult obstacles is that thecontinued existence of arsenals of guns and explosives isa source of fear  anxiety and mistrust. The IrishGovernment  for its part  is absolutely determined that allarms should be erased from the political equation as soonas possible. Any debate is about the best means ofachieving this  not about whether it should be done.It is because of the importance of this goal that wewish to situate it in the context where it is most likely tobe achieved in practice. We seek to avoid  as far aspossible  symbolic overtones of surrender or of aone-sided admission of guilt. In this context  no less thanin other contexts in Northern Ireland  the concepts ofvictory and defeat will never offer a solution.To make the decommissioning of weapons aprecondition for entry into negotiations  as opposed to animportant goal to be realized in that process  ignores thepsychology and motivation of those on both sides inIreland who have resorted to violence and the lessons ofconflict resolution elsewhere. We should treatnegotiations  as far as possible  as a practical step. Ratherthan surrounding entry into negotiations withpreconditions  we should instead seek to build goldenbridges to enable and encourage all to take part.We need all those who have been part of theproblem to become  as far as possible  part of thesolution. Given the depth and cost of the problem participation in negotiations should be treated as anecessity and a duty  not a privilege to be jealouslywithheld or awarded. If we multiply preconditions  we arein danger of saying  in effect  that negotiations can takeplace only when the problems they are supposed toaddress have already been largely solved.In saying this  I do not wish to be in any waydismissive of the genuine difficulty many people inNorthern Ireland have in dealing on an equal footing withthose who have in the past used or condoned violence andcoercion. It is clear that there is ample room for furtherguarantees and assurances aimed at building trust andconfidence in relation to this sensitive issue. If theseguarantees and assurances can be authoritatively andcredibly underscored by a respected and objective outsideagency  so much the better. That is why the idea of aninternational dimension to this confidence-buildingprocess is so appealing. We continue to work on it  in thehope that it can provide a bridge for all sides to overcomethe present difficulty.28The Secretary-General has eloquently expressed theessence of our task in this anniversary year by saying “To support the United Nations is not  and never hasbeen  to subsidize a separate  independent entity.Today  more than ever  to support the United Nationsis to participate in the only world Organizationcomposed of all humanity and in the service of allhumanity.“Today  a half-century later  it is our duty andour privilege to take this project to its next stage —the achievement of an age of peace  development andsecurity.”"
"75",3297,"IRN",50,1995,"May I atthe outset congratulate President Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal on his well-deserved election to the presidency ofthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly of the UnitedNations and assure him of the full cooperation of thedelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran at thisimportant session  which coincides with the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations.Less than a month from today  Members of theOrganization will assemble in this very Hall to celebratea half-century of operation of the United Nations. Fiftyyears ago  when the bitter events and experience of theSecond World War were omnipresent  the originalMembers decided to establish an organization “determinedto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.They signed the Charter of the United Nations  the resultof two months of negotiations and compromise among theparticipants at the San Francisco Conference  which wasto serve as the framework and the guide to prevent warand promote the economic and social advancement of allnations  large and small.However  it is generally acknowledged that shortlyafter the establishment of the Organization  the spirit ofcooperation and friendship gave way to bloc politics andrivalry  which led to the cold war and effectivelyprevented the achievement of the objectives enshrined inthe Charter. It would not be excessive to point to theantipathy between the two blocs as the principal cause ofwars  underdevelopment of the third world  suppression ofliberation struggles of nations under foreign domination and interference in the internal affairs of others. It wasthis mentality  prevalent in the bipolar world  which ineffect denied the Organization the opportunity to fulfil itsobligations completely  and which circumscribed theextent of participation by Member States in thedecision-making process and brought about the dominanceof a few countries.After 50 years of turbulence  the United Nations isnow in one of its most sensitive periods. Although manyproblems and obstacles of the past no longer exist  a newset of challenges have appeared  each of which has takenthe credibility  efficiency  relevance and ability of theOrganization to task  and which provide opportunities andresponsibilities to bring into conformity the modusoperandi of international relations in general and theOrganization itself in particular  with the purposes andprinciples of the Charter.Today the United Nations faces these challenges andopportunities at a time when it remains the only trulyuniversal organization. This universality of theOrganization can naturally put tremendous resources at itsdisposal to facilitate the achievement of the principles and25objectives of the United Nations Charter  particularly themaintenance of international peace and security  thepromotion of economic and social development  justice andmutual cooperation  and place it in a better position to dealwith emerging challenges in a more efficient anddistinguished fashion.What should be of the utmost importance to theOrganization is the extent to which Member Statesparticipate in its decision-making process. In fact  if wedefine and assess the universality of the Organization interms of the wide participation by Member States in itsdecision-making process  and not merely in terms of thenumber of its Member States  and direct all our efforts tostrengthening such universality  we will contributetremendously to enhancing the credibility  authority andability of the Organization. In other words  when publicparticipation of all Members as sovereign States isguaranteed in decisions of the Organization and theirimplementation  then the possibility of the exerting ofundue influence and dominance by a few States to shapethe approach of the Organization vis-à-vis internationalissues according to the limited confines of their ownnational interests diminishes to a large extent.Regrettably  even in the current internationalenvironment  certain Members continue to adopt unilateralactions contrary to the provisions of the Charter  andthereby exhibit an absence  for their part  of the spirit ofinternational cooperation.The arrogant approach and attitude of the Governmentof the United States of America towards the internationalcommunity  and the unsuccessful attempts of the Americanforeign policy establishment to exploit issues of globalconcern  such as terrorism and the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction  to advance an extraneous andillegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeeddangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateralmeasures.The United States Secretary of State must put to restthe illusion that his Government can become both the judgeand the policeman of the global community. Nor should heexpect others to follow American pressures againstindependent States brought to bear with the sole objectiveof pleasing Zionist pressure groups even at the expense ofdisregarding the interests of the American people.Perhaps they still do not really believe in thefundamental principle of the sovereign equality of Statesthat constitutes the cornerstone of the United Nations andthat requires each and every Member of the Organizationto play its role in securing the objectives of the Charter.This mentality is unfortunately the unwelcome heritage ofthe cold-war period when  owing to the nature of blocrivalries  States Members of the United Nations wereviewed  not as independent  sovereign equals  but asmembers of power blocs. The unfortunate natural by-products of such a world view are inequality  hegemony disrespect for the interests and spiritual values of othernations  disregard of the choices and opinions of themajority  preference for the short-term interests of theminority and self-serving interpretations of the rules andprinciples of international law.It seems imperative  therefore  that in the newinternational political environment all organs of theUnited Nations  particularly the Security Council  shouldadopt substantive and procedural measures to facilitate thefull integration and participation of all Member States.The Security Council  which constitutionally representsthe general membership of the Organization and acts onits behalf  should muster the requisite political will to dealwith all crises on the basis of principle and the same setof standards and should avoid preference for the interestsof powerful States over the interests and choices of themajority in order to discharge its responsibilities inaccordance with the Charter. To achieve that objectivesome structural  substantive and procedural reforms in thework of the Council  including democratization andtransparency  are inevitable and will enhance thecredibility  efficiency and relevance of the Council as therepresentative of the general membership.At the same time  I should emphasize that the mostimportant organ of the United Nations  the one that is themanifestation of the principle of sovereign equality andaffords direct participation to all Member States  is theGeneral Assembly. Therefore  strengthening this importantorgan and ensuring the accountability of other organs particularly the Security Council  before the GeneralAssembly will guarantee full and more meaningfulparticipation by the Organization’s general membership inits decisions and their implementation. This will go veryfar towards strengthening true universality and providingthe most effective guarantees for the implementation of itsdecisions.In the past few years  following the end of the coldwar  we have witnessed increased efforts to formulatenew sets of international standards in various political social and economic spheres. A thorough review of thefinal documents of recent international conferences clearly26illustrates that  notwithstanding the conceptual andnormative transformations which the internationalcommunity has undergone in the formulation andexpression of its concerns and recommendations  it haslegitimately stood firm on the need to respect thefundamental principles that preserve the very fabric of ourdiverse and pluralistic world. For instance  concepts andphrases such as “the necessity and importance of upholdingfull respect for the spiritual and ethical values  national andregional particularities  as well as different historical andcultural backgrounds of countries”  and “the necessity ofhomogeneity and conformity in final documents andrecommendations of international conferences with thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter andthe prevalence of a spirit of international cooperation andconsensus in their implementation and follow up” havebeen incorporated and reaffirmed in the final documents ofthe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna  theInternational Conference on Population and Development inCairo  the World Summit for Social Development inCopenhagen  and the recently held Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing.This clearly attests to the fact that while theinternational community has taken it upon itself to adopt ajust and non-discriminatory approach through internationalcooperation towards the protection and promotion of allhuman rights  including the right to development  asuniversal  indivisible and interdependent rights  it continuesto insist on the absolute imperative of guaranteeing that inthe process of international standard-setting  promotion andprotection  the sanctity of the principle of the nationalsovereignty of all States is respected and that no nation’sreligious values and beliefs and cultural and nationalidentity are infringed.Furthermore  the Charter of the United Nationsrecognizes international cooperation in economic and socialissues as necessary for the maintenance of peaceful andfriendly relations between States. Unfortunately notwithstanding this emphasis  because of the conditionsprevailing in international relations  both during and afterthe cold war  the importance and centrality of issues relatedto economic and social development have not received dueconsideration.In addition  at a time when the North-South gapcontinues to widen on a daily basis  the world economictrend  manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionistpolicies on the part of the developed countries  also tendsfurther to debilitate the potential of the developing countriesto deal with the adverse impacts of international economicdevelopment. In this connection  we welcome theSecretary-General’s “Agenda for Development” andannounce our intention to participate actively in thedeliberation of it. We firmly believe that post-cold-waropportunities should be utilized to their maximumpotential so as to place issues of economic and socialdevelopment at the centre of the United Nations attention.Hence  there is a renewed need for recommendationsabout and practical measures for expansion of the role ofthe United Nations in promoting the economicdevelopment of developing countries  as well as full andrapid implementation of relevant agreements andinternationally agreed upon objectives in this field. In thisconnection  the fundamental principle that States have theright to benefit from the utilization of their own resourcesthat are vital for their sustained economic growth anddevelopment in accordance with their national policiesand priorities must not be neglected.Another key characteristic of the post-cold-war erais the expansion of peace-keeping operations  which have in recent years  demanded an increasing share of theenergy and resources of the Organization. Nevertheless the expansion of United Nations peace-keeping operationsshould not take place at the expense of its activities in thearea of development  which constitute one of the mosteffective measures for preventing the occurrence oftensions and conflicts as well as for ensuring tranquillityand stability. The Islamic Republic of Iran  along withother non-aligned countries  supports the United Nationspeace-keeping efforts in principle  but emphasizes that allMember States that are willing and able to participate insuch operations should be treated equally and withoutdiscrimination. In like manner  while a unified UnitedNations command structure is essential for successfulpeace-keeping operations  its leadership should not be themonopoly of a handful of States.Although the United Nations has been successful inreturning peace and stability to some volatile parts of theworld  its disregard for some important principles hasresulted in the failure of the Organization to resolve othercrises that still rage. Let me emphasize that it isabsolutely imperative for the United Nations fully torespect fundamental principles  including nationalsovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference inthe internal affairs of States in all phases of theestablishment and execution of peace-keeping operations.The Islamic Republic of Iran  eager to contributemore actively to this growing area of United Nations27activity  announces its readiness in principle to participatein United Nations peace-keeping operations in accordancewith our tenets and the fundamental principles of theCharter. Here  I deem it necessary to reiterate thepreparedness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatchpeace-keeping forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina  which wehad earlier committed along with other Islamic countries tostrengthen the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) in order to enable it to discharge effectivelyits mandate to protect safe areas.We hold the firm view that if the Security Council hadat least provided the necessary mandate or committed thenecessary forces for the protection of the safe areas including through taking advantage of the assistance offeredby the Islamic countries  the Bosnian Serbs could not havecontinued  with relative ease  their crimes of genocideagainst the defenceless people of United Nations-declaredsafe areas. However  the lack of political will to suppressaggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance withUnited Nations decisions  coupled with the unreasonable immoral and legally baseless insistence by some onextending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslaviato the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to theSerbs that they can continue with impunity their murder destruction  aggression  “ethnic cleansing” and genocide.Since the outbreak of the crisis  Islamic countries including the Islamic Republic of Iran  have adopted aconstructive position and called for internationalcooperation in finding a just and peaceful resolution of theconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The recent decision ofthe joint meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) ContactGroup and troop contributing countries to establish the“Assistance Mobilization Group” in order to address thehumanitarian  economic  legal and defence requirements ofthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents a properapproach to this tragedy in keeping with the principles andpurposes of the United Nations.This decision  along with the previous declaration byOIC member States of their readiness to dispatch asufficient number of peace-keepers to Bosnia  as well astheir declaration on the “de-jure inapplicability” of the armsembargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina are not only solidlybased in international law  the United Nations Charter andhumanitarian principles  but also emanate from theconsidered assessment that without a proper militarybalance  it would be impossible to compel the Serbs toengage in serious negotiations or to guarantee theunhindered implementation of any negotiated settlement.In this connection  the Islamic Republic of Iranwelcomes the recent cooperation between the two ContactGroups  and holds that only a plan which does not entailrecognition of the fruits of “ethnic cleansing” andguarantees the national sovereignty and territorial integrityof Bosnia and Herzegovina as a Member of the UnitedNations can restore peace and stability to the region.Furthermore  it is necessary in any peace negotiations toaccord the non-Serb populations of Kosovo  Sanjak  andVojvodina the same rights and privileges as thoserequested for the Serbs in Bosnia. Moreover  in order toguarantee a durable settlement and to preclude therepetition of aggression and genocide  the InternationalTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible forSerious Violations of International Humanitarian LawCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslaviasince 1991 should continue its work resolutely  withoutany regard for political expediency  and severely pursueand punish those who are found guilty.The increasing growth of inter-State cooperationwithin the framework of regional groupings constitutesanother characteristic of the new international climate.There exist natural common grounds for cooperation as well as shared interests among the countries of anyregion  which together create a framework for thepromotion of regional organizations. Such regionalcooperation leads  in turn  to enhanced peace and stabilityin each region and the world through the expansion of aculture of cooperation  coexistence and dialogue. In thiscontext  the Islamic Republic of Iran has emphasizedregional cooperation and taken significant steps in thisregard in order to enhance prosperity  peace and stabilitythroughout its own region.Today  the Economic Cooperation Organization(ECO) has grown to an organization with 10 members.With a population of 336 million  rich natural resourcesand considerable potential  and in close proximity toimportant centres of economy and trade in Asia  Europe and the Middle East  the organization endeavours tostrengthen and expand its activities  particularly in theareas of transportation  communications  trade and energy in order to achieve well-being and prosperity for thepeoples of the region  and to promote trade and economicgrowth.In another effort for the expansion of regionalcooperation  the Islamic Republic of Iran has madeconcrete proposals for the establishment of the CaspianSea Cooperation Organization which  with the28participation of the littoral States  would aim for theexpansion of cooperation in the fields of shipping  fishing the protection of the environment and the exploitation ofthe resources of the Caspian Sea. Fortunately  the proposalof the Islamic Republic of Iran has been accepted by theStates concerned  that is  the Russian Federation  theRepublic of Kazakhstan  the Republic of Azerbaijan and theRepublic of Turkmenistan. In our opinion  the Caspian Seamust be a sea of peace and tranquillity whose affairs willbe decided by the concurrence of all its littoral States.Considering the political and economic characteristicsof our region  and the occurrence and expansion of conflictsand tensions due to internal and external factors  theGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran feels nationallyand internationally obliged to exert every effort aimed atthe enhancement of economic prosperity and regionalsecurity  the prevention and de-escalation of tension and thepeaceful resolution of regional crises  based on respect forsovereignty and territorial integrity  the inviolability ofinternationally recognized borders  and non-interference inthe internal affairs of others.In Afghanistan  while refraining from any involvementin the regrettable fratricidal war  our policy has focused onkeeping channels of communication open with theGovernment and all Afghan groups in order to put an endto fighting and to bring about a negotiated settlement.In the crisis in Tajikistan  the Islamic Republic of Iranhas exerted every effort and has succeeded in securingnegotiations in Tehran at the highest level betweenGovernment and opposition groups  leading to the signingof significant agreements concerning a cease-fire and thepeace process. Attempts to find solutions to these crisesrequire the constructive engagement of regional States andthe effective participation of the United Nations and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference.At the same time  the maintenance of internal andregional stability and security in Central Asia and theCaucasus requires economic prosperity. The IslamicRepublic of Iran  in view of the special economic andgeographical situation of regional States  has tried to serveas a reliable economic and trade partner  through bilateraleconomic cooperation  as well as the establishment oftrilateral commissions with the participation of States fromwithin and outside the region aimed at the expansion andfacilitation of trade.Inter-State cooperation in the sensitive and strategicarea of the Persian Gulf  where regional States share manycommonalities  can also lead to economic prosperity  aswell as guaranteeing peace and stability. The militarypresence of foreign Powers  who have interests atvariance with stability and long-term cooperation amongregional States  cannot be conducive to achieving thecommon objective of securing the tranquillity of thisimportant waterway.In the final analysis  all littoral countries of thePersian Gulf would be better served if they were to joinhands in a concerted effort to maintain peace and securityin the region  which will directly affect our destiny. Suchefforts can be channelled through an institution organizedby these same littoral States  where confidence-buildingmeasures commensurate with the specificities of the areacan be devised and followed up.Reducing military budgets  setting a ceiling for armspurchases  acceding to disarmament and arms-controltreaties  cooperating with the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms and devising a mechanism fortransparency in armaments are but a few examples ofconfidence-building measures which the aforementionedinstitution could consider. The Islamic Republic of Irandeclares its full readiness to enter into bilateral andmultilateral negotiations with its neighbours in order toreach common understandings on these issues.In the Middle East  the Zionist entity  supported bycertain powerful countries  continues its occupation ofPalestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon  and persists inits policies of aggression  suppression of those who dareto express opposition to its illegal occupation  andviolation of the very basic human rights of the Palestinianpeople.Experience and the events of the past few yearsfurther illustrate the fact that the only viable option forrestoring peace and security to the Middle East is onewhich is comprehensive and just and which addresses thefundamental issues of the Palestine question. Such asolution should entail a realization of the inalienablerights of the Palestinian people  including the return of allPalestinian refugees and displaced persons to theirhomeland  the full and free exercise of their right to self-determination  and liberation of all occupied territories. Inview of the volatility of the Middle East and the PersianGulf  these two regions must be off limits to any foreignmilitary presence and weapons of mass destruction. MyGovernment continues to underscore the need toimplement numerous General Assembly resolutions aswell as the decision of the Review and Extension29Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to establish anuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as animportant factor for installing stability in the region. Whathas actually prevented the NPT from achieving itsobjectives and the establishment of the Middle East as azone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction has been Israel’s illegal nuclear capabilities andits refusal to join the NPT and put its unsafeguardednuclear facilities under the safeguard regime of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Undoubtedly  without the direct and indirect financialand technological support of certain Westernnuclear-weapon States  Israel could not have acquired thecapability to develop nuclear weapons. Unfortunately  thereexist strong indications that the nuclear capability of thatregime is being continually increased by the very samecountries that are the most vocal proponents of nuclearnon-proliferation. This discriminatory trend persists even incircumstances where Israeli nuclear policy has adverselyaffected regional security  the negative effects of whichinclude a lack of confidence and a perception of insecurityin the region  an escalating arms race and influx of foreignweapons into the region  and the refusal of some States inthe region to join certain disarmament treaties.On the international level  it must be acknowledgedthat  despite the modest progress achieved in the control ofnuclear  chemical and conventional weapons  these weaponshave unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitativelyto an alarming degree. We are of the view that the failureof the international community to deal effectively withthese weapons is primarily due to the fact that majorproducers of conventional weapons and weapons of massdestruction have prevented the United Nations fromfulfilling its primary responsibility and central role in thefield of disarmament. Another main reason for this failureis that the policies of major arms-producing countriesdesigned to control the spread of weapons of massdestruction and conventional weapons are alwaysshort-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously atsecuring the destructive power of their own weaponry andtheir own military dominance.A glance at generally unsatisfactory disarmamentnegotiations in various fields  including nucleardisarmament  the Hague negotiations on the chemicalweapons Convention  negotiations concerning verificationsystems for the bacteriological weapons Convention  andthe performance of the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms make the veracity of our contentionquite evident.Following four weeks of difficult negotiations  the1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT couldnot reach the conclusion that any progress towards theprimary objectives of the Treaty  including completenuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclearenergy  had been achieved in the past 25 years. Theindefinite extension of the Treaty must be viewed withinthe framework of three major final documents of theConference  together with the necessity for all signatories particularly the nuclear Powers  to commit themselves tothe full implementation of all provisions and objectives ofthe Treaty. These obligations include achieving completenuclear disarmament  expanding the peaceful uses ofnuclear energy  strengthening the role and enhancing theauthority of the IAEA as the only international bodycompetent to oversee the good-faith discharge of MemberStates’ responsibilities under the Treaty  ensuring theuniversality of the NPT as an urgent priority  andestablishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclearweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In thisconnection  the nuclear-weapon States should  as a firststep  prove their good faith by refraining from nucleartesting and finalizing a comprehensive test-ban treaty in1996.The Islamic Republic of Iran  inspired by the divineteachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarityand the continued participation and efforts of its people has endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of thedignity and worth of the human person and respect forhuman values  a society whose ethos includes fairness andsocial justice as well as cultural  social and economicdevelopment. In this regard  despite extensive damagecaused by the imposed war and other economic pressures the Islamic Republic of Iran  endowed with the resolveand work ethic of its entire population  has been able notonly to move towards reversing the vast destruction of thewar  but also successfully to complete its first five-yeareconomic and social development plan and embark uponthe implementation of the second five-year plan on solidfoundations. We foresee bright prospects for astrengthened economic  social  cultural and politicalinfrastructure.Since the Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believesthat the maintenance of peace and security  at thenational  regional and international levels alike  isdependent upon economic growth and sustaineddevelopment  we spend only about 1 per cent of our30national budget on defence and devote the rest tooverhauling and strengthening our economic  social andcultural infrastructures. We have made this strategicdecision at a time when the bitter experience of militaryaggression against my country  a foreign military presencein the region and an alarming military build-up followingthe second war in the Persian Gulf could have justified veryextensive military expenditures.The current session of the General Assembly providesa golden opportunity for us to engage in a serious reviewof the performance of our Organization over the past 50years  assess the current international situation and try toshape the conduct of international relations in the light ofthe United Nations Charter in a fashion that remedies theshortcomings of the past.The most important characteristic of our world is itscultural diversity  which has enriched human civilization.The experience of the past 50 years has clearly illustratedthat attempts to impose Western standards  beliefs andculture upon the rest of humanity have not only failed toachieve the desired results  but also undermine thefoundations of peaceful coexistence and mutualunderstanding because  in spite of the appearance ofchampioning the cause of freedom and tolerance  such anapproach manifests extreme intolerance towards the valuesand beliefs of others.Mutual respect for the rights  values and beliefs of allmembers of the international community  along with theempowerment of all nations to participate actively in thesetting of international norms  the maintenance of peace andsecurity and the promotion of economic and socialdevelopment throughout the world must form the solidfoundation of Member States’ activities in the next 50 yearsof the United Nations. The Islamic Republic of Iran isprepared to fulfil its role in this respect."
"76",3344,"IRQ",50,1995,"I ampleased to begin my statement by extending to you sincerecongratulations on your election to the presidency of thepresent session of the General Assembly. I am confidentthat your high competence and profound experience willcontribute effectively to the success of the work of thepresent historic session.This session coincides with the fiftieth anniversary ofour Organization. There is no doubt that such an importantoccasion calls for examining the course the Organizationhas taken in order to draw the best object-lessons thatwould enable the international community to proceed to thebuilding of a better future in which peace and stabilitywould prevail on the basis of justice  the balance ofinterests of all peoples and genuine internationalcooperation that would be free from selfishness andhegemony; a future which would open the doors towardsthe solution of economic  social  cultural and humanitarianproblems that continue to cause suffering to theoverwhelming majority of States  especially in Asia  Africaand Latin America.Members of the international community welcomedthe end of the cold war. They view it as the harbinger of anew age. However  many representatives of many MemberStates did point out the dangers of imbalance ininternational relations. They warned that the supremacy ofone super-Power would make international life hostage tothat Power and  thereby  lead to the imposition of its views interests and policies on the rest of the world. Thecorrecting of this imbalance in the international situationrequires a great deal of care in upholding equality betweenStates  restructuring the United Nations in line with well-balanced formulas  revitalizing the work of its institutionsin a manner that would ensure balance and genuineparticipation in responsibility  prevent hegemony by one orcertain parties over the international community and overthe United Nations with its institutions. Although theseobjectives have not been achieved so far  to work towardstheir achievement and to develop an understanding of whatthey involved continue to be urgent needs of the highestpriority.We believe that the imposition of a unipolarstandpoint on the work of the United Nations totallycontradicts the purposes and principles of the Charter.The persistence of such attempts would lead only to moreanxiety and deterioration in international relations.This conviction stems from Iraq’s actual experienceover the past five years. It is an experience that relates tothe implementation of the resolutions of the SecurityCouncil on the so-called Gulf Crisis  and especially theimplementation of resolution 687 (1991).That resolution imposed upon Iraq a number ofobligations  as a basis for a comprehensive settlement ofthe situation. A few days after the adoption of theresolution  Iraq informed the Security Council of itsreadiness to comply with the provisions of the resolutiondespite the harsh nature of the obligations imposedthereby. Since that date  Iraq has seriously taken uponitself the implementation of the resolution in order tonormalize the situation at the regional and internationallevels. In fact  a great many steps have taken place inimplementing the resolution. Our people hope that whathas been achieved will be the subject of an objective andfair evaluation by the Security Council that would lead tothe lifting of the embargo imposed upon Iraq for morethan five years now.Allow me to review very briefly the stepstaken by Iraq in the context of implementing theobligations imposed by the Security Council inresolution 687 (1991).On 10 November 1994  Iraq officially recognized thesovereignty  the territorial integrity and the politicalindependence of the State of Kuwait  and the internationalboundary demarcated by the United Nations Iraq-KuwaitBoundary Demarcation Commission. This was done inimplementation of resolutions 687 (1991) and 833 (1993).Iraq has cooperated also with the representatives ofthe United Nations in returning Kuwaiti property on thebasis of the lists presented through the United Nationscoordinator. In this connection  Iraq affirmed that it willreturn any item of property that would be found when itis established that it belongs to Kuwait.As regards the prisoners of war and the missingpersons  Iraq  in implementation of Security Council8General Assembly 21st plenary meetingresolutions 686 (1991) and 687(1991)  released all prisonersof war and detainees who were in Iraq and repatriated themin cooperation with the International Committee of the RedCross (ICRC). As for investigating the fate of missingpersons  we are cooperating fully within the framework ofthe joint work carried out under the auspices of the ICRCby the Tripartite Commission and its TechnicalSubcommittee on Military and Civilian Missing Prisonersof War and Mortal Remains. Since the middle of 1994 when we found the appropriate modality for effectivetechnical work in dealing with this humanitarian problem we have sought within the said framework to provideanswers to the questions raised in the individual inquiryfiles presented to us on the basis of the availableinformation. Moreover  Iraq has been receptive to all theinitiatives of States and personalities to find a quicksolution to this humanitarian problem in accordance withthe Geneva Conventions.With regard to the subject of compensation  Iraqaccepted the principle of responsibility in accordance withinternational law to compensate direct damage resultingfrom the events in Kuwait as stated in resolution 687(1991).Iraq has cooperated also with the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) in carrying out itstasks and has extended every possible assistance to theMission with the aim of enabling it to perform its duties.Iraq has affirmed its adherence to the 1925 GenevaProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War ofAsphyxiating  Poisonous or Other Gases and BacteriologicalMethods of warfare  and deposited the instruments ofratification of the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Development  Production and Stockpiling ofBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and ontheir Destruction  in implementation of paragraph 7 ofresolution 687 (1991).As for the implementation by Iraq of section (C) ofresolution 687 (1991)  that is the provisions relating toproscribed weapons  our relationship with the SpecialCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) witnessed  in the middle of 1993  a turning point inthe field of positive and constructive cooperation in orderto finalize the implementation of the said section.On 26 November 1993  we presented the officialresponse in regard to compliance with resolution 715 (1991)relating to monitoring in the field of weapons.In the process of work with the Special Commissionand the IAEA  we have not hesitated to offer all possibleassistance to facilitate the work  whether by presentinginformation  available documents  details relating to pastprogrammes  the destruction of prohibited weapons  andthe setting up of an effective monitoring system. We havebeen able to achieve substantive progress in this area  asacknowledged by the Special Commission in its report tothe Security Council on 19 June 1995  and have taken thefinal steps to complete the desired work.These facts are well established in the relationshipbetween Iraq and the Special Commission and the IAEA.The substantive nature of these facts cannot be distortedby the campaign waged against Iraq by well-knownquarters because of special objectives of their own whichare totally alien to the objectives of resolution 687 (1991).Despite all the propaganda  Iraq no longer has anyproscribed weapons  equipment  devices or materials  andthis is the essence of resolution 687 (1991). We affirmour determination to continue our cooperation with theSpecial Commission and the IAEA to close the weaponsfile in accordance with the relevant resolutions and havethe embargo against Iraq lifted.I should like to express here our deep regretregarding the a priori ill-intentioned exaggerations whichcast a terrifying image of past Iraqi weapons programmes and the deliberate distortion of the fact that theseprogrammes were something of the past and that they nolonger exist. Raising fears in such a contrived fashion isnot an objective position at all. It is an attitude promptedby political objectives which are far removed from theconcern over security and stability in the region and theprovisions of resolution 687 (1991).Iraq has taken all these steps even while it hascontinued to suffer the hardship caused by a totalembargo  the most extended ever imposed by the SecurityCouncil in all its history. It is an embargo that embraceseverything and every aspect of life with the exception offood and medicine. However  the freezing of Iraq’s assetswith foreign banks has prevented Iraq from using any ofthose assets to purchase its needs of medicines andfoodstuffs and  thereby  has made the exception relatingto food and medicine devoid of any practical content. Thesituation in Iraq has been aggravated by the actualpractice obtaining in the work of the Security CouncilCommittee established by resolution 661 (1990)  which isin charge of the application of sanctions against Iraq.Work in the Committee proceeds along highly9General Assembly 21st plenary meetingbureaucratic lines and follows the rule of unanimity. Thishas provided certain States with an easy way to object andthereby to reject a large number of export requests to Iraqto meet civilian humanitarian needs  from pencils andeducational materials to automobile tyres and other simplecivilian provisions. All these matters are documented in therecords of the 661 Committee.The deliberate insistence on prolonging the embargoagainst Iraq is not linked to Iraq’s implementation of itsobligations. It is a systematic plan to inflict severe damageupon Iraq and to deliberately destroy its infrastructure andput paid to its developmental capabilities. This is a fact thatis known to all. The reports of the competent UnitedNations Agencies operating in Iraq and ofnon-governmental organizations concerned with reliefwarned against the deterioration of the situation as a resultof the shortage of food and medicine  which threatens thelives of millions of Iraqis  including thousands of children women and old people. In this connection  I should like torefer to the last alert of the World Food Programme  issuedon 26 September 1995.The report of the Secretary-General on the work of theOrganization  and his “Supplement to An Agenda forPeace”  refer clearly to the problem of sanctions. Weshould like in turn to draw the attention of Member Statesto the fact that the application of sanctions against Iraq with such cruelty and bureaucratic complexity  calls forquestioning and scrutiny  in the interests of objectivity. Weare not sure that all the representatives in the GeneralAssembly know that the Security Council reviews thesanctions regime against Iraq every 60 days  and that 27reviews have been conducted to date without any easing ofthe sanctions. The situation remains the same as it has beensince 3 April 1991  as if nothing had been achieved. Is thisa healthy situation?The tragic consequences of the embargo have not beenlimited to the food and health sectors in Iraq. The sectionsof agriculture  education and environment also havesustained grave damage  due to the shortages of materialsand the basic requirements needed for work in such sectors even at the minimum level required to satisfy the basicneeds of the civilian population.The aggravation of this extremely difficult situationhas not prevented us from continuing to implement ourobligations under the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil. It is worth noting that  as is known to all  whilewe were being called upon to implement our obligations and while we were deploying persistent efforts to do justthat  we have not received in return any objective andequitable position that would have reduced sanctionscommensurately with the progress achieved by Iraq inimplementing the resolutions  or that would have givenencouragement and hope and given confidence that thesituation would be normalized eventually  in accordancewith the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.The reality has been the very opposite. From thevery beginning and to date  we have been the target ofmany threats; doubts have been raised about ourintentions; and we have been  twice  the target of armedaggression. There has been considerable deceit withregard to objectives. Pressure has been brought to bear onany party that even thought of treating us fairly  even ifsuch fairness was not intended as a gesture towards Iraqbut as a means of safeguarding the credibility of theCharter system and of the resolutions of the SecurityCouncil. We have been accused of intermittent andselective cooperation and of a lack of peaceful intentionsand lack of credibility  to such an extent that the levellingof accusations by certain parties has come to resemble achronic pathological alignment. Such accusations havebeen accompanied by the continued pursuance on thepractical level of policies aimed at interfering in theinternal affairs of Iraq in order to destabilize it; toundermine its security  stability  the freedom of its peopleand its sovereignty; and to try and change its politicalsystem.A super-Power has imposed upon my country twono-fly zones  in the north and the south  without any legaljustification or authorization from the Security Council. Ithas also exercised every means of pressure and deceptionto perpetuate the harsh conditions caused by the embargoagainst Iraq  while  at the same time  it conspires  quiteopenly  to change the regime. Without any hesitation  itsofficials declare that such is its intention. While all thistakes place  it is we who are asked to prove our peacefulintentions and credibility.It is no secret that the Power that leads the onslaughtI have spoken of against Iraq is the United States ofAmerica. All the facts on the ground make it clear that itis the United States of America and no one else thatshould be asked to demonstrate its credibility  to provethat its intentions are peaceful  and to desist from itscontinuing acts of provocation  aggression andinterference in the internal affairs of Iraq and fromfomenting tension in the Gulf region under the pretext ofan illusory threat.10General Assembly 21st plenary meetingPresident Saddam Hussein noted that the Americanadministration’s accusation that Iraq lacks credibility in itsrelationship with the Special Commission is a false one and that it is the United States that does not have credibilityin dealing with States and international organizations.Where is the credibility in the position of the United Stateswhen it declares its determination not to lift the sanctionsagainst Iraq even if Iraq implements Security Councilresolution 687 (1991)  of which the United States was thechief author? Again  where is the credibility in the positionof the United States when the American administrationmasses its naval and military forces in the Gulf and in theMediterranean under the false pretext that Iraq is planningto attack Jordan  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia?I do not wish to enter into polemics with therepresentatives of the United States in the GeneralAssembly. But I find it necessary  with regard to theAmerican allegations about credibility  to raise certainpoints of principle which call for serious thought andcontemplation. Before I do that  I should like to ask thisquestion: if it is important that the implementation of theresolutions of the Security Council should be founded oncredibility  then how can allegations about the credibility ofIraq be accepted at a time when the State which repeatsthose allegations puts itself above the Security Council andabove the Charter and gives itself the right to interpretUnited Nations resolutions and to arbitrarily drawconclusions from such interpretations that agree with itsown selfish interests which are far removed from any basisto be found in the provisions of the resolutions themselves?While on the subject of credibility  where are theefforts of the Security Council  and the United States inparticular  with regard to the implementation of paragraph14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991)  which aimsat declaring the Middle East as a zone free from weaponsof mass destruction? This is an objective that has to be afundamental cornerstone of the edifice of peace  securityand stability in the region if such an edifice is to be builton sturdy  well-balanced and equitable foundations. It is anobjective that acquires great importance from the standpointof the oft-mentioned credibility  since it is a known factthat Israel possesses those weapons. Why does the UnitedStates keep completely silent about paragraph 14  and whyhas the Security Council not taken any action towards theimplementation of that part of its resolution? Does such ablatant double standard have anything to do withcredibility?Is it objective or even fair to imagine that theobligations stipulated in Security Council resolutions couldbe implemented in a natural fashion in the context of suchcircumstances  atmospherics  and hostile policies directedagainst Iraq?Iraq is well aware of the fact that it is not in itsinterest to conceal any information relating to pastweapons programmes  and that its interest lies in workingto lift as soon as possible the sanctions that are imposedon it. Indeed  Iraq is acting in full conformity with thisobjective. In this connection  we call upon member Statesof the Security Council not to jump to any conclusions onthe basis of any unjust accusations levelled at Iraq because the right thing to do would be to wait for theoutcome of the work of the Special Commission  whichis responsible for evaluating the implementation by Iraqof the Council’s resolutions concerning the proscribedweapons.We do not call for anything more than the legallysound application of Security Council resolutions inconsonance with the purposes and principles of theCharter  and not in line with the whims and aims ofunilateral policies of a certain State  which are foundedon the logic of naked power  opportunism  doublestandards and the imposition of hegemony.We believe that there is a collective duty to workjointly with firmness in order to put things in the rightperspective in order to ensure the sound application of theprovisions of the Charter. The first step in this directionrequires us to ponder the philosophy of the sanctions ascreated by the Charter. Is the sanctions regime a meanstowards an end  or is it an end in itself? What is thenature of the said regime? Is it punitive  or is it a meanswhereby the purposes of the Charter should be achievedwithout reference to the individual policies of individualMember States?It is well known to all that the sanctions regimecreated by the Charter is nothing more than a meansaimed at achieving certain results which would ultimatelylead to the realization of the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations as elaborated in Articles 1 and 2 ofthe Charter  and that the means should cease to be appliedonce the end has been achieved.The competence of the Security Council to imposesanctions is an exceptional means that is used when it isestablished  objectively  that all other means of peacefulsettlement of disputes have failed. Such a means shouldnot be  however  a tool in the hands of a super-Power orof a group of major Powers to achieve foreign policy11General Assembly 21st plenary meetinggoals at the expense of the common interest of MemberStates.It is now patently clear that the imposition of sanctionson Iraq and the maintenance of the embargo against it  inthe well-known fashion  cannot be justified on thesubstantive basis of the provisions of the Charter  becauseit has become  in actual fact  an extension of the unilateralpolicy of a super-Power that has made sanctions an end inthemselves and a vindictive means that serves its owninterests in the region.In essence  the grounds for the imposition of sanctionson Iraq no longer exist and  thus  the sanctions should belifted. But a well-known State obstructs the process.We should like to say to the United States that thesolution lies in dialogue  which provides a mechanism forthe achievement of interests on a balanced and equitablebasis. This is what Iraq has called for and continues to callfor. The policy of hegemony and of creating crises cannotbut fail  because it is illegitimate and because theinternational community rejects it. While this continues tobe our position of principle  we unfortunately find that theUnited States statesmen ignore the realities of the regionand the needs and aspirations of its peoples  who yearn tolive in stability  peace and fruitful cooperation amongstthemselves and with the world as a whole.At a time when we witness the tensions and internalconflicts that prevail in the states of the region  and thefeelings of bitterness amongst their peoples as a result ofthe current short-sighted policies  which recall to mind thepolicies of the old imperialist Powers  we in Iraq shouldlike  from this rostrum  to call for the promotion ofrelations of dialogue  understanding and goodneighbourliness amongst the States of the region  on thebasis of mutual respect  in accordance with the principlesof the Charter of the United Nations.Iraq is an ancient country with a very long history thatgoes back 7 000 years. The Iraqi people  who havecontributed greatly to human civilization  will remain incontrol of their affairs  independent in their choices andcapable of overcoming crises.We hope that Member States  especially the permanentmembers of the Security Council  will make every effort tointerpret and apply the provisions of the resolutions of theSecurity Council in accordance with their normal legalmeaning and not on the basis of whims and the politicalinterests of this or that State. Any course of action thatdeviates from this principled rule would lead only to lossof credibility and utterly undermine the principle of goodfaith in the determination of international obligations.The United Nations was established in order toachieve the common goals of preserving peace  securityand stability in the world. The provisions of theOrganization’s Charter  in letter and in spirit  are foundedon the balancing of rights and duties and aim atprotecting the common interests of the internationalcommunity. Therefore policies that are based on the logicof naked power and unilateral action outside the conceptsof the Charter  and that aim at achieving individualobjectives  are bound to contradict the very raison d’êtreof the Organization and to contravene the letter and spiritof its Charter. Such policies would only lead to themarginalization of the Organization’s role in internationalaffairs.It behoves us as we are about to celebrate half acentury of the existence of the Organization to rededicateourselves to honouring our undertakings as enshrined inthe Charter."
"77",3391,"ISL",50,1995,"Mr. President  may Icongratulate you on your election and express my deepsatisfaction at seeing a representative of Portugal  an allyand a valued member of the international community occupy the presidency of the General Assembly in ourfiftieth anniversary year.Anniversaries are occasions to celebrate pastaccomplishments. The towering achievement of the UnitedNations is to have survived through nearly half a centurywhere power relationships often submerged the high-mindedvision of the United Nations Charter. Therefore  as wecelebrate the half-century of our Organization  we alsocelebrate the triumph of hope over despair and of goodfaith over cynicism. At long last  there is an opportunityfor the United Nations to come into its own and for theideals of the Charter to take hold.At the same time  we must learn from our mistakes.Foremost  in that context  is the tragic conflict in Bosniaand Herzegovina. In spite of the laudable humanitarianand peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations  theOrganization has in the eyes of the world appearedincapable of preventing the savage dismembering of asovereign Member State.Although we all realize that the United Nations cannever provide foolproof insurance against evil andinjustice  the Organization must in the future face suchchallenges in a more resolute manner. We must demandmore of ourselves and learn how to use more effectivelythe indispensable machinery the Organization has to offer.We should also bear in mind that no organization however efficient  can provide a substitute for the politicalwill of its Member States.Recent setbacks should  however  not be allowed toobscure the considerable gains  global and regional  thathave been made on a number of fronts over the past year.Let me mention only a few.The march of democracy has continued through theorganization of free elections in different parts of theworld  and a growing number of people now live underpluralistic and democratic Governments. In recent years the Organization has contributed to the success ofelections in various Member States.Two major United Nations Conferences took placeearlier this year. Each could  if followed up in earnest make a tangible difference in the lives of peopleeverywhere. At the World Summit on SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen in March  we decided toplace people at the centre of development and to addressthe problem of global poverty more effectively. At therecently concluded Fourth World Conference on Womenin Beijing  we pledged to empower women and to involvethem as equal partners in all spheres of society. Together women and men can and should create a powerful unitybased on equality  development and peace.In the area of international law  the achievements ofthe United Nations were once again brought into focuswith the entry into force of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea last November and theadoption in August of the Agreement on the16Implementation of the Provisions of the Convention relatingto the Conservation and Management of Straddling FishStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.In May  a historic step was taken towards ridding theworld of the threat of nuclear weapons. The decision by theParties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to extendthe Treaty indefinitely and without conditions should pavethe way for a comprehensive and verifiable test ban and anagreement to cut off the production of fissile material. It isregrettable that China and France have not heeded theworldwide demand for a moratorium on nuclear testing.At the regional level there have also been welcomedevelopments. While the passage has not been smooth there has been further progress towards a comprehensivepeace in the Middle East. We have witnessed the jointefforts of the Israelis and the Palestinians to bring theirconflict to an end  and we extend to them our sincerecongratulations on their historic agreement to be signedlater this week.These are substantial accomplishments. They confirmthat hard work  guided by the goals and ideals of theUnited Nations  can bear fruit. More of that samededication is now required as the Organization prepares totake on the complex challenges of the twenty-first century.The foremost challenge is the need to establish andsafeguard peace. While the threat of nuclear holocaust hasreceded  we still live in a world riven by wars. Annualmilitary expenditure still nearly equals the total income ofthe poorer half of the world’s population. The peacedividend we had hoped for in the aftermath of the cold warremains for many a sight unseen.The Secretary-General has rightly observed that thereis an inherent link between peace and development.Without the one you cannot have the other. Peace is thenecessary precondition for the well-being of all peoples and in the long run we shall be able to protect ourselvesfrom the scourge of war only if we make the necessaryinvestment in the infrastructure of peace. This involves among other things  dealing with the legacy of deprivationthat still confronts mankind.The challenge of development will not lend itself to asimple formulation in terms of government versus themarket-place. Instead  we must apply a comprehensiveframework  linking democracy  society  the economy andthe environment  carefully nuanced to regional and localcircumstances. Here  the Secretary-General has led the wayin his ground-breaking report. Let me dwell on a fewaspects of the issue of development that are of particularinterest to my own country.First a word on the role of democracy. Democracies it is sometimes said  do not make wars. By promotingdemocracy we also foster peace. This is in part becausetwo of the main pillars of democracy are tolerance andrespect for the customs  traditions and opinions of others.But tolerance and respect for diversity must not bemisinterpreted. We live in a world of rich culturaldiversity  which we should relish and protect. However multiculturalism should never be used as a pretext forcompromising basic and universal human rights.Iceland attaches continued importance tointernational efforts to create a global environmentconducive to job-led economic growth. But economicgrowth must never be our sole objective  without regardto human values.Environmental protection is another main concern.Important strides have been made in this area since theEarth Summit in Rio. Climate change and ozonedepletion  two major dangers to the global ecosystem  arenow being dealt with on the basis of legally bindingconventions. But much will depend on coordinated actionto implement the commitments we have undertaken.Furthermore  greater attention needs to be devoted to themarine environment.Pollution of the marine environment  if notcontained  can have a serious impact on humansettlements in certain regions of the world  not leastcommunities of indigenous peoples. In this connection chemical pollutants in the form of persistent organicsubstances are of particular concern for entire societieswhich base their livelihood on the living resources of thesea.Iceland is firmly of the view that this threat can becountered only through a global and legally bindingframework similar to that governing climate change andozone depletion. For this reason  my Government attachesparticular importance to the conference on the protectionof the marine environment from land-based sources  dueto take place in Washington later this year  and we urgeMember States to take active part in this conference.Marine living resources can make an importantcontribution to food security in a world faced with rapidpopulation growth. Such resources provide food and17livelihood to millions of people and  if sustainably used offer increased potential to meet nutritional and socialneeds  particularly in the developing countries  as noted ina recent report of the Food and Agriculture Organization.For this reason  it is particularly regrettable that closeto 70 per cent of the world’s conventional species of fishwere  according to the same agency  fully exploited overexploited or depleted  or are in the process ofrebuilding as a result of depletion in the early 1990s.Clearly  the ability to satisfy global demand for food fromthe sea in the coming years will depend to no small extenton the adoption of responsible fisheries conservation andmanagement policies. We should at all times view theecosystem of the oceans as a whole and harvest all speciesof this vast but delicate resource in a sustainable manner.Looked at in this light  the results of the UnitedNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks  while by no means the final wordon this matter  acquire major significance. Let me point outthat the law of the sea has been the sphere in which Icelandhas been most engaged  beginning in 1949  when  upon aproposal by Iceland  the International Law Commission wasgiven the task of studying all aspects of the law of the sea.Iceland will continue to be active in the implementation ofthe Convention on the Law of the Sea.We live in an era of growing demand on diminishingnatural resources. It is therefore to be welcomed thatinternational cooperation is now gradually extending to theArctic region  breaking at last through the barrier of whatthe Icelandic- American explorer Vilhjálmur Stefánssononce referred to as“the ancient inherited opinions about the terrors of theFrozen North”  a “lifeless waste of eternal silence”.The resources of the Arctic are enormous. The nations ofthe region should develop its potential and work together inthe economic  environmental and cultural fields. Therefore my Government attaches the highest importance to theconsultations that have taken place among the Governmentsof the eight Arctic States to establish the Arctic Council.We have had intensive discussions on changes in theSecurity Council  including on whether to increase itsmembership. Iceland is of the view that the fundamentalobjective of an enlargement of the Council should be tostrengthen its capacity to discharge the duties assigned to it.We believe that there should be an increase in the numberof both permanent and non-permanent members. In thiscontext  I would like to express my Government’s supportfor the permanent membership of Germany and Japan inthe Security Council.Reform  however  will avail us little if we fail tocome to grips with the serious financial situation of theUnited Nations. Here  I fully share the deep concerns thatthe Secretary-General has expressed in his comprehensivereport on the state of the Organization. According to theirobligations under the Charter  the Member States shouldpay their contributions to the regular budget in full  ontime and without condition. If all Member States do notlive up to their obligations  we will be forced to take theinevitable political decision to scale back the activities ofthe Organization. At a time when the services of theUnited Nations are in greater demand and when theOrganization has a better chance of success than everbefore  such a step would be highly unfortunate. Instead let us put the fiftieth anniversary to good use and makethe earnest pledge to put the Organization on a soundfinancial footing."
"78",3438,"ISR",50,1995,"I should like to congratulate Mr.Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. We are glad that a representative ofPortugal  a nation for which Israel has high regard  waselected to that distinguished post.I would like to express to the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a man of our region and a man ofpeace  our deepest appreciation for his contribution to worldpeace in general and to the Middle East peace in particular.Tomorrow  the Jewish people will pray on the day ofYom Ha-Kippurim:(spoke in Hebrew; English text furnished by the delegation)“In the Book of Life: blessings  peace  a goodlivelihood  good decrees  salvation and consolation.May you be remembered and inscribed.”(spoke in English)We pray for all humanity  for the whole world.For us  the United Nations is not just a place of prayerand surely not a platform for speeches. We come here tostate our convictions and to announce our commitments. Inour address in 1987  I stated on behalf of the State ofIsrael:“We have found President Mubarak of Egypt tobe a builder of a better life for his people and ofbridges for a comprehensive peace in the region.”(Official Records of the General Assembly  Forty-second Session  Plenary Meetings  17th meeting p. 23-25)Today  under the leadership of President Mubarak Egypt is becoming a centre for regional development on theway to hosting the first regional bank of development.In the same address  we stated:“An international conference is the door to directnegotiations. Once convened it should leadimmediately to face-to-face bilateral negotiations.”(Ibid.  p. 26)On 30 October  1991  the Madrid Conference took place.In 1992  again we declared:“The opportunity to select  through democraticpolitical elections  the Palestinian administrativecouncil will enable the Palestinian people to exercisea double measure of freedom: the freedom to governtheir own lives and to do so ... democratically.”(Ibid.  Forty-seventh Session  Plenary Meetings 20th meeting  p. 48)Last week  we achieved what we promised.Lastly  in 1993  we declared again from this rostrum:“Geographically speaking  we live side by sidewith the Jordanian Kingdom  and what is so obviousgeographically must become clear politically [sothat] we can offer the people of both sides of theriver full peace  that the Dead Sea can become aspring of new life.” (Ibid.  Forty-eighth Session Plenary Meetings  6th meeting  p. 22)In October 1994  just one year later  Jordan and Israelsigned a peace treaty.Last year  we said here:“All countries of the Middle East face a choice:to remain politically divided and economicallystagnant or to become economically advanced andpolitically just.“... We shall try to establish instruments fordevelopment: a regional bank  channels for privateinvestment and a framework for regional planning.”(Ibid.  Forty-ninth Session  Plenary Meetings 10th meeting  p. 16)In October 1994  the first Middle East-North Africaneconomic summit was held in Casablanca under thesplendid presidency of His Majesty King Hassan II. Atthe end of this month  a second summit will be held inAmman under the auspices of His Majesty King Hussein.At the end of November  the first ground-breaking Euro-Mediterranean conference will be held in Barcelona.Three years  five promises: all of them fulfilled. Iwould like to use this occasion to turn to the Syrians andto turn to the Lebanese and ask them to stop hesitating to stop wandering. They have to look at this record andcome in and follow up. The President of Syria has saidthat from experience he has learned that only throughmilitary negotiations and making security the majoragenda item can one achieve peace. Sorry: Experience has4shown that through negotiation on all levels  embracing allissues without timidity  without fatigue  we can achievepeace. If leaders meet and are not successful at the firstmeeting  they will have another meeting. How can it bewrong for them to work day and night  ceaselessly  withnew ideas and new approaches? They are not wasting theleaders’ time; they are wasting the time of the people —their fortunes  their happiness  opportunities for the youngergeneration.We also tell all the countries of the Middle East  notthat we want to have a new Middle East  but that we wantthe Middle East to join in a new age — for the good oftheir people  not for the good of Israel. Israel is in goodshape because we are no longer living in a world wherethere are empires of power and colonies of poverty. Povertyand oppression are home-made  not imposed by others. Thechoice is before every country to become free andprosperous and democratic  like so many nations have donein a relatively short time in Asia  Latin America and insome countries of Africa. It is their choice  theiropportunity not just to build a different world but tointroduce the new world to their own people.For us  the United States is not an empire of power.We are not afraid of the United States. For us  the UnitedStates is an empire of peace. We need the United States.For us  Russia is going through a process of change. Russiawill remain great but will become something different. Forus  we welcome the European contribution to othercountries east and south of them and the convening of theBarcelona conference to offer the Mediterranean peoplesfunds and experience to build a new life. We are glad thatJapan is expanding its economic horizons and understandingand contributing so that other nations can do so. And wehope that other well-to-do countries in the Middle East including Arab countries  will help the needy parts of ourown region.May I say that in my best judgement the greatestdanger is a combination of high technology and deephatred  of modern instruments and feudalistic views  andthe greatest hope for all of us is a double effort to respecthuman values and modern education.Israel itself is in good shape. We are strong militarily:I do not deny it. We have an excellent economy — aneconomy of brains  not of material resources. We haveabsorbed a very large immigration of white and black Jews white Jews from Russia and black Jews from Ethiopia  andnobody can understand what put Israel in such a relativelygood position.What brought this about is  first of all  the return tothe moral choice. By the end of this year — at the latestat the beginning of next year — not one Palestinian willremain under our control. For the first time in the historyof the Palestinian people  they are educating their childrenwithout intervention by us or anybody else. Nobodyforces us to do so. We are not weak. We are not poor.We are not under pressure. We have had to take seriousrisks because terror still continues. The Arab boycott isstill intact.In our own country there is strong opposition towhat we are doing. We have had to spend a great part ofour budget to make peace — and yet  despite all this  wedecided to make a moral choice: not to dominate anotherpeople. We stated in this Assembly that that was ourintention. Now we have done it and even politically  asdifficult as it may be at home — because  as a party  wemay win historically but we may also lose politically —but then  winning peace is in our eyes more importantthan winning elections. Why should you be elected if youdo not use the mandate of the people to change the courseof your history in a reasoned  moral way?We believe that the strength of ethical judgement isas important as military exercises or triumphs. We gaveup land and produced instead an economy of brains.Today Israel is making out of its brains more than someother countries in our vicinity are making out of oil.And what we actually expect from the Palestiniansis for them to become democratic  to be prosperous  tofight violence and terror  and we are giving ourneighbours a simple message: What we can do everybody can do.For many years there was a legend that only theNorth  which is white and wealthy and permanent  is asuccess story  whereas the South is condemned tobackwardness  to poverty  to lagging behind. What hashappened in Asia  where the most vibrant economicendeavours are taking place today  and what is happeningin Latin America show that the economy has nothing todo with geographical location or the colour of the skin.Make the right choice: serve your people and create anew future.What we are offering to anyone who is interested isour experience — open  in a comradely way. We do notwant to dominate anybody and certainly not anybody’seconomy. We did not give up the domination of peopleto gain domination of markets. And we are suggesting to5our neighbours — and we are happy that they haveaccepted — is that the new frontiers — say  betweenJordan and Israel — will not be frontiers of mines andhostile fences  but an occasion for joint ventures.The whole rift of Africa  the whole valley which is adesert that separates the Jordanians and us will become with God’s help  a source for work  for development. Wewill build hotels and schools and desalination plants andparks  and people will be free to move from one side to theother  competing without hating  cooperating withoutdominating.We want to do the same about the dividing linebetween us and the Palestinians: we want to build alongsidethe line on the West Bank and Gaza eight industrial parksso that the Palestinians will not have to cross the borderand go through Israel’s checkpoints: instead  work willcome to them  and together we shall invest and together weshall develop.A better economy is the best guarantee of peace.Actually  there cannot be economic cooperation withoutpolitical understanding. Recently  while we were negotiatingwe created three zones of security sensibility on the WestBank — zone A  zone B and zone C. Then we turned towater and electricity and we asked the water and thecurrent to submit to our political wisdom  but the electricityand the water people said that they did not distinguishbetween A  B and C. Water flows according to nature andnot according to artificial agreements  and electric currentdoes not stop at A or B or C. They serve everybody.Today in the Middle East as elsewhere  the distinctionis no longer ideological or religious or national. There isjust one distinction between an old  poor  backwardeconomy and a new age where economies are based ontechnology and science and where the natural resource isschools for the children and not the mines of the Gulf.Everybody can postpone the choice but nobody can escapeit.Our aim is to have peace so as to serve our people; tohave education so as to equip our children to takeadvantage of the new age  to be equal to others and tocompete with other children. It cannot remain a peacebetween leaders: it must become a peace for the people now and in the future.I started by showing what has happened in three orfour short years. It is a revolution. It is a beginning. Weshould not stop in the middle. Let everybody pray to theLord in the language he is used to. Let everybody respecthis own tradition  his own heritage. Let everybody respectthe special experience of a people  of a nation. But let allof us give up unnecessary hatred  untold suspicion. Let usgive up barricading ourselves behind old dogmas andterrible prejudices. Let us help the people and the future.Then the 50 years of the United Nations will offer notjust 50 years without war but the coming 50 years withpeace and prosperity."
"79",3485,"ITA",50,1995,"Mr President  let mecongratulate you and your country  Portugal  on yourelection as President of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. At the same time  I wish to thank yourdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy.Italy fully supports the statement made by theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Spain in his capacity asChairman of the European Union  and wishes to add thefollowing considerations.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is anopportunity for us to reflect on the Organization’s pastachievements and future role. The fundamental challengeof the United Nations has always been the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  to which Italy hascontributed by participating in several peace-keepingoperations  in which some of our young men have losttheir lives. Our experience has convinced us that theUnited Nations should expand its role in the areas ofpreventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peace building.The activity that has provoked more controversy in recentyears  peace enforcement  must take place under themandate of the Security Council  but the Council candelegate such operations to coalitions of States or regionalarrangements  thereby drawing on their valuable militaryexpertise  particularly in matters of command and control and preventing an overextension of United Nationsresources.The responsibility for peace-keeping operations mustbe shared by the international community as a whole  andthus they should be financed through assessed rather thanvoluntary contributions  to be calculated on the basis ofconsensus  and in accordance with internationalcommitments.In the former Yugoslavia  we have welcomed andconstantly supported the diplomatic initiative undertakenby the United States Government and we sincerely hopethat it marks the turning-point in the crisis.The renewal of diplomatic action has thus far scoredmajor achievements: the Geneva agreement of 8September on basic principles for a settlement in Bosnia the Framework for a Cessation of Hostilities within theSarajevo Exclusion Zone signed by the Bosnian Serbs inBelgrade on 14 September  and the joint statement issuedon 26 September. For the first time in three years  thereseem to be real prospects for a viable and stable peace inBosnia and we cannot afford to miss this opportunity. It24is essential that Europe  the United States and Russia worktogether to overcome the remaining difficulties in the wayof a general cease-fire and a peace agreement. We callupon all the parties concerned to come to the negotiatingtable  to show good faith and to resist the temptations toresort to military action to gain political advantages.We should also prepare well in advance for thereconstruction and rehabilitation of the former Yugoslaviaby crafting an approach that would reaffirm respect forhuman rights and the rights of minorities and foster civiland cultural coexistence  development and welfarethroughout the area.In the Middle East and the Mediterranean  Italyapplauds the determination and courage of Prime MinisterRabin  Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat inreaching yesterday’s agreement on the second stage ofself-government. Every effort should be made to implementit  starting with the holding of democratic elections in thePalestinian territories as soon as possible. Italy willcontinue its commitment to provide economic support to thePalestinian people.Other situations in the Middle East give rise instead totension and instability. We must contribute ideas andinitiatives to efforts aimed at defusing these tensions andencouraging dialogue between opposing forces  except thosewhose programme and policy are violence. At the sametime  Italy expects those countries trapped in self-inflictedisolation to engage in a constructive dialogue with theinternational community.It is of the utmost urgency that an internationalconference be convened in the Great Lakes region of Africaunder the sponsorship of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity  with the goal of fosteringthe process of national reconciliation and allowing a rapidrepatriation of the millions of refugees still living in camps.But there have also been positive developments inAfrica  such as the historic events of 1994 in South Africa the reconstruction currently under way in Mozambique  theagreements that brought an end to the bloody conflict inAngola  and the political and constitutional developments inEthiopia. My country’s commitment did not stop at theparticipation of its military personnel in Mozambique. Wealso responded positively to the Secretary-General’s requestfor military advisers to train de-mining personnel inAngola.Latin America has made significant progress in thereaffirmation of democratic laws and respect for humanrights. Italy supports the peace process in Guatemala andhas sent a contingent to the United Nations human-rightsmonitoring Mission there  as it did to the peace-keepingoperation in El Salvador.The Asian continent is teaching all of us a lesson inrealism  hard work and investment in human resources. Itsgrowing force and economic success have brought it tothe forefront of the community of nations.Italy will actively participate in the new WorkingGroup for the reform of the United Nations  payingspecial attention to the economic and social sectors  whichneed improvement and streamlining. While proceedingwith determination  we must avoid hasty decisions inareas where caution and diligence should be the rule. Wemust keep our sights on results and effectiveness ratherthan on symbolic and artificially-imposed deadlines. Thisis true not only for the economic and social sectors  butalso for the reform of the Security Council  which isalready the subject of a detailed Italian proposal inspiredby the principles of democracy  equitable geographicalrepresentation and efficiency. It aims at reconciling theaspirations and interests of the greatest possible numberof countries. Our goal is a Security Council with morenon-permanent members that is able to express thefeelings and political will of the international communityas a whole. Only a Council that is truly representative ofthe entire United Nations membership and closely linkedto the General Assembly can make this goal a reality.However  if the financial crisis of the United Nationsis not solved  budgetary problems could derail any reformproposals and send the entire system down the road tobankruptcy. The Secretary-General has repeatedly madethis point  as has the President of the Council of theEuropean Union. In the review of the scale ofassessments  Italy hopes that the Member States willapprove much-needed reforms  confirming beyond ashadow of a doubt their will fully and promptly to honourtheir financial obligations.In some sectors of weapons of mass destruction important limitations have been agreed on andimplemented. As we recently learned  biological weapons among the most horrifying arms known to man  are stillin our midst. It is our wish that the prohibition ofbiological weapons be backed up by an effective systemof verification.25As for nuclear weapons  the indefinite extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons pavesthe way for new goals in the field of disarmament. Theprimary goal is the conclusion of a comprehensive test-bantreaty by 1996. It is imperative that we achieve an outrightban on all nuclear testing  and my country will do its partto see that this becomes a reality.The Agenda for Development should be finalized bythe end of the current session. The Agenda must reflect theconclusions and commitments made in the series of worldconferences on the major social issues of our time  whichwill conclude with the World Conference on Food beinghosted by Italy in the fall of 1996.The growth of the economy and of employment isfundamental to international political stability in an era ofinterdependence. An effective form of coordinationbetween the United Nations system and the financialinstitutions of Bretton Woods should be devised.Multilateral trade and the free flow of investments couldenhance the spread of equitable and sustainabledevelopment. With regard to the persistent problem of thedebt of developing countries  Italy ranks second amongcreditor countries in its reduction of the external debt ofcountries with grave economic difficulties.The Italian Government is pleased with the work ofthe Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of anInternational Criminal Court and with the draft statute ofthe court prepared by the International Law Commission.Significantly  this draft explicitly does not include thedeath penalty among the sentences that can be handeddown  in line with a position that Italy defended in thissame Hall. My country hopes that the debate in the SixthCommittee will set the basis for convening a diplomaticconference in 1996 or 1997  which Italy has offered tohost  to adopt the statute of the court.The Italian Government believes that the UnitedNations should step up its efforts  as should itsspecialized agencies and international financialinstitutions  to channel more resources towardshuman-centred activity. Democracy and respect for humanrights must become the hallmark of our efforts to build abetter future for our children."
"80",3531,"JAM",50,1995,"On behalf of the Governmentand the people of Jamaica  I congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral on his election to the presidency of the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. As a distinguishedrepresentative of Portugal  we are assured that he will beable to bring his undoubted skills to the affairs of this bodyat this important juncture in the life of the United Nations.Allow me also to express my appreciation to hisdistinguished predecessor  Foreign Minister Amara Essy ofCôte d’Ivoire  for his very valuable contribution to the workof the forty-ninth session.I also wish to take this opportunity to extend awelcome to the Republic of Palau  which was admitted tothe United Nations on 15 December 1994.Let me  on behalf of the Government and the peopleof Jamaica  express our sympathy to the peoples of oursister countries in the Caribbean who recently experiencedthe ravages of devastating hurricanes. Most of these smallislands suffered extensive damage to infrastructure and totheir agriculture and tourism industries. Their task ofreconstruction will require immediate assistance andsupport from the international community. I appeal to allgathered here to provide the required support to theseCaribbean partners.Our general debate this year coincides with thecelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. This historic occasion affords us the opportunityto reflect on the work and value of the Organization andto chart the way forward into the twenty-first century.The establishment of the United Nations 50 yearsago irrevocably changed the course of world history. Withits founding  a new framework for international relationswas created. Throughout the last five decades  the worldbody  buffeted as it has been by the vagaries of anunpredictable and often tense international environment has achieved remarkable successes in a wide variety offields  and in many ways and for many millions of peoplearound the world it remains the greatest repository ofhope  and the only viable option for ensuring internationalpeace  security and development.Today we still inhabit an imperfect world wherepoverty  social and economic inequality between andwithin States  hunger  disease and environmentaldegradation remain critical issues. Global solutions must befound to what are inevitably global problems. At last we allnow agree that the major problems confronting our worldare transnational in nature.Addressing these challenges is a daunting task.However  whereas less than a decade ago the cold-warideological divide hindered our ability to address them today we are in a much more favourable position to do so.Today there is greater willingness and capacity to makecommon cause on a number of issues.The priority task of our time is to eliminate thefundamental causes of instability and conflict in the globalcommunity  a situation rooted in the social and economicconditions affecting the greater part of mankind. As wemove into the next century  our commitment to achievingdevelopment in all its aspects must be our priorityobjective. In this regard  Jamaica continues to attach greatimportance to the work of the United Nations in advancingthe Agenda for Development. We believe it provides therudiments for constructing a sustained developmentstrategy. It is our hope that this historic session of theGeneral Assembly will recognize the importance of theAgenda and give the mandate for its implementation.The Secretary-General has outlined five dimensionswhich provide the foundation for action to achievesustainable development. These are: peace  the economy environmental protection  social justice and democracy.It is important that we accept these concepts asmutually reinforcing and interdependent. Development isnot possible in the absence of peace and stability.Conversely  the absence of broad-based development andthe lack of opportunity to participate in the benefits ofmaterial progress constitute a threat to peace and stability.Economic growth is necessary for development. As theSecretary-General points out in his report “New development approaches should not onlygenerate economic growth  they should make itsbenefits equitably available. They should enablepeople to participate in decisions affecting their lives.”(A/49/665  para. 5)For sustainable development to be maintained it mustbe people-oriented in its objective  scope and focus. Itneeds an environment that gives priority to the promotionof social well-being  integration and advancement; anenvironment where there is emphasis on the eradication ofpoverty  on the enhancement of health and education andon productive employment for all.That is why it is vital that we honour thecommitments agreed at major international conferencesand integrate them into a common framework fordevelopment. The declarations and work programmes ofconferences  beginning with the World Summit forChildren in 1990  up to and including the recent FourthWorld Conference on Women  provide the basis forforging a global consensus on new approaches to socialand economic development. The United NationsConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II)  to be heldnext year  will further add to the global consensus.It is in this context that I refer specifically to theWorld Summit for Social Development  one of the twomajor global conferences held this year. That Summitprovided a forum for discussion and commitment toaction on issues of poverty  unemployment and socialdisintegration. In Copenhagen world leaders recognizedthe central and pervasive theme of poverty and itsimpediment to social integration. The CopenhagenDeclaration and Programme of Action contain universalcommitments: a commitment to create a national andinternational environment conducive to the eradication ofpoverty; a commitment to enhance productiveemployment; a commitment to promote socialdevelopment and foster social integration. All theseactions would be taken in a framework of sustainableeconomic growth and development.Not only does the Declaration and Programme ofAction contain commitments to accelerate economic social and human resource development: it alsospecifically sets targets for addressing the seeminglyintractable problems facing developing countries. Thecritical issue is one of resources. It is a dauntingchallenge.As part of national policy and consistent with thecontent of the Declaration and Programme of Action Jamaica has already committed itself to the alleviation ofpoverty as a matter of priority.Permit me to refer to the other important conferenceheld this year  the Fourth World Conference on Women which was recently concluded in Beijing. Out of thatConference emanated a comprehensive Platform forAction aimed at fostering greater empowerment of womenand bringing them fully into the development process.2We recognize that Governments have the mainresponsibility for undertaking the commitments agreed atthese conferences. However  to achieve these goals nationalefforts must be complemented by effective internationalcooperation. We therefore join others in urging theinternational community to collectively fulfil thecommitments by channelling substantial new and additionalfinancial and technical resources to developing countries. Itis this mobilization of adequate financial resources fordevelopment purposes that will determine whether thepoorest countries in the world remain excluded from theprogress enjoyed by others.The positive trends in world economic growth cannotmask the dichotomy which persists in the internationaleconomy. The efforts by developing countries to implementsound macroeconomic policies and structural adjustmentprogrammes continue to be affected by adverse externaleconomic conditions characterized by protectionism ingoods-and-service trade  continuing decline in officialdevelopment assistance (ODA)  volatile financial flows andexchange-rate instability  and constraints in access totechnology.All this is convincing evidence that in the increasinglyglobalized environment it is imperative that we give greaterweight to the whole process of coordination of internationaleconomic policy. Institutions such as the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should furtherimprove their processes to take into account the criticalneeds and peculiar circumstances of developing countries.This process could be improved further through betterconsultations between the Group of 77  the Group of 15and the Group of 7.Many developing countries have at great costundertaken reforms in policy and regulatory frameworkresulting in the creation of a private-sector-led  market-driven economy. These efforts will be rendered meaninglesswithout the existence of a favourable international economicenvironment. In its absence  efforts to build self-sustainingeconomies will be frustrated.With the completion of the Uruguay Round and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) thestage is set for a more open multilateral trading system. Inconfronting this new and complex trade regime developingcountries require production and marketing assistance togain the potential benefits from the new marketopportunities.It is therefore crucial that a degree of flexibility begiven to developing countries to enhance our fullparticipation in the multilateral trading system.Recent developments and institutional changes including the establishment of the World TradeOrganization  reinforce the need for institutions such asthe United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment as a policy-oriented trade forum with astrong development perspective. We should not fail toreflect on the valuable role that has been played byUNCTAD  as well as by the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization. Every effort should be madeto preserve those organizations. They were designed toserve the development objectives of the developingcountries. They are not above change. They have showntheir capacity to adapt to the new environment and todevelop concepts and programmes relevant to the presentneeds of the developing countries. We are thereforeopposed to any attempt to undermine the contributions ofthose bodies to the development objectives within theinternational system.In our own region steps are being taken to improvethe conditions that will foster proper trading relationsamong our countries  thereby enhancing the productivityof our economies. The Convention establishing theAssociation of Caribbean States has now entered intoforce. The new grouping of 25 States plus associatemembers represents a strong and viable economic basefrom which to seize the opportunities offered by the newinternational economic environment.In this regard we continue to assert the need for theinclusion of all countries in the region in the integrationprocess. To this end  we reiterate our concern at attemptsfurther to complicate regional-trading arrangementsthrough national legislation that has an overwhelmingextra-territorial character.If I have devoted a substantial portion of mystatement to issues of development and internationaleconomic and trade policy  it is because Jamaica wouldlike to emphasize the fundamental importance ofeconomic and social development to the attainment ofpeace and security. We welcome the fact that theSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development has rightlybeen acknowledged as an essential complement to “AnAgenda for Peace”. We remain committed to a continuingrole for the United Nations in the area of peace-keeping.3The current regional and civil conflicts being wagedagainst the backdrop of ethnic and religious antagonismdemand that greater emphasis be placed on preventivediplomacy in order to diffuse tensions before they escalateinto the violence and bloodshed that we have witnessed inthe Balkans and in Central Africa. We must designmechanisms to deal with problems in their early stages andthus prevent the situation whereby the internationalcommunity finds itself expending more and more resourcesto deal with an ever-worsening situation. In this regard urgent action to achieve a rapid-deployment capabilityshould be considered.In Bosnia and Herzegovina the world has been witnessto the tragedy of the forcible dismantling of a multi-ethnicand multireligious society. The situation has been a difficultone for the United Nations. It is vital that all efforts bemade to bring an end to the fighting  and we hope that themost recent attempts to reach a negotiated settlement willlead to a lasting and comprehensive solution. I wish at thispoint to express on behalf of the Government of Jamaicaour profound regret at the almost- daily loss of life. Oursympathies go to the families of United Nations peace-keepers as well as to the families of the three Americandiplomats who were engaged in brokering a settlement tothe conflict.We are no less concerned and distressed by thesituation in Rwanda and Burundi. We continue to urge thefactions to pursue national reconciliation leading towardsthe economic rehabilitation and reconstruction of theircountries.In our own region  we can be justifiably proud of therole of the United Nations in restoring the democraticallyelected President of Haiti  Jean-Bertrand Aristide  to theleadership of his nation. This was a critical element in thecomplex diplomatic effort to achieve a solution to the crisisin our sister country. Jamaica joined other countries in theCaribbean Community in contributing to the multinationalforce in Haiti and subsequently to the United NationsMission in Haiti. The people of Haiti are now on the pathto building democracy. Haiti’s success in its efforts torebuild the economy of the country depends in no smallmeasure on the continued attention of the entireinternational community.The success of the United Nations in Haiti leads us toreflect on the often-overlooked achievements of theOrganization in providing much-needed humanitarianassistance in situations of conflict.There are a number of outstanding political issues onthe Assembly’s agenda that require resolution  amongthem the situation in the Middle East. We welcome theefforts of the parties to continue the peace process in aspirit of reconciliation in order to achieve acomprehensive  just and lasting peace. We hope that thesame spirit of reconciliation will prevail in negotiations toresolve other long-outstanding issues  including that of thesituation in Cyprus.I wish to refer to a matter which we consider one ofglobal concern. Four months ago  the Review andExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) concludedwith a majority of States agreeing that the Treaty shouldbe extended indefinitely. Like other non-nuclear-weaponStates  we supported the indefinite extension on the basisof the declared intention of nuclear Powers to exerciserestraint in relation to vertical proliferation and nucleardisarmament. In this sense  we view with greatdisappointment and as a serious blow to the non-proliferation regime the recent decisions by some nuclear-weapon States to resume nuclear testing. Jamaica isopposed to the proliferation of weapons and wishes toreiterate the need for the completion of a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty. In the meantime  we urge nuclear-weapon States to respect the moratorium on nucleartesting.The progressive development of international lawhas been a fundamental objective of the United Nations.The entry into force of the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea and the inauguration of theInternational Seabed Authority in Kingston  Jamaica  inNovember last year  represent a major achievement in thecreation of a legal order for the management of the seasand oceans as the common heritage of mankind. We urgeuniversal acceptance of the Convention. Jamaica being thehost of the Seabed Authority  I can assure the Assemblyof its steadfast commitment to provide the enablingenvironment to ensure that the objectives of theConvention are met.The establishment of the International SeabedAuthority represents the commitment of States parties tohave this new international regime operational in theshortest possible time. We are all very disappointed thatthe first session was concluded without the requisiteadministrative arrangements in place for commencementof the substantive work of the Authority. I take thisimportant occasion to urge that States parties address the4outstanding issues with the same commitment that wasevident in securing the acceptance of the Convention.We believe the United Nations is now positioned toachieve the objectives of the Charter and to play an active dynamic and catalytic role in maintaining internationalpeace and security and promoting economic cooperation.Now  more than ever before  there is a real possibility forus to take decisive and universal action to fulfil thepurposes for which the Organization was created. We musttake advantage of this opportunity. We are conscious ofheightened expectations. For these reasons  the restructuringand revitalization of the United Nations system must bevigorously pursued. We are confident that a reformed andstrengthened Organization will be able to undertake thetwin tasks of promoting peace and assisting thedevelopment process of all members of the internationalcommunity.In the Secretary-General’s annual report to the GeneralAssembly this year  he has emphasized  in the context ofreforming the United Nations  that“A crucial component of that larger reformprocess should be the achievement of a more dynamicrelationship among the main intergovernmentalorgans — the General Assembly  the Security Counciland the Economic and Social Council.” (A/50/1  para.20)This is a point of view which I share. Jamaica firmlybelieves that the General Assembly should be allowed tofulfil its role as the Organization’s highest deliberative anddecision-making body. We also believe that the role of theEconomic and Social Council should be strengthened.It is relevant also to underscore the fact that theUnited Nations was conceived in an entirely different era.Today  with all the changes which have taken place in thepast 50 years  it is indefensible that the same fivepermanent members of the Security Council can exercisethe same control as they did when they assumed that rightafter the Second World War. For this and other validreasons  Jamaica supports the call for the expansion of theSecurity Council  including its permanent membership  onan equitable geographical basis.Numerous initiatives have been undertaken by MemberStates  independent groups and individuals on ways toimprove the functioning of the Organization. It is now timefor the seminal ideas generated by these initiatives to bedistilled into a comprehensive framework for designing thenew structure of the United Nations. In this regard Jamaica will participate fully in the High-level Open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly  recentlyestablished to undertake a thorough review of the studiesand reports relating to the revitalization and reform of theUnited Nations.The agenda for this fiftieth session is indeed achallenging one. Our goal is to ensure that theOrganization is well placed to discharge itsresponsibilities effectively. There is enough evidence ofa disposition to do this  and this gives us hope. Ascustodians of the future  let us therefore strive to makethis a more peaceful  just and prosperous world."
"81",3577,"JOR",50,1995,"It gives me great pleasure to begin my statement bycongratulating you  Sir  and on the Government and peopleof your country  Portugal  on your election as President ofthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly  whichcoincides with the Golden Jubilee of the United Nations. Iam confident that  with your skill and expertise indiplomacy and international affairs  you will be able tosteer the deliberations of this session most efficiently andcompetently.I should like also to extend deep appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  Foreign Minister of Côted’Ivoire  for successfully conducting the affairs of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.Allow me also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his sincere incessant and dedicated efforts in the service of theinternational community through this Organization.Over the past few years  the world order has witnessedradical changes in its structure that have entaileddevelopments some of which have been positive whileothers have been negative. On the positive side  wide-ranging developments have been seen in many States withregard to the emergence of democracy  political plurality respect for human rights and basic freedoms. Suchdevelopments have been accompanied by a naturalyearning for the achievement of development in both itseconomic and social domains  while developments on thenegative side have generated a wider cycle of racial national and religious disputes in some regions of theworld that have led to a noticeable retreat from respectfor human rights and basic freedoms of the humanindividual  as well as regression of development both inthe economic and social spheres. The primary task of thisOrganization at this point in time is  perhaps  to focus onstrengthening the first tendency and to limit  as much aspossible  the second.In the face of such a challenge  the task of reformingthe United Nations should be met with a view tostrengthening its role  making it more effective andachieving a qualitative transformation of the work of itsorgans. The Security Council stands in need ofrestructuring with a view to increasing its membership insuch a way as to reflect balanced representation ofdeveloped and developing countries. The presentcomposition of the Council  as it took shape in the wakeof World War II  no longer reflects the present balance ofpower in its broader sense. Any expansion of thepermanent membership of the Council should take intoaccount the inclusion of countries from the developingworld which have significant political  economic anddemographic weight.On the other hand  the veto prerogative of the fivepermanent Member States should be reviewed and certainCouncil mechanisms must be substantively reformed as inthe case of the mechanism relating to economic sanctions.Reform of that mechanism should ensure: firstly  limitingas much as possible the impact of sanctions on thecivilian population of the country on which the sanctionsare imposed  and secondly  compensating third States thatare affected by the sanctions in proportion to the damagesustained by them.It is also necessary to achieve the universality of theUnited Nations in conformity with Article 4  paragraph 1 of the Charter  which stipulates that membership in theUnited Nations is open to all peace-loving nations whichaccept the obligations contained in the Charter.Membership should not be denied on the basis of anypolitical or other considerations.Peace-keeping operations have become the corner-stone of the overall work and activities of the UnitedNations. While my country  Jordan  prides itself on itswide-ranging participation in the operations  it deems it9necessary to continue the process of comprehensivelyreviewing peace-keeping operations in the light of thewidening scope and number of such operations  as well asthe diverse nature of the tasks undertaken by the peace-keepers and the dangers they are exposed to.At the same time  we emphasize the need tostrengthen the efforts made to consolidate the foundationsand bases of preventive diplomacy which aims to avert thebreak-out or escalation of conflicts  in addition todeveloping the machinery for post-conflict peacemaking andpeace-building.As for the financial crisis which has impacted onpeace-keeping operations  that crisis not only affects properimplementation and the level of performance  but affectsalso the participation of many developing countries in thoseoperations. Those countries have now become reluctant toparticipate because they have not been reimbursed on time.If such a situation persists  it may impact adversely on thedesired comprehensive international character of thestructure of peace-keeping troops and lead to the exclusionof developing countries therefrom  thus restrictingparticipation to the developed countries that are financiallyable to bear the cost of their participation.The only solution to this problem is for all countriesto meet their financial obligations on time  particularlythose countries that contribute the bulk of the UnitedNations budget. Jordan has supported the establishment ofa special fund to help start new operations wheneverneeded. Part of the capital of this fund should be earmarkedfor the reimbursement of the developing countries thatparticipate in such operations. In this regard  we feel thatamendments need to be made to the reimbursementmechanism  so that the developing countries contributingtroops to peace-keeping operations may be reimbursed ona priority basis.The end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued theworld during the cold war and the disappearance of theideological demarcation line that divided the world into twocamps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunityafforded us by the current transitional period to lay downnew foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrowthe economic gap between them. The first step in thatdirection may well be to find substantive and meaningfulsolutions to the problem of the accumulated debts of thedeveloping countries.While my country welcomed the establishment of theWorld Trade Organization and has applied for membership we call for an in-depth study of the foundations andcontrols upon which freedom of trade is built. We alsocall for a review of the strategies of economicdevelopment at the international level  with a view toimproving them in conformity with the principles ofsustainable development and to achieve the cherished goalof environmental conservation.While world peace and stability are among the mostimportant prerequisites for economic development and ofthe social development it entails  the development cycle however  will not be complete without consolidating theunderpinnings of democracy and social justice which leadto further development and thereby promote peace andstability.Proceeding from His Majesty King Hussein’s beliefin the close relationship between peace  democracy anddevelopment  Jordan’s earnest participation in the peaceprocess went hand in hand with the strengthening ofdemocracy and the consolidation of political plurality inJordan. As is known  the peace process which started inMadrid four years ago has resulted  inter alia  in theconclusion of the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty  whichrestored to Jordan all its territorial and water rights andlaid the foundation for a balanced relationship based onmutual and equal interests between Israel and Jordan.This  of course  reflects positively on the peace  stabilityand welfare of the peoples of the region.Efforts are now under way to bring about a hugequalitative jump in regional economic development in theMiddle East. The States of the region are showing greatinterest in the Amman Economic Summit  which isscheduled to be held at the end of this month  October1995  within the framework of regional cooperation  as aproduct of the multilateral track of the peace process.Jordan looks forward with optimism to theforthcoming Barcelona Conference with the aim ofestablishing a partnership that joins together theMediterranean States. This would contribute to theconsolidation of the comprehensive peace process in theMiddle East. In this respect  I should like to express deepgratitude and appreciation for the role played by Europe Japan and other States involved in the multilateral trackof the peace process which  together with the UnitedStates of America  support the development efforts inJordan and of peace-building in the region.Jordan’s participation in the multilateral track of thepeace process stems from its conviction that it is10necessary to find effective solutions to the problems thathave accumulated over the many years of the Arab-Israeliconflict. Foremost among those problems is the question ofrefugees. In this regard  we commend the outstanding roleplayed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency forPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  stress theimportance of that role and of the essential services theAgency provides for the refugees. Accordingly  my country as host to the largest number of refugees  feels that it isnecessary for UNRWA’s work to continue and indeed forthe services it provides to be expanded. This  in turn necessitates the strengthening of UNRWA’s budget  until afinal solution to the refugee problem is reached throughreturn and compensation  as provided for in the UnitedNations resolutions and principles of international law.Therefore  while we acknowledge the donor States’contributions  we call upon them  from this rostrum  tocontinue to contribute to UNRWA’s budget  so that thisnoble goal may be achieved.On the other hand  my country supports all efforts toadvance the negotiations on other bilateral tracks in orderto realize the principle of “the return of land for peace” onthe basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1978)  which constitute the essential termsof reference for the peace process.On this occasion  I should like to commend the veryimportant development on the Palestinian-Israeli track withthe conclusion of the Taba Agreement on the expansion ofself-government in the West Bank and the subsequentsigning of that agreement in Washington  D.C.  on 28September 1995.I should like also to take this opportunity to expressJordan’s full support for the Palestinian National Authorityin its sincere efforts to achieve the goals of a just anddurable peace in the region. We believe that those effortswill lead to the establishment of the independent State ofPalestine  with the holy city of Al-Quds as its capital  inrealization of the hopes and aspirations of the brotherlyPalestinian people.My delegation did not spare any effort during the 1995Review and Extension Conference of the States Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) in order for the Conference to produce positiveresults that would buttress this treaty which is a majorcornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and may bring about its universality by the accessionthereto of all States  including Israel  and the placement ofits nuclear facilities under the safeguards of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  as well as theprovision of adequate security guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States.In addition to the decision to extend the treatyindefinitely and to strengthen the review process  theConference also adopted a resolution on the Middle Eastwhich called  inter alia  for taking the necessary measuresto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.Jordan has participated actively and in good faith inall the regional talks concerning arms control and regionalsecurity within the multilateral track of the peace process.We hope that these talks will achieve their goals  namely the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and an end to the regional arms race in thearea of conventional weapons. These efforts have startedto bear fruit recently with the decision to establish threeregional security centres in Amman  Doha and Tunis. Wemust emphasize here that the activation of these centresdoes not at all mean acceptance of the status quo with allits inherent imbalances  particularly with regard to nuclearweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Themain objective that inspired the establishment of thosecentres was to promote confidence-building amongst theStates of the region and to redress the present imbalancesin order to achieve a more secure and stable Middle East as provided for in the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty.At the international level  we hope that the ongoingnegotiations within the Conference on Disarmament inGeneva will lead to concluding a comprehensive test-bantreaty before the end of next year. We also hope that theConference on Disarmament will begin negotiationsaimed at concluding a treaty on prohibition of theproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons  andanother convention to provide non-nuclear-weapon Stateswith security assurances.As for the situation in the Gulf  Jordan reaffirms itsinterest in the security of that vital region and its earnestdesire to establish strong relations of cooperation basedon mutual respect and non-interference in the internalaffairs of any State. In this regard  Jordan firmly supportsand upholds the right of the United Arab Emirates tosovereignty over the three islands occupied by Iran.Jordan also supports all efforts aiming at bringing aboutan end to the Iranian occupation so that good neighbourlyrelations among the States of the region may beestablished and consolidated.11While we appreciate the positive step taken by Iraq inrecognizing the sovereignty of Kuwait and its internationalboundaries  we emphasize the need to work for lifting thesanctions imposed on the brotherly people of Iraq  with aview to putting an end to their suffering  preserving theunity and the integrity of the people and the territory ofIraq and preventing its fragmentation which would endangerthe security and safety of the region. Jordan also stressesthe need to resolve the issue of the missing and detainedKuwaitis. We consider this a matter of utmost importancebecause of its legal and humanitarian dimensions. We callfor Iraq’s full compliance with all relevant Security Councilresolutions in order to discharge the commitment toproperly implement Council resolutions in accordance withthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations.Having said this  Jordan affirms its solidarity with andsympathy for the Iraqi people in their plight andunderscores the need to respect their legitimate rights andaspirations to freedom and democracy and to safeguardtheir unity. Jordan states this with a clear conscience  inconsonance with the Declaration of Human Rights and theCharter of the United Nations.Jordan has consistently made clear its stand on thetragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.It supports the sovereignty and independence of this youngrepublic and affirms the need to put an end to the Serbianaggression against it. Jordan also supported the position ofthe Contact Group established by the Organization of theIslamic Conference  which called for the lifting of the armsembargo imposed on Bosnia  in conformity with its inherentright to self-defence. Now  following the latest positivedevelopments  represented by the Declaration of Principlesagreed upon by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of theStates parties to the conflict under the auspices of theWestern Contact Group and following the cease-firedecision  Jordan supports the position of the Government ofBosnia and Herzegovina and commends its flexibility intrying to reach agreement. We attach great importance tothe continuation of diplomacy supported by force  whichhas led to the withdrawal by the Serbs of their heavyweapons from the areas surrounding the capital city ofSarajevo  with all that that entailed in terms of putting anend to the shelling of civilians  and of leading to theaforementioned Declaration of Principles.While we are to work in earnest for the establishmentof a safer and more secure world order that would befounded on the values of freedom  tolerance and equality we must recall the early calls made by Jordan during the1980s  when His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hassancalled for the establishment of a new humanitarian worldorder. Those calls were echoed in the proceedings of theUnited Nations General Assembly and translated intoresolutions which called for and encouraged theestablishment and consolidation of such a world order.Perhaps this new humanitarian world order  because of itsaims which would make the human being the main focusof international action in such areas as the eradication ofpoverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gapbetween the rich and the poor  on both the individual andsocietal levels  may well furnish the solid foundation uponwhich we can build the desired new world order whoseparameters have not crystallized as yet.In the same context  we should encourage interfaithdialogue. Such a dialogue would bridge the gaps betweenthe beliefs and concepts of millions of human beings and also  would make great strides towards advancing humandevelopment. If achieved  this would limit religious sectoral and ethnic conflicts  both internally and amongstvarious communities at the international level. Perhapsthere is a window of opportunity now afforded by the endof the cold war and of ideological and political conflicts.This could be a rare and historic opportunity to activatean interfaith dialogue  thus adding a new and valuableforum to the existing forums of dialogue.We in Jordan have always advocated interfaithdialogue as a safe way to combat blind bigotry andstereotyping. In order to achieve this  and in the midst ofthe painful labour that the process of establishing the newworld order is undergoing  we must not marginalize onebillion Muslims  exclude them or eventually drive themto radicalism. Muslims must be partners in the building ofthis new world order and must be actively involved in itsdevelopment.Islam’s bright image is being distorted  which is amatter of grave concern for us. The pervasive anti-Islamicphenomenon  based on unjustified generalizations  aims attarnishing the good name of Muslims and stigmatizingthem as terrorists and blind extremists  with a view tototally distorting Islam’s image. This matter must receivegreater attention from this international Organization. Oneshould not ignore the fact that Islam is an adaptablecivilization  comprising all shades of political opinion andall kinds of different religious thought  in addition to avast  multifaceted human experience. Jordan urges theMember States of this international Organization to try toreach a better understanding of Islam as a religion  as a12culture and as a civilization  and to reject the phenomenonof antagonism to Islam in all its forms and manifestations.In conclusion  the road to a world of peace  securityand stability inhabited by democratic societies  a worldwhose main goal is to attain the highest level of economicand social development  is a long and arduous road indeed.But the achievement of these lofty and noble aims of theCharter of the United Nations is worthy of our sacrifices and requires more serious and sincere action at theinternational level."
"82",3624,"JPN",50,1995,"I should like  on behalf of theGovernment of Japan  to begin my statement at the GeneralAssembly by extending my felicitations on the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. I also wish to offer mysincere congratulations to Your Excellency  ProfessorFreitas do Amaral  on your assumption of the presidency ofthis commemorative session of the General Assembly.Half a century has passed since the United Nationswas founded. When we recall that its predecessor  theLeague of Nations  endured for just a little over 20 years we should consider the very longevity of this Organizationa blessing. But that is not the end of the story. As we lookahead to the future  the mission of the United Nations willbecome increasingly important. I am thus particularlymoved to have been given the honour and privilege ofrepresenting the Government of Japan at this historic andsignificant session of the General Assembly.Although during the past 50 years confrontationbetween the super-Powers at times paralysed the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations  the structure ofthe international community has recently undergonetremendous change. Within this span of time  the worldpopulation has more than doubled  and this explosiveincrease has resulted in serious problems on a globalscale. Moreover  with the rapid proliferation of regionalconflicts in the years since the end of the cold war  thereare an estimated 30 million refugees in the world today.And  as Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali pointedout in his recent statement in Geneva  as we approach theend of the twentieth century  1.3 billion people are livingin absolute poverty and more than 1.5 billion do notreceive even the most basic health care. Needless to say there remain the increasingly grave problems ofenvironmental degradation  including global warming deforestation and marine pollution.The United Nations is the only universalinternational organization that exists to cope with thesegrave problems to ensure that the international communityenjoys peace and prosperity. Thus it is necessary at thistime for the United Nations genuinely to strengthen itsfunctions and to take concrete action for reforms in thefinancial  economic and social  and political fields.Cooperation with the United Nations has always been animportant pillar of Japan’s foreign policy. I should like atthe outset to state that Japan is resolved hereafter tostrengthen further such cooperation and to contributeactively to the strengthening of the Organization’sfunctions.The first point I wish to make with regard to thecrucially important international challenges in this newpost-cold-war era is that the development of developingcountries should be pursued from a new perspective. Theachievement of greater economic self-reliance bydeveloping countries through development is conducive tothe growth of the global economy as a whole and will  inturn  help stabilize the new international order.Development issues have until now tended to becomepoliticized in the context of East-West confrontation andhave not been addressed from the essential perspective ofdevelopment. Today  however  an environment is emergingin which the problems of the economic and socialdevelopment of developing countries can be squarelyaddressed from a perspective of cooperation andpartnership. On this occasion  I should like to reaffirm theneed to formulate a more comprehensive developmentstrategy for achieving peace and prosperity throughout theinternational community.In addressing development issues  I believe thatofficial development assistance will continue to play animportant role. Japan  recalling the assistance it receivedfrom other countries in the past  and now as the world’slargest aid donor  will continue its efforts to expand itsofficial development assistance.On the other hand  however  the development strategythat we are to pursue hereafter cannot be concerned simplywith development assistance. For example  when oneconsiders the extraordinary economic performance of theEast Asia region  one cannot but clearly recognize theimportance of fostering the market mechanism and ofpromoting the liberalization of trade and investment. Ishould also like to emphasize once again the need tomaintain and strengthen the multilateral open-tradingsystem  at the centre of which is the World TradeOrganization  established earlier this year.In this connection  I wish to refer to the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation (APEC) as a good example of openregional cooperation that rejects exclusive regionalism. Asthe presiding nation at this year’s APEC conference  to beheld in Osaka in November  Japan intends to contributeactively to the further promotion of such regionalcooperation under APEC.The concept of social development is increasinglyimportant in ensuring that economic development andgrowth will lead to the enhancement of individual welfareand the security and prosperity of society as a wholethrough the promotion of education and training  respectfor human rights and the advancement of the status ofwomen. Japan is working to enhance its internationalcooperation in all of these areas. It attaches particularimportance to the role of women in development andthus  at the recent Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  it announced a new policy to expand itsdevelopment assistance in the three priority areas ofraising the educational standards  improving the healthand promoting the economic and social participation ofwomen.In the formulation of the new development strategywhich I proposed earlier  a comprehensive approach isneeded. Such an approach would include not only officialdevelopment assistance  but a variety of policy measuresin such areas as trade  investment  macroeconomicpolicies  technology transfer and building socialinfrastructure. In addition  it is also important to take adifferentiated approach which applies the best policy mixaccording to the respective country’s stage ofdevelopment.Based on this fundamental philosophy  I should liketo present the following three concrete guidelines.First  realistic development targets which clearlyindicate the anticipated results of development should beestablished  and developing countries and donor countriesshould work together to achieve those targets. I shouldlike  for example  to propose that the United Nations  withthe cooperation of such bodies as the United NationsUniversity  undertake a study to establish developmenttargets. These targets would combine indices measuringthe economic growth of a developing country by  forexample  an increase of its gross national product to afixed level within a certain time-frame  with indicesshowing the degree of social development according to among other things  literacy and infant mortality rates.Secondly  it is important to promote participatorydevelopment that involves  in addition to centralGovernments  new development actors such asnon-governmental organizations and local governments.Thirdly  South-South cooperation should be furtherpromoted. I would propose that necessary financialmeasures be considered  including the establishment of aneffective mechanism for this purpose within the UnitedNations Development Programme.2While there is a diminished likelihood of a large-scaleconfrontation or conflict between nations today  ascompared with the cold-war era  regional conflicts whichstem from religious or ethnic rivalries are of increasinglyserious concern. Because poverty is in many cases a causeof these conflicts  it is essential that development issues beurgently addressed. At the same time  it is also the case thata conflict itself poses a major obstacle to the achievementof development  resulting in a vicious circle.The efforts of the countries concerned  as well asthose of other countries in the region  are  of course  basicto the settlement of regional conflicts. But  in addition  theinternational community too must seriously address itself tothe resolution of conflicts  and for this purpose thefunctions of the United Nations should be strengthened.Peace-keeping operations  building upon the efforts ofthe parties concerned  are an effective means of helping tosettle disputes. Their deployment can also play an importantrole in preventing conflicts. It is thus essential that theinternational community continue to support such operationsand work for their further reform. Japan actively cooperateswith United Nations peace-keeping operations and intendsto participate in the United Nations DisengagementObserver Force in the Golan Heights. Moreover  respondingto the rapidly expanding refugee problems resulting fromthese numerous conflicts  Japan continues to support theactivities of such organs as the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees.It is also important that the United Nations  as well asits Member States  place greater emphasis on conflictprevention. Japan supports the strengthening of UnitedNations efforts in the area of preventive diplomacy including the dispatch of fact-finding missions and the offerof political support through its good offices or mediationefforts.It is for the purpose of promoting conflict preventionand settlement that Japan  with the United Nations and theUnited Nations University  is co-sponsoring the High-LevelSymposium on Peace and Development: Problems ofConflict in Africa  which will be convened next month.Of all the regional disputes being witnessed in theworld today  particular reference should be made to theconflict in the former Yugoslavia. Peace will not beachieved in that conflict through the use of force by theparties concerned; it must be sought through negotiation.And now there is a window of opportunity for the partiesto engage in peace talks. It is essential that that opportunitynot be lost but that all concerned spare no effort toachieve peace. Japan continues to support the effortstowards peace being made by the countries concerned aswell as the activities of the United Nations. It is alsoextending appropriate cooperation  including humanitarianassistance. Once the conflict is brought to an end andpeace is restored  Japan intends to cooperate in therehabilitation of the region in conjunction with otherconcerned countries and relevant internationalorganizations.I turn now to the situation in the Middle East. Japanhas been actively contributing to efforts towards apeaceful settlement. Japan welcomes the agreementreached on 24 September in the negotiations on theexpansion of Palestinian interim self-rule and believes itwill be a major step forward in the peace process.Promoting disarmament and strengthening the regimefor the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destructionare essential to the maintenance of international peace andstability. As countries curtail excessive military spendingthrough arms-reduction efforts  the resources thus savedcan be allocated to development objectives. Conversely progress in economic development must not lead to armsbuild-ups  and for this reason too it is necessary toredouble disarmament efforts.In this year that marks the fiftieth anniversary of theatomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Japanwelcomed the decision to extend indefinitely the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which is an important contribution to strengthening thebasis of the non-proliferation regime and representssignificant progress towards the ultimate elimination ofnuclear weapons.As an important step towards nuclear disarmament renewed efforts should be made to complete negotiationson a comprehensive test-ban treaty by next spring and tosign it by the autumn of 1996  at the latest. Japan  withfirm political will and together with other countries  willdo its utmost to attain this crucially important goal. Asfor the scope of the treaty’s provisions against nucleartesting  we deeply appreciate the announcements made byFrance  the United States and the United Kingdomindicating their support for a total ban on all nucleartesting and we hope that the other nuclear-weapon Stateswill likewise adopt that position without delay. I shouldlike to reiterate here the proposal which I made in myaddress to this body last year that  once the treaty isconcluded  the signing ceremony be held in Japan.3I cannot but deeply deplore the nuclear tests conductedby certain countries immediately after the indefiniteextension of the NPT was approved unanimously by theStates Parties to the Treaty and just as the internationalcommunity has begun to make further progress towards anuclear-free world. I should like on this occasion toreaffirm that the nuclear-weapon States  which are accordeda special status under the NPT  have an obligation torespond to the trust shown in them by non-nuclear-weaponStates by engaging in genuine nuclear-disarmament efforts.Japan has consistently called for the cessation of nucleartesting and at this session of the General Assembly intendsto sponsor a draft resolution calling for the cessation ofnuclear testing. I hope that it receives the support andcooperation of all Member States.In addition  I would appeal to all States to workvigorously for the reduction and control of conventionalweapons. The United Nations Register of ConventionalArms  the purpose of which is to enhance the transparencyof arms transfers  has proved a great success  recordingmore than 90 per cent of the transfers of conventionalweapons that have taken place throughout the world. Istrongly encourage many more States to participate in theRegister. The prompt establishment of an internationalmechanism for controlling the export of conventionalweapons is also an important issue.The problem of uncleared land-mines is not only ahumanitarian issue but one that poses a serious obstacle toeconomic rehabilitation. International cooperation and thedevelopment of technology for clearing these mines areurgently required. As we look to the future  it is equallyimportant to consider and strengthen the framework ofinternational regulations with respect to the use  production transfer and so on of anti-personnel land- mines.Another serious problem facing the internationalcommunity is that of the proliferation of small arms. It isJapan’s intention to submit to the General Assembly at thissession a draft resolution on the establishment  under theSecretary-General  of a panel of experts to address thisissue.As I stated at the beginning of my remarks  we shouldseize the historic opportunity presented by the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations to realize concretereforms aimed at strengthening the functions of theOrganization  the importance of which continues to grow.I should like on this occasion to present my viewsconcerning reforms to be undertaken in three areas  namely financial reform  reforms in the economic and socialfields and reform of the Security Council.Unless the efficiency of its bodies is enhanced andits financial base is made sound and strong  a genuinestrengthening of the functions of the United Nations willnot be achieved. At present the unpaid contributions ofMember States to the United Nations amount to well overUS$ 3 billion. It is imperative that we as Member Statesrecognize this situation as an impending crisis and face upto it. I call upon all Member States to make every effortto pay in full and as soon as possible their assessedcontributions that are in arrears. At the same time Ishould like to stress the need for a comprehensive reviewof the method by which the financial burden is sharedamong Member States  in a manner that does not placeexcessive burdens on any of them. As the second-largestcontributor to the United Nations  Japan  despite its severefinancial situation  has assumed considerable responsiblefor United Nations financing. On this occasion I wish toemphasize that serious discussion of the fundamentalreform of United Nations financing and the realization ofa fair and equitable system of burden-sharing are key tothe strengthening of the functions of the United Nations.Now  with the situation more conducive toaddressing development issues from a new perspective  itis imperative that we tackle global issues moreeffectively  particularly those relating to the environment but also human rights  refugees  population  AIDS andnarcotics.In so doing we must work with greater earnestnessto strengthen the United Nations system in economic andsocial fields. Specifically  it is necessary to improve theefficiency and review the mandates of the variousorganizations and agencies active in these fields and topromote more effective coordination between them including international financial institutions.From this point of view  Japan attaches greatimportance to the discussion on “An Agenda forDevelopment”  and by contributing actively to thatdiscussion it is endeavouring to promote reform ineconomic and social fields. In particular  there is anurgent need to revitalize the functions of the Economicand Social Council  including the further utilization of itsvarious functional committees.The reform of the Security Council is of the utmostimportance in strengthening the United Nations in thepolitical field. The primary objective of Security Council4reform is to strengthen its function by enhancing itslegitimacy and effectiveness. Towards this end  Japanbelieves it is necessary to expand the Security Council byadding to its permanent membership countries in a positionto assume global responsibilities  and also to increase by anappropriate number the non-permanent membership.As I stated here last year  Japan  with the endorsementof many countries  is prepared to discharge itsresponsibilities as a permanent member of the SecurityCouncil  in accordance with its basic philosophy regardinginternational contributions  including the non-resort to theuse of force prohibited by its Constitution. On this point  Ishould like to take this opportunity once again to expressmy appreciation to the many countries that have indicatedtheir support for Japan’s permanent membership on theSecurity Council.Building on the results of the discussions conducted inthe Working Group over the past two years  particularly onthe substantive progress made during the last session of theGeneral Assembly  and also taking advantage of themomentum provided by the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  I would urge all Member States to redoubletheir efforts to reach an agreement on a broad frameworkfor reform by the end of the current session  in September1996.This year  which marks the fiftieth anniversary of theend of the Second World War  Japan has looked squarelyat its past history and has renewed its commitment topeace. Japan is among the countries that have benefitedmost from the peace and stability of the internationalcommunity over the past 50 years. I earnestly hope thatother countries throughout the world will likewise enjoy theblessings that have accrued to Japan as a result ofinternational peace and prosperity.I should like to conclude my statement today byreaffirming Japan’s determination to contribute to the bestof its ability to the building of a stronger United Nationsfor the future  as well as to establishing a new internationalorder for peace and prosperity based upon the principles offreedom and democracy."
"83",3649,"KAZ",50,1995,"Please accept mycongratulations  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. This attests toyour excellent qualities  which will undoubtedlycontribute to the successful discussion of all the items onthe agenda.I would like to take this opportunity to expressspecial appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his great contribution to the solution ofinternational problems of the world community and hisefficient management aimed at the establishment of newrelations between nations in the twenty-first century.We have to note that this anniversary session of theGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time of increasedtension and continued armed conflicts in different parts ofthe globe. One of the most dangerous and complicated isthe Bosnian conflict. Events in Bosnia defystraightforward interpretation. At the same time  thereadiness recently displayed by the parties in conflict tosettle existing problems on the basis of adherence to theprinciples of State sovereignty inspires optimism and hopethat long-awaited peace will be established in the Balkans.In Kazakstan’s opinion one of the most importantconditions for achieving peace is that respective countriesin the territory of the former Yugoslavia continue to existas sovereign States within the borders recognized by theworld community.We highly appreciate the role of the United Nationspeace-keeping forces  which in differing situations havedone their best to contain conflicts and alleviate theconsequences of hostilities for the civilian population. Wehave no doubt that the Organization has to exercise all itsauthority in such situations. The world community shouldprovide more effective assistance to the United Nations sothat it can use its peace-keeping forces in areas of conflictin a more efficient and timely manner.Creation of regional and global structures designedto promote long-lasting peace is an important aspect ofinternational security. The balance of forces  upset after24the end of the cold war  should be restored not through theestablishment of new military and political alliances butthrough international treaties and agreements promotingsecurity and stability and through the establishment and useof effective mechanisms of preventive diplomacy.We view as quite successful the activities of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  whose sphere of responsibility includes not onlyEurope but Central Asia as well. A high degree ofefficiency in security matters concerning the Asian andPacific region is being displayed by the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum.Kazakstan  for its part  continues its work towards theconvening of a conference on interaction and confidence-building measures in Asia. The forum’s mandate is beingdrawn up by the Special Working Group. We believe thatall the countries of the Asian continent  despite theirheterogeneity  have an equal interest in durable peace andstability  which is an important guarantee for theirprogressive movement towards economic prosperity andinternal stability. Taking this opportunity  I urge all Asiancountries to contribute to the realization of this idea expressed by President Nazarbayev from the rostrum of thislofty Organization at the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.We firmly believe that no matter how strong andeffective the United Nations may be  no matter howcomprehensive its activities are  security and peace shouldbe the backbone of the policy of all countries  irrespectiveof their capabilities and regional affiliation. We see that inthe new geopolitical reality more emphasis is being placedon meeting the various needs of the individual. There is ageneral understanding that quick solutions of security andstability issues cannot and should not take the place of along-term strategy of sustainable development. In otherwords  in today’s world there is an emerging tendencytowards a gradual transition from national security tohuman security.The Republic of Kazakstan  which used to be ade facto nuclear-weapon State and now is a nuclear-freeState  is making its contribution to these globaltransformations. The elimination of all existing nuclearwarheads in Kazakstan’s territory and of the last nuclearcharge at the already-closed Semipalatinsk nuclear-test sitehas been a highly important step in the fulfilment ofKazakstan’s international obligations.Kazakstan is a consistent advocate of a moratoriumon nuclear tests and of a comprehensive test-ban treaty which should be concluded as soon as possible but notlater than next year.Addressing the United Nations Conference onDisarmament in June 1995 in Geneva  Kazakstan’sPresident reaffirmed its commitment to the consistentpolicy of the strengthening of international security in itsnew interpretation. The President of Kazakstan stressedthat various needs of the individual must be met. Indeed the success of the disarmament process is measured todaynot only by the percentage of warheads and deliverysystems cut but also by the increase in the production ofgoods for the people.In the light of the outcome of the CopenhagenSummit  emerging models of human development shouldinclude new concepts for solving educational employment  environmental and health-care problems.Urgent and effective measures are needed to address adangerous growth in unemployment — an especiallypressing problem for the economies in transition. Webelieve that these countries can legitimately expect fromthe United Nations the adoption of special measurespromoting their sustainable development. The priority thatthis matter should be given by the United Nations can beexplained by a number of factors.Indeed  modern geo-economic trends reflect the factthat in the near future world economic centres in NorthAmerica  South-East Asia and Europe will emerge or bestrengthened. The stability and effectiveness of thesecentres cannot be imagined without their involvement intrade and economic relations with the countries of theCommonwealth of Independent States  which  even takenseparately  represent significant economic and politicalentities capable of filling existing gaps in relationsbetween Europe and Asia  North and South. It is relevant first of all  in the case of Kazakstan — a major CentralAsian State.Speaking of the need to adapt the United Nationssystem to the new geo-political realities  we think that thepotential of the countries of Central Asia should be takeninto account. Their capabilities in the formulation of thestrategies of sustainable development and peace-makingare becoming stronger. Close attention should be paid tothe impetus for cooperation with the United Nations  inthe interest of a secure world  that is being served bythese countries.25In this context  I would like to draw attention toPresident Nazarbayev’s initiative regarding theestablishment  under the auspices of the United Nations  ofa unit of the armed forces of three Central Asianrepublics — Kazakstan  Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. In ouropinion  this would contribute to the strengthening ofsecurity and peace in Central Asia — a region which alsohas its areas of conflict.In the opinion of Kazakstan  priority attention incooperation between the United Nations and the economiesin transition should be paid to the protection of theenvironment  which is one of the five main dimensions ofdevelopment. In the Central Asian region  the ecologicalthreat is one of the most dangerous threats to humansecurity.We think that the world community should pay specialattention to the tragedy of the Aral Sea region. Accordingto the World Bank  in the next 25 years  the efforts torestore an ecological balance in the region will require $50billion. Such a project is not feasible without financialassistance from international organizations. Thus  we areinterested in the search for new international sources offinancing  and support the idea of devising a system ofinternational taxes on arms transfers and transactions involving currency flows  to achieve global human including ecological  security.I would like to say a few words about United Nationsreforms. The position of Kazakstan on this issue is asfollows. Reforms are necessary  but they should be carriedout with the utmost care  in order to avoid upsetting thebalance of the whole system of international relations. TheCharter of the United Nations should largely remain as thebasis and the reference point for the work of theOrganization  to which there is no alternative in the modernworld.Major changes that have taken place in the world sincethe creation of the United Nations should be reflected in thecomposition of the Security Council. Kazakstan believesthat the number of Council members  including the numberof permanent members  could  in principle  be increased.We welcome measures taken by the Secretary-Generalto reduce expenses related to the activities of theSecretariat. It is important  in our opinion  that such anessential body as the International Court of Justice shouldalso be adapted to present-day requirements. The idea ofhaving important decisions adopted in an economic securitycouncil appears to be worthy of attention  considering theneed  in the view of many countries  to reorganize andrevitalize the Economic and Social Council.Debates on fundamental United Nationsdocuments — the reports by the United NationsSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  “An Agenda forPeace” and “An Agenda for Development” — reveal theneed for a more detailed analysis of ways to developsociety by meeting the social  economic  political andcultural needs of the individual. We are especially awareof this now as we celebrate  under the auspices ofUNESCO  the 150th anniversary of Abai  a great Kazakpoet  educator and philosopher  who devoted his life tothe mutual spiritual and cultural enrichment of nations.The desire to jointly solve the issues of “peace anddevelopment” also lies at the heart of our proposal to setup a United Nations commission for central Asia — ajoint body of the Economic Commission for Europe(ECE) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asiaand the Pacific (ESCAP). This idea was initially proposedby the President of the Republic of Kazakstan  Mr. N.Nazarbaev  at the Summit of the member States of theEconomic Cooperation Organization in 1993 in Istanbul.The common nature of the social  economic and politicalobjectives of the countries in the region  on the thresholdof the twenty-first century  determines the need toestablish regional mechanisms for their attainment and tocreate appropriate structures. The progress achieved bythe countries of Central Asia in this regard is reflected bythe rather effective activities of the OECD  as well asthose of the economic union between Kazakstan Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.Speaking about the importance of this problem forthe Central Asian States  I would like to note that judging by past experience  the efforts of two importantregional Commissions — ESCAP and ECE — are notadequately coordinated with regard to this group ofcountries. As a result  the republics of Central Asia arenot sufficiently involved in their programmes.As the United Nations Organization approaches itsfiftieth anniversary  it has great accomplishments to itscredit in peacemaking and in the strengthening ofinternational security. As a well-known Japanese writeronce said: only life filled with a workaday routine mightbe worse and more dreadful than a war. Least of allwould we like to see the United Nations as a structurewhich mechanically services the demands of mankind ona day-by-day basis. In other words  we do not want to seethe26United Nations as a rigid structure  insensitive to theprofound changes of our rapidly changing times. The worldcontinues to pin its hopes on the United Nations as aconcentrated source of wisdom  justice and responsivenessto the sufferings of mankind. The world appeals to theUnited Nations to rise above immediate plans andprogrammes in order to appreciate fully the mosaic ofmodern international relations in all their variety anddiversity. And we firmly believe that the United Nationsshould adequately respond to the aspirations of all peoplesyearning for peace and tranquillity  aspirations born out oftheir very existence."
"84",3696,"KEN",50,1995,"Let me  at the outset congratulate His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaralon his unanimous election as President of the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. His wide diplomaticexperience and intellectual abilities reinforce our confidencein his stewardship. I wish him success in the heavy taskbefore us.I also pay tribute to his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côted’Ivoire  who ably presided over the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly.We commend the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the untiring and visionary manner inwhich he is managing the affairs of the Organization.Kenya is fully committed to the ideals of thisOrganization. Indeed  Kenya’s motto  “Harambee” whichmeans “pull together”  and the national philosophy ofpeace  love and unity  are fitting expressions of what theUnited Nations and the Kenyan people aspire to. Kenyahas always championed the principles of democracy andthe pursuit of socio-economic development to enhance theliving standards of the people.Under the leadership of His Excellency PresidentDaniel T. Arap Moi  Kenya has undertaken far-reachingpolitical and economic reforms  whose benefits we arebeginning to see. Our economy is now totally liberalizedin keeping with our tradition of providing an environmentconducive to enterprise development. Our democraticinstitutions have developed the necessary flexibility tocope with the new situations and to ensure continuity ofthe political stability which the country has enjoyed sinceindependence.We have observed a systematic campaign todenigrate African countries. It is as though there were anagenda to bring them into international disrepute. Wereject these destructive approaches designed to promotedivisive elements and to manipulate domestic publicopinion with a view to pitting people against their ownGovernments. Kenya also condemns in the strongestterms the tendency in certain sectors of the internationalpress to present the image of African countries in termsof tribal superiority or inferiority  to inflame ethnicconflicts and to depict the continent as replete withcorruption and catastrophes. Africa deserves credit for itsarduous struggle against external domination. We aredetermined to create cohesive and prosperous States aftermany years of destructive colonial policies of divide andrule  which constituted gross violations of human rights.11I wish to assure the Assembly that the Governmentand the people of Kenya are determined despite the odds tocontinue the struggle to forge national unity and toaccelerate socio-economic development. Our commitment which I underscore  to the principles of democracy  goodgovernance  the protection and promotion of human rightsand the rule of law remains firm.It is against that background that I wish now toaddress some of the issues on the agenda of the GeneralAssembly. In the time since its inception  the UnitedNations has evolved into a truly global organization  asenvisaged in the Charter. Its membership has grown from50 at its inception to 185 today. Its activities have rangedfrom decolonization  the codification of international law disarmament and conflict resolution to global humanitarianactivities and international economic cooperation. Theachievements in these areas are  indeed  self-evident. Thedemands on the Organization have  however  exertedmaximum pressure on its ability to cope. Hence the needfor the Organization to be revitalized at this opportune time.Five years after the end of the cold war theinternational community still faces a number of conflicts which are of great concern as they continue to undermineinternational peace and security. These conflicts have posedserious challenges owing primarily to complexitiesassociated with their internal character. We neverthelessappreciate the flexibility with which the United Nations isdealing with these conflicts and the commendable successeswhich have been achieved in resolving a good number ofthem. These achievements include the resolution of theconflicts in Namibia  Cambodia  Mozambique  El Salvadorand Haiti. Success becomes even more pronounced whenwe consider the extent to which the United Nations haseffectively mobilized international humanitarian assistancein virtually all conflict areas  through the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and otherUnited Nations agencies.At the forty-seventh session the General Assemblymandated the Secretary-General to pursue preventivediplomacy and to strengthen the Secretariat’s capacity tocope with situations likely to endanger international peaceand security. To that end  the Secretary-General’s initiatives“An Agenda for Peace” and the subsequent Supplement tothat document have made a significant contribution to thisimportant subject. I wish to record Kenya’s appreciation tothe Secretary-General for his personal efforts and initiativesin search of lasting international peace and security. Welook forward to the results of the work of the informalworking groups that have been set up to consider ingreater depth the various elements contained in the Agenda.We note the recent initiatives taken with a view tostrengthening the role of regional organizations in conflictresolution and conflict management. Kenya  however wishes to reiterate that the thrust of the contributions ofregional organizations and arrangements should betargeted towards preventive diplomacy and peacemaking.We submit that peace-keeping and peace enforcementshould remain the primary responsibility of the UnitedNations. These responsibilities are enshrined in theCharter and cannot be transferred to regionalorganizations. We encourage closer cooperation in thisregard between the Organization of African Unity (OAU)and the United Nations on the basis of the Charter andthe agreement on cooperation between the twoorganizations.With regard to regional conflicts  Kenya welcomesthe important steps towards long-lasting peace that wehave recently witnessed in the southern part of Africa.Following the positive resolution of the conflict inMozambique  recent developments in Angola give us highexpectations for a durable solution of the protractedconflict in that sisterly country.At a time when the world is championing the causeof peace  democracy and human rights  it is totallyunacceptable that a band of mercenaries should overthrowthe Government of the Comoros and hold the Presidentand Government officials captive. Kenya condemns thisact in the strongest terms possible and calls on theSecurity Council to take necessary measures to rectify thesituation.With respect to Liberia  we welcome the recentsigning of an agreement by all the warring parties  inwhich they have committed themselves to a programmefor the restoration of democracy to culminate in generalelections in a year’s time. The Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) should be congratulatedfor the efforts and sacrifices it has made in the search fora lasting solution to the Liberian conflict. United Nationsinvolvement in the resolution of the Liberia conflict which has been minimal so far despite the magnitude ofthe problem  should be enhanced. It is  therefore important that the United Nations should enhance itssupport to the peace efforts in Liberia to ensure that themomentum for peace is sustained.12In the Middle East  the process towards durable peaceachieved another important milestone with last week’ssigning of a further agreement between Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin of Israel and Chairman Yasser Arafat of thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  extendingPalestinian self-rule over the West Bank. We commend thevision and courage of these leaders and encourage them andother leaders in the region to broaden the peace process.The situation in Somalia continues to be a matter ofgreat concern to Kenya. As long as the situation in Somaliaremains unstable  the countries of the region  and inparticular my own  will continue to experience problemsassociated with the influx of refugees and with a lack ofsecurity in the border region. While we commendhumanitarian efforts in Somalia  we are deeply concernedthat there has been no tangible progress in national andpolitical reconciliation in that country. We call on thefactional leaders to put the interests of the Somali peoplefirst and to be cognizant of the fact that a lasting solutionto the Somali problem lies with the Somali people and theirleaders.The conflict in the former Yugoslavia poses one of thegreatest challenges to the capacity of the United Nations tofacilitate the search for durable peace. We appreciate all thediplomatic initiatives which have been undertaken to bringabout a negotiated settlement  and we encourage all theparties to intensify their efforts for lasting peace. I wish topay tribute to all United Nations military  civilian andhumanitarian personnel for the sacrifices they have made toadvance the cause of peace in that region. Kenya has madea significant contribution to peace-keeping operations in theformer Yugoslavia  having contributed one battalion as wellas military observers and civilian police over the last fouryears.We welcome the establishment of the InternationalCommission of Inquiry to investigate the assassination ofthe former Head of State and senior Government officialsand the subsequent massacres of civilians in Burundi. Wewould also welcome the establishment by the SecurityCouncil of a commission to oversee compliance with armsembargos against groups and individuals undermining peaceand security in the Central African region.Kenya stresses the importance of reconciliation andtolerance and appeals to the international community tocontinue to assist the countries of the Great Lakes region todeal with the root causes of the problems that havebedevilled them for many years  as well as with theirreconstruction efforts. In particular  the security ofpopulations and the resettlement of refugees must beadequately and comprehensively addressed.The results of the Review and Extension Conferenceof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  held in May this year  constitute asignificant contribution to the realization of a nuclear-freeworld. The commitments and the security assurancesmade by the nuclear-weapon States to the non-nuclear-weapon States should strengthen the resolve of theinternational community towards the total elimination ofnuclear weapons. It is therefore necessary that thesecommitments be translated into binding international legalinstruments.Kenya looks forward to the conclusion  by 1996  ofthe comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. We join theinternational community in reiterating the call for strictobservance of the moratorium on nuclear testing pendingthe conclusion of that treaty.The world economy as a whole continues to showmodest growth  with the highest performance beingexperienced in South-East Asia. However  manyeconomies in the African region are still sluggish although there are signs of recovery. The continentremains highly vulnerable to adverse internationaleconomic policies  as well as natural calamities  owing toits limited capacity to respond.Kenya and many other African countries haveundertaken major political and economic reforms despitethe enormous short-term adverse effects on the vulnerablesocial groups  particularly in regard to the escalating costsof  for instance  education  health and housing. Theseefforts  however  have been hampered by the decline inboth bilateral and multilateral financial support  resultingin limited prospects for economic growth. In this regard we urge the international community to provide adequateresources to support these reforms.As the United Nations celebrates its fiftiethanniversary it is imperative that development support beaccorded the priority that it obviously deserves. Theinternational commitment relating to the fulfilment of theagreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national productshould be given the necessary impetus to reverse thedeclining trend. Kenya appeals to the industrializedcountries to meet the official development assistancetarget and to provide new and additional resources tofinance the programmes adopted by the various UnitedNations Conferences.13Debt-servicing obligations should not become anobstacle to efforts aimed at the creation of employment  thereduction of poverty and social integration. While wewelcome the various measures taken by the internationalcommunity  on bilateral and multilateral bases  to mitigatethe debt burden  it is evident that these measures haveachieved only limited results. Kenya believes that a lastingsolution to the debt burden is a bold initiative for a moreeffective reduction  or cancellation  of both the bilateral andthe multilateral debt of the heavily indebted low-incomecountries  particularly in Africa.While the liberalization of world trade  in the contextof the World Trade Organization  is expected to benefit theinternational community  there are strong indications thatthe results may not benefit all regions. The opening of theAfrican market to external competition has already putserious strain on the fragile industrial sector of thesecountries. Furthermore  the phasing out of the preferentialtrade arrangements extended to African and otherdeveloping countries poses a serious threat to theirtraditional markets. African countries therefore need supportif they are to diversify their economies.It is pertinent that “An Agenda for Development”should embrace all the programmes to which theinternational community has already committed  or willcommit  itself in the various international conferences including the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the Cairo Conference on Population andDevelopment  the Copenhagen Summit for SocialDevelopment  the Fourth World Conference on Women andthe forthcoming United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (HABITAT II)  to be held in Istanbul  Turkey.It is also important that HABITAT II come up with aconcrete plan of action that will give HABITAT  as theUnited Nations agency responsible for human settlements an enhanced mandate  with an effective capacity to assistMember States  particularly developing countries  to dealwith the increased problems of human settlements and thusenable them to have adequate shelter — one of thefundamental human rights.It is imperative that the Agenda accord the highestpriority to the development of national and regionalcapacities. It should also be people-centred  with theemphasis on human-resources development  the applicationof science and technology and the expansion ofemployment and income-generating opportunities.At the global level  the United Nations Economicand Social Council should not only assume effectivecoordination of the international policies and activities ofthe specialized agencies but also ensure the mobilizationof resources for operational activities which are criticalfor the realization of socio-economic development.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsprovides a great opportunity for the internationalcommunity to focus constructively on the measures thatshould be taken to revitalize the Organization on the basisof the experience gained and the challenges ahead. Kenyais of the view that the Organization has proved itseffectiveness and flexibility in dealing with complex andwide-ranging international issues. The United Nations therefore  does not require radical transformation but rather  the strengthening and modification of its structuresand organs to enhance its effectiveness andresponsiveness to new priorities and strategies.It is vital that the Organization continue to cateradequately for both international peace and security andcooperation for development  in accordance with theCharter. Revitalization of the United Nations entails notonly the need to streamline the administrative structuresof the Organization but also the need to ensure that it isprovided with adequate resources  on a regular andassured basis  to enable it to execute the mandatesentrusted to it by the Member States.The report of the ad hoc Open-ended WorkingGroup on reform of the Security Council has highlightedthe pertinent areas requiring reform. There is consensuson the need to expand the membership of the Council.Kenya urges greater flexibility in the positions taken sothat agreement can be reached on the number anddistribution of the additional seats on the basis ofequitable geographical distribution for all categories. Thiscould be achieved through expansion of the membershipto include more countries from the regions that arecurrently underrepresented and by effecting periodicreviews of the permanent membership to take account ofthe evolving realities of the world situation.With regard to the question of financing  we areconcerned that the operations of the Organization havebeen greatly hampered by the failure of many MemberStates to honour their budgetary obligations in full and ontime. Irrespective of the outcome of the reform process the timely payment of United Nations apportionments willcontinue to be of crucial importance to the financialsoundness of the Organization. The financing of the14Organization is a collective responsibility of all the MemberStates. Unilateral actions relating to budgetary contributionsare therefore inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter.It is only through necessary and thorough assessment of theindividual countries’ capacity to pay that the scale ofassessments can be adjusted.As the United Nations continues to introduce measuresto ensure the reduction of waste and to deal with thefinancial crisis  it is imperative that the Organization ensurethe maximum and rational use of the existing facilities. Allmeetings and conferences under the auspices of UnitedNations bodies should  to the extent possible  be held inNairobi — the only United Nations Centre in the whole ofthe developing world.We are  indeed  concerned about the very lowutilization rate of the conference facilities in Nairobipointed out by the Secretary-General in his report on UnitedNations Conference Services. In this regard  Kenya wishesto see the United Nations make full use of the facilitiesavailable at the United Nations Centre in Gigiri  theheadquarters of the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) and the United Nations Centre forHuman Settlements (HABITAT).Kenya has offered to host in Nairobi the secretariat forthe Convention on Biological Diversity in order to make itpossible to utilize the expertise and capacity which UNEPhas developed over the years. We look forward to thesupport of the international community in this regard.Let us not lose the opportunity offered by the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations to renew our resolve tomake the Organization fulfil the aspirations of peace  hopeand stability that inspired the founding fathers of thisOrganization. As we move into the next millennium  wemust endeavour to make this world a better place to live in.Kenya will play its part as necessary."
"85",3720,"KGZ",50,1995,"On behalf of the delegation of my country  Iwould like to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral onhis election to the lofty post of President of the fiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. We would also like to express our deep gratitudeto the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  who is at the head of our Organization atthis momentous time  for his tireless efforts to strengthenpeace and security around the world.The fireworks commemorating victory in the SecondWorld War still resounded when our Organization wascoming into being  but the world had already been dividedby military and ideological confrontation. In the SovietUnion  Ministries of Foreign Affairs were founded in eachof the republics and hastily staffed with diplomaticpersonnel. However  the Soviet Union’s attempts to use itsrepublics to increase the number of votes in its bloc withinthe newly formed international Organization were notsuccessful. Only three out of the 15 republics were acceptedas Members of the United Nations. Frozen by the years ofthe cold war  we gained our independence without anyviolence or bloodshed. Now  almost half a century later  wehave entered into the community of fully-fledged Membersof the United Nations.Since then  the world has gone through dramaticchanges. Today we need the United Nations as neverbefore.Through the United Nations  we  the post-socialistcountries  enter into the world and interact with countriesof the North and the South  the West and the East. Withinonly four years of attaining independence  Kyrgyzstan hasbecome a Member of the United Nations and has joined theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  theNorth Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) and theEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  as well asmany other international political and financialorganizations. The United Nations represents the main axisof the foreign policy of our young country  and we willwork without respite to increase the effectiveness of ourOrganization.As small countries  we see in the United Nations aguarantor of our independence  security and justice  basedon mutual respect for international law. The law is ourstrongest argument in the family of the United Nations.As countries with economies in transition and asdeveloping democracies  we receive extremely importantand urgent aid and support from the United Nations:medicine  food and technical equipment. The GraminBank is fighting rising poverty by giving the peoplemicroloans. We are trying to build a civil society byeducating the non-governmental organizations  lawyersand journalists. On 24 December 1995  open presidentialelections will take place in Kyrgyzstan  to which wewould like to invite observers from all over the world.One of our most significant achievements during ourfirst years of independence  as our President  AskarAkayev  has pointed out  is — in addition to our smalleconomic advances on the road to a free market — theattainment of an inter-ethnic consensus  internal stabilityand peace in our country.Hidden tensions based on religious and ethnicgrounds erupted in Central Asia after the dissolution ofthe Soviet Union  requiring the involvement of the UnitedNations  the OSCE and the CIS. We commend themediating role of the United Nations  which led to acease-fire agreement and the beginning of a dialoguebetween the sides in the inter-Tajik conflict. The fivecountries of Central Asia  along with the RussianFederation  are doing their best to launch the fifth roundof talks on the conflict in Tajikistan. These should lead toa dialogue regarding fundamental issues pertaining to thepolitical future of the country.Actions taken by the organs of the United Nationssystem  the donor countries and international financialinstitutions should range from humanitarian assistance tolong-term development programmes. This is true for bothTajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. I strongly support the proposalby the Secretary of State of the United Kingdom Mr. Malcolm Rifkind  for the establishment within theUnited Nations of special programmes for stabilizationand transition.It is a sign of the times that  in the face of horribleand prolonged conflicts  all the major countries  for thefirst time in half a century  have joined together to buildand keep the peace.Step by step  the knot in the Middle East is beinguntied. We would like to congratulate Israel and Palestineon the recent signing of an agreement on the West Bank 17and we hope that both parties will have patience  courageand success on this difficult road to peace. There arepromising hopes for a settlement to be reached that will endthe conflict in Bosnia. Kyrgyzstan welcomes the peace talksbased on the Washington Agreements on the creation of aState based on the federal principle. We are convinced thatthe time has come to focus the world’s attention on thesituation in Afghanistan. There can be no peace in Asiawithout the settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.It is impossible to be a mere spectator when theflames of wars and conflicts scorch our borders anddecrease stability. Kazakstan  Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstanhave announced their willingness to create a peace-keepingunit under the auspices of the United Nations. We areconvinced of the need to have such United Nationsoperational peace-keeping forces in reserve  so they can becalled upon in extreme situations.There remains an undiscovered potential when itcomes to cooperation among the United Nations and theOSCE  the United Nations and the CIS  and all of themtogether when it comes to solving conflicts in post-Sovietterritory. It is not by competing but by cooperating that theregional security institutions can stop the violence andexplosions. They can use a wide spectrum of preventivemeasures  such as “planting” the culture of peace  bringingthe sides to the negotiating table and constant monitoring.Border issues  the distribution of water and naturalresources  the rights of ethnic minorities: we in CentralAsia need international legal expertise in all these areas  aswell as the introduction of proven legal  political  socio-economic norms and regulations.Fully sharing the responsibility for peace and securityin our region  the newly independent States of Central Asiaare trying to do all they can to keep peace and order on theland given to us by God. Kazakstan is working withpersistence to organize a conference on confidence-buildingmeasures in Asia. Uzbekistan is working on the idea of astanding seminar on the subject of regional security.Turkmenistan declared its intention to become a neutralState. During a meeting in May of this year at LakeIssyk-Kul  representatives of the five countries  with thesupport of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  created a standing seminar on stable developmentfor Central Asia.Kyrgyzstan and other Central Asian countriessupported with great enthusiasm the unconditional andindefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treatyat the 1995 Conference on that Treaty. Along withUzbekistan  my country calls for establishing Central Asiaas a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It is our firm wish tofinalize work on the agreement on a comprehensive test-ban treaty no later than 1996 and to make the moratoriumon nuclear testing universal and permanent.Free economic and trade zones have becomeefficient instruments in speeding up trade anddevelopment among countries and continents. To makethe world a safer place  we need other types of zones: notjust non-nuclear but “non-conflict” zones. Central Asiacould become such a testing ground.The lessons of the last decade require focused andcompassionate attention from the United Nations and theworld community in general on countries in transitionsuch as Kyrgyzstan. The United Nations and itsorganizations — UNDP  the United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF)  the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA)  the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World HealthOrganization (WHO) — although sometimesoverwhelmed by the unprecedented nature and scope ofproblems such as those of refugees  natural disasters degradation of the environment  illegal drug traffickingand the spread of AIDS  deserve a great deal of credit forhelping us to solve severe social problems in this difficulttransition period. It is not only professional officemanagers who work there  but true implementators ofreforms. World forums of the United Nations — fromCairo to Copenhagen  from Beijing to the Habitat IIConference scheduled to be held in Istanbul — bind ustogether in the United Nations in understanding themagnitude of the social problems confronting humanity.Implementing their decisions will require enthusiasm anda huge concentration of effort. The most important thingnow is action — the political will of Member States togo forward— effective international monitoring and“glasnost”.The participation of women in all thesetransformations is of critical importance. The world in thetwenty-first century means equal rights for men andwomen  for my son and my daughter  my daughter andmillions of other young girls and women in Central Asia to be married in accordance with their own choice anddesires  to have unrestricted access to education andemployment  to be elected to Parliament and to work atall levels of government. It is for the sake of these goalsthat I am tirelessly working today.18We welcome the intention and determination of thePresident for this session  His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral of Portugal  personally to lead the activities ofa High-level Open-ended Working Group to report on thesubject of reform to the General Assembly at its fiftiethsession. We  the Member States of the United Nations expect not only thorough and precise reports  but seekconcrete  genuine reforms and changes.Kyrgyzstan favours an enlargement of the SecurityCouncil  while bearing in mind the need for appropriateregional balance. Germany and Japan  in our view  deserveto be elected to the Council as permanent members. Beingamong the biggest contributors to the United Nationsbudget  they are playing an ever-increasing role instrengthening peace and promoting development anddemocracy. It is also necessary to increase the number ofnon-permanent Security Council members.The world at the end of the twentieth century is ascomplicated and multi-faceted as we are — peoples andcountries on six continents who are burdened with theirdaily problems and worries  their dreams and concerns.Modern means of communication and speed haveencouraged humankind to feel more united on anunprotected Earth. It is likely that no one would have triedto rule the world if it were a single voting district.The United Nations  empowered by its 185 MemberStates with a clear understanding of its responsibility  iswisely and competently leading us to the new millennium.My country is going forward consciously and confidentlyunder the United Nations banner with a hope for a betterfuture."
"86",3765,"KHM",50,1995,"First of all  I wish toextend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral and his glorious country Portugal  my delegation’s heartfelt congratulations on hiselection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. I am certain that hisleadership talent and experiences will enable us to meet theserious challenges that we face in today’s quickly changingworld. I wish to assure him of our full cooperation.On behalf of the Kingdom of Cambodia  I would liketo join the heads of delegation who have preceded me inthe pleasant task of expressing thanks and admiration to thePresident of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly  Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  for thetremendous contribution he made over the course of aproductive and historic year.The Kingdom of Cambodia wishes also to thank theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisstrong and effective work  which has been so instrumentalin the success of this Organization. We are all aware of theSecretary-General’s great achievement in his handling ofCambodia’s problem. My country is very proud of him.Cambodia now enjoys peace  freedom and democracythanks to the representatives of all the Member States  whohave contributed so much in this peace process with us.Cambodia wishes to pay special tribute to the courage ofthe United Nations peace-keepers who died for peace andfreedom on Cambodian soil alongside thousands of othercompatriots.The Royal Government of Cambodia is working inclose cooperation with the Special Representative of theSecretary-General in Cambodia  the Honourable BennyWidyono. His presence is of the utmost importance toCambodia. He performs his duty with excellence and ishighly commended by the Government and the people ofCambodia.The Kingdom of Cambodia appreciated the work ofthe Honourable Justice Michael Kirby  the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Human Rights inCambodia. Through close cooperation and regularconsultations with him  and the United Nations Centre forHuman Rights  steps are being taken to improve thehuman rights situation in the country. Cambodia however  continues to support the presence and the workof the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. It ismaking valuable contributions to and recommendationsfor the improvement of the overall situation in Cambodia.It is with great honour and pride that I address thisfiftieth session of the General Assembly  for the firsttime  as the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia.The Royal Government today  under the leadership ofboth the First Prime Minister  His Royal Highness PrinceNorodom Ranariddh  and the Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen  is now more than two years old. Itwas the result of a democratic election organized andsupervised by the United Nations. It is a product of themultilateral efforts of the United Nations with the closecooperation of the Cambodian people  under the wiseguidance and leadership of His Majesty King NorodomSihanouk Varman.Through the determination of the Cambodian people the Kingdom of Cambodia today has emerged from along period of destruction and war  with many challengesand opportunities to build a better future. In the past twoyears  the Royal Government has made importantprogress and achieved some of the most important workin nation-building  peace-building and economicdevelopment.After the United Nations-sponsored election in May1993 the two main political parties combined their effortsand formed a coalition Government  which has shownitself to be able to work closely in an efficient manner.These achievements were only possible with the supportand assistance of the international community.With peace-building  Cambodia has furtherconsolidated sustainable peace  security and stability which are the necessary conditions for economicdevelopment and nation-building. We have been dealingwith the task of reforming the military  the police and the11administration for some time now  in order to improve thepublic sectors so that they can serve the needs and interestsof the Cambodian people and the private sector. At thesame time  the Royal Government and the NationalAssembly are working very closely together to makeCambodia a State based on the rule of law. Cambodia isnow concentrating more effort  time  energy and funds onnation-building and economic development. In this respect Cambodia is a nation in the making.On the economic front  Cambodia is working closelywith international financial institutions  particularly theWorld Bank  the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  theAsian Development Bank and the Caisse Française pour leDeveloppement to ensure that the process of rehabilitationand transition to a market economy is well under way.Despite some difficulties during the period immediatelyfollowing the elections  progress in economic developmentthus far is very encouraging. According to the latest reportfrom the IMF  dated 15 September 1995 “The improved financial discipline has led to anincreasingly stable economic environment  as isevident in the stability of the exchange rate after thewide fluctuations of previous years.”For the period from 1995 to 1997 the Kingdom ofCambodia is targeting a 7 per cent growth rate. Theinflation rate was brought down from 200 per cent for theperiod before the election to 31 per cent in 1993 and to 18per cent in 1994. An inflation rate of below 10 per cent hasbeen projected for 1995. These improvements are linked tothe pursuit of structural reforms in the financial sector  civilservice  military and public enterprises. It is important tonote here that a privatization law was adopted in December1994  and private investments approved and formalized bythe Council for the Development of Cambodia from August1994 to May 1995 are estimated at $2.5 billion  comparedto $621 million of private investment approved during the1991 to 1993 period.The Royal Government is pleased to inform you  Sir and the Assembly that the National Programme toRehabilitate and Develop Cambodia has made greatprogress in articulating the Government’s overall andsectoral policies and programmes.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)First Country Programme for Cambodia for 1994-1995 hashelped establish three important priorities: first modernizing and restructuring the country; secondly poverty alleviation and sustainable management of theenvironment; and  thirdly  natural resources.In this regard  Cambodia wishes to thank theSecretary-General for his appeal for the implementationof the Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries for the 1990s  especially for the five mainobjectives: first  the lifting of the debt burden; secondly a greater flow of finance to the least developed countries(LDCs); thirdly  a more favourable trade environment forthe LDCs; fourthly  encouragement for partnership inLDCs; and  fifthly  a proper infrastructure within LDCs.The economic and financial situation in Cambodia isevolving positively  and the performance criteriasubscribed to by the Government with internationalorganizations have been achieved. While these are goodsigns for improving the economic situation in Cambodia poverty is still a major problem  particularly in ruralareas  where development is moving at a slower pace.Rural development has been hampered in some parts ofthe country by the continuing problem of landmines. Withinternational and bilateral assistance  the Cambodian MineAction Centre is working towards making Cambodia alandmine-free country. It will take time  effort andsupport from the international community to accomplishthat task.This year the Kingdom of Cambodia has officiallyacceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia. It has become an observer member in theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and isnow a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).Cambodia is actively engaged in improving andexpanding ties with all countries throughout the world.Since 1993  with its open door policy and the policy ofpositive engagement  Cambodia has rejoined thecommunity of nations and is working closely with othersto promote world peace and international security. So farthe Kingdom of Cambodia has established diplomaticrelations with 87 countries from all continents.Cambodia has also taken steps towards fullintegration into ASEAN. As an observer member ofASEAN  Cambodia may participate in important ASEANmeetings. In December this year Cambodia will for thefirst time participate in the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok Thailand. Cambodia welcomed Vietnam’s fullmembership of ASEAN  Lao aspirations to become a fullmember by 1997 and Myanmar’s accession to the Treatyof Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia  to become12an observer  and looks to the day when all the countries ofSouth-East Asia form an ASEAN-10. At the same time Cambodia welcomes the recent positive trends in thecontinuing development and growth of the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation (APEC). While sustainableeconomic development and growth are crucial for us all  itis important that development works to further enhancepeace and stability for the whole world. The long-termsolution being widespread economic development Cambodia wishes to assure the Assembly of its support forthe newly created World Trade Organization.I turn to the question of world peace and internationalsecurity. Cambodia is very concerned about the situation inAfghanistan. We support a peaceful settlement of theconflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia.Continuing war in these countries will have seriousrepercussions on international security.Cambodia warmly welcomed the major agreementconcluded between Israel and the Palestinians on Sunday 24 September 1995. We support and encourage thecontinuing efforts of the Israeli and Palestinian people tobuild peace  freedom and harmony between them.Cambodia is very happy to see that Mrs. Aung SanSuu Kyi  leader of the National League for Democracy ofMyanmar  was freed last July by the State Law and OrderRestoration Council. We welcome this latest move byMyanmar.We note with great concern the role of the UnitedNations peace-keepers. Ten years ago they numbered only4 000  but now  as new conflicts pop up like mushrooms their number has risen to over 70 000. A new situation hasalso emerged wherein the credibility of the peace-keepersis constantly being challenged. We must find a mechanismto strengthen the role of the peace-keepers and give thembetter support and protection against the evil forces that areout to weaken and destroy them. It is in this context thatwe applaud the new role assigned to the peace-keepers inBosnia and Herzegovina. We pray for the success of thepeace talks  led by the distinguished American diplomatRichard Holbrooke  between Croatia  Bosnia andHerzegovina and the Bosnian Serbs.The subject of the United Nations Conference onWomen  held in Beijing this year  was very timely. Sincethe formation of the Provisional Government in June 1993 Cambodia has been conscious of the rights of women.Cambodia now has in the Government a NationalSecretariat for Women’s Affairs  which promotes greaterrecognition of the roles of women in society. The RoyalGovernment sent a delegation of women  headed by HerRoyal Highness Princess Marie Norodom Ranariddh  toBeijing.With regard to nuclear testing  as a Party to theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  Cambodiastrongly supports a ban on all nuclear testing around theworld. As we have just concluded the 1995 Review andExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  nuclear testsanywhere  whether atmospheric or underground  are ofmajor concern for all of us in terms of the health  safetyand well-being of humankind. The Kingdom of Cambodianotes with satisfaction that progress is being made on thecomprehensive test-ban treaty  and we applaud theagreement that has been reached on the mandate withregard to the production of fissile materials for weapons.We are very happy to see the encouraging sign from theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inaugmenting application of the NPT’s safeguardsprovisions.As one of the founding members of the Non-AlignedMovement  Cambodia looks forward with greatenthusiasm to participating in the ninth SummitConference of Heads of State or Government ofNon-Aligned Countries  to be held this year in Cartagenade Indias  Colombia.We applaud the professional skill and chairmanshipof His Excellency President Soeharto of the Republic ofIndonesia during the last three years  as leader of theNon-Aligned Movement.Cambodia is very happy to welcome the nextChairman of our Movement  His Excellency PresidentErnesto Samper  President of the Republic of Colombia.My delegation wishes to assure him that he will receivethe fullest cooperation from Cambodia. We are convincedthat he will  in a very spirited way  keep our Movementin the international agenda spotlight.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of thisimportant Organization  an Organization that we shouldall be proud of  Cambodia calls for the strengthening andenhancement of the role of the United Nations  and urgesthat we move towards global peace-building and harmony.Remember that our Organization was built on the veryidea of preventing and ending all conflicts and sufferings and remember also that this same idea was made possible13in the case of Cambodia. Cambodia  I am very proud tosay  is one of the success stories of our Organization."
"87",3808,"KNA",50,1995,"As wecommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations it is indeed an honour for me to address this distinguishedAssembly. I take pride in conveying to it fraternal andcordial greetings from the new Labour Government and thepeople of Saint Kitts and Nevis.The United Nations has made noticeable progressand important strides during the past five decades throughsheer determination  assiduity and the unrelenting faith ofits Members. This is faith in an Organization that hasbeen able to balance the interests of the weak with thoseof the strong  faith in our collective will to preservedemocracy  promote peace and improve the quality of lifefor all our peoples. The occasion of the convening of thishistoric session of the United Nations General Assemblyprovides an important impetus to galvanize ourGovernments to reaffirm our commitment to the causes ofworld peace  international security and development. Thisfaith represents the very essence of what we celebrate notonly this year  but every year as well.Fifty years ago a few men of great courage andvision cast aside national differences to come together toplant new seeds of hope in a future that would one daybear fruit for humankind to enjoy. The historic legacy ofcooperation and partnership that triumphed overindividualism should burn like an eternal flame in ourminds  serving to remind us all that peace  one of themost precious of commodities  is not ours to squander but merely on loan to us. We have a solemnresponsibility to pass it on to future generations. TheGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis salutes thosevisionaries of half a century ago and thanks them for therich legacy bequeathed to us all.I wish to join other delegations in expressingwarmest congratulations and good wishes to you  Sir  ournew President  elected to preside over the Assembly inthis landmark year in the history of the United Nations.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to assureyou  Mr. President  of its continued cooperation andsupport. We are confident that your presidency will bemarked by adroit leadership  which will ensure a successfuloutcome to these deliberations.On behalf of my Government  I am pleased to expressgratitude to the outgoing president  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  for his diligence and ableguidance in a year characterized by varying degrees ofpolitical turmoil and other serious challenges.I salute the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tenacious leadership  hisgoodwill  and his diplomatic skills par excellence  whichhave been tested with great frequency since he took officea few years ago. My Government congratulates theSecretary-General on the outstanding manner in which hehas carried out the mandates of the Organization withregard to peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts. As ournations continue to work together to build a better futurefor our peoples  I wish to assure him of my Government’scontinued cooperation  support and goodwill.As regards human rights  my Government is of theview that  as an international fraternity of nations  we findit incumbent on us all to remember that every single humanbeing has an inalienable right to freedom  to the pursuit ofhappiness and to a better standard of life.The sanctity of human life is not negotiable; it isparamount. My Government remains steadfast in its ownefforts  and supports those of the United Nations to protectand preserve human rights.I now call attention to the question of representativedemocracy. The Government of Saint Kitts and Neviswarmly welcomes the unprecedented pace of democraticreforms taking place around the world. However  we areconcerned with the growing complexities of recurrentproblems and the emergence of new and more complicatedones which still pose serious threats to world peace andinternational security.Consequently  my delegation commends the resolve ofthe United Nations and its willing leadership to steerMember States along a steady and purposeful coursethrough the turbulent seas of political upheavals.It is encouraging to see that  despite obvious problems democracy continues to spring up in the far-flung cornersof the world. This should propel us to channel ourcollective energies into ensuring that those peoples stillyearning for a taste of freedom will one day come toexperience the triumph of democracy.The Caribbean breathed a sigh of relief when thehorrid spectre of dictatorship was removed from theHaitian landscape. Finally  the people of Haiti can beginto harvest the rewards of peace as they proceed to builda lasting and viable democracy.At present the Caribbean and Latin America enjoya period of relative peace and the rule of law. We wishfor this to continue infinitely. It is certainly not myintention to be the harbinger of doom. However  wecannot afford to take this situation for granted  becausehistory bears frightening and credible witness to the factthat political instability and poverty in areas wheredemocracy is fragile  tend to form a treacherous alliance.Democracy as a mere concept  without the requisitesupport of infrastructural development and institution-building  cannot survive. In order for democracy toremain viable in countries which are unaccustomed to itand/or which suffer from high or increasing levels ofpoverty  democracy should be buttressed with theappropriate support systems.My Government firmly believes that the UnitedNations is a people’s Organization. Therefore  we theMembers should impress upon the poor masses  which areoften easily led and misled  that democracy works  that itcan work for them  and that eventually  if given a chance it will deliver the political and material benefits theyrequire to improve their lives.I wish to state here clearly that my Government isnot appealing for hand-outs. On the contrary  we appealfor a reliable hand of genuine cooperation andpartnership. Because our countries share a common worldcommunity  with common concerns and interests  weshould become our brother’s keeper. Failure to worktogether effectively means that we foreclose thepossibility of learning from the past  and at the sametime  we shall be burning the bridges to the future  builtwith selfless courage by our predecessors.It appears that whenever we succeed in solving onemajor problem another more complicated one is foistedupon us. The post-cold-war world has given way to there-emergence of agonizing  old ethnic tensions  worseninglevels of poverty and widening economic inequalitieswhich  together  continue to force their way to the top of2the international agenda. These new challenges requireinnovative and collective strategies. They requirepartnership.The prevalence and the length of the conflict in theformer Yugoslavia seem to elude attempts at an effectiveand lasting solution. None the less  we support theinternational efforts to find a diplomatic resolution of thisconflict.Therefore  my Government welcomes the timelyinitiatives of the United States Government  which weconsider to be crucial in laying the groundwork for futureprogress in ending the war. Also  we wish to complimentefforts by the United Nations and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to broker a lasting peace in the formerYugoslavia.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis stronglycondemns the outrageous and cowardly acts of genocide “ethnic cleansing” and indiscriminate killing of the innocentand helpless  on all sides in this brutal conflict. It is myGovernment’s sincerest hope that the persons found to beresponsible for these atrocities will be brought to justice.I wish now to turn to another volatile region  theMiddle East  which has for a long time been one of thelingering trouble spots in world affairs.Times are changing  and in the interest of peace someGovernments in the region have begun to respond to thesechanges by taking appropriate steps to reconcile theirdifferences and to ensure that their peoples can livetogether in peace. The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevisapplauds the initiatives of the Government of Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization to rescue peace from theclutches of terrorism and violence. This augurs well forpeace not only in the disputed territories but alsothroughout the Middle East. Further  we urge nations in theregion to respect Israel’s right to exist and to follow thelead of the recent accord reached between the Governmentsof Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan.We hope that other countries in the region will heedthe call of peace and use diplomacy in the pursuit of theirobjectives. Also  we urge all Governments to declare waron terrorism and to make a commitment to its eradication wherever it may lurk. My Government is unambiguous inits belief that an act of terror against any man  anywhere is an act of terror against all mankind  everywhere.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomesthe decision taken last year by the Iraqi Government torecognize the State of Kuwait. Kuwait’s territorialintegrity and sovereignty must be maintained. We alsocall on the Government of Iraq to comply with all UnitedNations resolutions and to release all Kuwaiti nationalsdetained illegally in Iraq.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis isconvinced that the United Nations is about people.Consequently  we expect this Organization to advance thecauses of all our peoples. To achieve this  however Member Governments must fulfil their obligations to theOrganization so that it can function more effectively. Atthe same time  the United Nations has to accept that it isaccountable to its vast membership. Also  MemberGovernments and the Organization should seek toreconcile this critical relationship and work more closelyin the future to devise new approaches to problem-solving  development and security. The time has come forus to change the way we do business. Our Government isin favour of the reform of the Security Council to reflectthe current configuration of world affairs.I should like to focus the Assembly’s attention onthe question of membership. As we all are well aware one of the fundamental principles of this Organization isthat of universality of membership. My Governmentperceives the United Nations as a people’s organization;therefore  we believe that Member States will appreciatethe need to consider the timely readmittance of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to this body. TheGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis maintains that thatcountry’s 21 million inhabitants have the right to beappropriately represented in this Organization. Taiwancontinues to comply with international law and has takendue steps to ensure the democratization of its politics andrespect for and protection of human rights.I now wish to refer to the important subjects of first  the vulnerability of small island States and secondly  sustainable development. Although these issuesare not new  my Government remains convinced that theinternational community cannot afford to forget them. Wecommend the United Nations for hosting a Conferencelast year in Barbados to address these crucial issues.However  we need to go further. This will requirepartnership  cooperation and resolve from both developingand developed nations.Many small island nations are painfully aware of thepotential dangers that environmental degradation holds for3small island States like Saint Kitts and Nevis. Some ofthese dangers are: rising sea levels  coastal erosion  seapollution and natural disasters. These problems are easilycompounded  because small island States with limitedresources  such as those in the Caribbean  lack the financialand technological capabilities to deal with them.The environmental vulnerability of small island Statesis intricately interwoven with our economic dependency andopenness to external forces. My delegation thereforeappeals to the international financial community to reviewits policies on concessional lending to small island States.Statistics can be quite misleading. The tendency tojudge a country and its people’s development based onfigures such as per capita income quite easily distort theobjective reality of our situation.Just last month  for example  Saint Kitts and Neviswas ravaged by two hurricanes. Unfortunately  the passageof the first was sufficient to disrupt seriously the daily livesof my people  to destroy the physical infrastructure  and toundermine severely the economic life of both islands. Mycountry’s main export crop  sugar  was almost completelywiped out  and prospects for the 1996 sugar harvest arediscouraging. Further  my country’s main hospital sufferedextensive damage  placing the health of the people of SaintKitts and Nevis at great risk. I take this opportunity tothank the international community for the quick response inproviding emergency relief to the people of Saint Kitts andNevis.This  first and foremost  is the reality of small islandStates. It is this reality — not cold statistics — that shouldinform world policies towards them.Returning to the subject of the environment  mydelegation puts forward the view that  to a large extent  ourislands have inherited problems that are not always of ourown making. This is not meant to lay blame. On thecontrary  we wish to suggest that all countries takeappropriate measures to reduce the possibility ofenvironmental degradation and that those in a position tohelp in environmental protection lend assistance to thoseunable to do so.My delegation makes a fervent appeal to thedeveloped world not to link the granting of developmentassistance to guarantees of environmental protection fromdeveloping countries. Instead  we propose a much closerand more constructive working relationship aimed atcreating more meaningful  long-term strategies to solveenvironmental problems.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevisvehemently condemns attempts by some countries to usethe waterways of the Caribbean as a transshipment lanefor their toxic and hazardous wastes. Clearly  this regionsuffers from a high vulnerability index. We thereforecannot afford any increase in this index.We call on countries responsible to find safer andmore appropriate means of dealing with their toxic andhazardous waste.Saint Kitts and Nevis categorically supports theindefinite  unconditional extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and weanxiously await the successful conclusion of negotiationson a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Also  we urge allnations to impose a ban on nuclear tests.With regard to women in development  we applaudthe convening of the Fourth World Conference onWomen in Beijing to examine issues affecting womenthroughout the world. We appeal to Member States to gobeyond the conference halls and to make genuine effortsto promote the interests of women. The protection ofhuman rights and the pursuit of sustainable developmentcannot be viewed as distinct from the development ofwomen and their rights. They must go hand in hand.Women play a central and critical role in the processof development. Their contributions should be recognizedand rewarded appropriately. My Government iscommitted to further legislation to eliminate genderdiscrimination and to institute policies that address theinequalities that women face.We also have a duty to protect the lives of ourchildren and to ensure that we provide them withadequate protection for their individual growth and futureprosperity. We hold their future in trust  and we thereforehave a sacred responsibility to them  as well as to futuregenerations.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis stronglycondemns any form of discrimination and violence againstwomen and children. We urge all Governments to wagewar on the barbarism of child prostitution  infanticide andabortion on discovery that the foetus is female. The rightto life is fundamental  universal and sacred.4In conclusion  the catalogue of problems confrontingour nations bears ample testimony to the tremendous tasksahead of us. Our countries share common goals such as thepursuit of peace  world security  and better standards ofliving for all our peoples.Our predecessors have sown the seeds  and today wecelebrate their legacy. My Government is convinced that wecan achieve our individual goals by working collectively.And indeed we can. I know we can. Most importantly  weowe it to those who elected us  as well as to those who willfollow.As we  the peoples of the world  celebrate our pastachievements  let us resolve to achieve even greatersuccesses in the years ahead."
"88",3834,"KOR",50,1995,"Mr.President  congratulations on your assumption of thepresidency of this historic fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. Leadership has never beenmore critical to this Organization  and we are most gratefulfor the able work of your predecessor  Foreign MinisterAmara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  and of the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.We stand at the threshold of a new era  a time of greatperil and magnificent promise. The choices that we makein the coming weeks and months could rejuvenate theUnited Nations for a new century of cooperation andprogress  or they could consign the world body to years ofstagnation  decline  and irrelevance. Neither path isinevitable  and none of the United Nations shortcomings areirreparable. The choice is ours.The world  like the United Nations  is in a period oftransition and flux. Virulent local conflicts in severalregions are being met with global cooperation to contain theviolence  assist the victims and mend the political andeconomic fabric of the shattered societies. During this pastweek alone  patient and firm diplomacy has yieldedencouraging results in the Middle East and the formerYugoslavia  two areas known more for conflict thancompromise. In some places  however  gross violations ofhuman rights and genocide are being committed  even asgreat strides are taken globally by way of strengtheninginternational law and human rights standards  most recentlythrough the Fourth World Conference on Women. As thefields of communications  trade and technology haveexpanded to global proportions  interdependence hasbecome a fact of life.In a world of change  no institution — least of all theUnited Nations — can afford to stand still. The world body after all  is an experiment. Launched by leaders of vision foresight  and courage at another historic turning point halfa century ago  the United Nations has steadfastly stood forchange through peaceful means  for cooperation overconflict  and for hope over despair. Today  we have beencalled upon to reinvent the world Organization to meet thechallenges of the twenty-first century  while we recommitourselves to its founding  and enduring  principles.There is little doubt that this is a time of testing forthe United Nations  but really it is the Member States — all185 of us — that are being challenged as never before. Itis our collective will  commitment  and inspiration — orlack thereof — that will determine the fate of history’sgreatest experiment in international organization. Ourresponsibilities begin with paying our financial obligationsin full and on time  but they run much deeper and wider.The Republic of Korea recognizes that the time has comefor far-reaching reform in the way the United Nationsconducts its business and structures its programmes.Korea gladly joins the many other nations to make thishistoric General Assembly session a time of reflection recommitment  and renewal.No dimension of the United Nations work has beenmore severely or dramatically tested than its far-flungpeace operations. All of us owe a debt of gratitude to themen and women from 70 countries whose courage andfortitude have kept the hope of peace alive under the mostdifficult and trying circumstances. We have asked themto accomplish a great deal with very little. If the UnitedNations is to respond effectively to the new forms ofconflict that threaten peace and human security in today’suncertain world  it is imperative that its peace operationsbe strengthened and renovated. We appreciate the ongoingefforts to enhance the preventive diplomacy and rapidreaction capabilities of the United Nations  both withinand outside the framework of the Organization.One of the most promising avenues for bolsteringUnited Nations capabilities is the United Nations stand-byarrangement system  and I would encourage the broadestpossible participation by Member States. Today  myGovernment reaffirms its decision to take part in theUnited Nations stand-by system and its willingness toprovide some 800 men for this effort  including aninfantry battalion  engineering units  medical units andmilitary observers.Since Korea’s first participation in United Nationspeace-keeping operations in Somalia in 1993  when it sentan engineering battalion to the United Nations Operationin Somalia (UNOSOM II)  it has dispatched a medicalunit to the Western Sahara and military observers to boththe United Nations Military Observer Group in India andPakistan (UNMOGIP) in Kashmir and the United NationsObserver Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). I am alsopleased to inform the Assembly that next week a Koreanbridging unit of engineers will arrive in Angola to takepart in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEMIII).My Government is determined to expand itscontributions to the peace-keeping operations of theUnited Nations at a level commensurate with our nationalcapacity.5As one of the troop-contributing countries to UnitedNations peace-keeping operations  we feel a great deal ofconcern over the fact that the number of casualties amongUnited Nations peace-keepers is sharply increasing and thattheir safety is frequently endangered.We firmly believe that hostile acts against UnitedNations personnel  such as armed attack and hostage-taking are absolutely unacceptable and should not go unpunished.While we appreciate efforts for the protection of UnitedNations personnel  such as the conclusion of theConvention on the Safety of United Nations and AssociatedPersonnel  we feel that it is the collective responsibility ofall Member States of the United Nations to ensure thesafety and security of United Nations peace-keepers.The challenges before the United Nations  of course are hardly confined to traditional security concerns. Unrestin many parts of the world serves to remind us of theeconomic  social and political roots of conflict. Unevenpatterns of economic and social development are ofparticular concern.On the positive side  despite a slight decline in growthsince last year  the recent economic recovery of thedeveloped countries and sustained growth in a large numberof developing countries have helped boost the globaleconomy in 1995. Economies in transition have shownencouraging signs of improvement. The overall economicsituation in Africa has also made headway  albeit slow andmodest.However  developing countries  particularly those inAfrica  require the assistance of the internationalcommunity in their developmental efforts. Fostering afavourable external economic environment for them isessential. In this regard  my delegation believes that thedebate in the Economic and Social Council on the theme ofdevelopment in Africa this year was both timely andappropriate.In strengthening its cooperation with developingcountries  particularly with the least developed countries my Government places primary emphasis on humanresources development. We are implementing a plan  whichwas announced by President Kim Young Sam at the WorldSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen  to providetechnical training for over 30 000 people from developingcountries  particularly from the African continent  by theyear 2010.We welcome the fact that the issue of developmentis receiving renewed attention as a pre-eminent globalconcern. My Government is actively participating in theWorking Group of the General Assembly on “An Agendafor Development”. Although the primary responsibility fordevelopment falls on the individual Government  webelieve that national development efforts also require theassistance of the international community.In that spirit  we vigorously support the multilateralefforts to realize sustainable global development. As afollow-up to President Kim’s announcement at theCopenhagen Summit of our intention to increase ourofficial development assistance  we plan to enlarge ourvoluntary contribution to the operational activities of theUnited Nations by 65 per cent next year  and willcontinue such efforts in the coming years.In our view  the Copenhagen Social Summit was amilestone  not only because it laid a sound foundation forinternational assistance and cooperation in the area ofsustainable social development  but also because it charteda clear direction for future action.Women’s issues have also become a key part of theglobal agenda. My Government welcomes the recentdiscussions in Beijing on the enhancement of the status ofwomen and looks forward to the full and earlyimplementation of the plan of action adopted at theConference.The protection and enhancement of human rights arean enduring task. The inalienable and basic rights ofhuman beings must be faithfully protected and preserved.As articulated in the Vienna Declaration  the primaryresponsibility for protecting human rights should be borneby the respective Government. However  it should also benoted that the cooperation and attention of theinternational community  including the United Nations are paramount to the efforts in this field.Since the inauguration of President Kim Young Samin February 1993  the Government of the Republic ofKorea has placed an especially high priority on thepromotion of democracy and human rights. TheGovernment has ardently supported the democratizationprocess and has successfully taken various reformmeasures to promote human rights in the country. Ishould like to take this opportunity to express my6Government’s deep concern over the human rights situationin North Korea. As my Government strongly believes thatthe people in North Korea  as our kindred  should enjoy thefundamental human rights to which all of us are entitled we urge Pyongyang to respond positively to theinternational calls for the protection of human rights especially through opening its society.An outstanding and emotional dimension of this issueis the division of families on the Korean Peninsula. Duringthe Korean War  in 1950 to 1953  10 million people wereseparated from their families. Most were never to hear fromeach other again  because even the exchange of letters wasprohibited between the two Koreas. Even after the war hundreds of South Koreans were forcibly taken to NorthKorea against their will  leaving behind families grievingover separation and anguished by the uncertainty of whetherthe other members were still alive. I believe that it is hightime for the community of nations  particularly the UnitedNations  to render its assistance and do its part for thesedivided families so that they may at least hear from eachother until they are finally reunited.Turning to the issue of disarmament  I would like totake this occasion to declare  on behalf of my Government a one-year moratorium  which may be extended  on theexport of anti-personnel land-mines. We hope that ourdecision will strengthen the international efforts to limit theproliferation of land-mines and to end their indiscriminateuse.Considering the continued importance of theConference on Disarmament as a unique negotiating forumfor disarmament  my delegation welcomes the decision onexpansion of membership of the Conference  adopted byconsensus at its plenary meeting a week ago. We hope thatthe countries of the Group of 23 that wish to participate inthe Conference will be given full-fledged membership atthe earliest possible date.The Republic of Korea  as one of the originalsignatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993 has taken steps to ratify the Convention with a view tosupporting the international endeavours to prohibit andeliminate all types of weapons of mass destruction. As weall recognize  universal adherence to the Convention is anessential step towards securing an effective non-proliferation regime in this area. The Republic of Koreatherefore strongly urges those countries  including theDPRK  which have not yet joined the Convention to do soas soon as possible.In our efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclearweapons  the indefinite extension of the Non-ProliferationTreaty (NPT) by consensus last May was a watershedevent. We urge the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil theirresponsibilities under the NPT to make the world nuclear-free. In this regard  my delegation joins the call of manyother countries for the early conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty  a global agreement whichwould undoubtedly help facilitate the eventual eliminationof nuclear weapons as envisaged in the NPT.In the same spirit  it is deeply regrettable that somecountries with nuclear weapons are still engaged innuclear testing. On behalf of the Government and peopleof the Republic of Korea  I would like to urge thosenations with future plans for testing to cancel themwithout delay.My delegation strongly endorses the efforts tostrengthen the safeguards system of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We believe that thefuture of the NPT also depends upon cooperation betweenStates in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In thisregard  we believe that the legitimate demands of the non-nuclear States to promote the peaceful uses of nuclearenergy should be duly respected and that resolutemeasures should be taken against those States that fail tofulfil their obligations under the IAEA safeguards system.The North Korean nuclear issue remains aparamount security concern for North-East Asia and theworld. The Republic of Korea urges North Korea onceagain not only to comply with its NPT obligations andIAEA safeguards in a full and complete manner  but alsofaithfully to implement the Geneva Agreed Frameworkbetween the United States and the DPRK of October1994. Furthermore  North Korea should live up to itscommitments and obligations under the Joint Declarationon Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.Maintaining peace and stability on the KoreanPeninsula is not just an issue affecting 70 millionKoreans  but also a strategic issue with criticalimplications for the North-East Asia region and the worldat large. Accordingly  we believe that the currentarmistice agreement must be kept in force until apermanent peace mechanism is set in place. With a viewto dealing with all inter-Korean issues  my Governmentearnestly hopes that the North Korean leadership willrespond positively to our call for inter-Korean dialogueand cooperation.7As I noted at the outset  the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations provides a unique opportunity for theinternational community to revitalize  strengthen and reformthe United Nations system. To this end  a number ofproposals  studies and reports have been put forward. MyGovernment is closely following the constructivediscussions which have been conducted thus far in theworking groups of the General Assembly seeking ways toaugment the effectiveness  efficiency and democracy of theOrganization.As for the Security Council  we are of the view thatin reforming it account should be taken first and foremostof the need for equitable geographical representation in itsmembership and enhanced transparency and efficiency in itsworking methods. Given the utmost importance of the issueand its implication for other issues  we will remain flexibleand open-minded to various ideas and suggestions andmake due contributions to the process of consensus-building. We also believe that the coordinating role of theEconomic and Social Council should be strengthened particularly in the area of operational activities.On the financial aspect of the United Nations  it isalarming to note that the total amount of unpaidassessments is well over $3.5 billion. An effective solutionto the current financial difficulties should be found in orderto meet the increasing demands of the United Nations andto strengthen it. It is in this context that we again urge allMember States to pay their assessed contributions on timeand in full.In order for reform to be successful  however  it iscrucial to secure a broad consensus among Member States.We must not forget that consolidated political will  mutualconfidence and a sense of common interest and benefitamong Member States are key elements in the process ofreform. In this spirit  reform begins at home  inrededicating ourselves to the community of interests andprinciples that serve to unite the disparate nations of theworld.In three weeks  in this Hall  the leaders of more than150 nations — three times as many as met in San Franciscoa half-century ago — will reaffirm their commitment to theideals and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.As the nations and peoples of the world reflect uponwhat the United Nations has achieved in its first half-century and what it should aspire to in the years ahead  theRepublic of Korea wishes to renew its determination torender full and unswerving support for the revitalizationof the world body in the years ahead. We believe in thecollective ability of nations to build a safer  moreprosperous and just world  and we are committed to doour part."
"89",3880,"KWT",50,1995,"It gives me great pleasure  on behalf of thedelegation of Kuwait  to convey to Mr. Diego Freitas doAmaral our sincere congratulations on his unanimouselection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. We have no doubt that his election istestimony to his expertise and skills  which will guaranteethe able stewardship of this historic session. I assureMr. Freitas do Amaral of the support and cooperation ofthe delegation of the State of Kuwait.I take this opportunity to commend the President ofthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session  HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister of Foreign Affairsof Côte d’Ivoire  for his significant contribution to thework of this world body as well as for the wisdom hedemonstrated as he presided over the deliberations of thelast session.Let me also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his immenseefforts to streamline the structure and operations of theUnited Nations with an eye to the constantly changingmodern world. Also  I should like to put on recordKuwait’s support for the proposals put forward by theSecretary-General in his programme of action to deal withpotential crises  the use of preventive diplomacy and themodalities of peacemaking and peace-building. In thiscontext  special mention should be made of the Secretary-General’s annual report on the work of the Organization which demonstrates incisive vision combined with adispassionate and in-depth analysis of the challengesfacing the United Nations. The report outlines in aresponsible fashion the failures suffered in some of theactivities and operations undertaken by the Organization.Next month  a great number of Heads of States orGovernments will come to New York City to celebratethe fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the UnitedNations. This massive presence will reflect a genuinebelief in the role of the United Nations in building aworld founded on justice  equality  coexistence andcooperation  free of tension and aggression. Their12statements in this Assembly Hall will no doubt define theirvision of the tasks the United Nations should undertake their hopes for the ideal way of life that should prevail inthe world and their determination to spare no effort inworking for a better world. We cherish the wisdom of thefounding fathers who established an Organization thatembodies mankind’s collective effort and hope in a betterworld that would differ from the world of war and strife which wrought enormous destruction in terms ofgeopolitical entities  property and human life. States weredestroyed and entire human populations were annihilated tosatisfy the capricious whims of individuals who were drivenby greed and hegemony. The scale of sacrifice anddevastation  and the toll in human life caused by thedevelopment of atomic weapons was too immense toignore. In the wake of such destruction  the world’s leaderswere determined to make the Second World War the lastwar the world should ever endure.The signing ceremony of the United Nations Charterin San Francisco was  in a sense  a universal pledge torenounce the use of force  to embrace peaceful coexistenceand to shun the power politics of blackmail and hegemony.Regardless  the world continued to live thereafter in anenvironment that differed from the vision of the foundingfathers of the United Nations. The intense bipolar strife thatfollowed plunged the world in the maelstrom of a cold warthat lasted for some five decades and spawned numerousregional conflicts with which the United Nations dealtwithin the constraints imposed by big Power rivalries. Theinability to act was not due to impotence on the part of theUnited Nations but was the direct result of that bipolarrivalry. Notwithstanding  the Organization did manage todemonstrate its effectiveness in many a peace-keepingoperation it undertook over the past decades and didmanage to pacify many a volatile area.In point of fact  experience has shown  over the pastfew decades  that the presence of the United Nations in theareas of tension did prevent the eruption of conflict and warin several flash points while its absence increased thechances of war. In all this  the United Nations has been atrue reflection of the will of its Member States and  duringthe cold war  it provided a war-prevention mechanism bycreating buffer zones between the belligerents. It waseffective in containing tensions and in creating a climate ofpeaceful negotiation.Over the years  the United Nations system hasdeveloped an array of effective and credible mechanisms and gained wide-ranging experience and undoubtedcredibility that are employed to the common benefit ofmankind. Over the past 50 years  since the adoption of itsCharter  the United Nations has worked consistently togive real meaning to the dream of peoples all over theworld  that of saving“succeeding generations from the scourge of war which ... has brought untold sorrow to mankind” —as expressed in the opening paragraph of the Charter. Inlarge measure  the United Nations has lived up to itsinitial commitment.Once the cold-war chapter was closed  the worldstarted to edge towards rapprochement and meaningfuldialogue. Once the arms race ended  an intensedevelopment-race started. The territorial-gains mentalitygave way to a new commitment to intensive humandevelopment. Thus the new challenge facing our worldnow is the fulfilment of the immediate concerns of thehuman person and his or her right to live in dignity.The world was an arena of rivalry between thesuper-Powers; now it has become a vast battlefield in thewar against poverty and backwardness. The world was abattleground for fighting between various blocs indifferent regions; now many regions are closing ranks ina common effort to combat illiteracy and want. While theworld was the theatre of many a battle  now the worldhas but one battle  that of trying to break loose from thegrip of underdevelopment and backwardness.We in Kuwait were in the forefront of donors fordevelopment. The volume of assistance we offered wasthe highest  in terms of gross national product  becausewe wanted to live in a world dominated by justice  aworld whose hallmark is human compassion  a world inwhich the privileged will reach out towards theunderprivileged without strings attached.Along these lines  Kuwait welcomes the trendtowards the consolidation of relations between membersof the family of nations on the basis of equality. We arepart of a common effort to eliminate tensions. We rely onthe collective will of nations to suppress aggression  andon global cooperation to confront underdevelopment.Against this backdrop  we cannot overlook the needfor reform and restructuring inside the United Nationsitself with a view to bringing the system more into linewith these new objectives. In 1945  50 founding MemberStates signed the Charter. Ever since  135 other States13have joined the membership. Regardless  the SecurityCouncil  which is a major organ of the system  has  forexample  retained its original structure — without changeto reflect the enormous expansion in the membership of theUnited Nations. Nor has the Economic and Social Councilshown  as yet  significant improvement in programmedelivery  as dictated by the requirements of moderndevelopment  in the broad sense of such requirements  atthe threshold of the twenty-first century.We call for expanding the membership of the SecurityCouncil in order to enable the larger membership of theUnited Nations to participate in the process of decision-making. The change  which would enhance fairness  shouldbe effected in such a way as to ensure balance between therequirements of efficiency and of expansion. We also callfor more transparency in the Council’s methods of work for this  in our view  would reinforce our sense ofcollective participation and responsibility. We are also infavour of the trend towards better use of the resources ofthose States that can contribute significantly topeace-keeping operations and development activities.The people of Kuwait participate in the celebrations ofthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary with a deep sense ofgratitude to the Organization for its crucial role in liberatingKuwait from occupation. The people of Kuwait recognizethe firm resolve of the world community in rejectingaggression and its commitment to putting an end tooccupation. We cherish the determination displayed in theseries of successive resolutions adopted by the SecurityCouncil from the second day of August 1990  when thepeople of Kuwait  together with the rest of the world  weretaken by surprise by the sneak invasion of the State ofKuwait by Iraq. That naked aggression was committed intotal violation of the principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations and international treaties. Beyond Kuwait  theinvasion totally shattered the security and stability of theentire Gulf region.In facing up to that blatant aggression  the UnitedNations did indeed live up to its principles and was true toits mission. It did indeed stand firm in upholding justiceand in defending the victim.Building on the Kuwait experience  it is our hope thatthe critical role that the United Nations can play will befully utilized to further consolidate the underpinning ofpeace and to safeguard security and stability. The UnitedNations system can indeed provide deterrence in the face ofthose regimes that harbour schemes of aggression. There isa full range of measures and restrictions that the UnitedNations can put in place to ensure the isolation andcurtailment of those aggressive regimes and  if need be to strip them of their stockpiles of weapons that can beused in committing aggression.The ultimate goal of the United Nations is to ensureequality  mutual respect amongst Member States andrespect for the will of peoples. This would be conduciveto peaceful coexistence among nations and would createa favourable atmosphere allowing freedom of choice in ademocratic climate  where the stronger cannot dominatethe weaker  nor can a big country exploit a smallneighbour  nor one party assume a privileged role to thedetriment of others.Over a long period — since the end of the Gulfwar — the Iraqi regime has continued to claim that it hasfulfilled all its obligations under all Security Councilresolutions relating to the situation between Iraq andKuwait  especially resolutions 687 (1991) and 715 (1991) and thus blamed the Security Council and the SpecialCommission for the delay in lifting the sanctions imposedon Iraq. The Chairman and staff of the SpecialCommission  as well as the Security Council itself  havebeen harshly and offensively criticized by senior Iraqiofficials and the regime-controlled media.In view of the recent dramatic surprises thatunfolded in regard to the Iraqi armament programmes  athoroughly legitimate set of questions arises — namely:Does the Iraqi regime have any more credibility? Whoamongst us would be willing to accept Iraq’s statementsat face value? Who would believe its claims  echoed atevery gathering or forum  that it had met its obligations?What about Kuwaiti property and military hardwarelooted from Kuwait? Who can go along with Iraq’sassertions regarding Kuwaiti and third-country prisonersand hostages?The tragedy of Kuwaiti and other prisoners held byIraq remains unresolved four years after the liberation ofKuwait. This is due to the intransigence andprocrastination of the Iraqi regime  which continues tosidestep a straightforward and genuine resolution of thishuman tragedy. This represents a failure on the part ofIraq to fulfil its commitments under paragraph 30 ofSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991)  which demandsthat Iraq should cooperate fully with the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross.Accordingly  Kuwait reiterates its appeal  to theSecurity Council in particular and to the world14community in general  to continue to bring pressure to bearon Iraq  in a bid to bring this painful episode to an end.Iraq’s false claims and lies that it is sincere in its efforts toclose this case should be met with a firm stand. Indeed  thiswas the only course of action that forced Iraq in the firstplace to cooperate with the Special Commission.Iraq must recognize that participation in the meetingsof the Tripartite Commission and its sub-committee is notan end in itself. The purpose of these meetings is to securethe freedom of prisoners and to account for the missingpersons. The litmus test of Iraq’s cooperation in this area isthe number of persons released or accounted for. Mereattendance at those meetings is an exercise in subterfuge intended by Iraq to mislead world public opinion and tocircumvent its obligations.The final objective of Kuwait’s overall policy is toensure security and stability in our region. This goal willremain elusive unless and until Iraq implements fully andunconditionally all relevant Security Council resolutions.We are aware of the difficulties endured by the Iraqipeople. However  the responsibility for the suffering of theIraqis lies squarely on the regime itself which wastedvaluable time since April 1991 in pursuing a futile courseof prevarication  deception  suppression of data andmisinformation in regard to every area of its mandatoryobligations.The most recent events came to confirm oursuspicions and fears  namely  the disclosure of thepossession by Iraq of an arsenal of prohibited weapons ofmass destruction  which were being prepared for use againstpeoples of the region without heed for the potential massiveloss of human life.In the meantime  let me take this occasion to set onrecord that Kuwait affirms the need to maintain the unityand territorial integrity of Iraq. In view of the hardshipsfaced by the Iraqi people  Kuwait has moved to send through the Kuwait Red Crescent Society  food and medicalsupplies to the Iraqi civilian population in areas borderingIran and in Northern Iraq. We will continue to pursue thispolicy on humanitarian grounds.In the context of international endeavours to bringabout just  durable and comprehensive peace in the MiddleEast  Kuwait follows closely the ongoing peace negotiationsbetween the immediate parties. We support the negotiationsprocess. In our view  this process should be anchored in theset of principles agreed upon  namely  full withdrawal inreturn for peace. Also  progress should be made on alltracks of negotiations. And the final peace package shouldbe satisfactory to all sides because this would be the realguarantee of a lasting peace.Kuwait did participate in the multilateral negotiationsbecause we believed that our role within the multilateralswould strengthen the position of the Arab parties engagedin the bilateral talks and would eventually givemomentum to the process as a whole. We fully appreciatethe position of our sister State  Syria  which insists on fullIsraeli withdrawal from occupied Syrian territory in returnfor peace. Israel cannot attain full peace without completewithdrawal.In the same vein  international efforts shouldintensify to ensure full implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 425 (1978) which requiresunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Lebaneseterritory and the exercise by the Lebanese Government ofits sovereignty over all Lebanese territory  including theSouth. In the end  the territorial integrity andindependence of Lebanon must be preserved.Furthermore  Kuwait supports the self-rulenegotiations between the Palestine National Authority andIsrael. In our view  the agreement signed yesterday inWashington  D.C. regarding the expansion of the self-rulearrangements represents an important step in the rightdirection towards the exercise by the people of Palestineof their right to self-determination and the establishmentof their independent State.In this regard  let me recall that Kuwait has pledged$25 million in aid to the development programmesundertaken by international specialized agencies in theself-rule areas. Indeed  Kuwait has started disbursementof funds earmarked for those purposes.Also  we would like to underline the status ofoccupied Al-Quds  given its special significance to thethree heavenly-revealed religions. We emphasize that Al-Quds is Palestinian territory under occupation and shouldas such be subject to the withdrawal conditions underSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967).Kuwait welcomes the recent developments aiming atachieving a fair settlement of the situation in the Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina. We expect such a settlementshould satisfy the behests of international legality and bebased on Security Council resolutions. In the wake oflarge-scale suffering  destruction and displacement  the15people of the region now yearn for an overall settlementthat satisfies the demands of all parties  especially thepeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina who insist onmaintaining their independent State on their own territorywithout any interference from outside. My Governmentvalues the role played by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and the United Nations ProtectionForces (UNPROFOR) in opposing territorial expansion bythe Serbs at the expense of other parties  as well as theactions taken to lift the siege on Sarajevo. It is our hopethat this joint NATO-UNPROFOR action will persist untilthe declared objective is attained  that is  the conclusion ofa final accord that brings security and stability to the wholeregion. It is our sincere hope now that the most recentagreement reached several days ago will be honoured bythe parties to the conflict.Experience has shown that regional groupings andarrangements can play an effective role in addressingcontentious issues that create tension  impact adversely onpeace and security and poison the relations amongst thepeople of a given area. These groups have alsodemonstrated a great sense of commitment in defusing flashpoints of tension that might undermine regional security.A case in point is the experience of the GulfCooperation Council whose member States are firmlyconvinced that understanding among them is crucial insteering away from frictions and tensions. To them dialogue is an essential channel of confidence-buildingamong neighbour States. Since our established policyconsiders negotiations as the only viable means of resolvingdisputes  we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran torespond favourably to the call by the United Arab Emiratesto resolve the problem of the islands occupied by Iran bythe means suggested by the International Court of Justice.Such an approach would indeed reinforce the principle ofunderstanding and negotiations to which we adhere as aprimary component in relations among States.Kuwait is convinced that world peace is indivisibleand that it has far-reaching multiple implications on all ofus. Accordingly  ethnic disputes  tribal wars and factionalconflicts should be addressed as phenomena that can leadto massacres and genocides and to a total collapse of theafflicted communities. Therefore  in this year which marksthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  we ring downthe curtain on the Rwanda tragedy before a solution isfound  nor can we walk away from the catastrophe inSomalia  nor give up hope in the face of enormous odds inAfghanistan. All these remain burning issues despite thefeeling by some Powers that they have moved outside thecircle of global strategic limelight.We call for scaling up the efforts and showing moredetermination in addressing these festering wounds withinthe framework of collective world peace.The burden of debt is a major constraint on thebudget resources of many nations  especially thedeveloping ones. It aggravates their social problems andpushes up unemployment rates to a point where itundermines domestic security and stability and endangersthe lives of millions of people.Back in 1988  His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-AhmadAl-Jaber  Emir of the State of Kuwait  launched from thisrostrum an initiative to write off the foreign debt underwhich many least developed countries were suffering.Those countries have been victims of a complex host offactors that denied them the privilege of a calm life andindeed posed a real threat to their very existence. Kuwait for its part  cancelled all interest on loans to thesecountries in a bid to alleviate their debt burdens. It is ourhope that this approach would be expanded and that thedeveloped nations would cancel the interest on their loansto the developing countries.The dreams of the Charter’s authors stood the test oftime and transcended the tensions and limitations of thecold war. The era of the cold war was characterized bythe stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction to thedetriment of construction needs. It represented a harddrive to acquire the means of annihilation at the expenseof the means of development. Prestige was put ahead ofreal meaningful growth. Human ingenuity was put in theservice of human exploitation rather than in the service ofenhancing human freedoms. That chapter is now over.And we have entered a new epoch in which we have toheed the rational calls for civilized conduct in order tobuild up an atmosphere of genuine brotherhood andharmony. This can only be achieved by our collectiveendeavour that emphasizes our universal identity. Onlythrough such a common effort can we pool together theresources and energy of all peoples  big and small  toachieve a strategic consensus that would translate into areality the dreams envisioned 50 years ago when theCharter was signed."
"90",3926,"LAO",50,1995,"The unanimous election ofMr. Freitas do Amaral to preside over this historic session the fiftieth  of the General Assembly is a well-deservedtribute to his country  Portugal. Aware of his talent and hismany political activities at the national and internationallevels  I venture to believe that under his guidance thissession of the General Assembly will be successful.On this occasion  I also wish to pay tribute to  and tocongratulate  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of our Organization  for his vigorous efforts incarrying out his very responsible functions for themaintenance of peace and for the promotion ofdevelopment throughout the world.The international situation is still complex and in astate of flux. Ethnic  religious and border conflicts stillraging in various parts of our planet continue to haunt theinternational community. Despite numerous efforts toresolve those conflicts  there is no indication that we areanywhere near the goals we have set for ourselves. Bearingin mind past lessons and experiences  we should engage ininformed reflection  undertake appropriate actions and acttogether to find reasonable and peaceful ways to meet thesechallenges. The realities of the world today show that it isnot easy to create an atmosphere where peace and justiceprevail  because this involves a noble  difficult and long-term duty  a duty that requires  at one and the same time patience and resolution  which the international communityas a whole is called upon to provide  is in the interest ofthe nations and the peoples of the world.In Europe  the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina  which has caused great suffering to its people remains without a final solution. The 60-day cease-fireagreement just concluded by the parties involved in thispainful conflict is undoubtedly a new stage in the search fora global peace. This agreement also requires that otherefforts be made  with a maximum of wisdom and restraintand a readiness to restore peace and stability in thisregion of the world.In Africa  after long years of struggle  the apartheidsystem finally has been abolished. Like all other peoplesthat love peace and freedom in the world  the Lao peopleare very happy about this event. We wish ever-greatersuccess to the new South African authorities  under thewise leadership of President Nelson Mandela  in theirtireless efforts to build a new South Africa  united  non-racial  democratic and prosperous.Still on the subject of Africa  the Lao people hopethat the ethnic conflicts and violence still raging in somecountries of the continent will be peacefully resolved inorder to preserve unity and to promote national harmonyand development in their respective countries.In the Caribbean  the overall situation is favourableto the promotion of mutual understanding as well as tothe development cooperation between the countries of thisregion. In this context  the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic believes that it is high time that the economicblockade decreed unilaterally against Cuba be lifted inorder to contribute to the promotion of peace and stabilityand cooperation between the peoples of this region without any discrimination whatsoever.In the Middle East  the conclusion this pastSeptember of the agreement between the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel  which deals with theextension of autonomy to the West Bank region  marks anew  positive step in the implementation of theDeclaration of Principles signed in Washington in 1993.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic hopes that theMiddle East peace process will continue to move ahead in the interest of lasting peace and of cooperation fordevelopment between the peoples of this region.In the Asia-Pacific region  countries of that regionhave exerted many laudable efforts to ensure themaintenance of peace and security and promotion ofcooperation for development. These efforts enjoyincreasing support from the various peoples of the world.The initiative to create a Regional Forum for theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) isanother important gauge of the depth and strength of theconfidence and cooperation in this part of the world.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomesthe positive results of the implementation of the15agreements which have been reached between theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates of America and which have contributed to improvingthe situation in that region. At the same time  the Laopeople fully support the ardent aspirations of the Koreanpeople to the peaceful and independent reunification ofKorea.As an integral part of the community of South-EastAsia  one of the regions recognized for its activities infavour of maintaining peace and cooperation in the regionand in the world  my country  the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic  has made a worthy contribution to that effortdesigned to make that region one of peace  friendship andcooperation as well as a nuclear-weapons-free zone. In itseffort at national construction  my country has also had newsuccess. Last year  the economic-growth rate reached thelevel of 8 per cent. The volume of foreign investment hasincreased  thus contributing to the improvement of the Laopeople’s living conditions. More important still  politicalstability and social order in the country are now solidlyguaranteed. At the present time  the Lao government isworking actively to carry out  under market mechanisms the development strategy to the year 2000  which wouldpromote economic growth along with social development the development of human resources and sustainable ruraldevelopment  while giving great importance toenvironmental protection and the protection of the rightsand the interests of women and children.In the international arena  the Lao Government willcontinue to apply its consistent policy of peace  friendshipand cooperation with all countries. For the time being  it isconcentrating its efforts on establishing the necessaryconditions for it to become  in the near future  a full-fledged member of ASEAN. We hope that the countries ofthat organization  other friendly countries  and internationalorganizations will provide assistance and support for ourefforts.In recent years  the world economic situation as awhole has shown a somewhat positive trend. None the less the majority of the developing countries still face economicdifficulties stemming from many causes. The Lao People’sDemocratic Republic believes  therefore  that in order forinterdependence to be of equal benefit to all  we shouldresume as quickly as possible North-South dialogue inorder to promote cooperation for development. At the sametime  every effort should be made to find the means tosettle as quickly as possible the debt problem of the leastdeveloped countries  in order to create conditionsfavourable to their development.The Government of the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic attaches great importance to the implementationof the Programme of Action adopted by the SocialSummit — the first of its kind — which was held lastMarch in Copenhagen. My Government hopes that theinternational community will work together to implementthat Programme and to promote socioeconomicdevelopment  which would allow mankind to live inconditions of peace  security and justice.The Government of the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic believes that the success of the Fourth WorldConference on Women  held in Beijing this pastSeptember  created a favourable political  economic andsociocultural atmosphere for the full participation ofwomen in development. We will thus continue to promoteand ensure rights to equality between men and women —rights that are clearly specified in our Constitution. Wewill also continue to mobilize and to help the women ofethnic minorities to participate fully in the developmentprocess  as both players and beneficiaries of the fruits ofgrowth.In the current international situation  even thoughEast-West confrontation has ended  mankind none the lesscontinues to be concerned by the danger posed by theexistence of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction. It is imperative that joint  effective measuresbe taken to reduce this danger and eliminate it forever. Inthis context  the Government of the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic supports the initiative of thecountries of South-East Asia to make this region anuclear-weapon-free zone.The question of the promotion of human rights andof fundamental freedoms continues to have a high priorityon the international agenda. In considering this question a large number of countries are concerned at the trend todeal only with the civil and political aspects of humanrights and to use them to interfere in the internal affairsof other countries  which would violate the rights ofpeoples to self-determination. Bearing in mind theintrinsic characteristics of each nation  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic believes that only a global andbalanced approach to this sensitive question would servethe cause of human rights and would meet the legitimateinterests of all peoples.We are meeting today at a time when the UnitedNations is actively preparing to celebrate its fiftiethanniversary. This commemoration should be for us all anunprecedented opportunity to review the Organization’s16performance over the past five decades  with the goal ofenhancing the effectiveness of its role in the economic andsocial development of peoples and in the maintenance ofworld peace. In a new international context  the UnitedNations  and in particular its Security Council  should berestructured and democratized in order to become a reliableand upright body enjoying the confidence of all nations andcapable of solving global problems. In this spirit  thedelegation of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic willcontinue  together with other delegations  to make its activecontribution to the strengthening of our universalOrganization."
"91",3969,"LBN",50,1995,"In a few days the United Nations will be marking the firsthalf-century of its existence. This historic occasion  whichthe world with its different races  ethnic groups  religions and creeds will celebrate  will reach its peak here atUnited Nations Headquarters  where world leaders andHeads of State will meet.This occasion  while it should reaffirm the need forthe United Nations  and underline its importance and theimportance of its principles  objectives  and activities will  at the same time  pose certain questions about thecurrent state of the Organization and where it standstoday. Such questions must be viewed in the context ofthe principles that governed the establishment of theUnited Nations and the objectives it was meant toachieve. For it must be recalled that mankind wanted theUnited Nations to be an enterprise for peace  harmony solidarity  dialogue  and rapprochement amongst peoplesand cultures of the world.Through this legitimate dream  mankind sought tobuild an edifice for rights  justice and peace. The UnitedNations was meant to be an arbiter  a forum where peoplecould seek to defend their rights whenever they aredenied  and to redress injustice whenever oppressionprevails. By establishing the United Nations  humanity4wanted to put an end to the era of war and to open the doorto peace  national sovereignty  independence  and territorialintegrity  and to protect peoples’ freedom of choice.In the era of the communications and transportationrevolution  when political  economic  demographic  securityand cultural barriers are lowered  people need the UnitedNations more than ever. They need a forum for constructivedialogue and an effective and permanent mechanism forconsultation  cooperation  and coordination.We are witnessing a scientific and technologicalrevolution that intensifies the need for a greater synergythat would enable us to meet increasingly complicateddemands and challenges  to bridge the widening gapbetween nations and  together  to do what no nation can doalone.The world’s demographic explosion has put theEarth’s environment under constant pressure to cater to theincreasing demands made upon it. Competition for theworld’s resources is on the rise  as is the imbalancebetween human needs and disposable resources. Theaccumulation of lethal and sophisticated nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons  and the concomitant increasein their destructive capabilities across continents  increasepeoples’ risk of annihilation. Their proliferation andpossession by some States that lack even the absoluteminimum of credibility and fail to provide any politicalguarantees regarding the decision to use such weapons increases the world’s need for guarantees and controls onarmament.The information revolution is contributing to the rapiddissemination of information about political  scientific  andeconomic achievements across boundaries. Unequal accessto information by some societies is accentuating theirisolation and causing them to be bound by their traditions either because they want to protect their national identity or because they are unable to assimilate such achievements.Extremist and fundamentalist tendencies express the fearhaunting these societies against what are often perceived asthreats to their national identity.All these risks make it more important than everbefore to reactivate United Nations machinery and toreinvigorate confidence in its justice and credibility  to freeits decisions from hegemony  to redress its imbalances  andto apply the same standards in its approach andcommitment. That is the path we should take if the UnitedNations is to remain a world authority and an alternative toheated confrontations.So  where do we stand at present with regard to themoral authority and credibility of United Nationsresolutions? How can we apply one standard across theboard?The world has witnessed and continues to witness anumber of local and regional crises. Lebanon  which hassuffered from the scourge of war  follows what ishappening around the world with grave concern andinterest.Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina are two clearexamples of our inability to act in the face of horribleatrocities. More than 20 years have passed and theCypriot problem still awaits settlement  despite numerousrelevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly andSecurity Council to unify the island and to protect itsindependence and territorial integrity. The question of theislands of the United Arab Emirates still awaits a solutionthat would ease tension in the region.Four years ago the Madrid Conference wasconvened. We were optimistic about the invitation  thecontent  and the sponsorship. As the co-sponsors weresuper-Powers  and the Conference was to be convened onthe basis of establishing a just  comprehensive  and lastingpeace anchored in the principle of “land for peace”  andon the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) 338 (1973)  and 425 (1978) respectively  we accepted theinvitation  assuming that those who accepted it were alsoin agreement with its content and that what remained tobe done was to discuss the questions of mechanisms andschedules.However  years have passed and months have goneby while some waited for the results of elections and forthe arrival of the opportune moment at the domestic level.Time has passed while some awaited circumstances that they bet  were bound to strengthen their positions  orconducted secret negotiations that they expected toweaken  isolate or single out some other side. The resulthas been that we are still discussing today the basicprinciples which were supposed to have been settled atthe very beginning of the Conference.The principle of land for peace still awaits thematerialization of the concept of “land”. The principle ofwithdrawal is still being obfuscated by the term“redeployment”. We are told that resistance must cease without any guarantee that withdrawal or liberation willever take place. We are told that the boycott must end but no guarantee is given that usurped rights will be5restored. We are required to engage in multilateralnegotiations on complementary subjects while thefundamental bilateralism remains frozen and while weknow not whether there will be peace  or what the form andcontent of that peace will ever be.We are required to shake hands and to celebratebefore we know what exactly we are supposed to celebrate.We  the victims of aggression  are required to give securityguarantees to the aggressor. Those who do not possessweapons are required to reassure those who possess one ofthe largest nuclear and chemical arsenals which the worldcould not make subject to the Non-Proliferation Treatywhen the Treaty was extended.The media hype that surrounded the recent signing ofthe second Protocol between the Palestinian Authority andIsrael  which glorified the event and amplified its content makes us wonder about the extent of the authority that willbe exercised by the Palestinian people  the size of theterritories that would be returned and  ultimately  to wonderabout the fate of three quarters of the Palestinian peoplewho were displaced from the land of Palestine. What abouttheir right to return  their right to a nationality  to anidentity? What about those whose status was neverdiscussed either at Oslo or at Taba? We wonder: Couldthose tiny specks of land — in which an authority less thanthat of a municipality will be exercised — be called thePalestinian homeland? Doesn’t the isolation of those tinyspecks into so-called security islands mean additionalprisons in which anger and rancour will fester?Will the 400 000 Palestinians who are now in Lebanonand others who are elsewhere in the world ever enjoy theirlong-awaited right of return? How can we have faith in acountry that boasts of its desire for peace and its intentionto restore legitimate rights to people while it continues toviolate those rights  to build settlements and to occupy andconfiscate land? It cannot be credited unless it desists fromsuch actions forthwith  particularly in southern Lebanon where it has recently confiscated lands.Could this bloated glorification by the media serve asan alternative to the restoring of legitimate rights? Couldthis anaesthetization of international public opinion  thisillusion of a solution  actually put an end to the problem?We in Lebanon are patiently and diligently continuingto rebuild our homeland after the destruction of a ravagingwar. We are continuing to build our institutions and oursecurity. Those who had emigrated are continuing to returnto their homeland  and those who were displaced arecontinuing to return to their villages. Laws are beingenacted so that Lebanon may regain its natural place inthe Middle East on the economic  political and culturallevels.Lebanon has suffered for far too long from theconsequences and reverberations of the Middle Eastcrises. Lebanon has paid its heavy dues. Once again itproves that it is capable of facing difficulties and risingup to challenges and that its unity formula is muchstronger than was once believed  because it is the onlydefinitive reality.Lebanon will once again prove that certain nationshave a history that is more extensive than their geographyand a role that is much larger than their physical size. Aslong as Lebanon’s sovereignty and independence continueto be compromised; as long as major parts of its landcontinue to be out of its control; as long as the LebaneseState continues to be unable to extend its full sovereigntyover all its national territory by its own legitimatenational forces; as long as Israel continues to occupyLebanon’s territories 17 years after the adoption by theSecurity Council of resolution 425 (1978) whichdemanded Israel’s complete withdrawal from Lebanon; aslong as Lebanese citizens continue to languish in Israeliprisons and detention camps  ignored by the internationalcommunity in clear violation of their human rights — aslong as all this continues  the wounds will never heal andthe bleeding will never stop.So long as the occupation of more than one eighthof our national territory continues; so long as Israeli raidsdaily sow our land with cluster bombs  fission bombs scatter bombs and booby traps for the killing of children;so long as such criminal acts continue to be perpetratedagainst a people that refuses to surrender; so long as ourwomen continue to mourn the loss of their loved ones andso long as our children cry out  the cries of anguish willcontinue to haunt the world and the voices raised againstinjustice will grow louder than the roar of the guns thatdefend a senseless occupation.The occupier has used all the means available to it but has failed to contain this anger. Israel’s logic ofsecurity zones inside Lebanese territories and securitybelts has failed also. The cost has by far outweighed thereturns.The Security Council’s method in dealing withLebanon’s complaints does not represent the optimummeans of performing the role of that important body. We6have waited so long for the implementation of SecurityCouncil resolutions. Instead  the Council has refrained fromcondemning aggression  and if it happens to do so  it tendsto equate the aggressor with the victim of the aggression.When it fails to condemn  it uses as a pretext the desire notto cause any distortion to the peace process.The peace negotiations  however  do not absolve theSecurity Council from the obligation to perform itsappointed role at any given moment  especially when an actof aggression is committed in the shadow of a peaceprocess. Nor do they absolve the Council from itsresponsibility towards international peace. Discriminating inthe application of United Nations resolutions for some anddepriving others of the right to call for implementation;discriminating in the application of the stipulations ofChapter VII of the Charter on some trouble-makers whilerefraining from such application on others in a sort ofcover-up for the practices of those protected others  willdeprive the United Nations of credibility as an arbiter towhom the nations of the world have recourse in search ofjustice.The days when the problems of people were confinedto their own countries are over. The days when Stateboundaries were barriers that contained a country’s crisesare over as well. Regardless of how distant any countrymay be from a crisis area  it can none the less remainsubject to repercussions of such crisis. Thus every countryremains vulnerable to the political  economic environmental  demographic and security problems of othercountries.The Middle East must not forever be a fiery volcanothat threatens international peace and security. This way the region will not see better days nor will time be foreveron the side of those who seek peace.We have to realize that peace must be equitable  notbiased; just  not unjust; genuine  not ceremonial; balanced not deficient. Peace must help the refugee to return ratherthan consecrate his displacement. Peace must satisfy thosewho rebel against injustice  not provoke their anger.The new tendency to weigh the suitability ofresolutions  to selectively enforce some and freeze some  toelaborate different interpretations to different resolutions  anenterprise that is engaged in  from time to time  in thewings of the Organization under the pretext of having tointerpret resolutions with reference to the circumstancesunder which they were adopted  all this threatens credibilityof the United Nations as a whole.This then is the situation we face today  and it isagainst the backdrop of this situation that I congratulatethe President on his election at this session and extendappreciation to his predecessor  to the Secretary-Generaland to the commanders  officers  and soldiers of theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) whom I wholeheartedly thank for their valuable effortsunder difficult circumstances.May God guide us to peace and to acquittingourselves in the eyes of the generations to come."
"92",4016,"LBR",50,1995,"I congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral on his assumption of the presidency of thefiftieth regular session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. We note his laudable accomplishments in thediplomatic service of his country  and feel assured thatthrough his stewardship of this historic session a newparadigm will emerge to direct intercourse among nationsof the world.I also wish to convey the appreciation of the Liberiandelegation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy  a distinguished son of Africa  for the skilful mannerin which he conducted the work of the forty-ninth session.We commend our able and renowned Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisunrelenting devotion to charting a new course for theUnited Nations  in spite of formidable odds. Moreover  weare particularly pleased with the fervent attention that hecontinues to give to a peaceful resolution of the Liberiancivil conflict  as well as to the post-war reconstruction ofLiberia.I stand before this body in celebration of the largerfreedom that is personified in the survival and success ofthe United Nations and my country  Liberia. Both wereborn out of the visions of individuals who dared to standon higher ground  while others wallowed in fear  hatred racism  doubts and dismay. Half a century ago mycountry was proud to be one of three African nationsamong the 51 States that assembled in San Francisco California  to participate in the creation of the UnitedNations  culminating in the signing of its Charter.The United Nations was born because “We thepeoples” from diverse cultural backgrounds  representedby our Governments “determined ...to reaffirm [our] faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand small”.To demonstrate our commitment to these fundamentalrights  the principle of sovereign equality was enshrinedin the Charter of the Organization and later buttressed  in1948  by the adoption of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights.One and a quarter centuries before the birth of theUnited Nations  we the people  from diverse culturalbackgrounds represented by individuals and organizationswhich believed in the larger freedom as a measure ofman’s dignity and greatness  gave birth to the Liberiannation in times perhaps more vexing and troubling thanthe birth period of our United Nations. But we the people determined to escape the degradation to which we wereexposed by the denial of the universality of human rightsand the commonality of human nature  fled to freedom inpursuit of the very principles for which this Organizationstands.We ought to celebrate the survival and success ofthe United Nations and my country  Liberia.Symbolically  they represent the higher nature of man which compels him to acknowledge that no human beingis inferior or superior to another. Just as a man’s life“consisteth not in the abundance of the things whichhe possesseth”  (The Holy Bible  Luke 12:15)the greatness of any people or nation is not measured inthe abundance of things which they possess.8The survival and success of the United Nations forhalf a century have destroyed the myth that it is Utopian toorganize sovereign nations on a global level in the pursuitof international peace and security. Liberia’s survival as anindependent State since 1847 also destroyed the myth thatAfricans were incapable of self-governance. As one of thethree African founding Members of the United Nations Liberia’s independence and involvement in internationalaffairs served as a beacon of hope for peoples of Africandescent engaged in their legitimate struggle against colonialdomination. It lent diplomatic and moral support to thedecolonization of Africa and other regions of the world andforcefully voiced its opposition to apartheid in SouthAfrica.As more nations of Africa became independent Liberia offered them a hand of friendship  brotherhood andsolidarity. In particular  Liberia adopted and pursued apolicy of peaceful coexistence with its neighbours and wasa principal advocate of a functional approach to Africanunity. This led to the formation of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and other entities fosteringeconomic cooperation between the African peoples.In this connection  my delegation is immenselypleased to celebrate the practical actualization of the visionof three distinguished sons of Africa — Kwame Nkrumahof Ghana  Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea and William V.S. Tubman of Liberia — as we note that an independentAfrica is observing and actively participating in the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations.The fiftieth regular session of the General Assemblyis convening against the backdrop of tremendous changesin the international system. The peace euphoria which wasinspired by the end of the super-Power confrontation haslong dissipated and the world is far from being a peacefuland just place. Simmering inter-State disputes  violent civilconflicts and resurgent nationalism  carried to the extreme have led to the disintegration of several States andthreatened international peace and security. Theunfavourable consequences of this situation are the loss ofmany innocent lives and massive refugee flows  particularlyin Africa. Unfortunately  my country  Liberia  has not beenspared from this onslaught.The Liberian peace process must be viewed in thetotality of Liberia’s history. From the Declaration ofIndependence in 1847 to the present  the Republic ofLiberia has been besieged and buffeted by internal andexternal forces which hold diametrically opposing viewsrelating to the universality of human rights and thecommonality of human nature  as well as to theappropriateness of political and economic utilitarianism where powerful external forces — Governments multinational corporations  international organizations andso on — manipulate and exploit human and materialresources in Liberia to the detriment of the country. Thisis a reality that cannot be wished away.Although these views may be based solely onignorance  it is this same ignorance which fuels the fireof war and destruction around the world  manifestingitself as racism  “ethnic cleansing”  tribalism  religiouspersecution and so on. Thus  for those who believe thatthe African is less than human or is incapable ofgoverning himself  the existence for almost a century anda half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia withstrong economic potential is undesirable.Liberia  which was founded — about half a centurybefore the Berlin Congress of 1884  which carved outAfrica and institutionalized colonialism — as “an asylumfor free people of colour” fleeing the hot crucibles andbitter pangs of slavery  was threatened with partition andtrusteeship by the League of Nations  predecessor to ourbeloved United Nations  half a century after that colonialCongress. Ironically  the charge was slave trading.Although the Liberian Government was grievously atfault  and while we roundly condemn slavery of any kind that attempt by the League of Nations to undermineLiberia’s sovereignty was a sinister  hypocriticalsubterfuge whose only purpose was to perpetuate a racistmyth rooted in a very destructive ignorance. This was notin the best interests of Liberia or Africa  for no nation international organization or earthly Power can willLiberia out of existence.Roughly half a century after this unsuccessfulattempt by the League of Nations  Liberia experienced thebloody overthrow of its constitutional Government. Thepolitical-legal structure had become too rigid andinsensitive to the cries of the overwhelming majority ofthe people  who wanted to be included in the social political and economic structures of the country. Theerstwhile experienced leaders failed to provide therequired navigational changes. The execution of thesepolitical leaders  who had navigated the ship of State inturbulent times  and the first imposition of military ruleaffected more than 13 decades of political stability. Theattendant dislocations in our national fabric culminated inthe civil war that brings us here today.9Over the past six years  our country has been at warwith itself  trying to right injustices among the people ofLiberia while maintaining the sovereignty of the nation including the right to determine our own destiny. To someon the outside  this war has appeared very senseless — andit may be so in the sense that most wars are senseless. Onthe other hand  we believe that we will emerge out of thisas a stronger and more united people in a nation where wewill regard ourselves as human beings first and foremostand where the national identity will take precedence overtribal or ethnic identity.Thus  our efforts to seek peace when agreements arebroken should be lauded instead of ridiculed. This reflectsour history as a peace-loving nation. We cannot apologizefor desiring peace more than war. The Abuja Agreementwill hold and usher in a new dawn for Liberia; but even ifit did not hold  we would still pursue peace  ignore thosewho prefer war to peace and strike another deal for peaceand democracy. We are optimistic and will not give up onourselves. We ask the Assembly not to give up on us.We have consistently maintained over the course ofthis war that a military solution was neither desirable norachievable; we have consistently advocated a balance offorces and a Government of inclusion.In this connection  we commend ECOWAS for itshumanitarian intervention in the Liberian crisis. Althoughmandated to promote the economic integration of thesubregion  its action was a necessary concrete manifestationof unique African solidarity and has afforded Liberians theopportunity to resolve their differences through civildiscourse.The primary objective of the Liberian people has beenthe attainment of a just  comprehensive and durable peacethrough a political settlement of the conflict. The basiccomponents of the agreements reached by the parties andsubsequent resolutions adopted by the Security Councilcentred around the following objectives: combatants wouldbe disarmed and rehabilitated; sufficient security guaranteeswould be established to facilitate the resettlement ofdisplaced persons and the repatriation of hundreds ofthousands of Liberian refugees; internationally supervisedelections would be held in accordance with an agreedtimetable; a democratically elected administration would beinstalled; and the international community would lend therequisite assistance for the economic and socialrehabilitation of Liberia.Through the sustained diplomacy of the EconomicCommunity of West African States  complemented by theOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations and the willingness of the parties to continue negotiations a final agreement was reached in Abuja  the FederalRepublic of Nigeria  on 19 August 1995.In celebration of Abuja  we hereby announce ourprofoundest gratitude to former President Jimmy Carterand current President William Clinton of the UnitedStates of America  ECOWAS Chairman President JerryJohn Rawlings and his Special Facilitator  Captain KojoTsikata  both of Ghana  President Sani Abacha of Nigeria President Nicéphore Soglo of Benin  the late PresidentHouphouët-Boigny and current President Konan-Bédié ofCôte d’Ivoire  President Blaise Campaoré of BurkinaFaso  President Lansana Conté of Guinea  PresidentAbdou Diouf of Senegal  President Ali Mwinyi ofTanzania  President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia  formerPresident Sir Dawda Jawara  and current Head of StateCaptain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh of Gambia  formerPresident Moussa Traoré  and current President AlphaOumar Konaré of Mali  and former President JosephSaidu Momoh and current President Valentine Strasser ofSierra Leone.Special thanks also go to all the Presidents andForeign Ministers of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine the former Executive Secretary of ECOWAS  Mr. AbassBundu  and current Executive Secretary Mr. EdouardBenjamin  OAU Secretary General Salim A. Salim  andOAU Eminent Person  former President Canaan Banana members of the United Nations Security Council Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and hisSpecial Representatives  Trevor Gordon-Somers andAmbassador Anthony Nyakyi  all non-governmental andhumanitarian organizations in Liberia  the commandersand troops of the Cease-fire Monitoring Group ofECOWAS (ECOMOG)  the United Nations ObserverMission in Liberia (UNOMIL)  the member States ofECOWAS  the OAU  the European Union  the UnitedNations and all the friends of Liberia for helping us helpourselves. We also congratulate the Liberian people fortheir patience  sacrifice  understanding and maturity as wenavigate through turbulent waters to peaceful waters.Unlike previous agreements  the Abuja Agreementto supplement and amend the Cotonou and AkosomboAgreements  as subsequently clarified by the AccraAgreement  provides for a six-man collective presidencycomprising the leaders of the principal warring parties and10three civilian representatives. They are: His ExcellencyProfessor Wilton S. Sankawulo  Chairman  His ExcellencyMr. Charles Ghankay Taylor of the National Patriotic Frontof Liberia (NPFL)  His Excellency Lt. General Alhaji G. V.Kromah of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia forDemocracy (ULIMO)  His Excellency Mr. George E.Saigbe Boley of the Liberian Peace Council (LPC)  HisExcellency Mr. Oscar J. Quiah of the Liberia NationalCouncil (LNC)  and His Excellency Chief Tamba Tailor joint nominee of the NPFL and ULIMO  as Vice Chairmen.The very fact that the present collective presidency isfunctioning and deliberating with unanimity of purpose isreason to celebrate. Each of the six is uniquely and pre-eminently qualified to lead Liberia  but they have relegatedtheir personal ambitions to work collectively as leaders ofreconstruction.The Agreement also retained two cardinal principlesof the ECOWAS peace plan. The first requires theGovernment of Liberia to enter a Status of ForcesAgreement with ECOWAS regarding the status ofECOMOG in Liberia. This is being worked on at present.The second forbids the Chairman of the Council ofState from contesting any position in the ensuing elections.Other members of the Council  the Vice Chairmen of equalstatus  and officials of the Transitional Government mayseek elective office  but are required to resign from theGovernment prior to the elections.The first signs of adherence to the Abuja Agreementcame when  on August 26 1995  a general cease-fire wasre-established. On 1 September 1995  the new Council ofState was installed in office. Shortly thereafter  a newcabinet of the Liberian National Transitional Government(LNTG) was named and inducted into office. The NationalLegislative Assembly  the Supreme Court of Liberia and theElections Commission are functioning in accordance withlaw.As disarmament is crucial to a complete and timelyimplementation of the Abuja Accord  I am pleased to reportthat ECOMOG has begun the deployment of its troops inmany parts of the country  and has taken over command ofmost of the checkpoints hitherto controlled by the parties.Also  most of the major highways and roads in the countryare gradually and steadily reopening for the unimpededmovement of individuals and goods.The installation of the Council of State marks a newbeginning in the peace process. It points towards a finalpeaceful resolution of the Liberian crisis and has raisedthe hopes of Liberians  who believe that the process isnow irreversible.Now we must confront the all-engaging task offostering national reconciliation  unity and the economicrehabilitation of the country. There are clear signs thatLiberians earnestly desire to turn the swords ofdestruction and death into ploughshares of cultivation andrebuilding. They have placed much faith in the democraticoption  which will empower them for full participation inthe affairs of their country through civil discourse  asopposed to armed confrontation.Like all countries which have had to make thetransition from conditions of war and utter deprivation toconditions of peace and development  Liberia now standsin urgent need of substantial assistance from theinternational community. Help is also required for therehabilitation of children traumatized by the war and forthe reintegration of former combatants into civil society where their energies can be redirected to productiveactivities.Beyond these pressing needs the private sector which is very vital to the long-term economic recoveryand development of Liberia  must be revived. Thereforewe appeal to our investment partners to return with theirexpertise and financial resources.We welcome the Secretary-General’s decision tohold a pledging conference for Liberia at the UnitedNations on 27 October 1995 for the demobilization andreconstruction of Liberia  as well as assistance forECOWAS in the implementation of its mandate.As we Liberians forge ahead in a determined effortto restore peace in our country and embark on thereconstruction programme  it is imperative that theinternational community should provide the requisitesupport and encouragement to the new Liberianleadership.In this connection  we recall that earlier this year theCouncil of Ministers of the Organization of African Unityadopted resolution 1585 on Liberia which  inter alia called on the international community to “recognize andgive full faith and credence to the current LiberianNational Transitional Government and its successors”.It is my Government’s firm belief that the fullimplementation of this recommendation by Member States11will serve to revive and strengthen the bilateral relationsbetween Liberia and friendly Governments by acceleratingthe reconstruction efforts of the country.To my compatriots let me say that ours is a countrythat went to war with itself. In the process  all Liberianshave suffered or experienced some loss. We empathize withtheir grief  pain  anguish and frustration. We must nowassuage our hurt by rising above our differences andcoalesce into a strong  unified nation  determined to moveforward to a better and prosperous future. No matter howwell disposed to help us our friends and sympathizers ofthe international community may be  the challenge is oursto rebuild Liberia. I can only appeal to and plead with thosefriends and sympathizers to be messengers of forgivenessand love. We have a unique opportunity to participate inthe redemption of our common patrimony — Liberia  areality greater than our individual selves. Let us seize thishistoric moment.Our representation before this body would certainly beincomplete without a reflection of my Government’sposition on the many difficulties and the prevailing sense offrustration persisting on the international political scene.However  the recent efforts to reach a permanent solutionto the seemingly intractable crisis in the Middle Eastrepresent a positive step in the right direction. In thisconnection  we view the recent signing — on 28 September1995 — of the agreement reached between Israel and thePalestinian National Authority as a significant milestone.We also salute Israel and Jordan for the Treaty signed on26 October 1994 regarding mutual reconciliation  and weurge other Arab States in the region to emulate this boldinitiative.On the question of limiting nuclear and conventionalarmaments  my Government believes that nuclear non-proliferation is only the first step to the ultimate goal ofcomplete prohibition. In this connection  we view the recentindefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as anact that strengthens the international non-proliferationregime and enhances the maintenance of world peace andsecurity.The conflict in the former Yugoslavia — especially inBosnia and Herzegovina — and the crises in Rwanda Sierra Leone  Somalia and Burundi continue to be a sourceof much concern to the international community. MyGovernment welcomes the important role played by theinternational community — particularly the United Nations the Organization of African Unity and the EconomicCommunity of West African States  the European Union the United States and the Russian Federation. We alsocall on the parties to the conflict to refrain from furthermilitary action and to opt for a negotiated settlement  tothe mutual satisfaction of all the parties concerned.With respect to reform of the Security Council Liberia calls for either expansion of the membership ofthe Council or modification of paragraph 3 of Article27 — Chapter V — of the Charter to conform withparagraph 2 of the same Article  to enable the largermembership of the United Nations to participate in theprocess of decision-making. We believe that either orboth of these steps would make the Council not onlymore representative  but also more democratic andtransparent. The proposed reform is also intended toensure balance between the requirements of efficiency andexpansion  transparency in the Council’s methods of workand optimum utilization of the resources of those Statesthat can contribute significantly to peace-keepingoperations and development activities.The rationale for our call lies in logic  democracy equality and the Charter of the United Nations. When wesigned the Charter half a century ago there were threeAfrican countries among 51 nations. Today the Africanmembership has increased to approximately 52 nationsamong a total of 185. The five permanent members of theSecurity Council are from three of the five continents ofour world — Asia  Europe and North America. Thecontinent of Africa ought to have at least one permanentmember  to be determined by the African countriesthemselves.In his inaugural address at this historic session thePresident of the Assembly averred that if the UnitedNations is to maintain its unique character as aninternational Organization that is truly universal  effortsshould be made to ensure that all States which are not yetMembers can be admitted in the near future. Mydelegation fully supports this position and recalls thatwhen we signed the Charter of the United Nations thefive permanent members of the Security Council were theRepublic of China  France  the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics  the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland and the United States of America.Contrary to the principle of universality  the People’sRepublic of China was not included. We are happy that24 years ago the General Assembly restored the lawfulright of the People’s Republic of China to membership ofthis Organization  in keeping with the Charter’s principleof universality and the reality that that country is theworld’s most populous nation.12Twenty-four years later  we note that 20 MemberStates from Africa  Asia  the Caribbean and Latin America in a letter to the Secretary-General  requested that theexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwanbe examined by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.My Government firmly believes that the unification ofChina should be peacefully pursued and that it is a matterfor the Chinese people themselves to determine at sometime in the future. However  we note that there were twoGermanys in the United Nations until their reunification alittle over five years ago and that there are still two Koreas both of which are now Members of the Organization. Wehave confidence in the ability of the United Nations to dealproperly with this long-standing matter so that theunification of China may be peacefully pursued by theChinese themselves.We wholeheartedly welcome the recent progressivetrends in the world economic spectrum. However  we alsoremain mindful of the persistent inhibitive factors thatcontinue to account for the slow and unbalanced growth ofthe global economy. In spite of the increase in the numberof developing countries now participating as key players inthe world economy  the magnitude of increasing poverty formore than 1 billion people of the world leaves much to bedesired. The gap between developed and developingcountries continues to widen  not only reflecting themarginalization of the developing countries but alsoundermining efforts aimed at securing access tointernational trade  communications and the flow of vitalinformation.Meanwhile  there is also a crisis of officialdevelopment assistance  caused by stagnation and areduction in assistance sources. It is worth noting that thereis a need for increased cooperation if anything is to beachieved in addressing these distracting issues. Oneapproach would be to reconsider the agreement regardingthe developed countries contributing 0.7 per cent of grossnational product to the assistance programmes for thedeveloping countries. The economic situation in mostAfrican countries is critical and precarious. It is true thatthe global economic situation affects all developingcountries  but its impact on sub-Saharan Africa istremendous.While we recognize that the development of Africa isprimarily our responsibility  concerted efforts by theinternational community and donor countries willcomplement the national efforts of African Governments inreversing the negative trend of their economies.As regards the role of women in development  webelieve that the full and equal integration of women intothe development process at all levels is a central goal. Wefully support the Conferences that were held in Cairo andAccra and in Taiwan earlier this year  and we are alsocommitted to the successful implementation of thedecisions reached at the 1995 World Conference onWomen  held recently in Beijing  with the theme “Actionfor Equality  Development and Peace”.Liberia — a Founding Member of the UnitedNations — although encumbered by a fratricidal war  isproud of its modest contribution since the formation ofthe Organization  particularly in respect of thedecolonization of Africa and its aspirations for economicgrowth and development. As the country emerges fromwar  it pledges anew its commitment to the Organization.It is our firm belief that the United Nations offers the besthope for a just and more equitable world. Member Statesare therefore challenged to pool their resources and worktogether  not as competitors but as equal partners alignedin a common pursuit.Liberia is determined to regain its rightful place  byvirtue of its long history and involvement in the strugglefor peace  cooperation and the prosperity of all peoples in the comity of nations.During the past half-century of its existence  theUnited Nations has endeavoured to maintain internationalpeace and security and remain responsive to the needs ofthe public that it serves. Today  its responsibilities haveincreased to cover urgent humanitarian emergencies whichrequire the deployment of tremendous resources. It ishoped that the corresponding support will be forthcomingfrom Member States.When the United Nations succeeds  the greatmajority  who depend on the services it provides  arelifted from misery  suffering and deprivation. That is thebasic principle we should bear in mind as theOrganization enters its fifty-first year of existence. TheUnited Nations  in spite of its perceived shortcomings which we must collectively seek to overcome  representsmankind’s legitimate aspiration to be truly our brother’skeeper. Let us rededicate ourselves to this importantobjective to ensure our survival and that of succeedinggenerations."
"93",4062,"LBY",50,1995,"It is a pleasure for me tocongratulate you on your election to the presidency of thefiftieth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimouselection to this lofty post is a tribute paid by theinternational community to your country and to youpersonally. It also bespeaks recognition of your abilities andskills. To your predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  the presidentof the forty-ninth session  who demonstrated greatdedication and a high level of efficiency  we should like toextend our deep appreciation for his efforts and skill.On this occasion  I cannot fail to express mydelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tirelessefforts to enhance the United Nations and increase itseffectiveness. Through his “Supplement to An Agenda forPeace'”  he has demonstrated once again high initiative inseeking to enable the United Nations to rise to thechallenges of today’s highly complex world.This session of the General Assembly convenes on animportant occasion. In a few days  celebrations willcommence to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations with the aim of sparinghumanity the repetition of the suffering it had endured as aresult of two world wars. This historical occasion  whichmarks the end of the post-war era with all its ramifications affords us an opportunity to take stock  while we celebrate of the Organization’s progress over the past five decades to evaluate its performance  and to seek the ways andmeans whereby it could overcome the negatives that inthe past prevented it from achieving its goals. In so doing we should put forward plans and programmes of actionthat would revitalize the United Nations and enable it toface up to the challenges of the future and to establish abetter world that would be consonant with principles ofthe Charter and the common values and aspirations of allnations.Last year  the world witnessed certain encouragingdevelopments. The efforts deployed to promoteinternational cooperation in the interests of economic andsocial development  to reduce environmental degradationand to combat the phenomena of poverty  terrorism anddrugs continued apace. The dispute in Mozambique wassettled by peaceful means and peace in Central Americahas been consolidated. All these developments andtendencies give cause for hope. However  we should notallow ourselves to be overly elated. Civil wars andregional conflicts continue to wreak havoc and toundermine security and stability in many parts of theworld. In the post-cold-war world there are many otherchallenges  which I shall address presently. Before I doso  however  I seek your indulgence in allowing me toturn to another question that is not far-removed from thepresent international situation and the way small countrieshave come to be treated especially when they adoptindependent policies and positions. I refer here to thedispute between my country and France  the UnitedKingdom  and the United States of America over the PanAm flight 103 incident  and the crash of the French UTAaircraft. This dispute would not have continued for sucha long time had the right approach been adopted and hadthere been any acceptance of the call for dialogue andnegotiation in seeking to settle the dispute.As you know  over several years  and in completesecrecy  certain bodies that are claimed to be independentinvestigated the two incidents. Suddenly and without thepresentation of any evidence  Britain and the UnitedStates of America surprised the world by declaring thatthe Pan Am flight 103 incident was the work of twoLibyans nationals. At the same time  France declared thatcircumstantial evidence pointed at the involvement ofseveral Libyans in the attack against UTA flight 772.Although those who made the allegations did notcorroborate them by any document  testimony or fact  theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya  upon being notified of theallegations  announced that it was ready to cooperate inuncovering the facts surrounding the two incidents. I donot see any need to repeat the measures we have taken in12this regard  since I have enumerated them at the past twosessions of this Assembly. Moreover  we have informed allMember States of our positions and initiatives  in thisrespect  in official documents that have been circulated tothem. However  I should like to remind  briefly  that mycountry has condemned terrorism in all its forms  and hasdeclared its commitment to the implementation of anyaction decided upon by the international community tocombat terrorism. My country has also cooperated with theGovernment of the United Kingdom. British officials havethemselves voiced satisfaction with Libya’s response.Contacts have been initiated and are continuing with theFrench authorities with a view to determining thecircumstances of the crash of the French aircraft. Mycountry has spared no effort in searching for a feasiblecourse of action with regard to the two individuals whohave been suspected of having something to do with theincident of the American plane. Libyan judicial authoritiesstarted to investigate this case but had to suspend theinvestigation because of the refusal of both the UnitedStates and British authorities to submit any documents orpapers in their possession. Despite the fact that the issue ofthe trial of the two suspects is determined by the 1971Montreal Convention  which gives Libya the right to trythem  the refusal by Britain and the United States to abideby this Convention  to which they are both parties prompted Libya to seek other solutions to the issue of thetrial. In this respect  Libya has submitted several proposals including one that calls for resorting to the InternationalCourt of Justice  or trying the two suspects before a courtwhose venue should be agreed upon by the partiesconcerned.Although the United States and British Governmentshave both announced that their allegations have been builton specific facts and reliable information  the facts thathave come to light over the past three years refute suchassertions. In addition to the statement by the Palestiniannational  Yusuf Sha’aban  before a Lebanese court  thereare the statements of the manager of a Swiss electronicscompany which undermine the most important basis foraccusing the two Libyan nationals. The informationpublished in Tracking the Octopus  a recent work ofinvestigative journalism  points an accusing finger at otherquarters. Despite all this  Libya continued to cooperate inseeking to reveal all the facts surrounding the Pan Amflight 103 incident. Proceeding from this  Libya acceptedthe proposal of the League of Arab States  which calls fortrying the two suspected individuals by Scottish judges under Scottish law  at the seat of the International Court ofJustice at the Hague.The many secrets and mysterious dimensions of theLockerbie incident which have been uncovered have nowbeen brought into sharp focus by  inter alia  the televisiondocumentary “The Maltese Double-Cross”  WilliamChasey’s book The Lockerbie Cover-Up and GeoffSimmons’ book “Libya: The Struggle for Survival”. Inaddition  several articles on this question have appearedin various newspapers  including the article published byThe Guardian of London on 29 June 1995. All thesedocumentary revelations by the media refute theaccusations levelled at the two Libyans  and provideevidence that the incident was planned by professionalagencies to cover up certain suspect activities. Despite allthis  Libya  which  from the very beginning  declared thatit is most interested in unearthing the truth regarding thisincident  has not retreated from its declared position namely that it has no objection whatsoever to the trial ofits two suspected nationals before a court of law.Libya’s overriding concern in all this is to ensurethat its two nationals get a just  fair and neutral trial  thatwould be free from any emotional or media influencesand which would be conducted in accordance with therules of international law which Libya has always upheldand adhered to. The International Court of Justice cantestify to our adherence to and respect for internationallaw  as has been proven in three cases  the latest beingthe judgment by the Court in relation to the territorialdispute between the Jamahiriya and Chad. Although thejudgment was against our position  Libya  out of respectfor international law  accepted the ruling of the Court andimplemented it in a constructive manner. This confirmsLibya’s respect for international legality  to which one ofthe big Powers pays lip service all the time  but does notapply. It even refuses to resort to the International Courtof Justice because this big Power believes in the law offorce not the force of law.It is evident that the Governments of the UnitedStates and Britain are not keen on revealing the truthabout the perpetrators of the tragic Lockerbie incident. Ithas become abundantly clear that involving Libya in thisincident was a premeditated act that aimed at achievingcertain objectives. Otherwise  why should the twoGovernments object to the trial of the two suspectedindividuals before the judiciary of a third country orbefore the International Court of Justice when this hasbeen acceptable to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and hasbeen supported by most members of the internationalcommunity  as represented by their regional organizations:the League of Arab States  the Organization of theIslamic Conference  the Organization of African Unity 13and the Non-Aligned Movement? What prevents the twoGovernments from accepting the path of dialogue andnegotiation as stipulated by the Charter of the UnitedNations? Why is the Security Council being prevented fromresponding to repeated calls and appeals by over two thirdsof the membership of the United Nations on whose behalfthe Security Council is supposed to act? And why thedouble standards when it comes to dealing with issues ofinternational legality? Furthermore  how can a certain majorPower explain the fact that while it claims to be keen onpreserving this legality  its record shows that it has the leastregard for the will of the international community  a factthat is attested to by that major Power’s continued supportof a certain State and protection of that State frompunishment for its refusal to implement internationalresolutions which now total 143  including dozens that havebeen adopted by the Security Council?The rejection by the two Governments  of the UnitedStates and Britain  of all Libyan proposals and of allregional initiatives proves that they want this crisis tocontinue for as long as possible. Evidence of this can befound in the fact that the more Libya’s positions arewelcomed and the more widespread becomes the call forlifting the sanctions imposed on the Libyan people  themore the two Governments hasten to oppose such positionsunder the false pretext of Libya’s non-response to theresolutions of the Council  thus keeping the Libyan peoplehostage to unjustified sanctions. As if these countries arenot content with the difficulties and pains suffered by theLibyan people at the hands of colonialists and fascists —people who fought on its territory  a war that killed anddisplaced hundreds of thousands of its people  and plantedin their farms and under their homes millions of mines thatstill explode and injure innocent Libyans. These mines alsohinder Libya’s efforts to combat desertification  protect theenvironment  and expand economic and social development.It even seems that these countries are not content with thesuffering of the Libyan people so far  including the acts ofterrorism to which the Libyan people have been subjectedsuch as the deliberate downing of a Libyan civilian planeby Israeli military aircraft in 1973  which killed all its 108passengers. Also  in 1986  hundreds of American fightersbombed Libyan cities while their residents were asleep.This aggression claimed the lives of many people andresulted in heavy material damage. Later  it was proved thatthe pretext used by the United States of America for thisact of aggression was false and baseless. The deep desire topunish the Libyan people also became clear when thesecountries insisted on depriving its civilian aircraft ofnecessary spare parts. In 1992  this led to the crash of oneof those aircraft and the death of all its 157 passengers.All this begs the question: is it a desire to discoverthe truth  or is it a desire  a thirst to wreak revenge onLibya because of the defeat of the United States fleet in1805? So  where is the truth? Is it the thirst for revenge a vendetta waged by a major Power against a smallcountry  a vendetta that goes back 150 years?The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has sought a speedyand just solution to the dispute with France  Britain andthe United States of America. All Libya asked was thatthe problem should be settled in accordance with theprinciples of the United Nations and the rules ofinternational law. For this purpose  we have knocked onmany doors  but our efforts  and those of others  to solvethe dispute and to lift the sanctions have faced continuedrejection. Furthermore  there are hints that other measuresmay be adopted to tighten the sanctions against us underthe pretext that Libya has not responded to the demandsof the Security Council. This is not true. It merelyrepresents manipulation and trickery with regard to theinterpretation of those resolutions.Now that I have reviewed this crisis for the fourthtime before the General Assembly and in order to avoidany further ramifications  we believe it is now incumbentupon this august assembly to intervene and to act inaccordance with the powers entrusted to it by the Charterin order to get the three countries to respond to therepeated calls for an urgent and peaceful solution to thisproblem  in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter ofthe United Nations. This assembly should also urge theSecurity Council to reconsider its resolutions in order tolift the sanctions. Resorting to sanctions is not the properway to solve differences between States  especially whensuch sanctions are unjustifiably imposed  as is the casewith the sanctions imposed against the Libyan people.These sanctions have led to the freezing of Libya’s assets and prevented it from getting spare parts  including theparts needed for power plants and desalination machines.This in turn has hampered the Libyan people’s effortswith regard to development  and paralysed the activitiesof most economic sectors. The more serious aspect of theeffects of these sanctions is the enormity of the materialand human losses which I need not review here in detail since we have detailed them in several official documents the latest of which is United Nations documentS/1995/474 dated 12 June 1995. Suffice it to mention herethat the number of people injured in road accidents hasreached 12 700 of whom 1 870 have died of their injurieswhile others continue to suffer from permanent injuries.Material damage has exceeded ten billion dollars.Moreover  the adverse effects of the sanctions have not14been limited to the Libyan people. They have affectedneighbouring countries and all the peoples of the region.Here  I must repeat that the longer these sanctions continue the more people will die and the greater the suffering andthe damage. There is no reason whatsoever for remainingsilent on the subject of injustice and the continuation of thiswrong. For the Assembly’s information a road accidentwhich took place two days ago on the road from Tripoli toTunis resulted in the death of three members of a Maltesedelegation.As I have previously stated  the international politicalsituation has witnessed new positive developments whichmy country welcomes. However  we must recognize thatnumerous challenges still face peace in the world and that consequently  the international community is called upon tomobilize all its capabilities in facing up to those challenges.The continued deterioration of the situation in Somaliaand the intensification of tensions in that country requiremore regional efforts to persuade Somali leaders to enterinto additional political commitments and to work for therestoration of peace and permanent stability to theircountry. Seeking to make the world more secure and morestable requires supporting national reconciliation efforts inAfghanistan  promoting a satisfactory solution to theproblem of Cyprus  solving the problems in Rwanda andBurundi and settling the disputes in Angola and Liberia. Italso requires putting an end to the repeated setbacks topeace efforts in the Balkans  as well as sparing the peopleof Bosnia and Herzegovina  and other peoples of the formerYugoslavia  more pain and suffering.In order to establish permanent stability in the Gulfregion  the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq must berespected  and all interference in its internal affairs mustcease. Furthermore  the sanctions from which the Iraqipeople have been suffering should be lifted.In the context of any effort to consolidate world peace serious action must be taken to resolve the problems of theMiddle East. It is unacceptable that the Palestinian peopleshould continue to be displaced from their land  while thosewho stay on that land are brutally treated. Theoverwhelming majority of the international community which has continued to support the legitimate rights of thePalestinian people over the past four decades  should takefirm action to put an end to the Israeli practices against thePalestinians and the other inhabitants of the occupied Arabterritories in the Golan and southern Lebanon. The Israelismust be deterred  in accordance with the Charter of theUnited Nations  from their continued defiance of the will ofthe international community. The incontrovertible truth isthat occupation and expansion are the real aim of theIsraelis. Their former and present positions and practicesindicate that they do not want a just and comprehensivepeace. Their joining the so-called peace process is a meresmoke-screen  a mask they hide behind in order toperpetrate further occupation and enhance theirsuperiority.A just  comprehensive and lasting solution to theproblems of the Middle East cannot be achieved byceding the administration of local affairs in Gaza andJericho  but rather by the liberation of all occupied Arabterritories and the full enforcement of all the rights of thePalestinian people — first and foremost being their returnto their homeland  self-determination  and theestablishment of their own independent state in Palestine with Al-Quds as its capital  a state where Arabs and Jewsalike would live together. There is no alternative to thissolution. The solutions being put forward these days regardless of all the talk about how desirable their resultswould be  will not lead to the results aspired to by thePalestinians  simply because those solutions are unrealisticand ignore the facts of history.The continued existence of nuclear weapons and theincreased stockpiling of these and other weapons of massdestruction are among the principal concerns of theinternational community. When the first reviewConference of the States parties to the Non-ProliferationTreaty (NPT) was held in the first half of this year  it washoped that that Conference would lead to satisfactoryresults. However  what actually happened was that certainnuclear Powers brought to bear unprecedented pressuresthat made it possible for the NPT to be extendedindefinitely. My country declared its opposition to thisextension  and we remain convinced that extending theTreaty in that manner would never serve the objective ofnuclear-weapon disarmament.The NPT has not achieved universality  and its manyshortcomings have not been properly addressed. In ourview  ridding the world of nuclear terror will not beachieved through gains obtained by manoeuvres andunconventional measures  but rather through seriousmeasures  which must be taken by the nuclear States. Inthis context  the procurement of nuclear materials must beended  and nuclear States must commit themselves to adeadline for the complete elimination of all nuclearweapons. These States should put an end to nuclear testsand conclude  at the earliest possible time  acomprehensive test-ban treaty. Furthermore  the nuclear15States should demonstrate the political will required toconclude an effective treaty guaranteeing the security andsafety of non-nuclear States.Another situation that requires speedy corrective actioninvolves the unjustified restriction on the transfer tonon-nuclear States of nuclear technology for peacefulpurposes. Above all  measures should be taken to guaranteethe universality of the NPT. My country attaches thegreatest importance to this issue  because the region towhich we belong suffers from a security imbalance  owingto the Israelis’ tremendous nuclear capability — they havemore than 200 nuclear warheads and nuclear facilities thatare not subjected to international inspection. This representsa threat to the security and safety of the peoples of theregion. No one should keep silent about a situation of thiskind or accept the extension of the NPT as long as such asituation continues.If the indefinite extension of the NPT is to be with thecomplete support of all  international action must be takento meet all these widely expressed requirements and toguarantee accession by all to the Treaty  including  inparticular  the Israelis  who must agree to subject theirnuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  as well as fixing atimetable for the dismantling and destruction of theirnuclear stockpiles.In reviewing the international economic situation  itbecomes clear that the economic development of mostdeveloping countries  especially in Africa  is still sluggishand subject to fluctuations and imbalances. The presentindicators give the impression that this situation is likely todeteriorate further unless effective measures are taken toreverse it. The fact is that the economic difficulties of thedeveloping countries are not the result of a lack oflegislation or plans. For example  Africa has adopted plansand strategies to promote development and has concludeda treaty that aims at economic integration. However  theproblem lies in the unjust criteria still prevalent ininternational economic relations. These require realistic andresponsible solutions without the imposition of politicallymotivated conditions.The conferences that have been held over the past fewyears have created new opportunities to improve theprevailing economic and social situation. We hope that theconsensus agreements emanating from those conferenceswill generate the necessary political will for theimplementation of the resolutions taken by those and otherinternational forums  including the commitments announcedduring the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development. What is more urgent is the need totake immediate action to address the external causes ofeconomic deterioration in developing countries  namelythe increasing tendency towards protectionism  decliningterms of trade  shrinking official development assistanceand restrictions on the transfer of technology.In addition  it is necessary to deal with unjustpractices in international economic relations such ascoercive economic measures  including boycotts  thefreezing of assets  the confiscation of property and theprohibition of the export of spare parts  which has beenapplied by certain developed countries against a numberof developing countries  including my own. Suchmeasures not only impede development and run counterto the Charter of the United Nations  to the resolutions ofthe General Assembly and to the orientation towards theestablishment of a system of international economicrelations based on justice and fairness  but also constitutea violation of the norms of international law. The Westerncountries that manufacture the needed spare parts  medicalsupplies and water-desalination and power-generatingequipment  by taking such coercive measures  violate theircommitments under free-trade agreements. This shouldserve as a warning to whoever deals with those countries because there is no guarantee that such measures will notbe applied to them as well.Last year and the year before  wide-rangingdiscussions were held on the restructuring of the UnitedNations. These discussions have shown that there is aneed to review and change the procedures and methods ofwork of the Security Council so that it may be able toseriously and fairly address questions that touch oninternational peace and security. During the meetings ofthe Working Group established by the General Assemblyto look into the question of equitable representation inand increase in the membership of the Security Council as well as into other related matters  my country declaredits support of the call for enhancing the powers of theGeneral Assembly  including giving it the right to dealwith questions of peace and security in the world  inconformity with the provisions of the Charter. My countryreiterates its conviction that reforming the SecurityCouncil and increasing its membership should be part andparcel of an integrate process of reform that must beguided by the principles of the sovereign equality ofStates  equitable geographical distribution and the need todemocratize the procedures and methods applied in theSecurity Council  including the process ofdecision-making.16Libya has been among the first to call for theelimination of all the obstacles that hamper the work of theSecurity Council  particularly  the veto power. Today mycountry takes satisfaction in the fact that this call  whichLibya made 20 years ago  now has the support of manycountries. This shows that those countries have nowbecome convinced that there is no longer any justificationfor the power of the veto and that its continued existencebreaches one of the principles of the United Nations namely  the equality of States. It is that veto power whichimpedes all efforts aimed at the democratization of themembership and functions of United Nations bodies.Since becoming a Member of the United Nations  mycountry has played an active role in and contributed tomany achievements of which the Organization can beproud. My country will also contribute to whatever theOrganization seeks to achieve in the future. Based on this we have actively participated in the internationalConferences recently organized by the United Nations onpopulation  social development  human rights  and women.This we did in the same spirit that inspires our country’sinternational activities at other levels. That is why Libyahas participated in all efforts aimed at strengthening theArab Maghreb Union. We are proud to see that this Unionhas advanced steadily and has taken serious initiatives toserve the peoples of the Union and to protect their gains.Libya works with the same determination to adopt effectivemeasures to enhance cooperation and strengthen confidenceand security in the Mediterranean region in order to removethe causes of tensions there. This includes our efforts toclose foreign military bases in the Mediterranean region andto secure the withdrawal of military fleets from its waters.Proceeding from its positions of principle  Libya has beenat the forefront of the defenders of the aspirations ofpeoples  whether in the field of decolonization  theprotection and maintenance of human rights  or theenhancement of the role principles of justice and fairnessshould play in international relations.Libya has also sought to solve a number of regionaldisputes by peaceful means. In this spirit  it has undertakenseveral mediation missions including  for example assistance in solving the problems in the southernPhilippines and helping to arrest the deterioration of thedispute between Sudan and Uganda  as well as thosebetween Nigeria and Cameroon and Greece and Turkey.Libya has also contributed to efforts aimed at halting theescalation of the dispute between India and Pakistan  andhas helped in containing events in north Niger and Mali.In this current session in particular  Libya takespride in the fact that these positions have had wide-ranging effects that were reflected in the trust placed inmy country by Arab States and the group of AfricanStates which unanimously nominated Libya to themembership of the Security Council for the coming twoyears. While expressing its high appreciation of this Araband African stand  Libya would like to thank  in advance all the countries that will support our candidature for thatseat. We should also like to confirm to everybody thatLibya will support all efforts aimed at the realization ofthe purposes of the United Nations and  in cooperationwith members of the Security Council and other membersof the Organization  will work to enhance the role of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peaceand security  and in closing ranks with other countries infacing up to the dangers that threaten peace and securityin the world.At the beginning of this statement  I said that thissession of the General Assembly had a specialsignificance. This is due to the fact that we believe thatthe historical occasion under the aura of which thissession convenes  namely  the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  will afford us all anopportunity that should be seized — an opportunity torealize peace  security and prosperity for humanity.In our view  the starting point in this direction liesin hard work to establish the structure of a newinternational order. Such an order  however  should not bebuilt according to the wishes of the few who seek toimpose their hegemony on others in deciding the fate ofthe world  and to dictate their own methods of dealingwith international relations.The new order that would satisfy us all should bebuilt on the common aspirations of all. It should be anorder that guarantees full equality to all countries; anorder that must respect the free political  economic andsocial choices of all peoples. The new order shouldprotect and enhance human rights. It should createconditions conducive to the settlement of disputes andconflicts and to the resolution of differences among Statesby peaceful means. It should be an order which providessecurity and stability  and should make it possible for allnations to aspire after development and to be optimisticabout the future. This new order should embody the nobleconcepts and ideals enshrined in the Charter; namely  theneed to unite our strength to save humanity from thescourge of war  to realize justice  to respect theobligations arising from treaties and other sources of17international law  and to promote better standards of life ingreater freedom."
"94",4093,"LCA",50,1995,"The island State of SaintLucia shares the sense of history and the mantle ofresponsibility that falls over the General Assembly on this the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations.We must exult in the realization that a vague dream ofpeace in the aftermath of a world war has in five decadesfirmed into a solid commitment by 185 nations to shoulderthe burden of the global community  embracing everyaspect of life around the world.The elevation of Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfiftieth session is a distinct honour to his country and atimely recognition of the high esteem in which he is heldby his colleagues in the international arena.During this dramatic and exciting half century theGeneral Assembly has had its task cut out for it as it hasbeen called upon to deal with disruptions arising fromhuman failing  and often from human folly  which havethreatened to obstruct the path towards the fulfilment of theideals of the United Nations. However  some of theOrganization’s finest moments have occurred in this halfcentury — none more historic than when we presided overthe liquidation of apartheid and saw established themultiracial State of South Africa. We have seen the end ofthe conflict in Namibia  with the hope that this brings forthe economic and social progress of its people. We havemonitored the collapse of the Berlin wall. We have seendemocracy in Haiti. We have been able to deter aggressionaimed at fulfilling territorial ambitions  even while we havebeen able to encourage the prospects for peace in theMiddle East.Any inclination that we may have nurtured towardsself-congratulation is  however  arrested by events like theslaughter in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda  the“ethnic cleansing” operations in Bosnia and Herzegovinaand the seeming difficulty of ending the conflict. We arereminded by these events of the task that still lies ahead ofus in fulfilling the dream of a better world.We take pride in speaking of the equality of Membernations irrespective of size  and indeed have gone a longway towards ensuring such equality. We have admiredhow extremely large and very small nations have had theopportunity to contribute equally to the deliberations ofthe Assembly and to its decision-making process. Thereare however a number of impediments which still militateagainst smaller nations such as ours.The confrontational posture of the cold war hadgiven a strategic prominence to small States  then usefulas pawns in the global chess game between super-Powers.Now that the small States have outlived their usefulnessas honest brokers in the super-Power game  the alteredpolitical circumstances have left them stranded andmarginalized.The pious promises of the developed world toallocate a minuscule percentage of national income to theprovision of aid for the developing world have shrunk tonon-fulfilment; the thought of the strong economieshelping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun.Saint Lucia has experienced a dramatic decline ingrant assistance — by almost 50 per cent between thefinancial years 1993-1994 and 1994-1995; but we can illafford to sit around and merely moan. We recognize andaccept that we must use the fact of diminished aid toincreasingly spur on our own efforts towards greaterefficiency and increased productivity. But in strivingtowards the achievement of this end  we find ourselves upagainst multinational trading interests intent on adding tothe maw of their already well-nourished entities themorsels of trade on which the survival of our economydepends.The European Union banana regime came into forcein June 1993 as part of the process of creating a singleEuropean market  replacing a series of long-standingnational arrangements between individual member Statesand traditional banana suppliers. The United States itselfhas led the way in instituting various national andinternational arrangements in the interests of its ownfarming community. The existing banana regime seeks toensure that demand for bananas across the EuropeanUnion is satisfied  while at the same time providingtraditional suppliers of bananas to Europe fromdeveloping countries in Africa  the Caribbean and thePacific with continued access to the European market at5viable price levels. In doing so the European Union fulfilsa legal commitment under the Lomé Convention  that isthat the introduction of the single market should placetraditional suppliers in no worse a position than in the past.That is achieved by a combination of tariff quotas andlicences which ensure that suppliers from the African Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) maintain — but cannotincrease — their market share of approximately 15 per centof the total European Union demand for bananas. Thisfacility is not aimed at victimizing United States firms orindeed firms of any particular nationality. This is clearlydemonstrated by the fact that over 60 per cent of theEuropean Union’s market demand for bananas is satisfiedby fruit imported from Central and South America principally by three United States multinationals. It isimportant to note that the Caribbean’s share of the worldmarket for bananas is a paltry 3 per cent compared to themore than 70 per cent share of dollar bananas  mostlycontrolled by these multinationals.There is general nervousness and a creeping instabilitythreatening the Caribbean banana-growing States resultingfrom the decision of the United States Trade Representativeto pursue Section 301 action in response to an applicationby Chiquita Brands International and the Hawaii BananaIndustry Association challenging the European bananaimport regime. We have since been advised that the UnitedStates Government is to pursue a complaint against theregime within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Sincethe banana industry accounts for about 50 per cent of thedomestic exports of the Windward Islands and around 90per cent of all agricultural earnings in Saint Lucia andDominica  it is indisputable that the collapse of the industrywhich would accompany any tampering with the regimewould have a disastrous impact on the economies of thesevery small countries.In addition  the interdependence of CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) trading arrangements would  inthe circumstances  produce a ripple of economic downturnand accompanying social unrest and political instabilitythroughout the CARICOM region. The resulting prospect ofmassive unemployment  displaced family wage earnings andan escalation in criminal and drug activity is too horrific tocontemplate. The Caribbean must call on the good senseand high ideals of this body to use whatever influence ithas at its disposal to avert this looming danger. The UnitedNations may well consider it useful to develop a frameworkof international review and regulation with respect to theactivities and policies of transnational corporations  whichare becoming increasingly influential actors on the worldscene.There is little need to emphasize the openness andvulnerability of Caribbean economies. We are exposed tothe fury of natural disasters  as was evidenced by thehavoc wrought by Tropical Storm Debbie  from whichSaint Lucia is still recovering; the recent demolition ofAntigua and Saint Kitts by Hurricane Luis; and thedevastation of St. Croix  St. Thomas  St. Maarten andDominica by Hurricane Marilyn.With severe limitations of size and resources  we arenow called upon to come to terms with changes broughtabout by the process of liberalization and its requirementto be competitive globally; we are therefore forced todiversify our interests in reaction to the liberalization andderegulation processes which are taking place in theinternational marketplace. The classical response calls forrestructuring aimed at economic diversification accompanied of course by increasing efficiency andproductivity.In terms of diversification the services sector holdsattractions. In this context many of our countries areanxious to explore the field of offshore financial servicesto enhance the Governments’ revenue base. We are however  alert to the dangers associated with that sectorand  while pursuing the benefits to be derived from suchinstitutions  we must be ever on guard for white-collarcriminals who  as part of their everyday activity  laundertheir ill-gotten gains through the international financialsystems  using both public- and private-sector capitalprojects for this purpose. Quite often the strategiesemployed by quasi-investors to launder their wealth areboth innovative and sophisticated and require equallysophisticated systems to deal with their ingeniousmalpractices. Our growing States are not yet able toacquire the kind of resources to engage in a full-fledgedwar against such nefarious institutions.Admittedly  the 1988 United Nations ViennaConvention has sought to criminalize the laundering ofmoney derived from the illicit drug trade. But it is crucialthat our countries in the Caribbean area take a positivestand to enforce the law and protect our communitiesfrom these destructive practices. In this context international financial institutions should use theirinfluence  through moral suasion  to encourage membercountries  as a matter of urgency  to adopt the measuresnecessary to achieve the objectives of the 40recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force. In6the Caribbean area our CARICOM colleagues will no doubtembrace the nineteen recommendations of the CaribbeanFinancial Action Task Force.In the course of the year  our country attracted someattention in respect of irregularities surrounding the use ofthe Pérez-Guerrero Trust Fund. We did not flinch from thecostly decision to appoint a full commission of inquiry inour anxiety to ensure the fullest possible accountability. Inthese trying times  when cynics are ready to decry theachievements of the United Nations and besmirch itsidealism  it is the bounden duty of all Member States towash off the stains of calumny and allow the ideals principles and performance of this illustrious body tocontinue to inspire the world. The Phillips Commissioncleared both the Saint Lucia Government and the organs ofthe United Nations of any complicity or blame in the affair.This experience  however  points to the need for being onconstant guard against those who without scruples wouldseek to compromise the traditions and the integrity ofgovernment and of this body.The end of the cold war has left many countriesstranded on the beachhead of marginalization. In thecontext of the Caribbean  we are learning to deal with ourisolation by exploring new internal alliances designed tofoster pride in our patrimony  reduce our vulnerability  poolour human resources and intensify our self-reliance. Thelogic of this internationalization is to strengthen the linksbetween us in the Eastern Caribbean  within the context ofthe Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)  evenwhile we consolidate the process of the closer integrationof the Caribbean Community. The circle of integrationexpands in a growing relationship with countries in thewider Caribbean basin and the countries of Latin America.This new thrust of integration has found expression in therecently established Association of Caribbean States  whichlinks the countries of Central and South America  as wellas other Caribbean countries such as Haiti  the DominicanRepublic and Cuba. We will  however  within the LoméConvention  maintain our long and valuable historical linkswith Europe even while  by implementing the decisions ofthe Summit of the Americas  we seek to expand andconsolidate our hemispheric ties.This new Caribbean initiative has much to recommendit. The concept cuts clear across the barriers of race language and culture to establish a market of 204 millionpeople with an annual trade volume of $180 billion andestablishes a regional base from which competitive strengthmay be developed for dealing in the global arena.In the case of Haiti  we can now look hopefullyforward with new confidence to the restoration ofdemocracy in an environment of peace and stability. Thenew setting should pave the way for the Haitian people’sachievement of economic  social and political well-being.The re-establishment of democratic order leaves Haitipoised to play a greater role  in concert with itsCARICOM colleagues  in helping shape the newinternational order. The United States of America  theCARICOM grouping and the United Nations itself canfeel satisfied over and take pride in the fact that theirsustained interest and cooperation have led to thepromotion of Haiti’s rehabilitation and economicdevelopment. Saint Lucia renews its commitment tosupport the consolidation of the hard-won gains in Haitiin the hope that the country will finally enjoy the fruits ofdemocracy  with full respect accorded the inalienablerights of its people.In the case of Cuba  we are firmly convinced thatthe cause of democracy can best be served by thediffusion of its values through association and exampleand not in a process of isolation. That is why Saint Luciajoins its Caribbean colleagues in calling for an end to theeconomic blockade of Cuba so as to allow that Caribbeancountry the flexibility to develop the creativity of itspeople and pursue its Caribbean destiny.The winds of change which blew across Africa inthe fifties were fuelled by a strong pan-Africanism. It isgenerally known that the ideas which generated theliberation struggles in Africa came out of the cross-fertilization of the ideas of African and Caribbeanthinkers. Caribbean thinkers like Saint Lucia’s Nobellaureate  Sir Arthur Lewis  and others  such as C.L.R.James and George Padmore  were strong influences onpersons like Kwame Nkrumah  Jomo Kenyatta and SékouTouré. This historic link between the Caribbean andAfrica must continue  especially at a time when the entireinternational community is deeply concerned about thecritical economic and political conditions in Africa as awhole. Our Secretary-General has openly expressed hisdeep concern for the problems of Africa and the need forthis body to give them its urgent consideration.At its fiftieth session  the General Assembly mustact in concert with the Secretary-General in giving highpriority to programmes of action for African recovery anddevelopment. The United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s must be pursuedurgently and vigorously. In this anniversary year  SaintLucia will pursue a conscious policy of establishing7diplomatic relations with a number of African countries with a view not only to stimulating trade and culturalexchanges  but  indeed  to recovering and stimulating thatvital interchange of ideas.Saint Lucia is strongly supportive of the peace processin the Middle East  which started with the signing on4 May 1994 of the first implementation agreement of theDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Governmentbetween the Government of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization. The second phase of the agreementwas signed on 28 September this year. The agreementbetween Israel and Jordan has deepened the processconsiderably. It is our fervent hope that the skirmishesbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis will not derail thepeace process in the Middle East. We further urge thecountries of the region to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons for the long-term stabilityand development of the region.In preceding sessions of the Assembly  my country hasdrawn attention to the Republic of China on Taiwan’srequest to take its rightful place within this family ofnations. Our support for this request in no way implies anattack on the sovereignty of the People’s Republic ofChina  nor is it meant to vitiate the intention of resolution2758 (XXVI).My country is acutely aware of the need to protect thefundamental principles of our institutions  but it is notbeyond the creativity of the Assembly to play a catalystrole in resolving the impasse between the Republic ofChina and the People’s Republic of China. Recent militarymanoeuvres in the Taiwan Straits provide an eerie warningof the possibility of deteriorating relations between the twocountries. The Assembly should not wash its hands of theissues like Pilate  but should exhaust the possibilities ofpreventive diplomacy rather than live to bemoan the tragedyof inaction.Saint Lucia continues to be of the view that Taiwan’spresence in the United Nations will help to further the goalsand ideals of our Organization. Saint Lucia’s support forTaiwan’s bid for a seat in this body is in the knowledgethat this does not preclude the eventuality of reunification.As we stand on the threshold of a new century  at thevery same time as we are presented with an anniversaryopportunity to look back on a half-century of UnitedNations activity  two vital processes loom large in theperception of small States. These processes aredisarmament and decolonization.It is our wish that the process of arms reductioncontinue to gain momentum and to stabilize at a level thatwill ensure the easing of tensions and conflicts wheneverand wherever they are waged around the globe. Attentionmust be focused on those countries which devote largeslices of their national budgets to arms purchases andproduction while numerous areas of the world languish inpoverty and disease. Civil and external wars could occurin regions where the possession of advanced weaponry such as medium-range missiles with chemical  biologicalor even nuclear warheads  by ambitious and threatenedregimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect. The searchfor peace is the most compelling rationale for theexistence of the United Nations  and the indefiniteextension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  together withcomplete disarmament and the total eradication ofchemical weapons  will be the greatest global contributionto a new world order. Saint Lucia has already ratified theTreaty of Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of NuclearWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean.With regard to the process of decolonization  thetarget date of the year 2000 set by the United Nations forthe total eradication of colonialism is to be borne in mind.In this context  the United Nations should continue topromote the idea that referendums and other forms ofpopular consultation on the future status of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are appropriate means ofascertaining the wishes of the people in this matter.As the United Nations has grown in scope andcomplexity over these past 50 years  so too have theproblems and complexities assumed new dimensions. Wehave seen floods of refugees escaping civil wars all overthe globe  but now we are faced with the prospect ofenvironmental refugees fleeing from disaster areas andnatural catastrophes. Without wishing to sound like aprophet of doom  I must say that the possible effect ofglobal warming upon agriculture in the developing worldis a further cause of concern. In recent months we havefaced the relentless fury of hurricanes  rising sea levelsand  in the case of Montserrat  one of our smallCaribbean island neighbours  the threat of volcaniceruption.We appreciate that these unfolding problems havenot escaped the attention of the United Nations. Theforty-second session of the General Assembly designatedthe 1990s as the International Decade for Natural DisasterReduction  and a Plan of Action was adopted in May1994 by the World Conference on Natural DisasterReduction. Our small countries view the transfer of8technology in respect of early warning systems  monitoringdevices and up-to-date research on safer constructionmethods as a matter of urgent priority. While we aregrateful for the short-term assistance given to such disasterareas  it is vital that we should also focus on the long-termgoals of preparedness and prevention.The question of equitable representation and anincrease in the membership of the Security Council wasincluded in the agenda of the thirty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly  in 1979  the same year Saint Luciajoined this Organization  and the same year that themembership of the United Nations was tripled  from 51original members to 152 members.During the 16 years since 1979 we have been callingfor an increase in the membership of the Security Council especially of developing countries  to reflect the increasedmembership of the United Nations and the reality of itscomposition. Repetition is necessary to emphasize theimportance of the point that the policy-making arm of theUnited Nations should reflect the diversity and universalityof the membership of this body and uphold the principle ofequitable representation that the Charter embodies.Saint Lucia continues to support the recommendationthat the relationship between the General Assembly and theSecurity Council should be strengthened. We also supportthe view that the process of briefing and consultationshould be institutionalized  that the privilege of veto shouldbe phased out and that the efforts at developing greatertransparency and predictability should continue. Saint Luciawill work with and support the efforts of our regional groupand of the Non-Aligned Movement to achieve theseobjectives. It is our hope that  in this fiftieth year  we shallexercise the courage and willingness needed to bring aboutthe overdue changes and reform of the Council.Saint Lucia has taken the opportunity of the fiftiethanniversary to reflect deeply on the role of smallmarginalized States in the family of nations. We haveendured the ravages of a colonial past  been exploited bymultinational corporations  divided by the sea andhamstrung by a desperate shortage of resources.Today a new vision unfolds. We cannot hope toconquer worlds as the early Conquistadors did. There areno worlds to conquer  but worlds to recreate. In thisrecreation of the post-cold-war world  there aredisappearing divisions between States once sworn enemiesin a drive to adjust to the dictates of the new worldeconomic order. The interdependence of nations ishighlighted against the background of diseases whichthreaten the world  and the potential for destruction of thevery environment which guarantees the survival ofmankind.These problems to be resolved must be approachedthrough the collective means available within this body.However  solutions to be effective must take account ofdifferences in size  in resources and in the culturaldiversity of those who are to benefit from them.Practicality must take precedence over mere dogma and idealism must not be allowed to lose ground to anarrowness of realism that pays little heed tocircumstances. Saint Lucia sees the United Nations as asolid bulwark for the creation of a new order. Itscommitment to world peace  human rights  genderequality  racial equality and sustainable development forthe peoples of the world is the touchstone of ouraspirations.My country stands prepared to assist in the retoolingand reshaping of the organs of the United Nations toenable it to face the global challenges which lie ahead ofus. These challenges are as demanding of Member Statesas they are of the organs of the United Nations. Our focuswill be to work in concert with our colleagues in theCaribbean Community and our colleagues in theAssociation of Caribbean States to increase our efficiencyand productivity with a view to playing a full role in theinternational arena. We will explore with other MemberStates ideas for fostering a new ethos in the internationalforum  in which size  wealth and influence will besubordinated to the concourse of ideas.Finally  Saint Lucia will endeavour to join the globalsearch for a more relevant and edifying system of valueswhich will inspire generations of young people toembrace the concerns which five decades ago motivatedthe founding fathers of this noble Organization."
"95",4120,"LIE",50,1995,"I should like to begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fiftieth session. At thesame time  I wish to thank your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy.We are meeting this year at a crucial moment in thehistory of the United Nations. The fiftieth anniversary ofthe Organization should be an occasion on which toreview the first half-century of the United Nations  butalso  first and foremost  to prepare the Organization for itsfuture activities and to address the manifold challengesthat are ahead of us.While we commemorate the United Nations fiftiethanniversary  Liechtenstein is celebrating its fifth year ofmembership in the Organization. When Liechtenstein wasadmitted to the United Nations  the global situation wasundergoing fundamental changes. People around the worldhoped that the Organization would be able to work in acomprehensive and more efficient way towards fulfillingthe purposes assigned to it under the Charter. Many ofthese hopes have remained unfulfilled. The optimism thatprevailed at the beginning of the post-cold-war era hasturned into sometimes heavy criticism and a decreasingconfidence in the work of the United Nations. Thiscriticism is not always justified and is sometimes basedon a lack of understanding of the functioning of theUnited Nations or  more often  on a one-sided approachto its activities.The achievements of the Organization in the areas ofdevelopment  humanitarian assistance  the promotion andprotection of human rights and the strengthening andfurther development of international law  to name only afew  are unique and undeniable. However  it remains afact that events of the recent past have undermined thecredibility of the United Nations in the eyes of manypeople  and we have to make every effort to restore andenhance the confidence of the peoples that we represent.We must only look back in order to make the best use ofthe experience we have acquired over the past 50 yearsand to enable the Organization to respond effectively tothe new challenges it faces today.The financial situation of the Organization is beyondany doubt one of the issues that need to be addressedurgently. After many years of serious financial problems we have reached a stage where the work of the UnitedNations itself is in jeopardy. Drastic measures had to betaken recently to guarantee the continuation of its dailywork. It is of the utmost importance  however  that no9General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995measures be taken which affect the nature and theefficiency of United Nations activities  which are urgentlyneeded. The efforts to improve and to monitor theadministrative and management capabilities must becontinued and further enhanced. All Member States have topay their assessed contributions fully and on time if adurable solution to the current crisis is to be found. We areconfident that the Working Group that you  Mr. President will be chairing  will produce fruitful results.The increasing financial burden that peace-keepingoperations impose on national budgets must be alleviated.We are of the opinion that a proliferation of peace-keepingoperations has to be avoided  and I wish to emphasize thatthe concept of preventive diplomacy deserves even moreattention than it has received until now.It is obvious that the world has changed. It is alsoobvious that the challenges for the United Nations havechanged. For these reasons  changes have to be madewithin the Organization in order to enable it to cope withthese challenges. We therefore support the efforts to reform modernize and restructure the United Nations and welcomethe process that has been initiated to that effect.Many people wrongly identify the United Nations onlywith the activities of and the decisions taken by theSecurity Council. While we must work together in order topromote understanding and knowledge of other UnitedNations activities  which are equally important  we alsohave to understand that issues of international peace andsecurity directly or emotionally affect people all over theworld. We therefore have to make every effort to enhancethe effectiveness and the credibility of the work of theCouncil. A limited expansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership and improved working methods  aswell as enhanced transparency  would certainly make animportant contribution in this respect. As a small country we follow the activities of the pertinent Working Groupwith particular interest. We are of the view that the workdone so far has been very substantial. However  many ofthe sensitive questions require further discussions.Liechtenstein  like many other countries  has to rely onthe universal respect for international law. The UnitedNations has made remarkable contributions to the furtherdevelopment and strengthening of international law. Theadoption of new legal instruments in important areas however  sharply conflicts with continued and sometimessystematic violations of international law  particularly in thefield of human rights  and of international humanitarianlaw. The establishment of the international ad hoc Tribunalsfor the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda can prove to be animportant element in preventing the recurrence of suchviolations. It is essential that  for the first time since theTribunals of Nuremberg and of Tokyo  individuals beheld responsible for violations of internationalhumanitarian law. We hope that the work of theseTribunals will be effective and will contribute to the earlyestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.The Liechtenstein Government welcomes the historicdecision to make the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) permanent. We have come onestep closer to the overall elimination of nuclear weapons and we express our most fervent hope that the NPT willvery soon become universal. We therefore appeal to thoseStates which have not yet ratified the Treaty to do sourgently. We further express our hope that the next stepwill be the early conclusion of a comprehensive nucleartest-ban treaty. Liechtenstein deplores the fact that nucleartests are still going on and urges all nuclear-weaponStates to refrain from any further testing.One of the most remarkable and uncontested meritsof the United Nations in its first 50 years lies in the fieldof self-determination. While some people seem to thinkthat these activities of the Organization are a closedchapter that belongs to the past  others  including theGovernment of Liechtenstein  are of the view that thepotential of the right to self-determination has not beenexhausted and offers possibilities to cope with manyconflict situations all over the world. We are convincedthat the right to self-determination deserves furtherdiscussion and development within the United Nations.Liechtenstein has therefore  within the framework of itsnational activities for the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary  organized two international conferences thisyear dedicated to this subject. We hope that we cancontinue to count on the Organization’s interest in thismatter  which is of crucial importance for the fulfilmentof its purposes.The Fourth World Conference on Women  whichconcluded in Beijing three weeks ago  reaffirmed that thehuman rights of women and of the girl child are anintegral part of universal human rights. The LiechtensteinGovernment welcomes the fact that the Conference agreedon a wide range of measures to remove the remainingobstacles to women’s full and equal participation in allspheres of life. The Beijing Declaration and Platform forAction contain a comprehensive plan for the internationalcommunity to promote the status of women  to theultimate benefit of society as a whole. It gives me10General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995pleasure to announce that the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Womenhas recently been submitted to the Liechtenstein Parliamentfor approval.The fiftieth anniversary cannot be an occasion for self-congratulation. However impressive the achievements however disappointing the failures  one thing is certain:there is no alternative to the United Nations  and allMember States have to work together to make theOrganization stronger and more efficient. The Governmentof Liechtenstein remains committed to this goal."
"96",4167,"LKA",50,1995,"Let me at the outsetextend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal the sinceregood wishes of the Government and people of Sri Lanka onhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly atthis its historic fiftieth session. We are privileged to havehim guide its deliberations. My delegation offers him thesame full cooperation that we extended to all hispredecessors in that high office.Our gratitude is due Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire who presided over the forty-ninth session with great skilland wisdom.When I addressed the Assembly last year  I reportedthat the people of Sri Lanka had secured an electoralvictory for“moderation  tolerance and unity” (Official Records ofthe General Assembly  Forty-ninth Session  PlenaryMeetings  5th meeting  p. 23)in a society that had passed through harrowing times. Idetailed the initiatives taken by the Government ofPresident Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga supported by a number of political parties  including thoseof the two principal minority communities  to resolveoutstanding ethnic and other disputes through a boldprocess of political negotiation. That process waslaunched  but later encountered set-backs  primarilybecause one of the groups with which the Governmenthad commenced talks abruptly returned to violence andterrorism  rejecting the peaceful option to which the restof the country is committed. The Government has beenconstrained to take unavoidable reactive military measuresto safeguard the lives  the security and the welfare ofthose who are threatened by the terrorist group. So longas they aim at our leaders the threat of assassination  wecannot believe that their professions of peace are sincere.We continue to fulfil our obligations to all ourcitizens  including those trapped in the north of thecountry. Supplies of food and other essential requirementsare being made available by the Government anddelivered through the International Committee of the RedCross to our citizens in affected areas. This is anexceptional exercise which the late James Grant of theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) described asuniquely humanitarian in a conflict situation.We are deeply troubled and concerned about thesituation in which the children of the north and east ofour country are placed. That mankind owes to the childthe best it has to give is universally accepted. Yet we areappalled that in their desperation the militants  spurningthe entreaties of distraught parents  have descended toconscripting children as young in age as 10 years to wagewar and have even assigned them to suicide missions. Arecent military encounter in north-eastern Sri Lankarevealed grim evidence confirming our worst fears. Mostof the lives sacrificed by the leadership of the militantswere teenagers barely able to carry arms  let aloneunderstand the twisted mono-ethnic separatist ideologythey have been indoctrinated to defend. In truth  it is themilitants who must bear the ultimate responsibility forcivilian casualties in this conflict. One of the challengesof peace that Sri Lanka will soon have to face is the needto overcome the terrible legacy of the subverted anddistorted young minds  of the broken  bereft families andinterrupted lives that the conflict will leave behind.All this has only increased my Government’sdetermination to fulfil an imperative mandate from thepeople  to rebuild a free society in our Republic which is23based on tolerance and understanding and in which allcommunities throughout the nation could live in harmonyand dignity in accordance with the principles of democraticgovernance. The Government has accordingly presentedcomprehensive proposals  daring in their scope and reach for the devolution of power to regional units. True to ourlong-established democratic tradition  a free-rangingnational debate among Sri Lankans is proceeding on theseproposals. The eventual implementation of agreed proposalswill require compliance with the procedures appropriate forthe amendment of our Constitution  including a two-thirdsmajority in Parliament and a national referendum.To help further enhance conditions of confidence forthe observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms my Government has presented legislation in Parliament toestablish a Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. TheCommission will consist of members chosen from amongpersons with knowledge and experience in the field ofhuman rights. They will be appointed on therecommendation of a Constitutional Council — anindependent and widely representative body reflecting allshades of political opinion. The proposed Commission willhave monitoring functions in respect of executive andadministrative practices as well as investigative functions toinquire into any infringement of fundamental rights. It willalso have advisory and other functions  inter alia  to ensurethat laws and administrative practices accord withinternational human-rights norms and standards and tofacilitate inexpensive access to remedial relief. Sri Lankahas consistently supported United Nations initiatives fornational institution-building in the field of human rights.It has been a source of major encouragement to us thatthe international community has supported the efforts of theGovernment of Sri Lanka in the pursuit of peace. While theeventual solution of our problems lies essentially in ourown hands and through mechanisms of our own devising we sincerely appreciate the interest and support of theinternational community. It is in this context that I havevolunteered today to brief the Assembly on the situation inSri Lanka.The significance of this session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly extends well beyond the fact that itcommemorates 50 years in the life of the Organization.International life is in constant flux. No era is wholly static.Yet the last decade or so has seen radical changes affectingvirtually every aspect of life on this planet. Not all of suchchanges have been welcome. Not all of the changes havereached their logical  or indeed illogical  conclusion.The acclaimed transformation in South Africa hasbeen a blessed exception. Institutionalized racism in itsgrosser forms has at last been vanquished. The SouthAfrican experience has demonstrated the power oftolerance  understanding and inspired leadership to weardown the brutal  evil legacies of the past. It has alsoshown that there is a capacity for change in humanattitudes once considered unthinkable. Racism  however has continued in subtler forms elsewhere in the world.The international community must continue to be vigilant.That ugly phenomenon must never be tolerated  whereverit occurs and whatever its manifestations.Sri Lanka feels deeply that the African continentneeds the wholehearted and vigorous support of theinternational community to overcome the obstacles todevelopment and growth in this vital region of the world.The strengthening and utilization of the capacities andresources of Africa  identified by the African countriesthemselves and the Economic Commission for Africa  andconcerted action to implement the Programme of Actionfor the Least-Developed Countries are urgently called for.The Middle East is the cradle of three of the world’sgreat religions. Yet historical prejudices have weigheddown the quest for peace. Resort to violence andterrorism  the expropriation of land and the developmentof illegal settlements have conspired to impede themomentum for peace. Sri Lanka supports the continuationof the peace process in the Middle East  the realization ofthe inalienable national rights of the Palestinian peopleand the establishment of conditions of peace and stabilityfor all States in the region which would enable them todevelop within secure boundaries. Commitments made oninterim agreements towards this objective  as ChairmanArafat of Palestine stated last Thursday  must be precise honest and mutual.In Bosnia  Sri Lanka welcomes the fact that theparties concerned have found it possible to commencepeace negotiations although the guns have yet to befinally silenced. We feel deeply for  and share the sorrowof  those who mourn for lives lost  lives disrupted in theaffected communities. We hope that a viable settlementacceptable to all will soon be concluded. I had occasionrecently  speaking in the Parliament of Sri Lanka  tocondemn unreservedly the inhumane and cruel treatmentthat has been inflicted upon the Muslims in Bosnia. Theseand other atrocities committed in Bosnia have been fullydocumented by the United Nations rapporteurs andhumanitarian agencies and need to be condemned by theinternational community.24The role of the United Nations in that conflict hasreceived special focus as the Organization  in this its fiftiethyear  undergoes a period of introspection. The situation inBosnia has been an unusually complex one in which theUnited Nations has had to deal with developments withoutprecedent in the Organization’s peace-keeping history. Interms of Article 17 of the United Nations Charter  peace-keeping is the collective financial responsibility of allStates. A healthy  albeit controversial  debate has proceededin the United Nations on peace-keeping and other relatedissues. The debate has made abundantly clear that UnitedNations intervention or involvement in any situation canexpect to be successful only if certain basic considerationsare heeded. First  any intervention must enjoy the generalsupport and confidence of the international community andnot be promoted merely to satisfy the political exigenciesand partisan objectives of members of the Security Councilor other powerful States. Secondly  in any intervention theconsent of the countries in conflict must be clearlyobtained. Finally  such politico-military operations mustneither dominate United Nations activity nor be its principalfinancial liability. They must certainly not be carried out tothe detriment of the pressing development priorities of theUnited Nations.In “An Agenda for Peace” the Secretary-General hassought to evaluate manifold aspects of contemporary peaceand security  not merely the question of peace-keepingoperations. This evaluation has had a continuous focus inthe General Assembly  in the Security Council  in otherforums such as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries aswell as in national debate since the Secretary-General’sinitial report was presented in 1992. The cardinal aspect of“An Agenda for Peace” is the conviction that it is clearlybetter to prevent conflicts through heeding early warningsand encouraging quiet diplomacy rather than throughlaunching major politico-military ventures to settle conflictsafter they have erupted.While economic factors have not always been thecause of conflict  we very much agree with the Secretary-General that the foundations for peace lie primarily in therealm of economic and social development.The 1990s have often been described as a period ofeconomic globalization  considering the increasinginterdependence among States  greater internationalintegration and flow of goods  services  capital and markets as well as a more widespread and rapid dissemination ofinformation and ideas through technological advancementsin communications. Globalization is sometimes over-simplified as a phenomenon favourable to the emancipationof international economic activity. It is true that mosteconomies which had been constricted or centrallycontrolled have now been liberalized and have  as it were plugged in to the global economy. Yet  in the process many developing countries have had to make painfulstructural adjustments in their economies at heavy cost tovulnerable sections of their populations. If there is greateroverall international economic activity  it is also true thatfor many developing countries  despite their best efforts the economic outlook has not been encouraging. Therecent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakartaissued a renewed call for a new orientation betweendeveloped and developing countries whereby constructivedialogue and partnership were emphasized  based on amutuality of interest and benefit  genuine interdependenceand shared responsibility.A major thrust of this approach has been to work outnew practical aspects of international developmentcooperation which would embrace developed as well asdeveloping countries  the more secure economies as wellas those that are more vulnerable. The final communiquéissued earlier this year in Halifax  at the Summit of theseven major industrialized countries  proclaimed theirwillingness to cooperate with others to develop a newapproach to international cooperation and to define theparticular contribution expected of the United Nationssystem to develop such an approach. A vital aspect of thisexercise should be the enhancement of cooperationbetween the United Nations system and the BrettonWoods institutions.Calls made earlier for a restructuring of internationaleconomic relations and a North-South dialogue havefloundered in a sea of slogans. But we must realize thatglobal interdependence has made international cooperationan imperative  not a slogan. The United Nations mustassert its part in a more effective new multilateralism.Almost two decades ago Sri Lanka adopted a liberalfree-market economy in order to accelerate economicgrowth. My Government is taking steps to privatize State-controlled enterprises  in particular utilities and servicesprovided by the Government  and to encourage foreigninvestment. We intend to benefit from the opportunitiesarising from the globalization of economic activity.A number of world conferences have recently beenheld  covering a series of generic issues which have adirect bearing on the lives of people the world over.These have demonstrated both the promise and thepaucity of international cooperation. Agenda 21  produced25by the Rio Conference on Environment and Development is yet to be fully operationalized due to the lack ofnecessary resources. Last year the International Conferenceon Population and Development affirmed the central role ofthe human being in all development and populationactivities. The World Summit for Social Development  heldin March this year in Copenhagen  sought to promoteconcerted international action to deal with a crucial trio ofcontemporary concerns: poverty  unemployment and thedisintegration of society. The World Conference onWomen  in Beijing last month  dealt with a range ofissues — political  social  religious and economic —affecting women and adopted a Platform for Action toempower women.All these conferences have emphasized thatresponsibility for major global problems needs to be sharedand that action to deal with them needs to be taken inconcert. Regrettably  if expectations have been great resources for their realization have been meagre. Thepolitical determination necessary to transform commitmentsinto action still appears far less than adequate.Despite the absence of optimal internationalcooperation in certain areas  some regional activities havemade good progress. In our own region  the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) celebratesits tenth anniversary this year. The SAARC PreferentialTrade Arrangement has made much headway and isexpected to enter into force this year. We look to the futureconfident of consolidating our gains in a South Asian free-trade arrangement. Sri Lanka  together with our SouthAsian partners  will explore all avenues to seek and buildon common ground and optimize regional cooperation inareas of mutual interest. Indeed  cooperation within  as wellas between  regions offers much scope for economicprogress and equitable sharing of global wealth. We lookforward to greater interregional cooperation to advance thisprocess.Sri Lanka was privileged to have served the Reviewand Extension Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to facilitatethe adoption of a package of decisions without resort to avote. While the outcome of the Conference has been widelyhailed  it is vital also to emphasize the need for theestablishment of a comprehensive disarmament regime tomeet the security concerns of all countries  including thenon-nuclear-weapon States  through the realization ofcommitments undertaken under the Treaty and the decisionstaken at the 1995 Conference by the nuclear-weapon States.These commitments include the conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban Treaty  legally binding assurancesto non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat ofuse of nuclear weapons  the unimpeded non-discriminatory transfer of nuclear technology forpeaceful purposes and the eventual elimination of allnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destructionthroughout the world.We have expressed our deep disappointment andconcern over the resumption of nuclear testing by somenuclear Powers  which is contrary to the undertakings ofutmost restraint entered into at the NPT Conference. Wetherefore urge that expeditious negotiations be conductedon a comprehensive test-ban treaty  with a view toconcluding it in 1996. In this regard  we are happy tosupport President Clinton’s initiative to place the Genevanegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty on afaster track in order to achieve a zero-yield test-ban treatyby 1996. We also note the recent assurance in this respectgiven by President Chirac of France.The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones andzones of peace is an essential part of regional security.The non-aligned countries  including Sri Lanka  havesought to establish conditions of peace  security andstability in the Indian Ocean region. The United NationsAd Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  taking intoaccount current realities  has been considering new alternative approaches to ensuring peace and security inthis vital but volatile region of the world. Sri Lanka  asChairman of the Ad Hoc Committee  has been inconsultation with those permanent members of theSecurity Council that have not been participating in theCommittee’s work in order to re-enlist their activeparticipation and give fresh impetus to the process ofstrengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean region including in respect of non-military aspects of security.Sri Lanka’s initiative for Indian Ocean MarineAffairs Cooperation (IOMAC) has focused on thedevelopment of international cooperation in marine affairsin the economic  scientific and technical fields. The recentMauritius and Perth initiatives on the Indian Ocean haverecognized IOMAC’s pioneering effort in helping towiden cooperation in the marine sector. The process forthe formalization of IOMAC through the ratification ofthe 1990 Arusha Agreement on the Organization forIndian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation is being furtheraccelerated in order to provide an effective mechanism forintensifying cooperation  in keeping with the growingaspirations of the countries of the region.26The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations hasspawned a variety of studies on the future of theOrganization  initiated within as well as outside the UnitedNations. Working groups of the General Assembly havebeen busy during recent sessions  studying the financialsituation of the Organization  development issues  theSecurity Council  the Agenda for Peace and other aspectsof the United Nations.The issues are complex. Progress is slow. Decisionsare few. A resolution on the strengthening of the UnitedNations system  patiently negotiated on the initiative of thePresident of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly  was adopted by consensus. There is much tosupport a coordinated  rational and informed examination ofrecommendations which seek to strengthen the UnitedNations and render it a more effective and efficientOrganization. A piecemeal approach may not be aneffective one  given the complexity of the individual issuesinvolved as well as their interrelationship. We look forwardto further work on this initiative next year.The Security Council has perhaps been the single mostcontentious United Nations organ under scrutiny. SriLanka’s own position is that in many respects the Councilstill reflects power realities that prevailed 50 years ago.There can be no warrant for the perpetuation of exclusiverights without accommodation of other relevantconsiderations. A substantial increase in the membership ofthe United Nations  particularly from among developingcounties  needs to be more equitably reflected in thecomposition of the Council as well. Furthermore  there arereasons  at least as compelling as those proclaimed 50 yearsago to justify the status conferred at that time on theCouncil’s five permanent members  to now advance theclaims of other States that aspire to join the five. Thesenew aspirants to permanent-member status include reasonably and justifiably in our view  non-alignedcountries as well. Regrettably  eligibility claims formembership in the Council continue to be made onassumptions of power  military or economic  and its globalor regional projection. But this vitiates basic principlesunderlying democratic representation and considerations ofjustice and equity. If regional criteria are considered  then Asia  Africa and Latin America are either unrepresented orseverely under-represented in the present Council. Finally the veto power  given its untrammelled character and itsassociation with the possession of nuclear weapons  needs in our opinion  careful  sober review.The Security Council’s methods of work have in therecent past been subject to welcome improvement particularly in permitting a better exchange of viewsbetween Council members and others. There is  however much more that needs to be done to make the SecurityCouncil truly accessible  democratic and responsive toMember States of the United Nations  on whose behalfthe Council is meant to act in accordance with Charterprinciples. A single example relating to the impositionand implementation of sanctions would suffice to indicatethe gap between principle and practice. Situations inwhich sanctions are imposed vary greatly and no uniformrules are applicable. Sanctions cannot be applied withsurgical precision to impact exclusively on those at whomthey are aimed. Sanctions can thus hurt innocent civilians affect entire economies and  as the Council itselfacknowledges  impact adversely on third countries that arein no way involved in the transgressions of the regimeagainst which sanctions are imposed. Yet decisions by theCouncil on the imposition of sanctions are not based onprior consultations with the countries concerned  to assesscarefully the true impact  extent and reach of suchextreme measures. As sanctions are mandatory  allcountries are bound to implement them even when theyhave had no part in the decisions leading to them. In his“Supplement to An Agenda for Peace'”  the Secretary-General has made a number of useful recommendationsrelating to the serious problems encountered in theimplementation of sanctions. The non-aligned countrieshave studied these proposals and we await further developments.Later this month  the United Nations will mark itsfiftieth anniversary with a special commemorativemeeting. Although the occasion will  by its very nature embody the highest possible political commitment madeby the international community to the United Nations  itmust not be seen purely as an opportunity for theOrganization to garner a harvest of tributes. Much ails theOrganization. Nevertheless  it is Sri Lanka’s firmconviction that the membership of the United Nations haswithin it the means to reinvest in the Organization all itrequires to fulfil the principles of the Charter. This wouldrequire much more than a symbolic declaration ofcommitment by each Member State. We owe it to thepeople we represent to strive diligently in the years tocome to make this Organization truly a place where thehighest aspirations of humanity can be fulfilled.Tentative programme of work"
"97",4209,"LSO",50,1995,"Mr. President  it affords megreat pleasure to congratulate you on your election todirect the work of this historic session of the GeneralAssembly. Such an honour bears testimony to yourundoubted dynamism and diplomatic skills  which will inno small measure bear on the outcome of the work of thisAssembly.Permit me also to pay tribute to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  of Cote d’Ivoire  for hisoutstanding leadership of the forty-ninth session. Wecongratulate him also on the many initiatives that he tookin the furtherance of the work of our Organization.Lastly  may I refer to the sterling work that theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali  continuesto do against great odds. His report on the work of theOrganization in 1995 has painted in sharp relief theawesome task that faces us at the threshold of a newmillennium and as we enter the second half-century of theUnited Nations existence.The United Nations has been  and will always be the symbol of humankind’s fervent desire to conduct itsaffairs with the purpose of eternal survival. When thedark clouds of war threatened to engulf the world with acatastrophe of unimaginable proportions  humankindfound strength within itself to negate the Armageddon.The pattern of large-scale wars involving many nationshas been reversed  and the worst that we suffered inrecent years was a cold war that was morepsychologically than physically damaging. Happily  thatis now behind us.But  even as we stop to ponder and reflect on thepast  a new pattern of ethnic intra-State conflagrations hasemerged and continues to threaten the very survival ofhumanity. This new scenario has posed a seriouschallenge to the initiatives and peace-keeping capabilitiesof our Organization.The record of the United Nations in the recent pastin peace-keeping has been mixed. We have hadunqualified successes in some places  but then in others4success has eluded us. Our resolve  therefore  has to be toshift the balance in favour of greater success. Ourmachinery for peacemaking and peace-keeping needs to befine-tuned to maximum precision. The implications of thisrequirement are far-reaching and need to be appreciated intheir amplitude.First  the financing of peace-keeping operations mustbe put on a more secure footing. Persistent arrears  such asthose we are currently experiencing  especially when theyare incurred by major Powers  cannot but have an adverseeffect on the morale of the small countries  such as myown  that make great sacrifices to meet their obligations tothe Organization.Secondly  greater attention should be paid to peace-making and preventive diplomacy  thereby reducing theprospects of conflicts  with their attendant costs. In thisregard  the ideas contained in the Secretary-General’sSupplement to An Agenda for Peace merit our closeattention. The strategy of pre-empting the eruption ofconflict is  of course  closely linked to the United Nationsefforts in the fields of social and economic development because it is in the soil of poverty that the seeds of nationalupheavals take root and sprout.Last  but not least  the changed nature of thechallenges facing the Security Council call for therestructuring of that organ to reflect the changed realities ofpresent-day international relations. All the internationalpeace-and-security matters of which the Council is currentlyseized pertain to developing countries or countries intransition. Thus  it is reasonable to suggest that thecomposition of the Security Council should include anappropriate proportion of developing countries in both thepermanent and non-permanent categories.My delegation therefore supports the view that thereform of the Security Council should be in accordancewith the following principles: one  the reform of theSecurity Council must not put in danger its effectiveness but  on the contrary  should strengthen it; two  theenlargement of the Security Council should enhance itsrepresentative character  taking into account the emergenceof new economic and political Powers as well as theincrease of United Nations membership; three  theenlargement of the Security Council should enhanceequitable geographic representation; four  the possibility ofsmaller Member States serving on the Security Councilshould not be diminished; and  lastly  the enlargementshould take place in both categories of permanent and non-permanent members.The Open-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council has continued toaddress the question of the reform of the Council. It isencouraging to note that discussions have shown a generalsupport for the need to increase the membership of theSecurity Council  especially of developing countries  anda subsequent need to review the Council’s composition.The general view is that the size and composition of anexpanded Council should reflect more accurately theuniversal character of the United Nations and present-dayrealities.It has further been recognized that the principle ofthe sovereign equality of all Members of the UnitedNations and the concepts of equitable representation anddistribution  legitimacy  effectiveness and efficiencyshould serve as guiding principles for the reform of theSecurity Council.A number of political questions continue topreoccupy us. In this regard  the leaders and people ofIsrael  Jordan and Palestine deserve our congratulationson having transformed the hopes and goals embodied inthe Middle East peace process into tangible achievements.The people of Israel and the Palestinians have overcomeformidable obstacles. Yet the most difficult and divisiveissues still remain unresolved.The peace process in that area of the Middle East isof the utmost importance and must therefore be negotiatedagainst a backdrop of continuing and satisfactoryprogress. Only that will help give both Israel andPalestine the further confidence needed to make thepolitical decisions that will ultimately achieve a lastingsolution.We also need to urge the international community torespond quickly  appropriately  generously  practically andflexibly to the needs of the Palestinian people.Achievements must match expectations.In the tragic situation of the former Yugoslavia  theGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina must becommended for accepting the peace proposal of the five-nation Contact Group  which has been endorsed by theSecurity Council. This peace proposal  as recentdevelopments have indicated  does not sufficientlyrespond to the requirements of justice and equity  but weare none the less encouraged by a number of positivedevelopments that have taken place.5We therefore urge the international community  inparticular  the Security Council and the member States ofthe European Contact Group  to respond effectively to thesituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We hope that thelogic of peace will finally overcome the logic of war  onthe basis of the cease-fire  which is yet to come into effect.In Africa  many significant developments have takenplace in respect of peace-keeping that have to beunderstood in the context of changes in the internationalenvironment. The changes include the fatigue andreluctance of the leading world Powers  especially those inthe Security Council  to participate in peace-keepingoperations in Africa. That reluctance was exemplified bythe events in Burundi  where the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) had to deploy a limited observation missionbecause the United Nations could not.On the other hand  however  some of the Westerncountries have launched several initiatives aimed atidentifying ways in which the international community canassist Africa to cope with the challenges of conflictprevention and management. While Africa  in keeping withits determination to combat conflicts on the continent  isappreciative of these gestures from its outside partners  wewish to remind the international community of the UnitedNations primary role as the guardian of world peace andstability everywhere  including in Africa. Africa remainspart of the international community  and the notion that“African problems need an African solution”  as somecountries advocate  is erroneous. The determination ofAfrica to address  through the OAU  the problem ofconflicts on the continent should not be misconstrued asabsolving the United Nations from its responsibility forpeace and security where Africa is concerned.The Sahraoui people have a right to self-determination.We therefore appeal to all parties to respect the decision tohold a referendum in Western Sahara  to be held asscheduled in January 1996.My delegation believes that the key to attainingnuclear disarmament and a nuclear-free world continues tobe the universality of the non-proliferation regime. In thisconnection  therefore  I wish to register my delegation’sstrong rejection of nuclear tests  which are clearlyinconsistent with the decision of the Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regarding theprinciples and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation anddisarmament  which committed all States to work towardsthe elimination of nuclear weapons and to exercise theutmost restraint with respect to nuclear testing. We callon all nuclear-weapon States to refrain from any furthertesting.We express our deep disappointment at the lack ofconcrete results on the question of the review andappraisal of the implementation of the declaration of the1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade.It is important to note that at its forty-ninth sessionthe General Assembly adopted resolution 49/75 B of 15December 1994  in which it decided to undertake  at itsfiftieth session  such a review and appraisal. TheAssembly requested the Disarmament Commission  at its1995 session  to make a preliminary assessment of theimplementation of the Declaration and of suggestions thatmight be put forth to ensure appropriate progress. Weregret to note that despite extensive efforts to agree onconsensus language  there was a divergence of views andit was not possible to reach a consensus. It isdisappointing to note that delegations were not willing toengage in serious negotiations to find even small areas ofcommon ground.In recent decades the Organization of African Unity(OAU) has also adopted a number of other resolutions ondisarmament and on the denuclearization of the Africancontinent. Convinced that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones can contribute to the strengthening ofthe international non-proliferation regime  the sixtiethordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministersadopted a resolution in which the OAU Secretary-Generalwas requested to convene a joint meeting of theOrganization of African Unity inter-governmental groupof experts and the Group of Experts to Prepare a DraftTreaty on an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone set upjointly by the Organization of African Unity and theUnited Nations. This initiative needs the unrelentingsupport of the international community  in particular thatof the nuclear-weapon States  through their accession tothe protocols that concern them in connection with thereduction and prohibition of the use and testing of allweapons of mass destruction.My Government  like the Governments of all AfricanStates  is convinced that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones worldwide  through the encouragementof the United Nations — especially in the Middle East  asalready proposed by Egypt — would enhance the securityof Africa and the subsequent viability of the Africannuclear-weapon-free zone.6In the social and human rights field  the UnitedNations continues to make some progress. The WorldSummit for Social Development  held at Copenhagen inMarch  was a milestone in humankind’s quest for consensuson universal standards for social development. Theimplementation of the undertakings which the Heads ofState or Government made needs to be monitored closelyin order to assess the degree of progress being made inachieving those undertakings. In this regard  the 20/20compact is an important step in the direction ofinternational collaboration to achieve balanced developmentof the social sector. It is the intention of my Government tofulfil its commitment to allocate 20 per cent of itsdevelopment budgetary allocation to the social sector; weexpect our development partners to meet us half way in thisendeavour.The outcome of the Fourth World Conference onWomen is still very fresh in our minds  having beenachieved only a few weeks ago. Although it wasunfortunate that some countries found it necessary to enterreservations in respect of certain paragraphs of the Platformfor Action  we are encouraged that a significant stepforward was taken towards the goal of recognizing the rightof women to be equal partners with men and to havecomplete control over all aspects of their lives. The triplegoals of equality  development and peace  enunciated 20years ago in Mexico City  underscore the undeniable truththat development and peace are not feasible while half ofthe world’s population is discriminated against and notallowed to realize its full potential. My delegation reaffirmsour Government’s determination to forge ahead with vigourwith the implementation of the Platform for Action until thefull emancipation of women is attained. In this connection I should like to call for an early follow-up and reviewconference lest the momentum generated in Beijing be lost.There is a widely held myth that the developing worldis experiencing a high growth rate because of theremarkable economic performance of East Asia. How canthis be true when a total of 47 developing countriesclassified as least-developed countries continue to fight forsurvival? These countries account for 10 per cent of theworld’s population but earn only 0.1 per cent of the globalincome. For over two decades now  they have continued toexperience serious declines in per capita income. Theirshare of world trade has declined from 0.6 per cent in 1980to 0.2 per cent in 1992.Africa continues to be the region most in need of help.The 1995 economic growth indicators  however  present anencouraging picture. For the first time in over six years  theeconomic-growth rate is projected to match thepopulation-growth rate  which is  unfortunately  thehighest in the world.Africa has been used over the past 20 years  and isstill being used  as a policy laboratory for the BrettonWoods institutions. It is regrettable that today  as theUnited Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since thesigning of the Organization’s Charter in San Francisco many people in Africa continue to live under even harsherconditions of poverty  hunger  disease  civil war andnatural disaster. The plight of the African continentremains a major challenge for the emerging world order.There is an urgent need for a stronger consolidated effortto pull the continent out of the poverty trap into which itcontinues to sink.A few months ago at Geneva  the Economic andSocial Council  at the high-level segment of its 1995substantive session  deliberated an item entitled “Thedevelopment of Africa  including the implementation ofthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s”. The high-level segment recognizedthat  among all the five regions of the world  Africacontinues to be the only one lagging far behind in termsof development and that it remains the most marginalizedin the world economy.Allow me at this juncture to take this opportunity toapplaud the Government of National Unity of theRepublic of South Africa for having embarked on areconstruction and development programme as a strategyfor tackling the thorny issue of the economic imbalancescreated by the policies of apartheid. It is important for theinternational community to realize that the entire southernAfrican subregion was as much affected and that it stillsuffers from the impact of the apartheid legacy. Anyinternational support for the implementation of thereconstruction and development programme in SouthAfrica should take this fact into account.The southern African States members of theSouthern African Development Community continue topay priority attention to closer and stronger integration oftheir economies. The international community shouldmake its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts areadequately supported through complementary financialand technological support  including improved terms oftrade  increased flows of direct foreign investment andappropriate debt relief measures.7Lesotho  as a land-locked and least developed country attaches great importance to issues of concern to the leastdeveloping countries  particularly their transit transportproblems. We welcome the adoption by theintergovernmental meeting of the land-locked and transitdeveloping countries  donor countries and financialinstitutions of a framework for cooperation to alleviatetransit transport problems of the land-locked States and oftheir transit neighbours. It is our sincere belief that thissession of the General Assembly will seriously addressitself to the provisions of this framework  with a view tospeeding up their implementation.The Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries for the 1990s remains largely unimplemented.Lesotho  as a least developed country  is seriouslyconcerned about this.In Lesotho  as in many other countries in Africa andother regions  we have undertaken far-reaching politicalreforms  thus heeding the international clarion call torestore democratic administration  popular participation accountability and good governance. These reforms havebeen undertaken amidst painful but necessary structuraladjustment programmes intended to improve ourmacroeconomic policies and structures. The internationalcommunity needs to realize that the success andsustainability of all these reforms cannot be guaranteedunless they bring about tangible results and satisfy theexpectations of our people  particularly the mostdisadvantaged.Our cooperating partners  in the forefront of advocatesof democratic rule  seem to be relinquishing theirresponsibility of seeing to it that democratic institutions aresustained. In most of our countries our fledglingdemocracies face the serious challenge posed by lack ofresources initially promised by our friends. We seeemerging in each of our countries pockets of discontentwhich in essence challenge and destabilize the very shakyfoundations of our young democracies. We in Lesothounderstand very well the complementarity of democracyand development  and it is on this basis that we call uponour partners to carry out as a matter of urgency theirinternational responsibility  particularly in this area.For two consecutive years now  Lesotho has beenexperiencing an unprecedented devastating drought  whichhas adversely affected food production. This year thequantity of acreage cultivated was substantially reduced due to lack of rainfall. As a result of the drought  theGovernment had to declare a state of food emergency andsend urgent appeals to our traditional and new fooddonors for a helping hand. Unfortunately  not veryencouraging responses have so far been received. It istherefore my humble duty and responsibility to renew thisappeal to the international community through theAssembly.Today’s world is increasingly being made smallerand smaller by technological advances. Developments inone part of the world are of direct relevance and interestto other parts of the world. Closer cooperation andcollaboration between partners is more urgently neededthan ever before. South-South cooperation has to befurther strengthened and universalized. In this regard  theimportance of triangular arrangements for promoting andexpanding South-South cooperation cannot be over-emphasized. Furthermore  increased transfer of modernproductive and efficient technologies is a necessarycondition for all the nations of the world to be able tofulfil their obligations and commitment to leave man’scommon heritage — the Earth — in a condition that willenable future generations to sustain life on it.Many of us are doing our best to develop the fullpotential of our human resources through education  goodhealth  a clean living and working environment andnutrition. We have put in place appropriate policies toensure the realization of this noble objective. We areworried about slow progress towards the discovery of apermanent cure for the HIV/AIDS pandemic  and wouldurge all humankind not to spare any effort or resourcesuntil this menace has been vanquished. We therefore jointhe appeals for increased political commitment andfinancial and material support for scientific and otherresearch that will lead to the discovery of a cure for thisdisease.For a long time the nations of the world haveexpressed their desire to enhance the international justicesystem. The recognition that an international criminalcourt was an essential element in building respect forhuman rights throughout the world led the Members ofthe United Nations nearly half a century ago to pledge tocreate a new system of international justice. Progress inthis regard has  however  been slow.The atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and Rwandaprovided an impetus to establish a permanent internationalcriminal court. Lesotho supports the view that apermanent international criminal court should beestablished by 1996. We believe that the most practicalmethod of establishing such a court is by a multilateral8treaty that would enter into force following ratification bya reasonable number of States. It is our fervent belief thatsuch a court would be the living embodiment of thefundamental principles of international criminal law.Besides being able to hold individual perpetrators of humanrights violations personally liable  the court wouldcomplement prosecutions in national courts by acting whenStates were unwilling or unable to bring perpetrators tojustice.The commendable efforts of the International LawCommission in preparing the draft statute for the court areto be applauded. It now remains for Governments and otherorgans of civil society to strengthen the draft statute toensure that it is a model of justice  fairness andeffectiveness."
"98",4235,"LTU",50,1995,"It is with great pleasure thatI join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. It is a greathonour and a great challenge to be serving in thatcapacity at a time when the United Nations is marking itsfirst 50 years of existence  and when people are hopingfor a better world — as Mr. do Amaral noted in hisstatement last week — through peace  freedom  justice education  health and development.Fifty years ago  the United Nations was formed tobring all nations of the world together to work for peaceand development based on the principles of justice human dignity and the well-being of all people. TheUnited Nations aim of promoting internationalcooperation is still alive half a century later  although itis facing more challenges than ever before.Lithuania itself is facing  and meeting  newchallenges. In the less than six years since thereestablishment of independence  Lithuania has enshrined24democratic values in its constitution  established the rule oflaw  promoted human rights and implemented free-marketeconomic reforms. Our foreign policy is based on respectfor international law  national sovereignty  human rights andpeaceful coexistence among nations — especially our mostimmediate neighbours. The best testimony to our good-neighbourly relations is provided by the treaties we haveconcluded with all neighbouring States; they were a resultof hard work and compromise. It is our view that theyconstitute a major contribution to the security of the regionand of the entire world.Our other foreign-policy goals are also clearly defined.Lithuania is striving for full integration into Europeanpolitical  economic and collective-security structures. As anassociate member of the European Union  our ultimate goalis full membership in the Union. Membership in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and in the WesternEuropean Union (WEU) is also a high priority. We lookforward to continuing our cooperation with and our activeparticipation in regional organizations such as theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and the Council of Europe.The United Nations is facing new challenges today. Ahalf-century later it is not only proper to assess theOrganization’s performance  but also necessary to prepareit for the new demands and problems resulting from thedramatic changes that have come about since the end of thecold war. The number and importance of the challenges thatface the United Nations call for reforms. The UnitedNations is expected to solve many problems  such as armedconflicts  human rights violations  the poverty gap andhumanitarian crises. The problems presented by conflictssuch as those in the former Yugoslavia  Afghanistan Liberia  Rwanda  Burundi and Somalia are in many waysunprecedented. The United Nations is expected to providedevelopment assistance and emergency relief to refugees. Itis expected to promote democracy and to safeguard thehealth and rights of women and children. The UnitedNations is expected to play a leading role in solvingenvironmental and population problems and in securingsustainable development. It is expected to prevent thespread of weapons of mass destruction.If the United Nations is to live up to theseexpectations  Member States will have to provide it withthe necessary means to do so. For this reason  Lithuaniaattaches importance to the efforts aimed at therevitalization  strengthening and reform of the UnitedNations system  and will follow with interest the initiativesdirected towards that goal. Good management in theSecretariat is an important tool in achieving that goal.Better productivity and increased cost-effectiveness  aswell as accountability and responsibility  can make adifference in creating a more mission-driven and result-oriented Organization. Energies and resources within theUnited Nations system need to be utilized in a moreeffective and coordinated manner if the Organization is tomeet the challenges that lie ahead.Likewise  there is a need for integrated policies toaddress these global problems  which too often are treatedas separate questions. In that regard  we see a closeconnection between “An Agenda for Peace” and “AnAgenda for Development”  and are in full agreement thatthe quest for peace and security should not divertattention from other fundamental objectives of theOrganization  especially in the fields of economic andsocial development.Another priority for a revitalized United Nations isreform of the Security Council. Lithuania supportscontinued discussion on the transparency of the work ofthe Security Council. Recent informal arrangements toimprove consultation on peace-keeping between theSecretariat  the Security Council and troop contributorsshould be further developed. The Security Council mustbe more representative of the greatly expandedmembership of the United Nations  and it has to take intoaccount the interests of small States and of all regions including those of Central and Eastern Europe. Webelieve that an increase in the overall membership of theCouncil is needed and that an increase in the permanentmembership should reflect current geopolitical realities. Inthis context  Lithuania supports an increase in the numberof permanent members of the Security Council with newmembers to come from among countries that make anexceptional contribution to the activities of the UnitedNations. This would significantly strengthen the authorityand capability of the United Nations as a whole. It goeswithout saying that reform of the Security Council shouldnot decrease its effectiveness or its efficient functioning.The tremendous increase in and complexity ofpeace-keeping operations in recent years clearly signalsthe need for change. We cannot ignore the financialconsequences of this increase. The budget for peace-keeping operations currently amounts to approximately$3.6 billion. We must strengthen preventive diplomacy inorder to avoid overextending our capabilities in the areaof peace-keeping. Nevertheless  Lithuania will continue toplay its part in peace-keeping  as it is already doing in theUnited Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in25Croatia (UNCRO); it stands ready to do more. The thirdplatoon of Lithuanian peace-keepers is now serving inCroatia within the Danish battalion. We are activelyparticipating in the NATO Partnership for Peaceprogramme and are moving forward on the formation andtraining of a Baltic peace-keeping battalion.Lithuania also welcomes the growing interactionbetween the United Nations and regional organizations such as the OSCE and NATO  in the field of peace-keepingoperations. This approach enables regional organizations toshare the common burden of peace-keeping functions andto contribute  together with the United Nations  to themaintenance of peace and security. OSCE missions areactively promoting peaceful political solutions to regionalcrises in Chechnya  Georgia  Nagorny-Karabakh  Tajikistanand elsewhere.Although Lithuania believes that European countriesshould try to solve their own problems in the framework ofthe OSCE before turning to the United Nations  we hopethat cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nationswill be strengthened in areas of common concern particularly on issues concerning stability and security inthe OSCE area. Further work needs to be done indeveloping a standard set of principles for peace-keepingactivities undertaken by individual States or third parties.Any strategy for preventing armed conflicts shouldinvolve disarmament and non-proliferation objectives. Theeasy availability of arms contributes to the scale ofsuffering in conflict situations as well as to the outbreak ofconflict itself. Lithuania wholeheartedly supported theindefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  because itviews the Treaty as a crucial instrument for preventing thespread of nuclear weapons and for reducing existing stocks.We recognize that  although the threat posed bynuclear weapons is of prime concern  the ongoing use ofconventional weapons is equally dangerous. There is a needfor States to exercise greater responsibility and restraint intheir arms transfers. The United Nations Register ofConventional Arms has led to greater transparency  but acode of conduct for conventional arms transfers could setout common principles to be observed in this area.Drug trafficking and associated international crime areanother growing threat to the security and well-being ofnations and peoples. We give our full support to the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme  which hasthe responsibility of leading the global fight against thisscourge. In view of the continuous and growing rise indrug-related problems throughout the world  including inour region  we encourage closer cooperation in this area.The situation in Rwanda and in former Yugoslaviais uppermost in our minds  as are other armed conflictscloser to home  which have resulted in bloodshed andsystematic violations of human rights. Racial and ethnichatred have led to particularly inhumane behaviour. Thesehorrible lessons must never be forgotten; nor should thesecrimes against humanity go unpunished. This is why weare in favour of strengthening mechanisms to monitor andprotect human rights by fully implementing the mandateof the United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights  and by strengthening the Centre for HumanRights. In order to avoid duplication  we encouragefurther coordination of United Nations human rightsactivities with regional bodies carrying out similarmandates.Lithuania also feels that the mandate for peace-keeping operations could include a human rightscomponent with clearly established reporting andverification procedures. When terrible crimes arecommitted and when human rights are systematicallyviolated despite all efforts  Lithuania believes that thoseresponsible  including the actual perpetrators  should beprosecuted. We thus support moves to establish apermanent international criminal court which would havejurisdiction over serious crimes of international concern wherever they occur.Lithuania places great importance on the work of theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as theprincipal funding agency and coordinator of UnitedNations technical and development assistance. Since theestablishment of the UNDP office in Vilnius in 1992  myGovernment  with support from UNDP  has launchedprogrammes in such priority sectors as democratizationand the development of civil society  publicadministration reform and the social impact of transition.We are especially grateful for UNDP assistance in thepreparation of our 1995 national development report.My Government reaffirms the need for the fullintegration of countries with economies in transition intothe world economy and for continued United Nationssupport in achieving that goal. We see the concept oftransition as a temporary one  which at this point in timeidentifies the special needs and immediate concerns of26countries undergoing fundamental political  economic andsocial transformation. We hope that these needs andconcerns will be reflected in “An Agenda forDevelopment”. Lithuania recognizes the fine work done bythe Economic Commission for Europe in diagnosing theproblems of transitional economies and in preparing usefulrecommendations.I also wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge thework of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) inmy country. UNICEF has provided much-appreciatedtechnical and advisory services on meeting global objectivesfor the welfare of children.Recent major international conferences in Rio deJaneiro  Cairo  Copenhagen and Beijing have addressedimportant strategies and goals for development. Coordinatedfollow-up and implementation of the recommendations ofthese conferences will require not only the commitment ofGovernments  but greater coordination in United Nationsoperational activities and improved coherence inprogrammes.Fully recognizing and supporting the obligation of allMember States to pay their contributions in full and ontime  Lithuania also believes in the principle of sovereignequality  that is the equal rights of all Member States. Inour case  those rights were violated by the assignment in1992 of inequitable assessment rates to the Baltic Statesand the countries of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS)  which were above the capacity of those Statesto pay. We have participated in the work of the high-levelworking group on the financial situation of the UnitedNations and have followed the work of the working groupon the principle of capacity to pay. We welcome the partialimprovement in our rates of assessment due to the 50 percent phasing out of the scheme of limits for 1995-1997.Next month the Lithuanian Committee for the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations will commemorate thisanniversary with an impressive programme. Emphasis isbeing placed on youth education  the main themes on theagenda of the United Nations and the achievements of theOrganization over the past five decades. We must  however remind ourselves of what the United Nations has not yetachieved. Let us hope that those unattained goals willinspire us to move forward with the same vision andcommitment as the founders of the United Nations did 50years ago."
"99",4279,"LUX",50,1995,"Like previous speakers  I should like to convey to thePresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assemblyour warmest congratulations on his election to thepresidency of the Assembly. As a representative of acountry close to us  Portugal  he will  I am certain discharge skilfully and effectively his difficultresponsibilities in leading our deliberations.The President of our Council  Mr. Javier Solana  hasrecently explained the position of the European Union onthe work of the United Nations and on the major challengesit is called upon to face. Those are also the views of mydelegation. I welcome the promising prospects opening upin the Balkans and the Middle East. As for Chechnya  Imust  on the other hand  regret that the parties have beenlagging behind in restoring peace to that sorely tried regionin the past year.In the former Yugoslavia  dramatic developments inrecent months have changed substantially the nature of theconflict there. After years of civil war  atrocities and“ethnic cleansing”  we now see a glimmer of hopeemerging. I welcome the recent agreements in Genevabetween the warring parties  as well as that on the openingup of Sarajevo  which was arrived at thanks to themediation efforts and the commitment of the Americanspecial envoy  Mr. Richard Holbrooke. I am  however  notunaware of the fact that negotiations on a comprehensivesettlement will be lengthy and that its implementation willbe a difficult task.The Government of Luxembourg is prepared to takepart in the reconstruction effort as long as certainconditions are met: the effective implementation of acomprehensive settlement  the implementation of adisarmament plan and respect for human rights and forminorities  including the right of return.In the Middle East  negotiations for the conclusionof a second agreement on the autonomy of the occupiedterritories have just been concluded. Mr. Rabin and Mr.Peres  as well as Mr. Arafat  have shown exemplarytenacity and political will  and they deserve our warmestcongratulations.We are all called upon to help in the success of thisvast endeavour for peace now under way. MyGovernment has launched an important action forcooperation in development in the occupied territories. Itwill also send observers to the forthcoming elections which will be the decisive test for the creation of a civiland democratic society.My country notes with satisfaction the indefiniteextension last May of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It appeals urgently to thenuclear-weapon Powers to renounce any new testing andto comply with the current moratorium. Such a decisionwould help to create a climate favourable to theconclusion in 1996 of a global treaty on the banning ofnuclear testing  one which is suitably verifiable.The Fourth World Conference on Women has justconcluded in Beijing. My Government commends theprogress achieved at that Conference. It hails the fact that for the first time  the rights of women are recognized asan integral and indivisible part of all human rights andfundamental freedoms. In particular  we have in mind therecognition of the right of all women to control theirsexual health and their access  on an equal footing  toeconomic resources. The “right to be different” claimedby religious fundamentalists should not hamper theimplementation of these new principles.The events of some time ago led us to believe thatthe old bipolar world was a thing of the past and that anew world order was automatically about to succeed it.Unfortunately  reality has not confirmed that hope. Themultipolar world in which we live has not at all becomemore unified  nor more supportive  nor safer. Ethnicconflicts have broken out in many parts of the world.Narrow-minded nationalism has gained adherents  andpolitical and religious intolerance is spreading.We thought that with increased internationalcooperation  the role of multinational organizations wouldincrease. This has not always been the case. Often  therole of our Organization has been ill perceived or badlypresented to the public.15In many cases  the image given of the United Nationsseems unfair. It does not take into account the manyconstraints under which the United Nations functions. Veryoften  the critics are aiming at the wrong target  forgettingthat it is Member States that prevent the United Nationseither from taking decisions or by acting  by denying it thenecessary resources.The political commitment of Member States is oftennot commensurate with the ever-growing responsibilities ofthe United Nations.Our Organization must then today come to grips witha new situation arising from the fact that most currentconflicts take place within the borders of a single State  andno longer pit States against each other. Interventionconstitutes an interference that only the United Nations canlegitimize.These ethnic or religious conflicts  whose originsderive from economic and social issues  are the result notonly of regular armies  but of militias and clans. Thecivilian population is often the first victim  if not the maintarget.The missions demanded of the United Nations are alsobecoming more and more complex  difficult and dangerous.The United Nations is called upon to maintain peace  butoften there is no peace to keep.The United Nations has none the less had a number ofsuccesses which have been important but which the mediahave tended to minimize  be they in Namibia  Cambodia El Salvador  Mozambique or Haiti. In those countries  theUnited Nations has helped peoples to overcome years ofcivil war and to channel their energies into buildingdemocratic nations.These positive and courageous actions contrast withother  rather timid reactions to conflicts that threaten thelives of thousands of civilians and expose them to terribleviolations of their basic rights. This was the case inRwanda and was long also the case in the formerYugoslavia  even if the international community hasprovided substantial humanitarian assistance and helped toease the suffering of the victims. But as long as the UnitedNations does not adopt a more defined and resoluteapproach that would allow it to prevent such catastrophes the effectiveness and credibility of our Organization run therisk of being called into question.As I have just emphasized with regard to theconflicts in the former Yugoslavia  we must learn fromour failures and near-successes. My country encouragesefforts to provide the United Nations with its own rapid-reaction capacity. But the Organization should alsodetermine whether increased cooperation with specializedregional organizations  such as the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization or the European Union  might not in certaincases be both more effective and more economical. Atany rate  any new United Nations operation should beestablished only on the basis of a military appraisal aswell. Furthermore  the United Nations should see to it thatthe commanders of an operation are given sufficientmilitary resources and clear  consistent politicalguidelines.Our era has witnessed spectacular developments atthe national level. The concept of the State has beencalled into question as both a mechanism for solvingnational problems and a basic element of the internationalsystem. States find themselves increasingly threatenedwith disintegration  their citizens seeking to escape theoppression of rigid structures and demanding to becomepart of ever more narrowly defined ethnic groups.In such a context  democracy would seem to be thebest means of ensuring the viability of the State asmanager of public affairs and guarantor of progress. Atthe national level  democracy provides the stabilitynecessary for peace by ensuring respect for human rightsand allowing the population to express its will. At theregional level  as in Europe  it involves States  large andsmall  in joint decision-making and contributes todevelopment by encouraging cooperation and fosteringpeace. Democratic States do not war with each other.It is thus an important duty of the internationalcommunity to promote democracy among and withinStates by helping them to build a democratic system; byproviding them with logistical and technical support forthe organization of free elections; by promoting thecreation of a public sector to guarantee the propermanagement of State affairs; and by providing the varioussectors of civil society with the resources to consolidatethe bases of democracy. The Government of Luxembourgprovides tangible support to the activities of ourOrganization in this sphere.In our view  the promotion of human rights isanother priority area. In particular  the adoption of theConvention on the Rights of the Child represents a largestep forward. This Convention is a valuable instrument16that helps to protect children from physical and mentalabuse. It is therefore essential for Governments that haveratified the Convention to adopt and implement thenecessary national legislation. The General Assembly hasinitiated international activity on behalf of millions of streetchildren. My Government proposes that a similar effort beundertaken to assist millions of children who work bynecessity or even compulsion.It is unacceptable  indeed intolerable  that at the endof the twentieth century more than a billion people live inabject poverty and almost 1.5 billion men  women andchildren lack sufficient food and drinking water and haveno access to education or the most elementary health care.To be sure  certain parts of the South today are enjoyingremarkable development. But others  on the Africancontinent in particular  seem to have been left behind by theprogress from which the world economy as a whole hasbenefited.It is also alarming that inequalities both withincountries and between the countries of the South and theNorth are growing rather than shrinking  and that the richestfifth of mankind owns more than four-fifths of the world’ssocial product while the poorest fifth must content itselfwith 1.4 per cent.As concerns the developing countries  we have a dutyto be supportive. This support should supplement andstrengthen the efforts which these countries must undertakeat the national level. Luxembourg has doubled itsdevelopment assistance in just a few years. It hascommitted itself to the goal of achieving 0.7 per cent inofficial development assistance before the end of thecentury. It would also like to see new progress achieved inreducing the debt that continues to paralyse thedevelopment of many developing countries.Our Organization must play a central role as the majorinstitution for international cooperation at the global level.This was in fact envisaged by our Charter. The Preamblestresses the need to promote “the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples” and thereby makesdevelopment one of the principal goals of our Organization.Fifty years after the creation of the United Nations  webelieve that the time has come to begin an in-depth reviewof the activities and structures of the Organization in theeconomic and social spheres  taking into account the far-reaching changes that have occurred and the growingglobalization of problems. This review should takecognizance of the fact that countries are being faced withnew phenomena that are often diverse but are alike inreaching beyond national borders.I am thinking  inter alia  of such health problems asAIDS or of such environmental problems as the depletionof the ozone layer and global warming. There are alsosuch social phenomena as population growth  the pressureof migration  the problem of refugees  and violations ofhuman rights. Other trans-border issues that are ofincreasing concern are drug trafficking  and new forms ofviolence and crime and even international terrorism.We need an effective system built on these realitiesand better able to take into account the interests of allmankind  the poorest in particular. Such a system shouldbe able to define integrated policies and lay down clear coherent guidelines. Cooperation between internationalfinancial institutions and the United Nations systemshould be organized with this in view.Only the United Nations has the necessarylegitimacy and authority for such reform. The work ofrenewal and clarification that has begun with the Agendafor Development is a natural component of this globalperspective. My country  together with its partners in theEuropean Union  intends to make an active contributionto the discussion to be held on this subject.On the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations several focus groups have considered the challengesfacing humanity and the ability of the United Nations tomeet them. In particular  I would refer to the Carlsson-Ramphal Commission  which submitted the report entitled“On Global Governance”  and an independent workinggroup on the future of the United Nations which theSecretary-General himself established and which deliveredthe results of its study last June. These two reports setforth a number of potential reforms and make concreteproposals  including one to create an economic securitycouncil.I believe that these proposals are a valuable sourceof inspiration and make an important contribution to thereform work that should be pursued and intensified. Iattach great importance to the consideration of thesereports  which our Assembly has entrusted to the high-level Working Group recently set up in the framework ofthe strengthening of the United Nations system.Before concluding I should like to deal with twoissues concerning the reform process begun by theOrganization — expanding the Security Council  and17putting the finances of the United Nations on a soundfooting.The Security Council today is invested with enormousresponsibilities. Its decisions commit all Member States andhave a decisive impact on the fate of millions of humanbeings. The Security Council must therefore reflect asfaithfully as possible the determination of the internationalcommunity as a whole. A Security Council morerepresentative of today’s world would strengthen thelegitimacy of its actions and facilitate the implementationof its decisions.My Government is in favour of a balanced increasethat would involve the admission to the Council of newpermanent and non-permanent members from both theNorth and the South. In particular we would likepermanent-member status to be acknowledged for economicPowers whose positive role in international affairs has longbeen recognized.The improved representativeness of the SecurityCouncil cannot be achieved only by remaking itsmembership: it also requires greater transparency in itsdecision-making processes. Dialogue with other Membersof the Organization  especially those countries thatcontribute troops for peace-keeping operations  must beenhanced.Finally  the time has come to delete from the Charterreferences to “enemy States” which have not existed for along time now.Each and every one of us is aware of the seriousnessof the financial crisis that the Organization faces. It resultsnot only from sums disbursed  which are relatively speakingvery modest if we compare them to sums investedelsewhere. It results essentially from the failure of MemberStates which fulfil inadequately  if at all  their obligation topay their contributions to the budget of the Organization.Each and every State is bound under the Charter to pay itscontributions on time and in full.The Luxembourg Government is in favour of amonitoring mechanism that would ensure the propermanagement of the United Nations system.On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  Member States should endeavour to definean approach that could confer on the Organization newlegitimacy and credibility for the next century. This willsucceed only if they involve in this effort representatives ofcivil society and  in particular  those of non-governmentalorganizations.But in the final analysis the proper functioning andefficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremoston the political support that Member States  especially themost powerful  give to multilateralism  as well as thepolitical  military and financial resources they areprepared to make available to international organizations."
"100",4305,"LVA",50,1995,"Allow me to congratulateMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly. I wish all of us a productiveand fruitful session.I also wish to thank His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy  President of the Assembly at its forty-ninth session for his able leadership  and to give due recognition to theSecretary-General for his achievements in restructuringthe United Nations on the eve of its goldenanniversary — an occasion for remembrance andcelebration  but also a time for reflection and appraisal.The Baltic States have participated in the work ofthe United Nations only since 1991. Nevertheless  duringthe long years of occupation the United Nations wasperceived in Latvia as a unique global internationalOrganization embodying humanity’s ideas about freedom human rights  sovereign equality and respect for theprinciples of international law.I shall not join in detracting and criticizing theUnited Nations  for it is not an entity existing on its own.12General Assembly 21st plenary meetingRather  the effectiveness of the Organization is a functionof the political will of its Member States and their resolveto find common ground. In criticizing the United Nations we should keep in mind the amount of criticism that mustbe directed against ourselves.It is to be hoped that the end of the cold war has putan end to balance-of-power politics. Still  the situation inthe world today evokes historical analogies — aboutcollective security  aggressors and their appeasement. Ageneration of Latvians still alive remembers the results ofappeasement in 1939. It is often stated that today’s leadersmust try not to repeat the mistakes of the past. The notionthat they have succeeded is belied by the recentestablishment of international ad hoc tribunals regarding theterritory of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and by thepressing need for an international criminal court.Conflict-prevention mechanisms  including preventivediplomacy and preventive deployment  as well as otherconfidence-building measures  have become increasinglyimportant. The establishment of political dialogue betweenparties and early action by the international community area key to heading off potential conflicts.The status of the United Nations as a centre forconflict resolution may be enhanced by promoting theuniversality of the Organization. We support the statementof the Secretary-General that the process of arms controland disarmament needs to be globalized and that it is vitalthat all States be engaged in the disarmament process inpractice as well as in declared intent. Latvia supported theunconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We hope thatanother historic step will be taken next year with theconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.The dramatic rise in the number and complexity ofpeace-keeping operations in recent years  as well as thedistinctive nature and experience of each operation  requiresnew approaches to peace-keeping. Humanitarian assistance human rights and economic and political questions are nowintegral components of peace-keeping. Experience showsthat it is necessary to detach peace-keeping fromenforcement action. In Somalia  as well as in the territoryof the former Yugoslavia  peace-keepers have beenperceived as enemies. In such cases the most suitablesolution is for the United Nations to grant clearly definedauthority to international organizations or groups of Statesthat have the desire and the capacity to establish peace.Recognizing that each State has a duty to contributeto the maintenance of international peace and security Latvia is ready to participate  within the Danish battalion in bringing peace to the territory of the formerYugoslavia. For the purposes of peace-keeping  the BalticStates have established a Baltic battalion (BALTBAT) which is currently undergoing intensive training inpreparation for a future role in peace-keeping missions. Itake this opportunity to thank all countries that havesupported the establishment and training of BALTBAT —in particular  the United States  the Nordic countries  theUnited Kingdom and Germany.Latvia strongly supports efforts to strengthen andreform the United Nations system so that it may betterserve the peoples of the Earth. It recognizes that it is stilltoo early to clearly perceive the shape of the post-cold-war world  which must be the final determinant of thenature of the necessary reforms.In these circumstances there is a need to viewreforms of the United Nations system as a long-term ongoing process that must protect the stability of theUnited Nations system at all times. At the same time there is an opportunity for progress in regard to reformswhich can be made without making permanentcommitments to new fundamental system structures andprocedures.In the light of these general considerations  I shouldnow like to address Security Council reforms and UnitedNations system financing issues.The operation of the Security Council must continueto become more transparent and open  while preservingthe Council’s effectiveness. Its expansion must strengthenthe role played by small countries in globaldecision-making  while respecting equitable geographicdistribution and the new geopolitical realities of thepost-cold-war era.Since there is general agreement about the need fora modest expansion of the Security Council  the GeneralAssembly could immediately decide to carry it out  if thedecision would not force Member States to makepermanent commitments on the two controversialissues — the composition of the Council and the use ofthe veto. Latvia intends to make proposals in this regardto the relevant Working Group of the General Assembly.The current system of financing the activities of theUnited Nations depends largely on assessed and voluntary13General Assembly 21st plenary meetingcontributions of Member States. The unprecedenteddifficulties of financing the recent growth in internationalactivities have exposed the limitations of the currentsystem  in which international activities have to compete forfunds against national activities that have strongerconstituencies.A recent report  commissioned by the IndependentCommission for Population and Quality of Life  oninnovative financing mechanisms for internationally agreedprogrammes  has made a number of recommendations tostudy and compile information relevant to suchmechanisms. Latvia would support a decision by theGeneral Assembly at this fiftieth session to prepare acompilation of information relevant to  and appropriatestudies of  innovative financing mechanisms.Innovative financing mechanisms are a matter for thefuture. Even then  they should not supplant the currentsystem  which  however  needs to be improved.Governments have a long-range interest in strengthening theUnited Nations by completing the reform of the current highly inequitable scale of assessments for the regularbudget. The reformed scale must obey the equitableprinciple that Member States with equal average per capitaincomes should bear assessments that are broadly at thesame per capita level.The current inequitable scale is one cause of thecurrent financial crisis of the United Nations  in that theover-assessed States are responsible for relatively highamounts of outstanding contributions  including arrearsfrom preceding years.This observation is illustrated by the case of the 15Member States  including Latvia  that were over-assessedby a General Assembly decision  adopted by vote  in 1992.A second decision in 1994 improved the situationsomewhat  by initiating a gradual decline in the excessiveassessment  which in 1997 will still be two times higherthan the assessment based on the principle of capacity-to-pay.While Latvia recognizes and tries to discharge itsobligation  derived from the principle of sovereign equality to pay in full and on time  it also believes that a secondcomponent of the principle of sovereign equality — theequal rights of all Member States — is not respected by thepresent assessment. The resulting over-assessment is areason that has led  in spite of Latvia’s best efforts underdifficult financial conditions and in the face of manypressing social  economic and humanitarian needs  to abuild-up of arrears which now threaten the application ofArticle 19 of the Charter  beginning January 1996. It willforce Latvia to seek relief from the General Assembly.In discussing the work of the United Nations in theeconomic and social sphere  it is useful to do so from theperspective of the individual. Is he or she secure? Has heor she enough food? Does he or she have adequate livingconditions and opportunities for developing his or herpotential?In the world today  enormous differences in levels ofdevelopment persist among countries. The United Nationshas accomplished a great deal in its work to eradicatepoverty and disease and to provide humanitarian relief. Itwould be possible to further improve this work byimproving coordination between relief agencies andprogrammes and by eliminating redundancies. Relief mustaddress needs; the United Nations has a significant role toplay in needs assessment.In the past Member States of the United Nationshave met in a number of global forums to highlight theissues surrounding people-centred development. Worldconferences in Rio de Janeiro  Vienna  Cairo  Copenhagenand  most recently  Beijing have drafted platforms foraction. Such large gatherings are sometimes criticized asbeing expensive and resulting in few tangible outputs.Such criticism could be avoided if Member States wereto implement their commitments fully. Howeverimplementation is greatly constrained by the financialrealities of each State.Nevertheless  Latvia has implemented arecommendation of the 1993 World Conference onHuman Rights by establishing a national Human RightsOffice  which commenced operations earlier this year.The Latvian Human Rights Office is an independentinstitution for the protection and promotion of humanrights.The international community has agreed that humanrights are inviolable and are the cornerstone of democraticsocieties. We intend to continue to implement therecommendations of the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action  and urge other States to do thesame. Further  we believe that the question of theadequate financing of the Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights must be resolved.The environment is an area that  along with humanrights  demands Latvia’s attention during the present14General Assembly 21st plenary meetingperiod of remedying the many consequences of Latvia’soccupation. In this connection  Latvia is making efforts tohold an international conference on disarmament and itsrelationship to environment and development.Latvia’s development  particularly in the social sector has been greatly assisted by the work of the Office of theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) established in Riga in 1992. The Government of Latviafully cooperates with and supports the work of UNDP  andis ready to increase the level of this cooperation.Latvia attaches high priority to the economic andsocial work of the United Nations and understands theobligation of each Member State to contribute to this work.We value and support the efforts to reform the Economicand Social Council and  in the spirit of sustaining andfurthering its work  have presented our candidature formembership in the Economic and Social Council for theperiod 1997-1999.In pondering the future of the United Nations duringits fiftieth anniversary  allow me to quote Mr. Henry CabotLodge  Jr.  a former United States representative to theUnited Nations:“This Organization is created to prevent you fromgoing to hell. It isn’t created to take you to heaven.”Let us remember these words as we look to the future ofthe United Nations. Let us make the necessary changes toour Organization and  moreover  concentrate our politicalwill so that we may ensure that humanity will alwaysremain firmly anchored between heaven and hell  on theplanet Earth."
"101",4352,"MAR",50,1995,"Onbehalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  I ampleased to extend to the President my sincerecongratulations on his election to the presidency of thefiftieth session of the General Assembly.I am convinced that his diplomatic experience excellent knowledge of international issues  and the manyresponsibilities that were assigned to him will ensure thesuccess of our work and help us achieve the best results.I also wish to assure the President that the delegationof the Kingdom of Morocco will spare no effort incooperating with him and in providing every support tofacilitate his task. I also salute in him the representativeof a country which shares strong ties of friendship cooperation and good-neighbourliness with Morocco.I should like to avail myself of this opportunity topay tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Amara Essy for his excellent conduct of the work of our previoussession.I should like also to express my deep appreciation toMr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali  the Secretary General  for hisuntiring efforts towards the promotion of peace andsecurity and for his constant endeavours in facing up tothe tremendous responsibilities shouldered by the UnitedNations as a result of the developments that took place inthe world over the past few years.Those efforts of the Secretary-General acquiregreater importance at a time when our Organization facesan unprecedented financial crisis.This session stands out by the fact that it coincideswith the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. We mayrecall the day  50 years ago  which gave rise to hope thatwe were embarking on an age of emancipation  liberty independence and the maintenance of peace and security.That day heralded  for all humanity  the dawn of a new erathat was received with joy as it was to be the beginning ofa path of dialogue and cooperation that affected analternative to violence and confrontation.The important changes in international relationswitnessed by the world over the past few years did usher ina new world situation. However  the fact that  in the newsituation  the economic interests of the major Powerscontinued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of thedeveloping countries that a new era of genuine solidaritybetween the rich and the poor was about to emerge andserve the legitimate interests of all the members of theinternational Community.As we see it  the economic and social situation inmost countries of the South gives no cause for hope oroptimism. The gap between developed and developingcountries is still widening  and the economic  commercial and social problems of the developing countries are onlyworsening. This has thrown the doors wide open to suchphenomena as extremism  fanaticism and terrorism scourges that we must confront and curb.In order for us to do so  the world economy has to berestructured in the context of genuine cooperation betweenall nations and an earnest dialogue in which the richcountries would shoulder their full responsibilities towardsthe promotion of an international partnership whose aimshould be to find viable solutions to this problem thatwould work in favour of men’s moral and materialinterests  wherever they may be: North or South.While we welcome the initiatives taken towards therestructuring of the world economy since the ratification ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and thesubsequent inception of the World Trade Organization  andthe steps taken by numerous developing nations  includingMorocco  to restructure their economies with a view tointegrating those economies into the world economy  webelieve that such initiatives  by themselves  will not besufficient to lead to solutions to the economic  trade andfinancial problems that beset the third world. We hope thatthe World Trade Organization will adequately and fullydischarge its responsibilities and that it will be providedwith the necessary means that would make it an effectivetool and enable it to translate into reality the commitmentsmade.We hope that the current negotiations amongst thevarious international organizations concerned will lead tothe desired coordination between monetary  financial andtrade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuinefoundations for free international trade  wherein therewould be no deterioration in the terms of trade or anydecline in the prices of primary commodities. We alsohope that those discussions will mark the beginning of areconsideration of the concept of foreign debt from whichthe developing countries suffer.The African continent is in the grip of a disastrouseconomic and social situation. Morocco views withconcern the deterioration of this situation as it is part ofthe African continent  and is a member of the Africanfamily that has a long history of shared struggle forliberation and emancipation which binds it to all thepeoples of Africa.Given the gravity of a situation  that portends untoldtragedies  Morocco calls on the international communityto make a concerted effort to find a solution to theworsening problems of Africa.In our opinion  the strategic perspective and theapproach adopted so far in tackling those problems willnot lead to any improvement or substantial qualitativechange so long as the international community does notcommit itself to a long-term strategy that embodiesconcrete commitments in favour of Africa. Such astrategy  as we see it  should be part of a comprehensiveperspective aimed at improving the level of social andeconomic development in Africa with a view tointegrating the continent into the world economy andenabling it to benefit from its dividends. In this respect Morocco calls for a speeding up of the implementation ofthe Convention to combat desertification in order to meetthe needs of our continent at both the national andinternational levels.In spite of the efforts made by the United Nationsand repeated calls from this rostrum to give pride of placeto dialogue  and to solve conflicts by peaceful means andpreventive diplomacy  some regions in the world continueto be the scene of armed conflicts and civil wars whichcrush our hopes of establishing lasting peace and security.By the same token  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  especially nuclear weapons  still threatens ourworld and should be addressed most earnestly in order toavoid irreparable disasters.2In this respect Morocco has effectively contributed tothe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and hopes that allcountries will accede to this important Treaty and therebyensure its universality. Morocco also hopes that the MiddleEast will be exempt from all weapons of mass destruction as has been the case for other regions of the world. This isone of the noble objectives that the Organization shouldwork for so that all may channel the funds tied up in thisfield to development and to combating all forms ofunderdevelopment.It is indeed cause for optimism that progress has beenmade in the negotiations on the test-ban treaty  especiallythe pledge made by the Conference on Disarmament toconclude a treaty concerning this issue before the end of1996.The era of colonialism is now a thing of the past. Asa matter of fact  this has been one of the greatachievements of the past 50 years. Unfortunately however the two Moroccan cities of Sebta and Melilia and theneighbouring islands are still under Spanish occupation.These enclaves  which are part and parcel of Moroccanterritory  and which overlook the Mediterranean sea  arethus the last remaining colonies in Africa. Such a situationis indeed a strange anomaly which neither reason nor logiccan accept and which clashes head on with the spirit andthe letter of the United Nations Charter.In this context  may I recall the major stages whichMorocco has gone through in order to complete itsterritorial integrity. Since its independence in 1956 Morocco started negotiations with Spain in order tocomplete its independence  hence the withdrawal  in 1958 from the region of Tarfaya  which is part of the MoroccanSahara  then the withdrawal from the region of Sidi Ifni in1969. In 1975  after a period of alternating dialogue andtension  Morocco recovered its other southern provinces.The only parts that are still under Spanish colonization areSebta and Melilia and the neighbouring islands.Morocco  which opted for dialogue as a fundamentalprinciple in its policy vis-à-vis its neighbours  propoundedthat principle in international forums as the best means ofavoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems bypeaceful means  remains convinced that its historical tieswith Spain  coupled with the two countries’ commoneconomic interests  will help overcome the difficulties thatstand in the way of a solution to this dispute.Morocco considers Spain to be one of its mostimportant economic and political partners in view of thesize of Spain’s investments in Morocco  the volume oftrade between the two countries  the joint developmentprojects  such as the intercontinental link between Spainand Morocco that would link the African and Europeancontinents  as well as the burgeoning cooperation in theareas of culture and tourism.We are convinced that if all this is taken intoaccount  it would help resolve the disputes. We believethat the best framework for the desired settlement is to befound in the proposal made to Spain by His Majesty KingHassan II  to set up a reflection and consultationcommittee with the aim of finding a solution to theproblem of Sebta and Melilia that would allow Moroccoto exercise its sovereignty over the two cities and theneighbouring islands while preserving Spain’s economicinterests.The Arab Maghreb Union has made considerableprogress on the road to Maghreb unity. Morocco  which like its neighbours  believes that the Union is a strategicchoice  is determined to overcome the few remainingobstacles in the way of progress towards unity. In this eraof economic blocs  the creation of the Arab MaghrebUnion is an unavoidable necessity if regional integrationis to be achieved  if challenges are to be met and if weare to ensure the progress and prosperity of our peoples who are united by the bonds of common language religion and history.I am sure that idea of establishing the Arab MaghrebUnion  which reflects an ancient historical reality  willcome to fruition as have other regional blocs that haveachieved a high level of integration and unity evenwithout enjoying the bonds that unite the Arab MaghrebUnion.In recent years  the Middle East has witnessed manydevelopments that have created an opportunity to achievepeace and to end the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis ofthe principles of land for peace  respect for the nationaland political rights of the Palestinian people and theestablishment of their own State  with Al Quds as itscapital.One of the decisive events in the region was theconclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement signed atWashington D.C.  which confirmed that the peace processin the region is irreversible  notwithstanding the obstaclesit is encountering. The Jordanian-Israeli agreement also3confirmed that the logic of tolerance and coexistence in theframework of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace basedon international legality is now an absolute necessity for all.In this connection we welcome with satisfaction theTaba Agreement that was signed in Washington D.C.between the Palestinians and the Israelis  an importantmilestone on the road towards the establishment of peaceand security in the region. It is our fervent hope that thetwo parties will be able to overcome existing obstacles andshow a firm determination to settle pending problems bearing in mind the legitimate interests of all and respectingtheir commitments and the behests of international legality.Optimistic as we are about the progress on the Israeli-Jordanian and the Israeli-Palestinian tracks  we hope thatpositive development will materialize on the Israeli-Syrianand Israeli-Lebanese tracks which would lead to resultsacceptable to all parties on the basis of the relevantresolutions of the United Nations Security Council andGeneral Assembly  particularly Security Council resolutions242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).Last year  in an attempt to promote the peace processin the region  Morocco acted as host to the very firstEconomic Summit for the Middle East and North Africa which stressed the need to establish economic programmesas part of an effective partnership that would create betterliving conditions for the peoples of those regions. TheSummit also emphasized the need to assist economicdevelopment in Palestine to enable the Palestinian people topromote their economic and developmental institutions andto participate on an equal footing in the development of theregion.We hope that the Amman Summit will be anothermilestone in the mobilization of the potential of public andprivate sectors to consolidate the peace process bypromoting economic cooperation to help in the region’sdevelopment and by meeting the aspirations of the peoplesof that region after progress  prosperity and just and lastingpeace.The United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic ofIran have not yet arrived at a final settlement of theirdispute over the future of the islands of Abu Musa andGreater and Lesser Tumbs. In light of our historicalrelations with those two sisterly countries  and given therelations of neighbourliness and friendship between thepeoples of the United Arab Emirates and Iran  we lookforward the day when there will be a final solution to thisdispute so that the region may revert to the spirit ofcoexistence that once characterized it.The tragedy of the Bosnian people is almost withoutprecedent in the history of mankind. It is even morealarming in light of the international community’s failureto stand up against murders  displacement of populations ethnic and religious cleansing  mass rape and thedestruction of the country’s culture heritage andcivilization.It is regrettable that the world should be witnessingsuch procrastination under the new world order  whichpurports to be founded on respect for human rights. It isalso somewhat amazing that that new world order  whichhad mustered all its resources to extinguish every hot spotoutside the Western world  should now fail to protect apeople in the very heart of Europe who are daily beingsubjected to Serb aggression.Morocco  which had been under the impression thatthe problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be settledin 1992  was surprised at the deterioration of the situationthere and by the escalation of violence and massacres. Inthis connection  Morocco has consistently discharged itshuman and Islamic duty to defend the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina  mitigate the agony of the Bosnian peopleand provide humanitarian assistance to them.I am convinced that the meeting of the Islamic andInternational Contact Groups in Paris on 7 September1995 and the meeting that took place between the twogroups yesterday  28 September 1995  are likely to openthe way to coordination and consultation to achieve theexpected objectives and strengthen the foundations forpeace in the region on the basis of justice andinternational law.We welcome with hope the results of the 8September 1995 meeting between the Bosnian  Serb andCroat ministers at Geneva.We hope that the agreement in principle concludedby the parties to the conflict last Tuesday  26 September1995  in New York will be a decisive step towardsalleviating the sufferings of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina and that it will help them achieve theirhopes for peace  tranquillity  sovereignty  safeguard theterritorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovinaand thus ensure peace  reconciliation and stability in theregion.4With regard to the question of the so-called WesternSahara  Morocco took the initiative of proposing theorganization of a referendum and accepted the settlementplan presented by the Secretary-General. Morocco alsoagreed on the criteria concerning voter identification andmade serious efforts in full cooperation with the Secretary-General  the Security Council and the United NationsMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara(MINURSO). Morocco has also offered financial assistanceand the necessary support to overcome difficulties andimplement the settlement plan in good faith.In view of the obstacles we are now encountering inconnection with the identification process with regard to allpersons of Saharan origin  we appeal to the SecurityCouncil to take the necessary measures and to mobilize allthe appropriate means that would safeguard the settlementplan against collapse and remove the spectre of tensionfrom the region.I take this opportunity to renew our commitment andstress our firm determination to continue our fullcooperation with the Secretary-General in order to completeall the procedures and take all necessary measures toorganize the referendum early next year  as suggested bythe Secretary-General in his latest report to the SecurityCouncil on the issue.We hope that the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization will be an opportunity to study all the ideasand suggestions put forth in order to improve and redressthe structures of our Organization so that  given all thechanges in the world  it can meet the actual needs of theinternational community. I refer in particular to ideasregarding the enlargement of the Security Council andimprovement of its working methods  which must becarefully considered and given ample time so that resultscan be achieved and a consensus can be reached.We are confident that the perseverance and earnestdetermination we have shown in taking up challenges willbe the best incentive for us to face up to the new challengeand enable our Organization to fulfil its duties adequatelyat the dawning of the twenty-first century  which we hopewill be the beginning of a new era of peace  stability andlife in dignity for humanity."
"102",4376,"MCO",50,1995,"Allow me first of all  and with particular gratitude  toextend to the President’s predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Amara Essy  our warmest compliments for the care anddiscipline he displayed during his presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Our complimentsalso go to the other officers who worked with him.Allow me also to extend the sincere congratulationsof the delegation of the Principality of Monaco to the newBureau that has just been elected and say how pleased weare to see this fiftieth session of the General Assemblyunder the esteemed authority of Mr. Freitas do Amaral.The country he represents  a country that is open tothe world  tolerant  accessible  culturally rich and enrichedby the cultures it has encountered throughout its history deserved to be given this recognition. Our GeneralAssembly decided to give it and we are deeply gratified.His personality and great political experience at the nationaland international levels  has recognized abilities anddynamism should all help to ensure the success of thisimportant session.Its importance is first of all symbolic. Since maninvented calendars  anniversaries have been occasions forcelebration and rejoicing  and  as many speakers have saidbefore me  for taking stock.Since its inception  our Organization has lived throughhighly complex political  economic  social and culturalevents and phenomena which make any appraisal difficult.It position and role have grown constantly and gained inimportance over the past fifty years. The expectations thatpeople have for it and the hopes they place in it can bemeasured by the depth of the disappointment and bitternessthat can be seen in cases of failure or difficulty.Has the United Nations not always tried to respond tothe constant and often conflicting appeals made to it? Itsresponses are inspired by the fundamental values thatprevailed when the Charter was drafted in 1945. Let us notforget that our States  by joining the United Nations recognized the universality of these values. We must remaintrue to them and provide assistance whenever they areendangered. Recent events  still fresh in all our minds  havereminded us that these values have not always beenrespected and that faith in fundamental human rights  in thedignity and worth of the human person  and in the equalrights of men and women and of nations  large and small has not always been shared. And so  at this fiftiethanniversary of our Organization  these values must berecalled forcefully and with conviction at every opportunityso that these same values can be the inspiration for each ofour resolutions  and every text we adopt.Above and beyond the States that we represent andtheir legitimate political interests  it is individuals — oftenvulnerable and adversely affected by poverty or war —who must be the recipients of international cooperation. Itis our duty to live up to their expectations.When we look at the situation in this way  whether interms of the Organization as a whole or in terms of certainof its organs  such as the Security Council  it becomes clearthat there is a constant effort at adapting on the part of theinternational community  and a need — widelyanticipated — to make our Organization moreperformance-oriented  more representative and closer tothe concerns of its membership.We have followed with interest the work of thevarious Working Groups set up to that end. We haveparticipated  and we have made suggestions  inter alia with regard to equitable representation within the SecurityCouncil and an increase in its membership.In recent years  there has been a significant increasein the membership of the United Nations  and today itincludes all  or almost all  nations of the Earth. And so itwould seem quite normal that its decision-making bodies including the Security Council  should reflect this newreality. As the famous French writer and philosopher PaulValéry wisely said  we have reached the stage when theend of the world is beginning. For this reason  we mustnow redouble our efforts and heighten our vigilance sothat our Organization may be able to respond to thisuniversality  in a relevant manner and in all its diversityand richness.Along with reforming its decision-making bodies  theUnited Nations must continue to improve its functioningand restructure its operations. Major efforts have beenmade. We would thank the Secretary-General for this  andwe would also thank the members of the Secretariat.Improving the functioning of this Organization musttake account of the need to strengthen its multilingualnature. Every staff member should know at least the twoworking languages of the Organization. Using just onelanguage deprives the Organization of a rich resource. Ifwe wish to really enhance the effectiveness of theSecretariat  we should first of all concentrate seriously onimproving the language abilities of staff members so thatthey have a truly international culture and dimension.As can be seen from our history  the people ofMonaco and the Government of our Principality  like allpeace-loving peoples  follow very closely all initiatives toreduce armaments and transform the arms race — whichhas gone on too long — into a race towards disarmament.Let us hope that with the end of the cold war  thisapproach will be strengthened and that despite technicaland financial problems  disarmament processes will notonly continue but speed up.We must more than ever ensure that respect forinternational treaties and agreements and for international14law shall replace the balance of terror  and that the law thusserve justice.It is in this spirit that we wholeheartedly welcome theindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. Our Principality was in favour of thisextension  and so once again we would thank the parties tothe Treaty for this courageous decision  which was inspiredby trust and hope. We welcome the initiative of the Powersthat have already entered into a commitment — which hadbeen expected for next fall — to ban  over the short term all nuclear-weapon tests. This is a major advance.Our Government also welcomes particularly thedecisions taken at the meeting  currently under way inVienna  aimed at establishing a moratorium on theproduction of anti-personnel land-mines. We trust that thisexample will be followed widely.Since joining the United Nations  the Principality ofMonaco has been co-sponsoring the resolution on assistancein mine clearance. By contributing financially to thevoluntary fund created for that purpose  my country’shighest authorities wished to become involved  in aconcrete way  in the implementation of that resolution. Theinternational community  quite rightly  was shocked by thedeath and mutilation caused by these mines  which afflictmainly civilian populations  and children in particular.Our delegation would hope that significant progresscould be made in strengthening security and cooperation inthe region of the Mediterranean  in the spirit of resolution49/81  which we co-sponsored and which was adopted on15 December 1994. Our Principality hopes that we willalways be involved in all the initiatives relating to theMediterranean countries.We are also ready to support all initiatives in favourof international cooperation relating to the peaceful uses ofouter space and those intended to develop  in collaborationwith the United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  education and information programmes insupport of disarmament. Making young people aware ofthis issue is a fundamental guarantee for peace in the yearsto come.While general and complete disarmament  no doubtstill far off  may today seem utopian to some  neverthelessthat goal must remain our ambition. For when weaponsawaken  their might and their destructive power arelimitless.This year  conflicts have been particularlydevastating. Wars of another age have become the warsof our age  attacking  brutally and without distinction men  women  children and defenceless old people.The Government of the Principality is thus resolutelyin favour of strengthening preventive diplomacy on thepart of the United Nations. We would thank theSecretary-General for the initiatives he has already takento promote the settlement of many disputes and to avoidthe eruption or continuation of conflicts. The “Supplementto An Agenda for Peace'” is an irreplaceable source ofideas  suggestions and wise solutions.It is no longer tolerable that the Blue Helmets bemistreated  humiliated  taken hostage and used as humanshields with no means of defending themselves. Thosemen and women are no doubt ready to sacrifice their life but not their dignity.This is a particularly appropriate time to stress —because recently the Organization has been criticized verysharply — how much it has contributed to the successfulsolution of disputes  which have sometimes been verydifficult ones  and how much courage has been needed totake certain decisions and to carry out certain operationssuccessfully.The hopes for peace coming out of the Middle Eastand Bosnia and Herzegovina represent a significantrecognition of the courage that has been demonstrated and they are an invitation to us to continue to persevereand to be optimistic. The report of the Secretary-Generalon the work of the Organization reminds us  in a verytimely way  of this  mentioning the 24 operationscurrently under way in the areas of preventive diplomacy the restoration and maintenance of peace  and the fourmajor operations  which he describes as multifaceted.Coordination within the Secretariat between the threeDepartments involved in peace-keeping operationsresponds to current needs and concerns  a fact we notewith great satisfaction.When diplomacy  at the end of its tether  cannotprevail and conflict erupts  then barbarism triumphs. Nolaw of war  no humanitarian law  can control it. The mostvulnerable human beings and those without weapons arenot spared. The only way to help them is by humanitarianassistance.15In conditions that are always very difficult andsometimes dangerous  many humanitarian operations havebeen conducted in a most admirable way in the last fewmonths. Men and women have lost their lives  and I paytribute to their suffering and to their memory. I would paytribute in particular to the “blue helmets”  the soldiers ofpeace  and to the Department of Humanitarian Affairs  theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees and to UNICEF  as well as to the many non-governmental organizations  some well-known  some lesswell-known  that have all worked tirelessly  constantly andwith determination to protect  feed and provide medical andhealth care to populations that are adrift  assaulted byruthless armed conflict.This year  the Principality of Monaco contributed alarge percentage of its public efforts to financialcontributions in the humanitarian and social fields. We willcontinue to do so  hoping that the action that is taken tothis end can be completed as the conflicts themselves cease.We would like to lend our support  and this is in thespirit of the suggestions made by the Chairman of thedelegation of Monaco  His Serene Highness  Crown PrinceAlbert  to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session to the thinking now under way on the strengthening of thecoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance providedby the United Nations.The international Tribunals created on the initiative ofthe United Nations designed to prosecute those responsiblefor crimes against international humanitarian law in theterritories of the former Yugoslavia and of Rwanda must bequickly established and enabled to function so as not todisappoint the hopes that have been placed in them.The idea of an international criminal court alsodeserves consideration and support.Humanitarian actions and respect for internationalhumanitarian law are corollaries in a period of armedconflict to the struggle being waged by the United Nationsto ensure general and universal respect for human rights.Since the 1993 World Conference on Human Rightsin Vienna  significant progress seems to be under way.With human and material resources that are far fromsufficient to meet actual needs  the Centre for HumanRights  thanks to the commitment and the extensiveexperience of its staff  is successfully continuing its work.The increase in the number and the quality of theconsultants and the technical assistance provided plays amajor role in ensuring that human rights are no longerjust a concept  but become a reality. The presence inmany countries of specialists working in varied areas such as training  education  legislative reform and publicinformation is one way of anchoring human rights and thereby  the state of law in society on a day-to-day basis.The dispatch of observers to certain troubled regionsof the world today is also an excellent initiative. We hopethat it will continue  because it strengthens the moralpresence of the United Nations. The creation of the postof High Commissioner is also in keeping with thisapproach  and we would encourage his actions.International cooperation in favour of the respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms  which is one ofthe basic vocations of this Organization  is beingstrengthened thereby.Rights that are applied to certain categories butwhich should remain universal — as the Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing has just rightly recalledby describing women’s rights as being inseparable fromhuman rights — must be recognized and strengthened intheir application.The implementation of international Conventionsrelating to those rights is an essential element in thisstrengthening process. The committees set up pursuant tothose instruments are the focus of this process and of thearrangements made to implement it. They must be giventhe means to act and to react.The Government of Monaco is particularly involvedin the implementation of the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child of 20 November 1989  and that of theInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Racial Discrimination of 21 December 1965  to whichthe Principality of Monaco has just become a party.The human condition in the twenty-first century willdepend to a large extent not only on respect for civil andpolitical rights  but also on the promotion of economic social and cultural rights.It is in terms of human rights that we have to lookat development  a point made in the 1993 ViennaDeclaration.The recent World Summit for Social Developmentin Copenhagen also adopted this approach. My16Government noted with interest the conclusions of theFourth World Conference on Women  which has just endedin Beijing.All of this leads us to think  as does the Secretary-General  that development must first of all be recognized asa primary task of our age.The fundamental objective must be to improve thestandards of living of people throughout the world including the developed countries  where an increasinglylarge part of the population is excluded from the benefits ofprogress.The satisfaction of basic needs and the elimination ofpoverty  hunger  sickness and ignorance must be goals thatwe constantly seek to attain  using all available means.The Government of Monaco devotes a major part ofits resources to social assistance  particularly for womenand children  those who are most in need.The celebration in 1996 of the International Year forthe Eradication of Poverty will be an excellent occasion forstrengthening the implementation of theserecommendations.Recent work on the “Agenda for Development” hasattracted close attention. For the Principality of Monaco development must above all be sustainable and based onbalanced economic exchange and trade  harmoniousregional integration and careful protection of theenvironment.The implementation of Agenda 21  the Conventionsand resolutions adopted at Rio de Janeiro in support of theenvironment and development  is in our view a priority.The General Assembly has decided that 1998 shall bethe Year of the Oceans. The people of Monaco  like allpeoples that love the sea  are eagerly awaiting this event.Through our history  our traditions and our economyMonaco  like many other countries in the world  depends toa large extent on the sea and its resources  whether these beliving  commercial  tourist or industrial.Protecting this valuable element of the environmentagainst all kinds of thoughtless pollution and over-exploitation is a major concern. Enough must be done atthe regional and international levels to protect it. In theMediterranean  the Principality of Monaco is doing what itcan  along with its closest neighbours France and Italy within the framework of international agreements withpractical and specific goals.The year 1998 must be an opportunity for us tobecome more aware and to launch new multidisciplinaryand well-planned programmes so that the next centurywill not see an irreversible worsening of the state of theseas and oceans. In this connection  we are glad that theUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) iswilling to act as the secretariat for the world programmeof action to protect the marine environment against land-based pollution. The Government of Monaco will beinterested in this programme and any other action toeliminate organic pollution from the marine environment.The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is involvedin the international initiative to protect coral reefs. Wehave organized an exhibition to make the public moreaware of the need to protect coral  which is particularlysensitive to all forms of pollution and which  to develop requires a healthy and protected environment. The UNEPprogramme on regional seas deserves encouragement.I cannot conclude my statement without mentioningthe very serious financial crisis that the Organization isgoing through. The measures taken by the Secretary-General are mere palliatives. If all Member States were tolive up to their commitments there would be no problem;there would be no need for working groups or committeesof experts  which  after all  involve additional expenditurefor the Organization.In conclusion  I should like to repeat something thatwas said by a famous politician: the United Nations  likenations  shapes its own future; nothing good comes to itby chance; those that serve it are those that develop theirinner strength."
"103",4401,"MDA",50,1995,"First of all  I would like to extend my sincerecongratulations and best wishes for success to Mr. Freitasdo Amaral upon his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. We areconvinced that  with his profound knowledge of currentglobal problems and his open attitude to the realities ofinternational life  he will make a very importantcontribution towards the achievement of the objectives ofthis session.At the same time  I should like to address mysincere thanks to Mr. Amara Essy for his productive workduring his presidency of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session.I should also like to convey to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of our appreciation for hisefforts to improve the functioning of the United Nationsand to assure him of the full support of the Republic ofMoldova.In this anniversary year  Moldova celebrates thepassage of four years since the proclamation of itsindependence and three years since its admission to theUnited Nations.Over these years of complex structural changes  wehave preserved our aspiration of becoming a democraticState with a market economy  despite the difficulties oftransition. Our country has already taken the first steps inthis direction by embarking irreversibly upon the path ofdemocracy.It is worth mentioning that the process of democratictransformation in Moldova has been supported and isbeing supported by the international community and primarily  by the United Nations and its specializedagencies. Therefore  I wish to express our gratitude to theUnited Nations and its Member States for their substantialsupport in the promotion of the ongoing reforms in ourcountry.In this context  I should like to describe the maindevelopments which have taken place in our society thisyear  as well as our most important present concerns.15In its foreign policy  the Republic of Moldova  aneutral State not involved in political-military alliances  isdeveloping mutually beneficial relations of friendship andcooperation with all States. It also intends to extend itsbilateral links with neighbouring States  as well as with itstraditional partners.In our domestic policy we have had two mainpriorities: to develop and consolidate the legal andinstitutional framework of a State of law and the smoothfunctioning of institutions appropriate to a moderndemocratic society on the one hand  and  on the other  toensure economic restructuring and the transition to a marketeconomy.So far  our country has succeeded in setting up anumber of basic institutions for the rule of law. A modernconstitution that guarantees political pluralism  privateownership and respect for fundamental human rights including rights for persons belonging to ethnic minorities has recently been adopted. Likewise  it assures the exerciseof political liberty  a fact that is proved by the existence ofnumerous political parties and by the possibility of the freeexpression of political opinions. The Parliament has draftedand adopted a number of laws of major importance.The progress achieved by our country in the processof transition has been facilitated  to a certain extent  bybilateral cooperation with other States and in the frameworkof various international bodies. Among the positive effectsof this cooperation have been a quickening in the pace ofinternal reforms and the process of integration intoEuropean political and economic structures. In this respect a major event in the external relationships of the Republicof Moldova has been its admission to the EuropeanCouncil. This is both a recognition of the progress achievedby our country on the way towards democratization and anencouragement to further build up the rule of law and ademocratic society.As for economic restructuring and the transition to amarket economy  I can state that a number of difficultiesare in the process of being overcome. This year newmeasures have taken aim at halting the decline in industrialoutput  which constitutes an important prerequisite for therelaunching of economic growth. Through a new monetaryand fiscal policy  we have managed to reduce inflation andstabilize the national currency. Moreover  it is worthrestating our willingness to continue our fruitful cooperationin this field with the international financial institutions primarily the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and theWorld Bank.At present we are engaged in a crucial stage of thereform  particularly that dealing with wide-scaleprivatization. My government is mostly concerned tospeed up privatization in the hope that this will spureconomic reform and encourage not only internalinvestment  but also foreign capital and credits. In thiscontext  I should emphasize that the difficultiesencountered in carrying out economic reforms are linked to a great extent  to the shortage of financial  energy andraw materials resources. The assistance we have receivedso far from the international financial institutions andfrom some developed countries has had a visible positiveimpact. Nevertheless  substantial and sustained externalfinancial support is still needed for the creation of amodern restructured economy.That is why we are counting  in particular  on thesupport of the European Union for securing the success ofour transition. Our efforts aiming at building a marketeconomy and integrating our country into the Europeanpolitical and economic structures would be stronglyhelped by its supportive signals and actions. The signingof the agreement of partnership and cooperation with theEuropean Union towards the end of last year and therecent signing of the Interim Commercial Agreement havebeen major steps in this direction.The difficult process of transition is being adverselyaffected by the anti-constitutional actions undertaken bya separatist regime which exerts temporary control overeastern districts of the Republic of Moldova.The Assembly may remember the armed conflictwhich was unleashed in 1992 by the separatist movement with external support  in the east of Moldova. Althoughthis conflict ended  its consequences still persist. Wecannot but note the gross violations of the fundamentalhuman rights of the Moldovan population in this area.Mention should also be made of the group of politicaldetainees  known as the “Ilascu group”  which wasillegally convicted and jailed by the anti-constitutionalauthorities of the Transdniester three years ago  and isstill in prison.Nor can we omit mention of the obstinate refusal ofthe separatist leaders to allow the Moldovan parents andchildren to use the Latin alphabet in the study of theirmother tongue. That is why the representatives of thecompetent international organizations in the field ofhuman rights have noted a series of abuses and violationsof the rights of the Moldovan population living in theeastern districts of the Republic.16Although the situation of the Transdniester is nolonger in the forefront of international public opinion  itshould be noted that no acceptable solution has beenidentified so far. Despite the reasonable compromisesproposed by the constitutional authorities  separatisttendencies still persist. I should like to stress that thepolitical leaders of my country have repeatedlydemonstrated their willingness to solve this conflictexclusively by peaceful means by negotiation  in conformitywith international law and in cooperation with internationalorganizations  primarily with the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  as well as with Russiaand Ukraine in their capacity of mediators. In a spirit ofcompromise  my Government also firmly believes in theprinciple that any proposal or initiative to settle the conflictmust provide for the maintenance of the territorial integrityof the Republic of Moldova and for its sovereignty over thewhole country. It was this spirit that led this year to thesolution of the conflict situation in the southern region ofMoldova  which is populated by over 100 000 Gagauz whoobtained  under the Constitution  the status of administrativeterritorial autonomy.As for the latest developments in the negotiations withTiraspol  I should mention that a certain amount of progresshas already been made  particularly in the matter of the re-establishment of economic links between Transdniester andthe rest of the country.At the same time  we believe that a political settlementof the conflict in this area could be achieved through theorderly and unconditional withdrawal of military troops ofthe Russian Federation from the territory of our country  inconformity with the Moldovan-Russian agreement and theresolutions of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE).In this regard  we are still concerned that  although theMoldovan-Russian agreement was signed last year by theHeads of Government of the Republic of Moldova and theRussian Federation  in the presence of Presidents MirceaSnegur and Boris Yeltsin  it has not yet been brought intoforce by the Russian side. I take this opportunity to voiceour sincere hope that the competent authorities of theRussian Federation will speed up the procedure for theratification of this document  in accordance with theirobligations. I must emphasize that any possible failure toimplement this important agreement might incur the risk ofdestabilizing the situation in the eastern districts ofMoldova  as well as the real danger that a part of thearmaments of the Fourteenth Army will be seized by theseparatist forces of the Transdniester.We hope that the competent authorities of theRussian Federation will as soon as possible set upeffective machinery for the withdrawal of Russian troopsand armaments from Moldova  in accordance with thebilateral agreement I have mentioned and the decisionsadopted by the OSCE Budapest Summit.The jubilee year of the United Nations is not only ananniversary but also an occasion for a lucid assessment ofthe achievements and failures of the first 50 years of theOrganization’s existence. In this respect  I want toemphasize that the United Nations has made an importantcontribution in the search for and identification ofsolutions to the numerous urgent problems at the global regional and national levels. Even if it has not managedto prevent or eliminate regional or local conflicts  theOrganization has played an essential role in preventingthe outbreak of a world conflagration.The evolution of international relations over the pastyears has provided favourable conditions for redefiningthe role of the United Nations and for adapting it betterto the new realities of international life in the context ofthe next millennium. If this is to be achieved  there willhave to be a new vision  as well as a redefinition ofconcrete machinery for achieving the fundamentalobjectives of the Organization  as inscribed in the Charter.Along the same lines  I should say that recent yearshave been marked by the appearance of new concepts which could serve as a basis for the diversification ofmachinery for action in various fields of United Nationsactivity.With regard to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  there have been unprecedentedqualitative and quantitative changes. As is well known the peace-keeping operations currently being undertakenon four continents  and their mandates  continue todiversify — electoral and humanitarian activities  supportfor institutional reconstruction  monitoring of theobservance of human rights  and so on. At the same time new methods of dealing with crises have beenproposed — for example  stand-by arrangements andrapid-reaction forces. In this context  we expect that therewill be a considerable increase in the operational capacityof the United Nations in the field of the maintenance ofpeace  provided that Member States support the adoptionof these new proposals.17We support unreservedly the importance the Secretary-General  in his report “An Agenda for Peace”  attaches toconflict-prevention machinery.All these initiatives confirm the preoccupation of theUnited Nations with regard to the adoption of a coherentapproach to problems of peace and security. At the sametime  noticeable attention is being paid to the study ofdevelopment topics. The particular interest of MemberStates in the Agenda for Development confirms thetopicality of these problems and the need to revitalize theworld Organization in this area.In this context  I should like to make the point that  inview of the interdependence between peace and security  onthe one hand  and social and economic development  on theother  it would be worthwhile for the United Nations tocreate an integrated system for implementation of thestrategies and polices agreed upon by States. All UnitedNations activities  including peace-keeping and social andeconomic development programmes  should becomplementary. At the same time  the decisions of high-level international conferences should find concreteexpression in the actions of States and of United Nationsagencies.In our opinion  in the attainment of these aims it isnecessary to avoid excessive politization of certain specificaspects of each field and  at the same time  find the areasthat are of interest to all Member States. The UnitedNations system must  through its expertise and globalvision  ensure a climate of cooperation and mutualconfidence  without which there will be no solutions to theproblems of peace and development.The Republic of Moldova  which is deeply committedto the purposes and principles of the United NationsCharter  is prepared to make its contribution and to supportthe Organization’s efforts to adapt better to the fast andprofound changes in the modern world. We are fully awareof the major role of the United Nations in consolidating thepositive trends of recent years in the international arena andof the need to increase the effectiveness of its activities. Wetherefore welcome the proposals aimed at enhancing that effectiveness.Naturally  we ourselves are well aware that theOrganization cannot attain these objectives unless theMember States put the necessary resources at its disposal.That is why we pay special attention to this question andtry to do our utmost to fulfil our obligations. We considerit necessary that the responsible United Nations structuresadopt adequate measures to avoid waste  to ensure betteruse of the resources entrusted to it.In this context  I want to refer to the problem ofcontributions. I am obliged to point out that for four yearsour country has carried the burden of a quota inequitablycalculated and set at too high a level in relation to its realcapacity to pay. The artificiality of this calculation is alsoproved by the paradox that certain countries at a similarlevel of development and with populations and territoriestwice or three times larger than ours make contributionssmaller than or equal to that of the Republic of Moldova.I imagine that some other recently independent States areexperiencing the same situation. This  together with thecosts of transition  could explain our current arrears. Webelieve that this matter needs to be taken into account atmeetings of working groups of the General Assemblywhen they examine the possibility of introducing penaltiesagainst the countries that are in arrears.In our view  the process of diversifying the relationsand the collaboration between States has enhanced thedevelopment of regional and subregional cooperation. Asa matter of fact  the Charter itself puts particular emphasison the regional organizations. Documents laying the basesfor collaboration between the United Nations and regionalorganizations in various fields have been drawn up andadopted in recent years.Several General Assembly resolutions relating tocooperation between the United Nations  on the one hand and the OSCE  the League of Arab States and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  on the other  arerelevant in this regard. At present such cooperation isbecoming increasingly diversified  covering new areas.Some regional organizations have acquired newcompetencies  including in the field of peace and security and have thereby become partners of the United Nationsin the settlement of some local conflicts. We hope that inthe near future recently created regional organizations andgroupings will be able to set up a cooperation frameworkwith the United Nations  similar to the one alreadyexisting with other regional organizations. The Republicof Moldova thinks this trend should be encouraged.At the same time  we consider that any decision ofthe United Nations to transfer various activities within itssphere of competence to other international organizations especially in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  implies major consequences for the security integrity and independence of States in the respectiveregions. That is why the United Nations should continue18to exercise its competence under Articles 34 and 35 of theCharter  according to which the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly are the main organs for dealing with andsettling conflicts having regional implications.In conclusion  I should like to express the hope thatthe proceedings of the fiftieth anniversary session of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations will be carriedout in an atmosphere of solidarity  of a realistic andconstructive approach to the complex issues confrontingthe world at the end of this century. The delegation of theRepublic of Moldova is prepared to contribute  alongsideother Member States  to the fulfilment of the lofty goalsof the United Nations.The meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.19"
"104",4445,"MDG",50,1995,"I must begin my statement by echoing the words ofprevious speakers who have congratulated Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral on his election by acclamation to thepresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.On my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation ofMadagascar  which I have the honour to head  I havepleasure in saying that we rely greatly on his experienceand wisdom in ensuring that our work will be crowned withsuccess at the conclusion of our debates. Whilst assuringhim of the cooperation and support of my delegation  Iwould also like to congratulate the other officers of theAssembly.It gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to ourcolleague  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  Mr. Freitas doAmaral’s distinguished predecessor  for the enthusiasm anddynamism he demonstrated in the service of the GeneralAssembly  which under his presidency carried out itsmandate well and always to the satisfaction of countrieslike my own.Lastly  may I express our appreciation for the effortsmade by the Secretariat to ensure the efficient organizationof our work  under the competent leadership of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali.Since our current session coincides with thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations Charter  it goes without saying that  as theSecretary-General stressed in his report on the work of theOrganization  it is an occasion not only to take stock of thefirst half-century of our Organization and to prepare for thesecond  but also to seek ways to keep up the momentum ofthe first years of the decade in world affairs.After the collapse of the Berlin Wall  a true symbol ofthe cold war  history has witnessed a series of events thatstrengthen confidence in the principles and agreementsenshrined in the Charter: the independence of Namibia; theformation of the first democratic multiracial Government inSouth Africa; the holding of democratic elections markingthe end of a long period of civil strife in Mozambique andone-party rule in Malawi; the promising steps taken byseveral southern African countries towards reconstruction;the process of reconciliation in the Middle East  recentlyadded to by the agreement — welcomed by Madagascar along with all other peace-loving nations — extendingautonomy in the West Bank; and  lastly  certainencouraging signs with regard to the situation in theformer Yugoslavia.Paradoxically  however  the end of the era ofideological confrontations  while accelerating theintegration of world society  has also promoted anincrease in conflicts  sources of outbursts of violence andsavagery  resulting not only from conflicts between States but also  unfortunately  from ethnic  civil  religious andother deep-rooted causes within a collapsing State orStates. This trend  one of the most marked of the post-war period  seems to be growing  in the context of aninternational community that is powerless  disarmed and above all  disillusioned.As regards Africa  to which Madagascar belongs  Irefer in this regard to the genocide in Rwanda  whoseimpact is still felt by international public opinion; thecontinuation of civil war in Liberia  in Sudan and Angola;and the spiral of violence and violations of human rightsin Gambia  one of the oldest democracies in West Africa following a coup d’état.Other conflicts still continue in Europe andelsewhere.At the risk of offending some  I must say that most if not all  of these hotbeds are fuelled in particular bysales of illicit weapons — I should rather  say “authorizedsales of weapons”. Their proliferation shows theineffectiveness of the relevant international conventionsand of the measures enacted by the internationalcommunity. They also run counter to the efforts made toreduce worldwide expenditures on armaments since 1987in order to obtain the peace dividend.International public opinion was also deeply shockedby the coup d’état carried out by mercenaries against theIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros. Madagascarstrongly condemned that putsch  and congratulates Franceon the happy outcome of Operation Azalea to re-establishinstitutional legality in the Comoros.The disillusionment that I have described disillusionment bordering on hopelessness  has otheraspects which are even more threatening to the world’ssecurity. Indeed  both in the North and in the South we11are witnessing an upsurge of intolerance  of xenophobia —in brief  of fear or the rejection of difference  of alldifferences. These feelings are exacerbated by individualand collective frustrations born of poverty  ofmarginalization and of social injustice. This picture iscomplemented by environmental degradation  a sluggisheconomy  the depletion of natural resources  thedisintegration of the social fabric  the spread of drug use international terrorism  pandemics  natural disasters unemployment and famine. To sum up  there is a wholerange of global threats which are no longer confined withinnational borders.It would be a truism to assert that solving theseproblems calls for us to be farsighted  to step back so as toget a global view and go beyond the outdated approach ofresolving the challenges facing us case by case. That is whyMadagascar must support all the efforts to implement theglobalizing structural approach in the Agenda for Peace.However  we must recognize that any initiatives in thisfield will be in vain if there continue to be contradictionsbetween the diplomacy of States and the diplomacy of theUnited Nations  because it is quite obvious that the futureof today’s societies lies within a space that is broadening toencompass the dimensions of the universe.This fundamental refocusing must be the purpose of arational reorganization of our organs and institutions  which given the social  political and economic conditionsprevailing when they were established  now havelimitations  gaps and shortcomings when it comes toresponding to the expectations of today’s world.In Madagascar’s view  what is needed is  first  toenlarge the Security Council on the basis of equitablegeographical distribution in order to ensure thedemocratization of international relations. Secondly  theGeneral Assembly must be given greater means  andespecially more powers  to put an end to the old cliché thatthis organ is merely a forum for rhetoric and orotundspeechmaking. Thirdly  as indicated in “An Agenda forPeace ” there must be a considerable strengthening of themechanisms for the pacific settlement of disputes set forthin Chapter VI of the Charter  which would seem in practiceto have become the poor relation of Chapter VII  with itsauthorization of the use of force as a last resort. Indeed  inthis connection  I would make so bold as to say that anyand all reform of the United Nations must also entail morecareful attention to the provisions of Chapter VII.This strengthening should include giving firstpriority in United Nations bodies to the prevention ofviolence by developing a policy and strategy centred ondevelopment. There  the General Assembly could play amore important role  in conjunction with the SecurityCouncil  by  for example  in the framework ofre-establishing peace  strengthening the role of UnitedNations forces used as buffers in international  ethnic orcivil conflicts. Paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the Charterexpressly excludes any intervention in matters which areessentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.The settlement of national conflicts  which falls within thecompetence of the United Nations and which still requiresthe support of the country concerned  must be viewed asthe carrying out of efforts to establish democracy and therule of law and to inculcate a spirit of tolerance and non-violence.There is also the question of strengthening regionalstructures for the peaceful settlement of disputes  such asthose that already exist within the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and theNon-Aligned Movement. Lastly  there is the question ofstrengthening regional cooperation in the sphere ofdisarmament so as to block the uncontrolled movementsof weapons and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction.It is in this spirit that Madagascar supported theindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and is about to ratify variousinternational conventions  such as the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destructionand the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on theUse of Certain Conventional Weapons.In the economic and social sphere  there is no needto stress that world development also presents a scenarioof contrasts and disparities  whereas there had beenreason to hope that the post-cold-war period would see ade facto mobilization of the international community insupport of development. Even worse  the outlook is farfrom encouraging. Poverty and hardship have becomeendemic in the so-called fourth world — the “stormzones”  to use an expression borrowed from the jargon oftoday’s experts — which is also prey to natural disastersin addition to its internal problems  resulting frompolitical instability and imbalanced economies. Thebalance of payments continues to show a deficit becauseof the crushing burden of external debt and thefluctuations in the prices of raw materials  accompanied12by — to cap it all — a stagnation and even a decline indevelopment assistance.We are also witnessing various forms of protectionismin the countries of the North  while the countries of theSouth are being urged to liberalize trade. The result isincreased marginalization of the poor countries  which arederiving absolutely no benefit from the globalization of theworld economy  and increased social disparities bothbetween and within nations. That adverse trend is leadingto the formation of an international social apartheid.In the United Nations  the establishment of theEconomic and Social Council embodied the poor countries’hopes for recovery  but it has become clear that itsadministrative machinery is still cumbersome and unsuitedto its task. It has gradually become paralysed by themultiplication of its organs  without any real follow-up orcontrol  and its high operating cost. At last July’s session ofthe Council in Geneva  emphasis was put on the need togive it greater vigour by strengthening its competencies andpowers.If development is today recognized as a human right Madagascar believes that that it is largely thanks to theUnited Nations  which has advanced the notion ofinterdependence between economic development democracy and respect for human rights. Therefore  one ofthe United Nations primary duties is to create andstrengthen the institutional structure needed to implementthe norms it has identified for the promotion ofdevelopment. In that connection  Madagascar willparticipate with attention and interest in the GeneralAssembly’s debate on An Agenda for Development.Similarly  we shall follow with interest theimplementation of the proposals contained in theCommuniqué of the G-7 Summit held last June in Halifax proposals designed to promote sustainable development andbetter share the fruits of growth. We welcome the G-7’sexpress offer to cooperate in formulating a new approachto international cooperation and in defining the contributionexpected of the United Nations system  which is seekingthrough a series of world conferences — recently inBeijing  previously in Rio  Copenhagen and Vienna  andnext year in Istanbul — to engage  beyond national borders in combined  effective action against poverty unemployment and social disintegration. Those conferencesare part of the attempts to renew and improve UnitedNations methodologies and strategies in the sphere ofcooperation for development.I cannot fail to refer to the beneficial activities inMadagascar coordinated by the United NationsDevelopment Programme and carried out through theUnited Nations system of operational activities andespecially by the United Nations Children’s Fund. Normust I forget the United Nations Educational  Scientificand Cultural Organization and the United NationsPopulation Fund  whose mid-term review of the thirdcountry programme with Madagascar was completed atthe end of August.In the same context we welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative on a steering committee to preparespecific short-term and medium-term projects for thedevelopment of Africa in such priority areas as foodsecurity  the strengthening of institutions  the developmentof the private sector  desertification and socialdevelopment.The viability and survival of our planet depend beyond cooperation  on our ability to adapt to the newrealities and constraints we face. As we approach 1996 declared by the General Assembly as the InternationalYear for the Eradication of Poverty  my delegationwanted today briefly to outline some of the proposals mycountry is presenting to contribute to making the dreamsof the founding fathers of the Charter come true  althoughwe know full well that our proposals are incomplete andthat even an improved and ideal United Nations would beunable on its own to solve all the problems before it.The building of a better world  to which we allaspire  remains dependent on establishing internationalrelations based on the principle of cooperation andsolidarity and on respect for the principles and norms thatgovern international relations.In that connection  let me conclude by noting a greatstep forward in international relations: on the occasion ofthe fortieth anniversary of the Organization  speakers inthis Hall stressed the concept of the balance of forces ingeneral and of strategic nuclear parity in particular  whiletoday  10 years later  we all recognize that security andpeace cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity  andin the absence of all violence."
"105",4484,"MDV",50,1995,"It gives me great pleasureto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral onhis election to the presidency of the United NationsGeneral Assembly on this momentous occasion of itsfiftieth anniversary. Aware of the strenuous task that thisAssembly has to perform  I remain confident of hiscompetence to guide our work to satisfactory conclusions.It is also my privilege and honour to pay a tribute tothe President of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire for the skilful mannerin which he discharged the onerous responsibilities of thepresidency of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.I would also like to convey my country’s deepappreciation to the Secretary-General for displayingexceptional capability and a capacity to meet the dauntingchallenges and obstacles to his noble mission  and for hisever-readiness to work selflessly not only to retain thecredibility and the validity of the United Nations but alsoto make this Organization stand tall in this rapidlychanging world. My delegation sincerely wishes himevery success in his unenviable task.The United Nations is celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of its founding  and many of us areadvocating the need for reforming and restructuring thisOrganization. There is no doubt in our minds that theworld is passing through an era of dramatic changeaffecting the map of international political relations andchanging the balance of economic and trade relations  areason which would naturally justify this call. But weshould not ignore the fact that this Organization hassucceeded in preventing a third world war — and thegreatest fear 50 years ago was that such a war wouldoccur.Furthermore  this Organization has effectively freedthe world from the evils of colonialism and racialdiscrimination. It has also helped in establishing a regimeof international cooperation based on the principles ofequality and respect for the rule of law. If not for thenoble role that the United Nations has played in many5areas of human activity  we would not have harvested theprogress we enjoy today in the fields of disarmament containment of the proliferation of nuclear weapons promotion of human rights  and many important issues suchas those related to environment and the welfare of refugees children  youth and women.Of course there have been failures and set-backs.Many a time we have come across situations which havemade us suspect the credibility of the Organization and theeffectiveness of its decisions.But the fact remains that the United Nations hasserved and is continuing to serve humanity — individuals peoples and the world community as a whole — withprofound dignity and with a sense of purpose  guided bythe noble principles of the Charter. And if we are talkingabout reforming or restructuring this Organization  then ourconcentration should first be focused on the realities oftoday in order to transpose our collective efforts tostrengthen international cooperation for the achievement ofour common objectives in full accord with the principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter.Moreover  the reforming and restructuring not onlyshould be focused on the concept of international peace andsecurity  but also should be extended to include the entirespectrum of the economic and social development of thehuman race. In other words  the effect of reform shouldreach all areas of United Nations activities  including thoseinvolving the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  the achievement of equitable economicdevelopment  the revitalization of the internationaleconomic order  the protection of the global environment the combating of terrorism and drug trafficking  theprotection of human rights  and the promotion ofdemocratic values and legal order within and amongnations.I would like to take this opportunity to extend mycompliments to the specialized agencies of the UnitedNations for their efforts to achieve economic growth andsustainable development. The Rio Conference onEnvironment  the Population Conference in Cairo  theCopenhagen Social Summit  and the recently concludedWorld Conference on Women  in Beijing  have taken us along way in this regard.However it is regrettable to note that  in spite of theencouraging signs  the overall picture of development is notoptimistic. The global Official Development Assistance(ODA) today is at its lowest level in 21 years. As a leastdeveloped island State  my Government is of the viewthat there is an urgently felt need to reverse this situationradically. A first step will be for all industrializedcountries to live up to the targets specified by the UnitedNations. If we work in the spirit of collectiveresponsibility and match our efforts with the concerns ofthe real people in the real world  I am confident thatsuccess will be achieved.As far as the principal organs of the United Nationsare concerned  Maldives believes that the GeneralAssembly should continue to play its central role as theglobal council which has the competence and capacity fortaking collective decisions and reaching consensus onimportant matters related to international peace andsecurity  development  and international cooperation ingeneral.Meanwhile  the role and functions of the SecurityCouncil should be strengthened and improved upon in away consistent with the realities of the present time which obviously are significantly different from thegeopolitical conditions which prevailed 50 years ago.However  the Maldives is of the view that if a majorrestructuring exercise is to be carried out it should be aresult-oriented one  which would strengthen the authorityof the Council and increase its ability to implement itsdecisions rather than simply increasing the number ofmembers of the Council on a selective basis. Even if wego along with the emerging consensus that themembership of the Council should be increased  mycountry strongly feels that careful consideration should begiven in the process to ensuring that the Council remainsa representative body for all regions and groups ofnations  including  of course  the developing countries andsmall States that share the responsibilities for maintainingpeace and security in the world with the more developedand the larger Member States of the United Nations. Themain criteria should be  we believe  the capability of theMember States to fulfil their obligations and commitmentstowards the United Nations and its principles  and theirrespect for and adherence to international covenants.Fifty years ago membership of this Organizationcomprised only a few countries. They had the privilege ofhaving a say in world affairs. They created this body tosafeguard not only their own interests but also theinterests of future generations of the entire world.The vast majority of Member States that arerepresented here today  including small States like myown country  Maldives  had been deprived of their6freedom in one form or other. It was the principles onwhich this Organization was founded that helped shape theevents which eventually led to the restoration of thelegitimate rights of deprived peoples on all continentsacross the globe.Now  ours is a community of nations that share thesame values and depend on each other in achieving ourcommon and individual interests. Among the MemberStates of the United Nations there is a large number ofsmall States which are actively interacting with otherMember States  not because they merely need thecooperation of the others for their survival and existence but because they actually are inseparable parts of this large interdependent world.What the United Nations is trying to do is to promotepeace and justice  eliminate racial and religious prejudicesand set up universal standards for aspects of our liveswhich affect our dignity as equal human beings. SmallStates are participating in this endeavour with the sameconviction that the larger countries have. Therefore  it ismore than reasonable that small States should be given theopportunity to play their role in decision-making andcarrying forward the torch of our common mission.As I first mentioned  the reform of the United Nationsmust be comprehensive and should include the three mainorgans  the specialized agencies  and all aspects of theUnited Nations work and activities; a reform which wouldchange the United Nations truly in to a “mission-orientedand results-oriented” Organization  to use the Secretary-General’s description. Therefore  my delegation feels thatit is important to maintain effective coordination betweenthe open-ended working groups which are already beingestablished  and that we should  by all means  avoidproducing a partial package of improvement.As the world anticipates seeing a revitalized UnitedNations  we should pause to review the current worldsituation.In this context  it is with great disappointment that wesee that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains ascritical as ever. We are still witnessing the destruction oflife and property  the violation of human rights and thedefiance of Security Council resolutions by the BosnianSerb leadership. The continuing deterioration of thesituation has led many of us to doubt the applicability ofthe arms embargo. Many of us  furthermore  fear theconsequences of partitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina onthe basis of the ethnic composition of this independentState. We urge the international community to exert itsinfluence on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the settlementnow being proposed  which we are confident will resultin a comprehensive and viable solution to this tragicepisode. Meanwhile  we wish to express our deepappreciation to the countries that are contributing bravelyto the efforts of the United Nations Protection Forceunder extremely difficult conditions.The situation in the Middle East seems to beimproving through the peace process. The United Nationshas continuously supported the rights of the Palestinianpeople to self-determination and independence. The recentaccords  which enable the Palestinian people to exercisea degree of self-rule  are certainly a good basis for therealization of this objective. While appreciating theimportant role played by the sponsors of the recentinitiative  we feel that the United Nations should continueto give support to the people of Palestine and to enhance by all available means  the fulfilment of their legitimaterights.The recent events that took place in the IslamicFederal Republic of the Comoros demonstrate once againthe vulnerability of small States to terrorism and theactivities of mercenaries  which threaten not only thesecurity and stability of small States  but also democraticinstitutions and the lawful existence of Governments. Thistime the victim was again a small island State in theIndian Ocean. But we have seen that acts of terrorismsimilar to this one — which took many innocent lives —are occurring rather frequently in many parts of theworld. Recalling General Assembly resolution 49/31  onthe Protection and Security of Small States  myGovernment calls upon the international community totake all necessary steps to prevent mercenaries fromcarrying out their criminal acts.Giant steps have been taken towards universaldisarmament. During the Conference earlier this year atwhich the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was discussedMaldives supported the Treaty’s indefinite extension  withthe firm conviction that it plays a central role incontaining the danger of the proliferation of nuclearweapons. Treaties have been concluded on chemical andother weapons of mass destruction. It is our fervent hopethat the comprehensive test-ban treaty will be signedbefore the end of 1996. In the meantime  it is mostimportant at this juncture that all States refrain fromtesting nuclear devices  and those which aspire toachieving nuclear-weapon capabilities should refrain fromdeveloping them. Instead  efforts must be made to7dismantle all existing nuclear weapons and free the worldfrom this dreadful menace. Further  the countries of eachregion should agree to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones thus striving collectively towards a nuclear-weapon-freeworld. Furthermore  my Government believes that thecourse of universal disarmament will translate into anincrease in available resources that can be used for urgentlyneeded humanitarian and social development needs.As mankind awaits the dawn of the twenty-firstcentury with great expectations for peace and justice andfor the emergence of a United Nations that will carryforward the noble mission for which it was created  we  theGovernment and the people of the Maldives  renew ourcommitment to the principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations and pledge that we will do whatever is possible  incooperation with other Member States  to uphold theseprinciples and work towards a better future.My delegation wishes to extend its felicitations to allStates Members of this Organization on this occasion of itsfiftieth anniversary and to congratulate this world body onits tremendous achievements."
"106",4531,"MEX",50,1995,"Since the United Nations was founded  Mexico has madea committed and enthusiastic contribution to its positivedevelopment. Without exception  Mexico has effectivelypromoted the principles  the letter and the spirit of theSan Francisco Charter. Today Mexico confirms before theworld its unswerving commitment to peace  developmentand collective understanding  which are the inspiration ofthe United Nations.We have had five decades of collective diplomacy controversy over the scope and limitations of multilateralaction  difficult adaptations for the United Nations to aworld that is constantly changing at a dizzying pace; fivedecades in which the ship of the United Nations has oftenbeen pounded by the waves of intolerance  of thearbitrary and irrational use of power and force and ofovert violations of the norms of international law. Despitethe pounding it has received  the ship remains afloat.Today it has 185 nations on board  and it is stillmankind’s best alternative for bringing future generationsto a safer and stabler port than the one we inherited at theend of the Second World War.In these first 50 years the foundations have been laidfor building a new civilization at a higher level forpeaceful coexistence between nations. Never before inhistory has mankind possessed an instrument as universaland spirited as the United Nations. The general debate inthis fiftieth anniversary year is an appropriate occasion forus to pledge ourselves to preserving the achievements ofthe United Nations and outlining the form it should takein the next century. Clearly  the world cannot do withoutthe United Nations  but it is also obvious that itsstructures are in need of far-reaching changes in order tobe up to the challenges of the present day.The recurring topic is the need to reform theOrganization  and the main issues are  among others  thefollowing:First  Mexico attaches priority to the examination ofthe reform of the Security Council and has proposed anincrease in the Council’s membership  strictly respectingthe principle of equitable geographical distribution in the15context of a genuine reform of its working methods including reconsideration of the use and the existence of theveto power.A second issue is the limitations on the role of theSecretary-General  which have very significantly curtailedhis ability to act.Thirdly  there is the failure of a large number ofMember States to meet their financial obligations.A fourth issue is the extreme bureaucratization ofsome of the specialized agencies of the United Nationssystem and the lack of coordination of their activities  aswell as the lack of political support by the Members forother agencies  such as the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization (UNIDO)  which carry out veryuseful functions.The enthusiasm generated by the end of the bipolarconfrontation has lessened due to the emergence of vast andpainful ethnic  religious and regional conflicts  especially inthe former Yugoslavia and in several countries in Africa —conflicts whose resolution we must urgently seek.Fortunately  there are reasons for optimism  such as theprogress achieved in the negotiations in the Middle East which we must acknowledge and continue to encourage.We view with special satisfaction the progress of thenegotiations toward a firm and lasting peace in Guatemala to which the Secretary-General and the Group of Friends among them Mexico  have greatly contributed.The issue of disarmament has for many years been apriority on the agenda of the international community. Justa few months ago  we agreed on the indefinite extension ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Atthe same time  we reaffirmed by consensus importantcommitments relating to disarmament  including agreementby all nuclear weapon States to make systematic andprogressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally  withthe goal of eliminating these weapons within a programmeof general and complete disarmament. We now need toestablish deadlines for the attainment of these objectivesand remain vigilant  through the review mechanism we alsoapproved at the Conference  in monitoring the commitmentsentered into.Nevertheless  the vast majority of members of theinternational community are clearly dissatisfied with thepace of the negotiations on the subject. It would seem thatthe necessary political will does not exist to take advantageof the detente between the major military Powers to moveahead in the sphere of disarmament. Rather  the fearpersists that this process may be reversible. This of coursemakes it advisable to redouble efforts to make progresson disarmament issues  as well as to devote attention toa specific programme of mutual confidence-buildingmeasures among States.The conclusion in 1996 of a treaty of universalvalidity proclaiming an absolute ban on nuclear-weapontests in all environments is the priority task in thedisarmament field. This treaty  currently being negotiatedin Geneva  should be opened for signature before thebeginning of the next session of the General Assembly.With a view to speeding up the attainment of thatobjective  all the nuclear-weapon States should embracethe “zero option”  as the United States of America  Franceand the United Kingdom have already done.The Government of Mexico is extremely concernedat the recent decisions by the People’s Republic of Chinaand France to conduct nuclear-weapon tests despiterepeated calls by the international community for them todesist from such action. We condemn those tests andreiterate our respectful but firm appeal to these countriesto proclaim a moratorium which will remain in force untilthe nuclear test-ban treaty is concluded. The States partiesto the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the member States of theTreaty of Rarotonga will be submitting a draft resolutionto that end for consideration by the Assembly. Moreover we share the view of those States that have indicated theirsupport for the immediate launching of negotiations toensure the prohibition of the production of fissionablematerials for nuclear weapons  which was indeed anotherof the commitments agreed to by consensus at the Reviewand Extension Conference of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Along with the efforts to bring about nucleardisarmament  impetus must also be given to the processof conventional disarmament. Mexico supports and isencouraging the negotiation of conventional-disarmamentagreements which will ensure transparency and limit themanufacture and trade in and transfer of certain types ofconventional weapons  both regionally and worldwide.In the Conference on conventional weapons nowunder way in Vienna  Mexico will promote theprohibition of the use  production  storage and transfer ofland-mines and will submit proposals on the use ofsmall-calibre weapons  cluster bombs  flechettes andair-fueled explosives.16The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations give usan opportunity to reflect on what has been achieved and onwhat we need to change. It should be recalled that the pastyear has also marked the fiftieth anniversary of theinstitutions established at the memorable Bretton Woodsmeeting. The agreements that set up the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank have promotedeconomic cooperation over the five decades following theirestablishment. The globalization of production  of trade and above all  of finance  is undoubtedly a stimulant toeconomic development. Yet it could cause crises whichthese financial institutions are not at present able to meeteffectively.Mexico recognizes and is grateful for the supportreceived from the international community in the financialcrisis it has experienced. The enormous efforts being madeevery day by the Mexican people to resolve this situationwould have had to be even greater if we had not been ableto count on the support of the international community both from friendly Governments and from multilateralagencies. Nevertheless  we must acknowledge that theMexican crisis has afforded evidence of the vulnerability ofthe international financial system as a whole.For the modern State  and especially for developingcountries  the successful conclusion of our structural-changeprocess requires a stable international financial system  thetimely and effective financial support that the internationalfinancing institutions can extend to us  and the ability ofthose institutions to detect and prevent crises facingmember countries in the external sector.Let me now comment on the economic situation in mycountry. Mexico decided to face head-on the problemswhich led to the financial crisis head-on and to establishimmediately  with the support of the internationalcommunity  a strict economic programme entailing dynamicbut necessary adjustment measures.We have taken difficult decisions  with a clearpurpose: to recognize the need for adjustment whilemitigating its costs to the fullest possible extent and at thesame time constructing a new platform for the sustaineddevelopment of the economy.As of now  inflation in Mexico is markedly declining as are interest rates; productive activity in key sectors ofthe economy is beginning to regain its dynamism; and theMexican economy is continuing its process of structuraltransformation with a view to maintaining and increasingour competitiveness. The balance of trade  which was insevere deficit  is now showing a surplus  and we arecontinuing to look for other markets in the world  be theydeveloped or developing  in order to diversify our trade.We fully recognize the social costs of the crisis  andsteps are being taken to mitigate its effects. To assess thesituation in its true light  however  it is not sufficient toconsider only the cost of the present economic policy.The still greater cost that would have been incurred ifdecisive action had not been taken in this serious situationmust also be taken into account.Mexico will continue to insist not only on theapplication of existing treaties in force  the universallyrecognized principles of law and the decisions ofinternational tribunals  but also on the major contributionmade by some United Nations resolutions to thedevelopment of international law.Therefore  we denounce in this forum  mankind’shighest  any attempt to apply  on an extraterritorial basisthe laws of a State to citizens of third countries  as themisnamed “Freedom and Democratic Solidarity with CubaAct” would do. We appeal to the sense of justice  equityand international solidarity of the United States Congressto stop what would be  if passed  a clear violation ofinternational law and an unacceptable political precedentfor the rest of the world.As a further clear demonstration of our commitmentto the rule of law as a standard of conduct  and inresponse to the appeal made by the Secretary-General inhis document entitled “An Agenda for Peace”  Mexicowould be prepared to withdraw the reservation made in itsstatement of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction ofthe International Court of Justice if other countries did thesame.Mexico supports the principle of sharedresponsibility among nations for the major issues of thenew world agenda: the maintenance of a just peace in theworld  the fight against poverty  moves to ensureinternational financial stability  free trade  the battleagainst drug trafficking  the regulation of migratorymovements  with strict respect for the human rights ofmigrants  the strengthening of democracy  and theprotection of human rights. Furthermore  on a selectivebasis  we think it is appropriate to formulate actionprogrammes through world conferences  such as theInternational Conference on Population and Development in Cairo  and the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen; and the incorporation of women in our17society on equal terms on the basis of the recent BeijingDeclaration and Platform for Action.Drug consumption and trafficking have become one ofthe principal threats to the health and welfare of societies endangering their economic  political and social structures.Drug trafficking and related illicit activities  such as theillegal traffic in arms  money laundering  terrorism corruption and other criminal activities  constitute the mostimportant challenge to the administration of justice in manycountries.It is essential for the international community toredouble its efforts to eliminate the demand  production supply  trafficking and illegal distribution of drugs. It isvital to forge new consensus around an internationalstrategy against drug trafficking. For this reason  thePresident of Mexico  Mr. Ernesto Zedillo  has proposed theholding of an international conference to work out proposenew solutions to this problem. The tenth anniversary of theUnited Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic inNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances seems aparticularly appropriate time for such a gathering.We trust that the General Assembly at this session willsee merit in and find full justification for our proposal which has already been endorsed by a significant numberof countries  and we reaffirm  of course  our readiness toengage in broad dialogue on the scope and content of thisinitiative.New forms of intolerance  racism and xenophobiathreaten world peace. The United Nations must carry out anurgent analysis of the growing significance of internationalmigratory flows in all geographical regions which are todayaffected by such destructive attitudes. We call on theinternational community to initiate a dialogue which willmake it possible to find constructive solutions to thisphenomenon  in a context of full respect for the humanrights of migrants and their families  including workers’rights.Starting with this general debate  the United Nationsis entering upon a period as full as of uncertainty as ofopportunity. The twenty-first century will differ from all thepreceding centuries in that  for the first time  we shall havethe opportunity of building a truly world-wide civilization and  by the same token  a set of universal values to guideand modulate the activity of all States. The emergence ofa collective awareness  the inexhaustible talent of humanbeings and the desire that negotiation and understandingshould prevail over any idea of force or imposition are thecornerstones of a new world order in which there will beroom for the richest and most noble contributions of allpeoples.In the phase the United Nations is now entering Mexico will maintain its unswerving support for thegreatest causes of mankind. As part of this commitment we shall bring the moral qualities  the pacifist vocationand the spirit of solidarity of the Mexican people to bearon the building of an international system capable ofimproving the human condition and ensuring the dignityand survival of mankind and of the planet that we sharewith one another."
"107",4557,"MHL",50,1995,"Please permit me tooffer you  Mr. President  our congratulations on yourelection to your high office and to assure you of oursupport and cooperation.To the Secretary-General we wish to express ourhighest regards and admiration for his leadership; and to thePresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session our deep appreciation for his contribution.This is also a most fitting occasion for me personallyto congratulate our brother and neighbour in the Pacific theRepublic of Palau on becoming a full Member of theUnited Nations. My delegation eagerly looks forward toworking closely with that country.Today  as we celebrate the passing of 50 years sincethe creation of the United Nations  we must also reflect onthe events associated with the purpose for which this bodywas created. The havoc wreaked upon humanity by theSecond World War prompted the founding fathers to devisean instrument to ensure a stable world and a better future.My purpose today is  first  to recognize those areasin which this body has undertaken some major initiativesin various sectors that are of great and direct significanceto us in the Marshall Islands. I also will state brieflysome of our concerns with respect to our membership inthe United Nations  and then I intend to raise those issueswhose implications have critical consequences for oursurvival in our country. As members will note  some ofthese have been raised a number of times in this forumduring the past sessions of this body.This year  the completion of the United NationsConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks is of particular importance to mycountry  and my Government intends to sign and ratifythe agreement  which was finalized this summer. We areindebted to the very able leadership of the Chairman Ambassador Nandan  from Fiji. The Marshall Islands hasgiven its full support to the Ambassador in hiscandidature to the post of Secretary General of theInternational Seabed Authority.I wish to acknowledge the support we have receivedfrom the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts of theClimate Change Convention. The scientific evidence wereceived from them in order adequately to address theConvention confirmed our belief in the existence of suchphenomena as sea-level rise in many of our low-lyingislands and in our region.We are particularly concerned by the strongpossibility that the Alliance of Small Island States(AOSIS) Protocol  now known as the Berlin Mandate might be derailed because of intransigent short-termeconomic interests. Such a possibility  arising solely fromthe desire to facilitate the selling of more oil  if real imperils our very survival. We will not accept such acondition and we urge that interference and delaying tacticsthat hamper the work of AOSIS and other concernedcountries should cease. The increasing level of destructioncaused by hurricanes and storms is a clear signal that thematter is urgent. We have deep sympathy with our friendsin the Caribbean countries and in the United States whowere recently struck by this devastation.The follow-up of the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island Developing Statesthat was held in Barbados last year will be looked at duringthis General Assembly session. The comprehensive andambitious programme involved has received thewholehearted endorsement and support of the MarshallIslands Government. In this regard  may I extend our warmthanks to the Chairman of AOSIS  Her ExcellencyAmbassador Annette des Iles of Trinidad and Tobago  forall her efforts.My Government also looks forward to receiving therecommendations of the Fourth World Conference onWomen held in Beijing last month. We will work closelywith the United Nations to ensure that the recommendationsarticulated in the Conference are appropriately addressed.Mr. President  we endorse without hesitation theconcern expressed in your statement in September of thisyear  in which you stated: “Efforts must be made to ensurethat all States that are not yet Members should seek to beadmitted in the near future” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings 1st meeting  p. 7)In the light of this view  the reasons underlying theinability of many of these nations to become Members ofthe United Nations should be examined. My delegationfeels that the unfair burden that is borne by many of theless developed countries with respect to the current systemof assessing the scale of contributions to the regular budgetand for peace-keeping operations deters others from seekingtheir rightful place in this community of nations.The Marshall Islands participated actively in the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situationof the United Nations  and we concur fully with therecommendation that the current floor rate should either beabolished  reduced substantially  or be designed accordingto a formula by which a country is assessed on the basisof its capacity to pay. A decision to that effect by theGeneral Assembly at this session will undoubtedly helpexpedite the realization of the goal that you Mr. President  envisioned.The current inequities with respect to the existingfloor rate have also been noted in a number of reports including that of the Committee on Contributions. Mydelegation strongly urges the United Nations to takeaction on the recommendations made by that Committeeas soon as possible.The need to undertake certain structural reformswithin the United Nations in order to make it moreefficient and responsive to the changing needs of present-day society is critical. One such area which should beclosely looked at is the Security Council  where theconcept of permanent membership does not  in our view constitute fair democratic representation. We are however  aware of the differences in capabilities whichexist among nations. We are aware  too  of the need forthis issue to be carefully weighed and believe thatpossible solutions  including Italy’s proposal for a moreformal set of subgroups or constituencies  should beseriously studied. This would be particularly helpfulwithin our own regional group. We are hopeful that theHigh-level Working Group on the Security Council willact with wise expediency to devise viable and acceptablesolutions to this important issue.We are also carefully studying the various reportsand proposals developed by different groups on the workof other agencies of the United Nations. One aspect whichwe consider to be of great importance is the need todetermine whether the existence of some of the agenciesrealistically justifies the resources provided for theirsupport. We must arrive at a frank assessment of whetherthe tasks entrusted to an agency are actually carried outin a meaningful way  and what that work produces interms of results. As long as this issue remainsinadequately addressed  the climate of resentment andsuspicion will persist and may give rise to adverse effectson the level of contributions needed to support the workof the United Nations. We must make urgent progress tocomplete this task of reform.The Convention on Biological Diversity and itsfundamental tenet regarding the conservation andsustainable use of our resources is under serious threatfrom human activities. Evidence derived from datagathered in our country suggests in no uncertain terms2that nuclear contaminants resulting directly from nuclear-weapons tests conducted in our country have entered ourbasic food chain  upon which our very livelihood dependscausing  among other things  extensive health risks.We must also pause and reflect on the plight of thosegroups of victims who  while the rest of the world wasenjoying the benefits and freedom of the post-war period were themselves caught between the crossfire of super-Power rivalries. One such unfortunate group was the peopleof the Marshall Islands.We are steadily unravelling the large amount ofinformation now available to us on the nature andconsequences of nuclear testing activities carried out in theMarshall Islands. We are deeply disturbed and alarmed atwhat we are uncovering. For in addition to the unfortunatenuclear tests  we unearthed something just as horrifying asthe nuclear tests themselves  if not more so. It grieves meimmeasurably to report today that in one of the Trusteeshipdocuments we discovered it was confirmed that in ameeting held in New York on 10 May 1954  the Secretary-General of the United Nations agreed at the urging of thethen United States Ambassador  Mr. Lodge  to withholdfrom circulation to Member States a petition from theMarshall Islands. The Marshallese petition  which pleadedwith the United Nations to put an immediate halt to thetests was to be withheld by the Secretary-General pendingthe completion of the test series. In this petition  the peopleof the Marshall Islands  through their leaders  had expressedtheir genuine fears and concerns to the only worldinstitution they believed could help them. In return however  the high executives in this institution not onlyfailed to consider this a matter of any significantimportance  but actually engaged in an act most unbefittingthe integrity of this august body.The ethical implications of this act  unimaginable asthey may be  are obvious. Nevertheless  I am raising theissue  and I can assure the Assembly that we shall continueto do so in various United Nations and other internationalforums. We shall do so until the international communitytakes action to address our concerns and until thisOrganization acknowledges the support lent by highofficials to nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands.We want to bring to the attention of the internationalcommunity the reality and the magnitude of the effect ofthese tests on our health  our environment and our futuredevelopment as a nation. We also want it to become awareof our daily struggle to cope with a situation whoseradiation-induced nature continues to haunt us  whosecomplexity in terms of solutions is far beyond ourcapacity to handle and whose conception was solely forthe purpose of countering hostilities and tensions that boreno relationship whatsoever to the Marshall Islands.And so I ask Member States  when they hear usspeaking out about the perils of radiation  to think aboutthese in terms of human suffering and to try to visualizeMarshallese children being born faceless  with no bones or with missing or extra limbs — the jellyfish babies  assome have come to call them — and the irreparabledamage wreaked upon the reproductive health of theirmothers.It would be remiss of me  however  not toacknowledge some of the efforts made by the formerTrustee in addressing our health and environmentalproblems caused by radioactive contaminants. We alsofeel that the international community has an obligation totake serious note of our concerns  as well as to undertakea leading and active role in ensuring that an acceptableprocess  designed to restore the Marshall Islands tohabitable conditions  is effectively and expeditiously setin motion. We were  after all  entrusted by the UnitedNations itself  and so this body had the moral obligationand the irrefutable responsibility at the time of testing tooversee these activities and to make our safety its primaryconcern. The same moral obligation  in our view  remainsbinding even today.Perhaps one of the most gratifying thingsoccurring — which  I might add  is giving us a ray ofhope — is that there is now a growing consciousness ofthe fact that nothing short of a collective effort is neededin order to focus on this issue. That some nations arebeginning  although slowly  to understand and sympathizewith our plight is most encouraging. This consciousnessis clearly reflected in their willingness to incorporate ourconcerns into pertinent and relevant international texts. Ishould like to cite some examples.The Review and Extension Conference of the StatesParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  for example  took special note of theinternational community’s responsibility to assist theinhabitants and restore the environment of the formerUnited Nations Trust Territories that were adverselyaffected by nuclear-weapons-testing programmes.The Fourth World Conference on Women  held thisyear in Beijing  recognized that the concept and practiceof environmental degradation are incongruent with3development and that the use and testing of nuclearweapons are undeniably one factor in the destruction of theenvironment  the displacement of people and the creation ofhigh health risks.The South Pacific Forum  held last month in PapuaNew Guinea  called upon all Governments and internationalorganizations with expertise in the field of clean-up and thedisposal of radioactive contaminants to give appropriateassistance for remedial purposes when so requested byaffected countries. The Forum also noted the existence ofa special responsibility towards those peoples of the formerUnited Nations Trust Territory administered by the UnitedStates that had been adversely affected by nuclear-weapontests conducted during the period of the Trusteeship. Thisresponsibility includes the safe resettlement of displacedhuman populations and the restoration to economicproductivity of affected areas  the provision of adequatehealth care and compensation for the loss of life  land andhealth.During the post-Forum dialogue in Papua New Guineaour former Trustee — the United States — took theposition that it would not stand in the way of the MarshallIslands’ exploring the question of or soliciting assistancefrom other countries or organizations for the purposes ofthe disposal of radioactive contaminants  the resettlement ofaffected populations and the economic restoration of theenvironment. Our sincere hope  however  is that the UnitedStates will not take its advocating of such a position as anopportunity to bow out of its obligations. It is our hope thatit will  instead  redouble its efforts and  with the assistanceof other nations and international bodies  lend its fullsupport for the goal of making our country free ofradioactive contaminants.I should also like to take this opportunity to thank thecurrent Administration for its willingness to acknowledgethe United States Government’s role in using human beingsfor radiation experiments  including at least two confirmedinstances of medical research  which did not provide anydirect benefit to Marshallese subjects.The unearthing of these horrendous activities is an actof political courage on President Clinton’s part. For theMarshall Islands  the White House Advisory Committee onHuman Radiation Experiments uncovered vital informationabout the effect of radiation on people and the environment.The Marshall Islands appreciates the United StatesGovernment’s recognition that the now infamous Bravoblast was not the only weapon that exposed the Marshallesepeople and environment to radiation. It is worth bearing inmind that  while Bravo was the equivalent of 1 000Hiroshima bombs  the total megaton equivalent ofweapons tested in the Marshall Islands exceeded 7 000Hiroshima bombs.It is an important step in our countries’ bilateralrelations that we can now begin to broaden our discussionof exposure. Exposure will never again be defined interms of fallout from Bravo alone  but will nowincorporate the cumulative effects of all the tests and theeffects of residual contamination in the environment. TheMarshall Islands looks forward to continuing to work withthe United States Congress and the ClintonAdministration to ensure that the recommendations of theAdvisory Committee are fully implemented — includingthe recommendation concerning whether it would beappropriate to add the populations of other atolls to thesouth and east of the blasts that have shown excessivethyroid abnormalities. We hope that the internationalcommunity will give these efforts its full support.As if our own four decades of painful experiencewith the dreadful business of nuclear testing were notenough  there appeared once again this year in ourbeautiful Pacific the trauma of yet a further series ofnuclear tests  intended to continue until May next year. Irefer of course to the French resumption this year ofnuclear testing at Mururoa. It is probably because we arefar removed from metropolitan centres that there is atendency for certain people to look at the Pacific as the“ideal desert” for nuclear testing  as one French officialrecently put it. Often overlooked too is the fact that allisland nations spread out across the length and breadth ofthe Pacific are connected by this mighty ocean. Nucleardamage to one island nation poses immense long-termimplications and dangers to others in the region.As people who are living the nightmarish experienceof nuclear testing  we cannot and will not accept the weakargument that the current tests are safe for any of ourPacific neighbours and friends. Nor can we accept thecontinuation of this irresponsible practice in the region.We have denounced its resumption from the beginningand will continue to do so.We joined in support of New Zealand’s case againstFrance in the International Court of Justice. We took thisaction with great regret since France has always been aconstructive partner in our relationship with the developedworld. It is simply incomprehensible to us that this greatnation of culture  science and fine arts could visit thisabomination upon us in the Pacific region. We protested4to the French authorities  but the first tests went aheadanyway. Although the International Court of Justicedeclined to hear the case  the decision was entirely basedon technicalities. France should not think that this is avictory for it  as many of the judges pointed out that therewas a strong moral and legal background for halting thetests. I strongly disagree with the claim made by the FrenchForeign Minister here a few weeks ago — that the testswere environmentally safe. Look at the situation I have justdescribed in the Marshall Islands. We have also receiveddocumentation from a number of eminent scientists whichwould  at the very least  warrant exercising caution.Furthermore  France is a State party to the NoumeaConvention for the Protection and Development of NaturalResources and Environment of the South Pacific Region aswell as the Convention on Biological Diversity. Theprinciple of environmental-impact assessment and theprecautionary approach are not compatible with theactivities that it is carrying out today. The offer to carry outan impact assessment after the tests are finished is aridiculous offer  since by then it might be much too late.The tests are violating treaties and they are violating ourenvironment  and I also think that they are a violation ofour human rights. The tests must stop. They must stop now.The collective voice of the leaders of the countries ofthe South Pacific Forum was heard when a statement wasissued during its meeting in Papua New Guinea expressingextreme outrage at the resumption of French nuclear testingin the Pacific. They demanded that France desist from anyfurther tests. The outrage was especially compounded bythe intransigence of France  and the People’s Republic ofChina  in persisting with their nuclear tests in the face ofthe strong views of the Pacific region. My Governmentstands by the decision announced last week by theChairman of the Forum  Sir Julius Chan  that France is nolonger invited to the post-Forum dialogue.We are in full support of the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We will also work actively to achievea breakthrough in the negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We also acknowledge the support of just  fair-minded and world-conscious leaders and peoples  who havecondemned and continue to condemn this anachronisticseries of tests in the Pacific. We join our voice to theirs insupport.This session provides the community of nations witha unique opportunity to examine our past performancerecord. As a world-governing institution  the United Nationsmust look closely at its strengths and build upon them.Likewise  it must pay particular attention to itsshortcomings and weaknesses so that it can continue toprovide much-needed hope  strength and direction to thenations of the world."
"108",4580,"MKD",50,1995,"I extend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral my warmcongratulations on his election as President of this jubileefiftieth session of the General Assembly. At the same timeI wish to express appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Amara Essy  for his very successful work.On 3 October 1995  in a cowardly terrorist act  anattempt was made on the life of the President of theRepublic of Macedonia  Kiro Gligorov. This assassinationattempt was a deliberate political act intended to destabilizemy country. It was carried out  not insignificantly  at a timewhen the centuries-old dream of the Macedonian people fortheir own State and for an equal role in the internationalcommunity had come true. Furthermore  it happened at thevery time when the resolution of the situation in theBalkans was in sight and when all of our neighbours andthe world had come to accept the fact that the Republic ofMacedonia was a reality  and a factor of peace andstability.The attempt to assassinate President Gligorov is anattack against the independent and peace-loving positionof Macedonia. It is directed against life in peace andagainst the well-being of all our citizens. This terrorist acthas been strongly condemned and decisively rejected byall of my countrymen  as well as by the internationalcommunity.The efforts of the United Nations againstterrorism — a criminal phenomenon — must continuewith a strong determination to wipe this scourge outcompletely. We should all fight unabatedly against theforces of darkness and the power-hungry demagogueswho are the main source and generator of criminalterrorist activities.The attempt to assassinate my President on3 October 1995 shall not  under any circumstances  divertus in our pursuit of democracy  reforms  and thedevelopment of good-neighbourly relations with all of ourneighbours  in brief  our efforts to transform our countryinto a modern European State.I wish to take this opportunity to express to thePresident of the General Assembly  the Secretary-Generaland all delegations in this body our sincere gratitude fortheir sympathy and solidarity and for their wishes for thespeedy recovery of my President.As our Organization approaches the next 50 years as we approach the twenty-first century  it is timely toacknowledge and pay tribute to the great achievements ofthe United Nations in bringing about a better and saferworld and to stress the need to work together to improveour Organization and prepare for the challenges of thefuture.Throughout the past 50 years  the United Nations hasbeen the right place in which to build betterunderstanding among nations  the right place in which toaddress some of the basic problems and needs ofhumanity and the right place in which to coordinateactions towards a brighter future for mankind. The UnitedNations assisted in achieving peace in many regions ofthe world; it succeeded in preventing many conflicts; ithelped in decolonization; it delivered humanitarianassistance; it succeeded in minimizing the nuclear threatand in building bridges over many gulfs betweencountries all over the world.In the past few years  very important decisions havebeen adopted at many United Nations conferences  such14as the Earth Summit in Rio  the World Conference onHuman Rights in Vienna  the International Conference onPopulation and Development in Cairo  the World Summitfor Social Development in Copenhagen  the Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing  the 1995 Review andExtension Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in New Yorkand the discussions on land-mines at the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva. We must work to implement thedecisions made at these conferences. We must work onfinalizing the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  and onfurthering the disarmament process. At the same time  wemust also begin working towards finding solutions to  andpreventing  the new problems and challenges that we arefacing in this ever-changing world. Rapid technologicalprogress brings new hope for a better future but also putsdangerous power into the hands of some of the worstenemies of our civilization. We have to design newmechanisms that will enable us to face these newchallenges and enable the United Nations to achieve newsuccesses in the next 50 years.On the basis of the experience of the past 50 years  wewill have to examine the functioning of the United Nationssystem as a whole  to restructure some of its parts  and toassign new tasks to some of the others for the purpose ofachieving the efficiency of the Organization as a whole.The United Nations must have as its vision a world that ismore stable  politically and economically. The recentagreement between Israel and Palestine gives hope forlasting peace in the Middle East. We strongly support theSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development and hope that at this session  we will carry out this most importantundertaking successfully.Economic development is necessary for political andsocial stability. For many countries access to markets andthe question of finances for development are of essentialimportance. We must also ensure that the United Nationsshall continue to be financially viable. Each Member of theUnited Nations  however large or small  has an obligationto do its share. We must also discuss the possibleimprovement of the work of the Security Council. To thisend  my delegation fully supports the inclusion of Germanyand Japan as permanent members of the Security Council.At this session of the General Assembly  I can assurethe President of the General Assembly that he will have thefull support of the Macedonian delegation in bringing to asuccessful conclusion the many important issues we haveon the agenda. I would like to take this opportunity tothank this General Assembly for giving us the importantduty of presiding over the Second Committee. We attachparticular significance to the economic issues that will bediscussed there.The Republic of Macedonia  despite difficultconditions  achieved its independence peacefully  withoutthe use of force and with respect for all internationalnorms. In a region so burdened by tragic wars  a regionwith violations of human rights  with a high degree ofinstability  we have pursued the path of our independencewith a strong commitment to resolve all of our problemsand conflicts peacefully  through dialogue  with good will with readiness for cooperation with all of our neighboursand with all international organizations.We are determined to contribute  within theframework of our capabilities  to the overcoming of all ofthe divisions and conflicts in the Balkans inherited fromthe past and to pursue the integration of our country intoEurope as soon as possible  with respect for all of theEuropean norms and standards of relations betweencountries as the only means to avoid repeating the tragicincidents of this region.One of the basic principles of our foreign policy isthat of equidistance in our relations with our neighbours a readiness to establish equally good relations with all ofour neighbours  based on mutual respect  the inviolabilityof borders  non-interference in the internal affairs of othercountries  and non-use of force.Recently in this building  under the auspices of theUnited Nations  through the mediation of Cyrus Vance Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  and Matthew Nimetz  Special Envoy ofPresident Clinton  my country  the Republic ofMacedonia  reached an accord with the Republic ofGreece which regulates many aspects of relations betweenthe two countries  and creates a basis for good-neighbourly cooperation. We believe that this accord willcontribute to increased stability in the Balkans and willhave a positive influence on the future development ofevents in the region. We believe this accord is a goodillustration of the positive role of the internationalcommunity  and especially of the United Nations  inpursuing peaceful solutions in relations between States based on the principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations.The Republic of Macedonia  during its four years ofindependence  has faced many challenges. The economyof the whole region was deeply disturbed by the war to15the north of us. As a result of the United Nations sanctionsagainst Serbia and Montenegro  the usual route to ourtraditional markets in Europe was cut off. The losses causedto our economy by the sanctions amount to over $4 billion.Since February 1994  we have also been under a unilateraltrade embargo from the south. In the same period  we haveundertaken a thorough transformation of our economy turning it into a market-oriented economy  with all of thedifficulties and risks that this transition brings. Despite allof this  we have succeeded in maintaining a high level ofpolitical  social and economic stability. We have built newdemocratic institutions with provisions for full protection ofhuman rights and a political system in which all nationalminorities are recognized and enjoy full participation. Wecannot claim that we have solved all of our problems.However  we have built the right mechanisms for solvingthem.A great deal of attention has been given during thissession of the General Assembly to United Nations peace-keeping operations. The enormous efforts of the UnitedNations in many peace-keeping operations have had variedresults. Some of them have been more successful thanothers. Allow me to say a few words about the UnitedNations peace-keeping operation in the Republic ofMacedonia  the United Nations Preventive DeploymentForce (UNPREDEP). It is a very successful operation andis fully achieving its goals. It has contributed tremendouslyto peace and stability in the southern Balkans and has builtconfidence among the people of the Republic of Macedoniain international organizations. This operation proves thatpreventive deployment is the most effective channel forUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts. This operation is thebest example that results can be achieved even with asmall  almost symbolic deployment of United Nationspeace-keepers  if it is done at the right time and with aclear mandate. The full support the people of the Republicof Macedonia are giving this operation shows that the rightdecision was made by the Security Council when thispeace-keeping operation was approved. This has been avery successful operation  and we hope it will serve as amodel for many future activities of the United Nations; ifso  I am confident that the same positive results will beachieved.These days there is new hope that peace in Bosnia canbe achieved. This tragic war has resulted in huge numbersof victims  a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe andmassive destruction. We hope that the efforts of theinternational community will result in a solution which willrespect the basic principles of the modern world. Bosniashould be preserved as an independent State within itsinternationally recognized borders. Provision must bemade for full respect of human rights  and repetition ofatrocities and war crimes must never be allowed.We believe that as soon as peace is achieved it willbe necessary to start the process of the reduction of armsin the Balkans  to start the process of a Balkan détente.This year the General Assembly  under item 81 ofits agenda  will consider the report of the Secretary-General on the development of good-neighbourly relationsamong Balkan States  prepared on the basis of resolution48/84 B  adopted at its forty-eighth session on theproposal of the Macedonian delegation. It is expected thatspecial attention will be paid to measures and preventiveactivities aimed at the creation of a stable zone of peaceand cooperation in the Balkans by the year 2000.The only way to achieve long-term peace andstability in the whole Balkan region is through the fullintegration of all the Balkan countries into Europe  withfull respect for European standards and norms. Theindependence  territorial integrity and inviolability of theborders of all Balkan countries must be respected.Problems of national minorities that have been at the rootof many conflicts in the Balkans throughout its historyshould be addressed. All national minorities should berecognized and their basic human rights fully respected.It is our duty to work for peace and the democraticdevelopment of the whole Balkan region now  and not toleave burdens of the past to future generations.Just as we must work for the stabilization of theBalkan region as a whole  we must also recognize theuniqueness of each of the countries of the region. Theproblems are not identical  and therefore the solutionscannot be identical. There are a lot of discussions aboutthe problems of former Yugoslavia. It is very importantto understand that there is no such entity as formerYugoslavia”. There are a number of new countries in thisarea  each with their own set of problems and prospects and there is no way to find a unified solution for theseproblems. Each country must be treated individually.The hope and desire for a better world were thefoundations for the United Nations 50 years ago. At thissession of the General Assembly  it is our duty to lay thegroundwork for the role of the United Nations in thetwenty-first century. We should all work together towardsa safer world and to reduce the fears and threats of thefuture as much as possible."
"109",4626,"MLI",50,1995,"Weare meeting on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations in order to assess  as we do each year  theprogress made by our Organization  an institution whichwas built to uphold peace and solidarity among men.To judge by its agenda  this session very muchresembles past sessions  but clearly this year’s session hasa much deeper meaning  because it marks the passing of50 years for the Organization  50 years during which thecommon destiny of diverse peoples has been consolidatedand advanced  despite many challenges and perils.It is significant on the eve of this fiftieth anniversaryto see the representative of an ancient European nationpresiding over the work of the fiftieth session. Indeed  thecontinent to which Portugal belongs  with its historic role has always been a major actor in the mechanisms ofinternational relations. The election of a President fromPortugal testifies to unanimous recognition by theinternational community and is also a tribute to thePresident’s talent and great diplomatic abilities.I take this opportunity to address our warmcongratulations to the President’s predecessor  our brotherand friend  Amara Essy  of Côte d’Ivoire  who so ablyand with great dedication guided the work of the forty-ninth session.It is also significant that this symbolic session istaking place during the mandate of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  elected some three years ago to head thisOrganization. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is also known asone of the skilled negotiators who  through their foresightand diplomatic talent  have cleared the way for peace inthe Middle East. Today  he is working tirelessly in thenoble and challenging mission of having the UnitedNations live up to its noble ideals  its inviolable principlesand its central purposes.The Republic of Mali became a Member of theUnited Nations 35 years ago  on 28 September 1960  onlysix days after its accession to national and internationalsovereignty on 22 September 1960.Mali  together with some 30 other African States thus expanded the family of independent and free nations bringing to the United Nations the vitality  humanism andgenerosity of the peoples of Africa.The international personality of Mali — apersonality that has been forged through the centuries —is based first of all on the ability of its people to live inharmony with their neighbours and on Mali’s openness tothe world  its sense of solidarity and its steadfastcommitment to defending the values of mankind.The Republic of Mali will continue to be dedicatedto that vocation despite the set-backs andmisunderstandings that are inherent in contacts betweendiverse cultures and traditions because we have the firmconviction that ethnic and cultural diversity constitute asource of mutual enrichment  and a powerful stimulant toeconomic  social and cultural progress.40Indeed  by its geographical position  Mali is at thecrossroads between northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.It is a nation enriched by centuries of playing the role of amelting-pot of diverse cultures.Today  fortunately  Mali lives in an atmosphere ofgood will  ethnic pluralism  religious pluralism  politicalpluralism  social and cultural pluralism.The national problem in the northern part of ourcountry has been making news because of partisan unfounded allegations broadcast across the world by lobbieswhose sole objective is to destabilize young States. Thecrisis that shook the northern part of Mali by its murderousand destructive character is one of the harshest tests thatmy country has experienced. With the restoration andconsolidation of peace and the return of Malian refugees ona massive scale  the feelings of rejection of the State  notedwith the blockages and ensuing violent reactions  havebecome an anachronism in a State that is founded on therule of law  a State where neither the language of arms northat of any other form of violence is admissible as a formof expression of the right to representation.The successful meeting in Timbuktu between theGovernment and the development partners in northern Malifrom 15 to 18 July 1995  is not only a symbol of exemplaryinternational solidarity but provided an opportunity forinternational opinion to take note of the firm will of allsectors of Malian society to tackle  first and foremost  thetasks of development.Born after a painful confinement on 26 March 1991 the date when a popular revolution triumphed  democracyhas become a permanent and ever-present fact in the dailylife of the people of Mali  who have had to pay a heavyprice to achieve it.The democratic revolution which took place four yearsago in Mali is a part of a general movement throughout theworld to knock down the fortresses of oppression andalienation of peoples. It gave rise to a young democraticState which  despite the shortcomings inherent in anyhuman undertaking  does represent a successful example ofthe rapid construction of a State built on the rule of law.Concerned with consolidating this democratic process the Government of Mali initiated  and successfully carriedout a year ago in the framework of a search for a generalconsensus on all of the problems of the nation  wideregional conferences followed by a national conference.This forum allowed all of the forces of the nation to debatein a transparent context all of the concerns of the peopleand enabled the governors and the governed to developconsensual solutions to face the challenges relating to thefuture of the nation and the development of the country.May I emphasize that democratic Mali has made ita point of honour to respect human rights and the rightsof peoples. Thus a distinguished panel met on 10December 1994  the anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration on Human Rights  bringing together notedinternational jurists who  in a completely transparentcontext  held public hearings with the Government ofMali on its human rights management. This was a boldexercise which set a valuable example and enabled us todemonstrate that respect for human rights and theestablishment of a State based on the rule of law havenow become a reality in Mali.In Mali  as in many countries  history accelerated ata dizzying pace towards the end of the 1980s.The fall of the Berlin Wall was a symbol of the endof the division of the world into two rival ideological andmilitary blocs. This foreshadowed fundamental andirreversible changes in international relations and led to anew thinking on relations of force between great andmid-sized Powers.The end of this bipolar world was expected to makethe risk of a world war disappear. Mankind hoped to seethe realization of its legitimate aspirations to peace andsecurity. That hope quickly waned when we realized thatthe period following the fall of the Berlin Wall became aperiod of heart-rending conflicts throughout the world.We have been seeing a terrible cycle of violence anddestruction shaking the very foundations of the unity territorial integrity and sovereignty of many countries.Africa  it is said  is a land of fire on the belly of theworld. It remains a suffering continent. It carries withinit deep divisions and we see unbearable images ofendless lines of refugees fleeing from their own country.The problem of refugees remains a tragedy  one whichthe international community must rapidly face andresolve.The inter-ethnic massacres in Burundi and Rwandawhich led hundreds of thousands of victims to flee theirhomes are powerful challenges to human conscience andmorality.41The situation in Rwanda calls for a constant effort onthe part of the United Nations to restore peace and enablehundreds of thousands of refugees to return undisturbed totheir homes.The tragedy of Rwanda  which does dishonour to thehuman race  demands for that reason that the internationalcommunity seek a way to implement solutions to ensurethat that country shall achieve harmonious and definitiveinter-ethnic coexistence. Hence  Mali  which has a militarycontingent in Rwanda  suggests that Rwanda should receivesubstantial assistance from the international community.Among the armed conflicts that afflict our continent isthat of Somalia. In that country  the situation remainschaotic as a result of the intransigence and ambition of thewarlords. The States of that region have already mademajor efforts in the search for peace and we pay tribute tothem. They should  with the assistance of the internationalcommunity of course  redouble their efforts in order toachieve solutions acceptable to all the parties.Should they succeed  the efforts under way in Liberiacould set an example for the settlement of local conflictsthrough subregional initiatives. Since the 19 August signingof the Abuja agreement by the parties to the conflict  atransitional Government of National Union has beenestablished in the capital  Monrovia  with a view to holdingfree and fair elections: a sure sign of the return of peace toLiberia.With regard to crisis-settlement in Africa  Angolaprovides a source of great satisfaction with the signing ofthe Lusaka Protocol of 20 November 1994  and especiallywith the meetings at Lusaka and at Cape Town betweenPresident José Eduardo dos Santos and Mr. Jonas Savimbi.That impetus towards peace is being consolidated with theparticipation of the União Nacional para a IndependênciaTotal de Angola (UNITA) in the exercise of power. I takethis opportunity to offer warm congratulations to all theAfrican Heads of State and to the Secretary-General and hisSpecial Representative on their remarkable contributions tothe restoration of peace in Angola.Mali also follows with interest the question of WesternSahara; we sincerely hope that the organization andupcoming holding of a referendum on self-determinationwill lead to permanent peace in this north-western part ofour continent.As the President of the Republic of Mali  Mr. AlphaOumar Konaré  has always stressed  Mali earnestlyencourages the creation of an African-run centralmachinery to prevent  manage and settle conflicts inAfrica. We invite the international community to supportthis initiative. The world must understand that theprevention of conflicts costs mankind less than dealingwith their consequences. The Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the United Nations must growincreasingly involved in anticipating conflicts and lessdependent on seeking remedies after the illness has takenhold.A major political development of the 1990s hascertainly been the gradual return of peace to the MiddleEast with the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreementin 1993. We earnestly hope that talks on the Golanbetween Israel and Syria and the new agreement onextending Palestinian autonomy to the West Bank will putthe final seal on a comprehensive peace in the region. Inthe Middle East as elsewhere in the world  Mali continuesto make its modest contribution to the quest forinternational peace and security.Within the United Nations  the Non-AlignedMovement  the OAU and all other regional andsubregional groups  my country quickly saw the need fora new  broader vision of international relations  the onlycredible alternative to the division of the world into tworival blocs  whose bitter competition could have ledmankind into catastrophe. The end of the bipolar worldconfirms the correctness and relevance of that politicalperception. That is why  consistent with our convictions we think that for developing countries the United Nationsremains the most appropriate framework to plumb the trueaspirations of mankind: the inevitable needs ofdevelopment and the establishment of relations of greatersolidarity between countries of the North and of theSouth. We must understand that growing poverty anddestitution are at the root of violence and armed conflict.Hence  development questions remain in theforefront of the concerns of all countries. Today economic performance is a criterion for assessing thepower of a State in the community of nations. Here unfortunately  Africa remains on the sidelines. Indeed despite the resumption early last year of world economicgrowth after several years of stagnation  the situation ofAfrica  resulting from its marginalization  continues to beof great concern.The efforts of Africa’s developing countries througheconomic reform  structural adjustment andencouragement of the private sector have been wiped out42by fluctuations in commodity prices and by excessive costsof debt service. At the same time  direct foreign investmentin the continent remains weak. Moreover  Africa’sburdensome debt is constantly growing  now consuming25 per cent of our export earnings. The tragedy of thissituation lies in its concurrence with a resurgence of naturaldisasters and the persistence or exacerbation of illnessessuch as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and especially  malaria.“An Agenda for Development” recognizes the right ofdeveloping countries — especially the least developedcountries — to development; it must reorient the objectivesand priorities of the United Nations system towardssocio-economic programmes and activities aimed ateliminating poverty and developing human resourcesthrough education  training  social integration and thecreation of productive jobs.Unfortunately  the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s remains no more thana devout wish. The only initiative under that programme —the establishment of a diversification fund for Africancommodities — has not succeeded owing to the clearreticence of some developed countries. This proves  if proofwere needed  the scant interest in Africa’s legitimate claimsfor reinvigorating the continent’s growth and development.International trade relations have been marked by theconclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization. Developingcountries expect complete implementation of the Final Actof the Uruguay Round  especially with respect tocompensatory mechanisms for the least developed countries for net food importers and for those which will experiencenegative effects from the elimination of the generalizedsystem of preferences.According to concurring estimates by the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) andthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  the overall result of the eighth negotiatingcycle will benefit the industrialized countries only. To takethe example of Africa  OECD studies project lossesexceeding $2 billion by the year 2002. In this connection the World Trade Organization should offer bold decisionsand recommendations in favour of Africa.Environmental questions are of major concern  for thevery survival of mankind depends on a balanced ecology.We fervently hope that the decisions and recommendationsof the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment will be quickly implemented in order tosave our planet from dangerous  fatal deterioration. Mycountry  which has experienced the effects of drought anddesertification and which must still address theirconsequences  attaches great value to the United NationsConvention to Combat Desertification in Those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification Particularly in Africa  concluded at Paris on17 June 1994.Among the priority challenges facing theinternational community are social questions  includingoverpopulation  the production  trafficking and use ofdrugs  unemployment  violence  social disintegration andthe role of women in economic and social development.We are convinced that the International Conferenceon Population and Development  held at Cairo  markedthe beginning of a new process with respect to populationand development strategy. Likewise  the recommendationsof the World Summit for Social Development  held lastMarch at Copenhagen  should help ease the fate of themost severely disadvantaged. The Fourth WorldConference on Women  held at Beijing from 4 to15 September 1995  constituted a praiseworthy concreteinitiative to take true account of the role of women ineconomic and social activities.Like most other African States  Mali remains a poorcountry faced with major problems — structural andrelated to our circumstances — of economic development.The implementation of our programme of action for the1990s is founded on strategies scrupulously based onagreements with the Bretton Woods institutions oneconomic and financial policies for the decade. Besidesstemming from our national will  our country’s basicguidelines are in perfect keeping with a strategy forsustainable development and with the United NationsProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s.The Republic of Mali is working tirelessly to resumedialogue on strengthening international economiccooperation for development through partnership. In Malithis has been reflected in round tables with ourdevelopment partners in key sectors of the nationaleconomy.On population policy  our country’s activities includethe establishment of a decentralized institutionalcoordinating machinery for the implementation ofpopulation policy throughout the country  and work in43various areas of economic and social development.Moreover  the United Nations Population Fund programmewith Mali has been adapted to the content and policies ofthe Programme of Action adopted at the InternationalConference on Population and Development.We in Mali think that the implementation of thesevarious United Nations programmes and activities  basedfirst and foremost on an increasingly sustained nationaleffort  requires more vigorous mobilization of bothmultilateral and bilateral assistance. Thus  it is increasinglyurgent for rich and industrialized countries to provide theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies with theresources they need to properly implement the various plansand programmes of action adopted since the beginning ofthe 1990s. That is the only way in which the twenty-firstcentury can see a widespread economic takeoff and sharedprosperity for all.The Republic of Mali is unreservedly committed tomore open international cooperation based on solidarity.Stronger still is our readiness to work towards economicintegration within Africa  most of whose States cannotachieve sustainable and balanced development on their own.Working through regional groupings  African countriesmust carry out an economic policy of complementarity withrespect to their national production  and must limit allcompetition that is harmful and that gives rise to the seriousproblem of negative resource flows. These economicentities  established by interdependent States  must enjoy allnecessary support from development partners.The United Nations  born in the wake of the greatesttrauma mankind has ever known  set as its goal the buildingof a new world through law. A powerful mechanism in theservice of peace  solidarity and development had beencreated. Never before has the world produced such animpressive arsenal of texts  conventions  declarations andprogrammes of action  all aimed at defining the rules ofinternational conduct  preventing war and conflict guaranteeing peaceful coexistence and promotingdevelopment. With the United Nations  a new internationalethic was born. The victorious Powers of the Second WorldWar  which retain the formidable right of veto  had a moralduty to make that ethic a permanent one.Having been conceived through relationships of force the United Nations unfortunately grew fragile owing to blocand Power rivalries. Hence  the Security Council  which isnone the less the main body responsible for themaintenance of international peace and security  was oftenparalysed in carrying out its basic mandate. In the course ofthis half-century  several serious conflicts nearly led to athird world confrontation. While the world has seen aperiod of non-war at the global level  people themselveshave been afflicted by the balance of terror imposed bythe nuclear Powers.The new international political context that hasprevailed since the end of the 1980s is increasingly fertileground for an international consensus favouring a neededrehabilitation of the United Nations and a restoration ofits authority in carrying out its basic mandates. Thereremains an urgent need to undertake the restructuring andrevitalization of United Nations structures to make themmore effective: to take more rapid  fairer decisions and tobe better able to monitor  respond and sanction whereverand whenever necessary in the interests of theinternational community.That  indeed  is the mission of the United Nations which has established peace-keeping operations since1948. It is the duty of all States to provide these peace-keeping operations with sufficient human and materialresources  so that no one can doubt the Organization’scredibility.Wherever they are deployed  such operations mustalso face serious attacks on human rights and the rights ofpeoples. In that connection  the tragic situation in Bosniaand Herzegovina merits the full attention of the GeneralAssembly. In accordance with United Nations resolutions the international community must restore the sovereigntyof the Bosnian people and the territorial integrity of theirRepublic. The delegation of Mali  which also endorses therelevant resolutions of the Organization of the IslamicConference  considers that the challenge to theinternational community in this former Yugoslav republicmust be addressed with determination to stop it frombecoming a dangerous precedent in international relations.A world based on law must be supported by theideal of a world of justice. The need to provideassistance  so often invoked by the United Nations and byregional organizations  has relativized the principle ofnon-interference in the internal affairs of a State when theinternational community finds in that State flagrantviolations of human rights and the rights of peoples.The United Nations has thus carried out an act ofjustice and law in reestablishing republican institutions inHaiti. It is also in the name of law and justice that Malicalls for the lifting of international sanctions againstLibya and Iraq  whose peoples want nothing more than44happiness  well-being and peace. Maintaining thesesanctions  which affect only the Libyan and Iraqi peoples runs frankly counter to morality and to our duty to assistand show solidarity with those peoples.The twentieth century will have been a century ofenormous progress in all spheres  in the course of whichmankind will have demonstrated its impressive creativecapacity. It is an important symbol that it was during thiscentury  just a few months ago  that the internationalcommunity reaffirmed its determination to ban forever theproliferation and use of nuclear weapons by the indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT). The rejection of the nuclear weapon marksan irreversible choice by the world’s peoples: in favour ofpeace and development.It is surprising that nuclear-weapon States have notunderstood the extraordinary trust that the rest of theinternational community has shown in them by itsoverwhelming accession to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; that trust requiresresponsibility on the part of nuclear-weapon States. ThoseStates must meet the challenge of peace by putting acomplete and immediate end to real and simulated testingand by gradually destroying their nuclear arsenals.As we come to the end of the second millennium  wesee a world-wide movement for democracy and freedom.The Organization has everywhere encouraged the quest forjustice and the free expression of peoples. To consolidateits gains and to become permanent  this vast movementmust be accompanied by the democratization ofinternational relations. But unfortunately  thatdemocratization is late in coming. The President of theRepublic of Mali has described the situation in this way:“Present inequalities among individuals  amongcommunities and among States unmistakably raise thequestion of justice  linked at the national level withorder and morality ... The world is composed ofongoing disparities  which give rise to conflict andviolence. We must all understand the peril we incur byfailing to reorder present structures that areunfavourable to the less well off and that benefit themore powerful. We need a world of greater solidarity;a less selfish and more humane world”.It is  indeed  sad to note that international relationscontinue to be governed from the standpoint of carving theworld up into spheres of influence and spheres of interests even though new political and economic changes indeveloping countries demand new behaviour by ourdevelopment partners  specifically the industrializedcountries. It is increasingly clear that on the wholeinternational cooperation is being fueled by economiccriteria alone  to the detriment of the values of solidarityand justice. Yet the challenges facing mankind arecommon challenges. They include environmentaldegradation  pollution  toxic waste  sickness  hunger poverty and malnutrition. The balance of the planet andthe survival of mankind depend on the collective solutionswe find to these serious problems.It cannot be overstressed that only internationalrelations based on solidarity  fairness and justice canenable us to face the challenge; and these are within ourgrasp. The maintenance of peace in the comingmillennium will depend on the international community’sability to foster development for all. Hence  it is urgent torestore the values of solidarity  justice and democracy ininternational relations in order to save succeedinggenerations."
"110",4667,"MLT",50,1995,"It is with great pleasure thatI congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. You bring tothe Assembly the wealth of your personal  political andacademic experience and the positive contribution whichPortugal has given to the work of the Organizationthroughout its 40 years of membership. At the dawn ofdemocracy in your country  yours was a determiningcontribution towards freedom based on fundamentalhuman rights and a State built on the rule of law. Yourcommitment to these principles required no mean measureof moral and physical courage.May I join other speakers in saluting the ForeignMinister of Côte d’Ivoire  Mr. Amara Essy  who skilfullyled the forty-ninth session and continued to promote therevitalization of the General Assembly within a broaderframework of strengthening the United Nations system.It is with great pleasure that we are convinced that under your able leadership  Mr. President  Member Stateswill continue to strive to ensure that this Assemblyreflects with immediacy and with clarity that which theworld community desires of the United Nations.The maintenance of international peace through theadvancement of social progress and better standards oflife in larger freedom for all was 50 years ago  andremains today  the onerous but vital mission entrusted tothis Organization by the peoples of the United Nations. Inlooking back at the past 50 years  we must exerciserealistic restraint. It would be a mistake to recall onlythose instances when our efforts were crowned withsuccess. It would be equally erroneous if we were tojudge the efficacy of the United Nations by highlightingonly those complex instances when results failed to dojustice to our collective will and endeavour.The determination to save succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war was what inspired nations andbrought them together to form this Organization towardsthe end of the Second World War. We have managed to20avoid a global conflict. This is in itself a great achievement one that inspires hope and confidence. Yet realistic restraintis particularly called for at this moment. Grief still echoesover the explosions of cannon fire aimed at villages andcities under siege.During its first 45 years the United Nations was heldhostage to the prevailing cold war logic. Yet even duringthose years  when world peace was strapped to theterrifying balance of nuclear destructive potential  therewere moments of great significance.The process of decolonization  even if there wassuffering at times  remains a peak achievement inhumankind’s history during the twentieth century. Itreaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignityand worth of the human person and in the equal rights ofmen and women and of nations large and small. Thatprocess paved the way for the achievement of independenceby peoples spread around the globe  who today arerepresented in this Hall as sovereign nations.The five years since the end of the cold war havewitnessed a world community subjected to the most intenseperiods of instability. High expectations violently oscillatedwith the doldrums of despair; the exuberant relief ofpeoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternatedwith the miserable anguish of occupation and “ethniccleansing”; rays of hope were paralleled by violentexplosions of civil strife; nuclear non-proliferation wascountered by a devastating spread in the traffic inconventional weaponry; peace for some was matched bywanton slaughter for others. Never have mankind’saspirations been so great  yet never have they been soformidably challenged.Such events cannot but impact on our concept ofsecurity. The primary mandate of the United Nations is“To maintain international peace ...  and to thatend: to take effective collective measures for theprevention and removal of threats to the peace”.How can we ensure and implement this commission?Five years ago  in the General Assembly  I had thehonour of calling on the United Nations to implement theprovisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter with regard toregional arrangements. Later  at the Helsinki follow-upmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE)  Malta proposed that the CSCE declareitself a regional arrangement  in terms of Chapter VIII ofthe United Nations Charter — which it did.It is still too early to assess the impact and fullpotential of that development  particularly in view of thecomplex situations that already existed and continued todevelop in the CSCE region. However  we are convincedthat the future ability and effectiveness of the UnitedNations in containing  addressing and resolving situationsof conflict is dependent on the creation and consolidationof such regional arrangements.The world has witnessed communities rediscover theoldest recipes for the generation of human misery. Mostof us believed that tolerance was universally embraced that it was strong enough to have imbued the manner inwhich we view elements that give nations and ethnic andreligious groups their rightful identity. The abuse of theseelements as a platform and weapon of war cannot butinstil in us determination to consolidate structures thatpromote a permanent confidence-building dialogue.During the darkest hours of the cold war the CSCElearnt that confidence-building was the most effectiveguarantee in the promotion of a wider concept of security.That conviction remains as we seek to identify thesupporting structures for a European security architecture.The broad elements of the emerging European securityarchitecture are already in place.On one hand  the CSCE  now changed into theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  is transmuting the notion of confidence- andsecurity-building from a remedial measure of the age ofantagonism to a tool of partnership in the newinternational environment.On the other hand  the enlarging European Union  ofwhich Malta expects to become full member in the nearfuture  provides a unique and ever-deepening dimensionof the process of regional cooperation. Malta has alwaysseen membership of the European Union in terms thatencompass not only economic but also much broaderpolitical dimensions. In this spirit  membership of theUnion constitutes for us both the natural culmination ofour significant economic and social development of recentyears and — more important — the opportunity toparticipate in a collective endeavour that consolidatesunion within Europe and stability within the region thereby providing a solid anchorage for those fundamentalvalues of democracy  the rule of law and the observanceof human rights to which we are deeply attached.21Comprehensive security is distinct from notions ofdefence. It is much wider in scope. It is more appropriatefor treating issues not necessarily or immediately linkedwith a military threat or outbreak of conflict.Comprehensive regional security structures could be themost effective instruments for identifying  analysing andcontaining the original root causes of potential conflict.Such regional arrangements cannot operate inisolation. They must take into account the work of otherinternational mechanisms that help signal developmentswhich  in the short or long term  could destabilize regionalor international security. Early-warning systems are anessential ingredient for success.To save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar we must cultivate and nurture stability. Equilibrium inthe socio-political environment cannot be ensured throughsuppression or imposition. It requires the development ofeffective rapid-response mechanisms to tackle problemareas that generate instability. A multifaceted approachdemonstrates an awareness of the manner in which differentissues  if left unattended or unresolved  fester and spread tothreaten society.Weaving such vital areas as human rights  fundamentalfreedoms and social justice into the broader network ofcomprehensive security is the foundation for the launchingof stability pacts which give peoples and nations thereassurance of peace  dignity and freedom.In this respect Malta has been active in promotingsecurity and cooperation in the Mediterranean. Theobstacles are enormous  but the perils that threaten totransform this historic middle-sea into a permanent lake ofinstability are even greater.Though aware of the difficulties in the way of its finalimplementation  we have supported the idea of a conferenceon security and cooperation in the Mediterranean  andwithin this concept of stability in the Mediterranean wehave ourselves proposed two distinct but correlated ideas namely  that of a council of the Mediterranean and astability pact for the Mediterranean. Both are based on thenotion of dialogue in that region of turbulence.The setting up of a council of the Mediterraneanthrough an association of Mediterranean States at the levelof Ministers of Foreign Affairs would facilitate cooperationat the highest political level. A parliamentary dimension tothat association further enhances this joint action andensures a wider spectrum of participation by the electedrepresentatives in the identification and solution ofproblem areas of common concern.The measured success of the Stability Pact forEurope  first launched by France  has underlined the needfor applying this notion to the Mediterranean region itself.With this in mind  at the concluding conference on theStability Pact for Europe  Malta launched the concept ofa stability pact for the Mediterranean based on the round-table system and not only bringing together parties todisputes but also making possible the discussion of issueswhich can serve to pre-empt the development of newthreats to the security of peoples and States in the region.The generally positive reception which this notion hasencountered encourages us to pursue its developmentfurther.Malta welcomes the holding of a Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference at Barcelona inNovember to consider future economic and politicalrelations as a milestone in the consolidation of regionalcooperation. The Mediterranean’s wealth lies in itsheritage of cultural  religious and social diversity. Aforced mutation of this rich mosaic into uniformity wouldbe destabilizing. Confidence-building and mutualunderstanding create the route that leads to security andcooperation. We must walk that arduous path. Withinmulticultural diversity we must discover the commonvalues that help foster dialogue. This requires sheddingpreconceived notions. It requires strong political will. Itrequires that we supplant instinctive mistrust with a spiritof mutual respect.The key protagonists in the Middle East crisis havedemonstrated how political will and dialogue canovercome obstacles that for decades appearedinsurmountable. We have supported the peace process andwill continue to support it  and we welcome the officialsigning in Washington today of the agreements reachedlast Sunday in Taba  Egypt  by Chairman Arafat andForeign Minister Shimon Peres on behalf of the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel  respectively. Ajust and long-lasting peace in the Middle East requires asolution that takes into account both the right of peoplesto self-determination and the right of States to secureboundaries. May this process of dialogue inspire otherswho still resist this unique human tool of conflictresolution.In particular  we are deeply concerned that thedivision of Cyprus has so far remained impervious to theefforts of the international community  especially those of22the Secretary-General  to find a just and lasting peacefulsolution. We predict that persistent efforts in this regardwill eventually prevail.The Mediterranean process is of great significance tothe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. The time thatthe United Nations has dedicated over the years to defusingand resolving issues which threaten peace in the regionillustrates the weight which we attach to the spill-overpotential of current crises. More important  however  is thefact that a successful Mediterranean process could inspirepatterns of cooperation in other areas characterized bymulticultural diversity.Important as it is to create forums that make it easierfor political leaders to enter into dialogue on and identifycommon strategies  the essential ingredient for long-termstability  is the building of peace in the minds of all womenand men. The United Nations and its agencies have had amajor role in the effort to identify common strategies forfuture achievements built on knowledge of and respect forthe multicultural diversity of the world community.During the past 12 months three world conferenceshave touched on the most crucial aspects of human rightsand freedoms  the dignity of the human person and the rightof all peoples to development. At Cairo  Copenhagen andBeijing we worked together  conscious of our culturaldifferences  yet aware that diversity need not and must notimpede our common endeavours if we are mindful of ourcommon heritage  our common concern and our commoninterest.This respect for multicultural identities has beenevident in the commitments undertaken by States and in theprinciples which inspire the platforms of action. It mustremain ever-present in the mind of all United Nationsofficials entrusted with its implementation.One other area in which the United Nations hastraditionally been very active is that of arms control anddisarmament. Over the past 12 months the internationalcommunity has had the satisfaction of seeing a successfulconclusion to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference  with theagreement on the indefinite extension of thenon-proliferation regime. Malta is proud to have taken anactive role in helping to bring about this agreement.We now look forward to an early agreement on thecomprehensive ban on the testing of all nuclear weapons.We urge all countries  in particular the nuclear States  totake all possible measures to ensure a successfulconclusion  during the coming 12 months  of thenegotiations which have been taking place within theConference on Disarmament since 1994.Anniversaries encourage us to drink from theoriginal source for inspiration. The United NationsCharter was forged at a time when the struggle against atotalitarian world vision was nearly complete. The horrorsof war were still tangible  but so also was the fear ofwhat could have been the fate of humankind had atotalitarian vision prevailed.The Charter established within its principal organs adelicate balance based on the equal rights of nations  largeand small  and a pragmatic awareness of the particularrole which certain States had in ensuring internationalpeace and security.During the past five years we have assisted in anintense discussion among Member States on whether ornot there exists the need to evolve  reform or restructurethe principal organs of the Charter. I am personallyhonoured to have been the first President of the GeneralAssembly to chair such a discussion within theOrganization and to make a presidential motion on thismatter approved by the Assembly which ensuredcontinuity. This process was later to give fruit in theformation of the Working Groups which examined therevitalization of the General Assembly and are stillstudying the different options relative to the restructuringof the Security Council.In this ongoing process of review and evaluation  wehave failed to take into account the future of theTrusteeship Council. Aware that the Trusteeship Councilhad nearly completed its responsibilities for the TrustTerritories for which it was responsible  five years ago Iproposed to the General Assembly a new  additionalrole — that of trustee of the different areas of commonheritage. It is because of the uncertainty as to the futureof the Council and the diverse opinions on this matter thatwe have requested the inclusion of an item on the agendaof the General Assembly at its fiftieth session entitled“Review of the role of the Trusteeship Council”.We are confident that when the item is discussed bythe Assembly — first in plenary and later within the SixthCommittee — Member States will bring and share theirviews with that same openness and frankness that havecharacterized the discussion of the other two principalorgans. Naturally we shall  on that occasion  expound23further our ideas on how the Trusteeship Council couldevolve.There is one aspect which I consider it opportune tounderline at this stage: the notion of the United Nations asa trustee. The notion that the Charter envisages is unique tothe Trusteeship Council. It is a notion which  at the time was immediately explicable and applicable to the Territoriesplaced under its care. Today  in a world that has become aglobal community  we are aware that the different areas ofcommon heritage protected by convention requirecoordination by a trustee.To avoid fragmentation  dispersal or duplication ofeffort in areas which are our common heritage  ourcommon concern and our common interest  we shouldexplore the manner in which this principal organ of theUnited Nations can evolve that notion of trust  which wasits major premise  to meet our present-day needs  anevolution that ensures that the Trusteeship Council holds insacred trust the common heritage of humankind and acts asa guardian of the interests of future generations.During the past months we have all invested muchtime and energy in generating public awareness on theimportance of the fiftieth anniversary. The peoples of theUnited Nations are sensitive to what we do and decide inthis forum  not out of mere curiosity or an interest ininternational affairs  but because the decisions we take havea direct bearing on their personal lives. They did so in thepast  when decolonization brought sovereignty to States andfreedom to many millions. They do so at present  when theUnited Nations and its blue insignia represent the lastbeacon of hope for those terrorized by the brutality of war famine or disease. Likewise  our decisions have a bearingon the lives of those who serve the Organization in thefield  on the fate of the families of peace-keepers killed inUnited Nations operations and all those of whom we expectsacrifice to ensure the success of sanctions.We pay a special tribute to all United Nations peace-keepers  and in particular those killed while on mission.Their dedication to duty  humanitarian concern and peaceis honoured by the whole international community.Our deliberations this year have a particularsignificance. On them hinge the hopes of millions. As wetake decisions  may we continue to be inspired by thatcommitment to the maintenance of international peace  theadvancement of social progress and better standards of lifein larger freedom for all peoples  which is the platform ofaction set forth in the Charter. Only then will we rightfullydeserve to be regarded as trustees of the commonconcerns  common interests and common heritage whichthe peoples of the United Nations have charged to ourcare."
"111",4713,"MMR",50,1995,"It gives me great pleasure toextend warm congratulations  on behalf of the delegationof Myanmar and on my own behalf  to Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. The diplomaticskills and experience he brings to his high office assureus of a successful session.Allow me to take this opportunity to express ourappreciation to Mr. Amara Essy  Foreign Minister of Côted’Ivoire  for having so successfully guided thedeliberations of the last session.The United Nations is 50 years old this year. It isboth a time for celebration and an opportunity forreflection. The Organization has evolved over time andhas served us well for half a century. The significantincrease in the membership — from the original 51 to thepresent 185 — underscores the continuing relevance ofthe United Nations. However  vast transformations arenow taking place  and reforms in the structure and workof the Organization must be instituted to reflect the newrealities. We wish to see a more efficient and result-oriented Organization — one that retains mechanismswhich have proved effective and adopts innovativemeasures to ensure cooperation in the post-bloc world.Security Council reforms constitute one of the mostimportant issues to be addressed. Myanmar stands for apragmatic approach that will ensure that the Councilevolves into a more representative  effective and21democratic body. To judge from the work done during thelast two sessions of the General Assembly by the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council  it is clear that there is a convergence ofviews that the Council should be enlarged. The enlargementshould however be accompanied by measures to make itmore effective. It should ensure equitable geographicalrepresentation and at the same time preserve the possibilityfor smaller States to serve on the Council.Myanmar fully supports the position of thenon-aligned countries which stresses the importance ofenhancing the effective and efficient functioning of theSecurity Council by adopting measures geared towardsreforming its working methods and procedures.Myanmar welcomes the actions already taken toenhance the relationship between the Council and thegeneral membership as well as measures to improve itsworking methods and procedures. We are particularlypleased to see that the Council has initiated the holding oforientation debates and briefings by the President of theCouncil for States non-members of the Security Council.We see the need to enhance cooperation between theSecurity Council and the General Assembly in accordancewith Articles 10  11  12 and 14 of the Charter. We alsoshare the view that reforms can best be achieved through acombination of means that include General Assemblyresolutions  changes in the rules of procedure  andappropriate amendments to the Charter where necessary.At the same time  the role of the General Assembly —the one forum where all the Member States arerepresented — should be reviewed to enable it to deal moreeffectively with outstanding problems and to allow it tofocus on the new challenges of our times.We consider it vital that there be a more dynamicrelationship between the main organs of theOrganization — the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.In recent years the United Nations  despite constraints has been in the forefront of the international community’sefforts to deal with the unresolved problems of the cold-wardecades as well as new ones that have surfaced. It has beencalled upon to meet the burgeoning demand forpeace-keeping. In some cases  like Angola  Cambodia  ElSalvador and Mozambique  it has scored successes. In someothers  like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia  it hascome under heavy strain and has proved to be ineffective.The lesson to be learned is that the Security Councilshould be far more conscious of when and under whatmandate to begin peace-keeping operations. Suchoperations must have clearly defined objectives. Moreimportant  agreement among major Powers must carrywith it the support of the majority of the Member Statesif it is to have the desired result.If the United Nations system is to be revitalized andstrengthened  the basic issue of adequate financing particularly of peace-keeping operations  must beaddressed. Whether that happens depends on us. TheUnited Nations can only be as strong or as effective asMember States choose to make it. The limitations of theUnited Nations should not encourage Member States totake precipitate action. As a Myanmar saying goes:“When mice enter the granary  we must catch themice and not set fire to the granary”.The founders of the United Nations also envisagedit as an international body for the promotion of theeconomic and social welfare of all peoples. Even thoughthe right to development is recognized as an inalienablehuman right  the disparity between developed anddeveloping countries continues to widen. Member Statesshould reaffirm their commitment to cooperate in creatingan international economic environment conducive to therealization of the right to development. Withoutdevelopment there can be no prospect for lasting peace.In this regard I am pleased to note that in hisrecommendations on an Agenda for Development theSecretary-General last November stressed thatdevelopment should be recognized as the foremost andmost far-reaching task of our time.The United Nations was established on the principleof the equality of all its Members. The mandate of theOrganization is to advance peace and security  and bringinternational justice and economic and social developmentto all peoples. While it deserves to be commended for itsvital role in the historic process of decolonization whichled to the independence of more than 80 countries  muchless can be said for its efforts to create an equitableinternational economic order.I am pleased to note that the perceptibleimprovement in the international climate is generating afavourable impact on some long-standing issues such asthe Middle East peace process. The initial steps taken twoyears ago towards a durable peace have now beenfollowed by firm strides. Myanmar joins other nations in22welcoming the accord signed by Prime Minister Rabin andChairman Arafat in Washington  D.C. on 28 September1995. We hope that it will pave the way to acomprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East.Just as the family of nations must work together toensure international peace and stability  individual Statesmust promote peace within their territories. I am happy tobe able to say that in Myanmar peace reigns as neverbefore and that the momentum for positive changecontinues. The Government has set 12 objectives in thepolitical  economic and social fields and is workingsteadfastly to achieve them.A unique feature of Myanmar is that it is a unioncomposed of well over a hundred national races. Unityamong the different national races is essential for thepreservation of our independence and sovereignty as wellas for the economic and social progress of the country. TheGovernment has adopted policies to prevent thedisintegration of the Union  ensure the non-disintegration ofnational solidarity  and ensure the perpetuity of ourcountry’s sovereignty. Moreover  with a view to building apeaceful  prosperous and modern nation  my Governmenthas formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in thepolitical  economic and social spheres.Allow me to focus briefly on some of the main issueson our national agenda.The first issue of ensuring the stability of the State.National reconsolidation is an indispensable component ofmy Government’s policy to achieve peace and tranquillity.A national convention has been convened to draft a newConstitution which would be in harmony with present-dayrealities and would reflect the aspirations of the entirenation.Secondly  in the economic sector guidelines have beenformulated to promote all-round development of agriculture which forms the mainstay of the nation’s economy. At thesame time  Myanmar has laid out a welcome mat to foreignand domestic investors in order to attract capital andtechnical know-how.Thirdly  progress is sought in the social sector in orderto buttress political stability and economic progress  whichconstitute foundation-stones for a peaceful  prosperous andmodern State. We are engaged in efforts to strengthen thefabric of society by rekindling the spirit of patriotism anduplifting the moral integrity of our citizens. TheGovernment is endeavouring to preserve the nationalcharacter and cultural heritage and to raise the standard ofeducation and health of the entire country.It is a source of immense pride and satisfaction thatour efforts have achieved a significant measure of successin charting a new course for the country. Insurgency which was born with our independence  is now coming toa close. The unprecedented return to the legal fold of 15out of the 16 armed groups speaks volumes for ourefforts at national reconsolidation.On 10 July 1995 the Government also lifted therestrictions placed on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The liftingof restrictions is unconditional. A large number ofindividuals against whom action had been taken inaccordance with the laws of the land have also beenreleased.I am also pleased to be able to say that we inMyanmar have been shouldering our responsibilities incombating the menace posed by narcotic drugs. TheMyanmar Armed Forces have been mounting majoroffensives against drug traffickers  including the forces ofKhun Sa. Since the end of 1988 there have been 823engagements with the drug traffickers. In these clashes 16 officers and 567 other ranks from the armed forcessacrificed their lives for the country  55 officers and 1 744other ranks were wounded in action and 153 weaponswere lost. Enemy losses amounted to 720 killed  118captured  221 surrendered and 708 assorted weaponsseized. The numbers speak for themselves. We aredetermined to wage war against the drug traffickers as amatter of national responsibility and we see it as our dutyto humanity. Our men have sacrificed life and limb sothat the world may be rid of the scourge of narcoticdrugs. The actions of the Myanmar Armed Forces deserveto be accorded due recognition  just as the Blue Helmetshave been commended for their valour and courage.In order to succeed in the fight against narcoticdrugs the Myanmar Government in May 1989 initiated anintegrated rural-development programme of anunprecedented nature and scope in the border areas.Subsequently  in 1992 a separate ministry devoted to thedevelopment of border areas and national races wasestablished. We are fully confident that once those areasare developed  the living standards of the local populaceare raised and alternative means of livelihood are madeavailable  poppy cultivation will be totally eradicated.We have relied on our own resources in promotingthe development programmes in the border areas. Over232 842 million kyats  the equivalent of US$ 400 million have been expended for infrastructure-building. We aregrateful that  recently  Japan approved a grant of 1 billionyen — US$ 10 million — to be used to purchase fertilizersand agricultural machinery and implements for the food-development programme in the border regions. It is ourhope that others too will join hands with us to developthose regions in order that humanity may be freed from themenace posed by narcotic drugs.On the economic front  Myanmar has made importantgains. The economy registered a growth rate of 6.8 per centin 1994-1995  and prospects look bright for the future.Foreign investment in Myanmar totals US$ 2.7 billion andis expected to reach $4 billion by the end of the year.An indicator of the pace of the development of theeconomy is the dramatic increase in the production of thestaple crop  rice  permitting the export of over 1 milliontons. In the meantime  Myanmar is fulfilling the basicneeds of the people and is striving to narrow the gap inliving standards between urban dwellers and the ruralpopulation.In the realm of international relations Myanmar hasconsistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship withall States  and especially with neighbouring countries. Arecent landmark event was Myanmar’s accession to theTreaty of Amity and Cooperation at the twenty-eighthMinisterial Meeting of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) in Brunei  paving the way forMyanmar’s eventual entry into ASEAN.In the light of the political and socio-economictransformations taking place in the country and theincreased cooperation with its neighbours  Myanmarcontinues to make important contributions to peace andstability in the region and in the world.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations is a time for reflection and for resolution.I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to renewmy country’s dedication and commitment to the purposesand principles of the Charter and to pledge that Myanmarwill contribute  however modestly  to the realization of aUnited Nations which will both serve the cause of worldpeace and fulfil the needs of humanity.In this new era we must strive to ensure that allnations can live together in peace and harmony. Everynation must also strive to keep its house in order. We havea responsibility in our time  just as the founding fathers ofthe United Nations had in theirs  to bequeath to thegenerations to come a world that is secure and peaceful."
"112",4770,"MNG",50,1995,"May I be permittedto offer to His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral mysincere congratulations on his election to the high post ofPresident of the golden fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. I am confident that  under his ablestewardship  the Assembly will succeed in advancing thenoble aims and objectives of our Charter. I wish also torecord my delegation’s profound appreciation to hispredecessor  Ambassador Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire who presided most ably over the various activities of ourAssembly during the forty-ninth session.The year 1995 is to be singled out for its landmarkanniversaries. The fiftieth anniversary of the end of theSecond World War is being observed worldwide with arenewed sense of comprehension of its painful lessons.This coincides with the golden jubilee of thefounding of the United Nations  which embodies in itsCharter the aspirations of our forefathers who  havingstood actual witnesses to the horrors of a most devastatingwar  pledged to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war and settle international disputes bypeaceful means.At the time of this historic celebration it is onlyfitting to pay tribute to the architects of the Charter whose vision inspired it with continued viability andvalidity.15The family of the United Nations has come toembrace 185 sovereign States  a fact that unequivocallyattests to the genuine universality and validity of itsunderlying purposes and principles. The world Organizationhas throughout served as a powerful engine for bringingabout dramatic changes both in the domain of internationalrelations and in the development process of nations.The United Nations is to be credited with impressiveaccomplishments in strengthening international peace andsecurity  marshalling the efforts of the internationalcommunity to put an end to colonialism and apartheid ensuring the independence and sovereignty of developingcountries and supporting their socio-economic development advocating human rights and fundamental freedoms andprotecting and preserving the environment  as well as inpromoting education  culture  science and health.It can be said that at the heart of theseaccomplishments lies the international community’sgrowing realization of the prevalence of global prioritiesand the objective trends in historical developments  alongwith the wisdom of mastering the philosophy of fine-tuningthe differing interests of States.However  the book of the Organization’s half-centuryhistory does not consist exclusively of success stories.There are chapters portraying the set-backs and failures ofthe United Nations when it was effectively handicapped bythe then prevalent ideological antagonisms and military-blocconfrontation. There were times when sovereign Statescould not exercise their right to become Members of theUnited Nations. Mongolia  for one  which steadfastly sidedwith the Allied forces and other peace-loving nations duringthe Second World War  and made its humble contributionto the great victory  was until 1961 prevented fromexercising its legitimate right to join the worldOrganization.The upcoming solemn celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations by the largest evergathering of world leaders demonstrates that theinternational community  by associating its present and itsfuture with the United Nations  is placing its hopes andaspirations in the Organization. We hope that the specialcommemorative meeting will be crowned with the adoptionof the visionary document reaffirming the underlyingpurposes and principles of the Charter and outliningforward-looking strategies commensurate with thechallenges of the new millennium. In this regard  theSecretary-General’s stimulating reports “An Agenda forPeace” and “An Agenda for Development” and theirsubsequent supplements help greatly in revamping ourconcepts of peace  security and development  as well asin our collective reflection on our future.The United Nations has served as a catalyst forconvening a series of global conferences — conferenceson the protection of children  on the environment  onhuman rights  on population and social development andon the advancement of women — resulting in theformulation of common strategies and specific platformsfor action  now and into the twenty-first century. In orderto ensure the full implementation of this comprehensivestrategy of sustainable human development it isimperative to streamline the existing machinery formultilateral cooperation. Here  I wish to emphasize theurgent need for reform to take in the entire system of theUnited Nations  including the Bretton Woods institutions by  inter alia  increasing the effectiveness of organizationsin the economic and social fields  as well as improvingtheir coordination.Momentous post-cold-war change has  in fact  failedto embrace international economic relations — an area ofmajor concern to the United Nations. The persistinginequities and imbalances  as well as protectionisttendencies  the growing external-debt burden  the inabilityto participate equally in international decision-making anddeclining official development assistance flows  weighheavily on the efforts of the developing countrieseffectively to address the pressing socio-economicproblems that they face.Mongolia fully supports the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 to call theattention of the international community  and of theGroup of Seven in particular  to the question ofaddressing these acute problems. It goes without sayingthat this common objective can be attained only throughjoint North-South action.The persistence and proliferation of wars and crisissituations testify to the fact that conventional attitudestowards the use of force as a standard means of settlingdisputes have not been done away with and that the worthof the human person and his or her right to life continueto be denied.Against this backdrop  the United Nations has seenover the last few years a marked expansion in itsactivities in the area of peace-keeping  peacemaking andpreventive diplomacy. Despite the difficulties encounteredand the growing complexity of their missions  the peace-16keeping operations have largely succeeded in places wherethey have intervened for the purposes of restoring peaceand normality. The failures suffered by the United Nationsshould not  however  frustrate its efforts in the future.Lessons drawn from these failures should help theOrganization to weigh its potentials and limitationsrealistically and to act within mandates that are clear andattainable.If the Security Council is to reflect today’s realitiesand to live up to the challenges ahead  the reformprocess — democratization of its working methods and theintroduction of greater transparency into its activities —should be further intensified. It is Mongolia’s consideredview that expansion of the Security Council should bebased on the principles of fairness and equitablerepresentation. This should be ensured by  inter alia  theadmission of countries with a global reach  like Japan andGermany  as well as representatives of developingcountries.It is important to take specific steps to ensure the fullimplementation of the resolution on the protection andsecurity of small States adopted at the last session.Mongolia welcomes the Secretary-General’s report on thespecific development needs of small Member States  andexpects that the ideas and recommendations that it containswill be duly reflected in the activities of the UnitedNations.Mongolia highly appreciates the internationalcommunity’s understanding of the problems and hardshipsfaced by countries in transition and the support for theirefforts to integrate into the world economy. We deem itimportant that the General Assembly has decided toconsider this issue at its fifty-first session. My delegationhopes that the report on this subject to be prepared by theSecretary-General will take due account of thecharacteristics of all countries — in particular  geographiclocation  climatic conditions and infrastructure development among others.We applaud the entry into force of the Convention onthe Law of the Sea  which is widely acclaimed as one ofthe historic achievements of United Nations cooperativeefforts. There is no need to emphasize the importance ofthat Convention to countries like Mongolia  which is ageographically disadvantaged  land-locked developingcountry with an unfavourable road and transportationenvironment.The Mongolian delegation expresses its hope that theGeneral Assembly will at its present session endorse therecommendations adopted last June by the SecondMeeting of Governmental Experts from Land-locked andTransit Developing Countries and Representatives ofDonor Countries and Financial and DevelopmentInstitutions.We believe that the World Trade Organization willfacilitate the integration of developing countries into theinternational trading system and ensure the protection oftheir interests through benefits derived from the trade-discipline mechanism.The disarmament agenda was highlighted this yearby the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT)  which considered the operation of the Treaty anddecided on its indefinite extension.Among the important objectives and principlesaimed at strengthening the nuclear disarmament processwith practical measures  special mention should be madeof those related to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. It is  however  deplorable that two nuclear-weapon States Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty contrary to the commitments undertaken  are conductingnuclear tests and have announced their intention tocontinue them. A zero-yield comprehensive test-banrecently announced by the United States Administrationwill  in our view  speed up the negotiations on the treatyso that it may be concluded next year.We wish to express our concern over the slow paceof ratification of the chemical weapons Convention  whichis unnecessarily delaying its entry into force. We callupon those countries that have not yet done so to ratifythe Convention as soon as possible.Mongolia welcomes the interim agreement on thesecond stage of autonomy reached by the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel within theframework of achieving the full realization of thePalestinian people’s right to self-determination. Thatagreement represents a major step towards consolidatingthe peace process in the Middle East.My delegation also expresses its satisfaction at therecent agreements regarding the former Yugoslavia  whichgive us hope for the eventual solution of the protractedcrisis there.17We believe that the Eleventh Conference of Heads ofState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which willtake place in Colombia shortly  will outline the tasks of theMovement in the years to come and will make itscontribution to the efforts of the world community aimed atsolving a host of interrelated problems of strengtheninginternational peace and security and promoting developmentand progress.It is of great importance that with the strengthening ofpeace  stability and economic growth in the Asia-Pacificregion  the contours of regional and subregional cooperationare becoming more pronounced. The progress achieved inresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has hada positive bearing on the prospects of overall settlement inthat part of our region.Mongolia  in line with its foreign-policy priorities  isendeavouring to participate more actively in the process ofregional integration. We trust that this stance will enjoygreater support from other Governments.More than five years have elapsed since Mongoliaembarked upon the road of democracy and economicliberalization. A solid foundation for a new political fabricand its legal guarantees has been laid down. The economicdecline has been checked  and signs of recovery are beingdiscerned. We are gratified by the support and assistance ofthe world community  donor countries and internationalorganizations  which continue to play an important role inconsolidating these positive beginnings.However  the hardships of transition are still beingacutely felt as  inter alia  our gross national product is quitefar from its pre-crisis level  living standards are in declineand poverty is on the rise. Under these circumstances  myGovernment  in addition to mobilizing its own resources tothe utmost  is compelled to seek further assistance fromoutside. In this regard  we look forward to the fifth donormeeting  to be held in Tokyo early next year.In conclusion  may I express my confidence that atthis commemorative session the General Assembly willconsider the items on its agenda in a constructive mannerand will adopt decisions responding to the challengesahead."
"113",4812,"MOZ",50,1995,"On behalf of myGovernment and on my own behalf I wish to congratulateMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral upon his unanimouselection as President of the General Assembly at itsfiftieth session. I am particularly gratified that  for thefirst time since the creation of the United Nations  a sonof Portugal — a country with which Mozambiqueentertains special ties of friendship and cooperation — is17presiding over our deliberations. Mr. Freitas do Amaral’selection to this important office bears testimony to hispersonal qualifications as an enlightened scholar andstatesman  a man who has served his country withdistinction and has contributed in the dissemination andcodification of international law. My delegation  therefore has no doubt that he will lead our work to a successfuloutcome. I pledge him our full support and cooperation.I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to puton record my delegation’s appreciation of the manner inwhich Mr. Freitas do Amaral’s predecessor  Mr. AmaraEssy  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire  presidedover the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. His performance during the last session ofthis very important gathering brought additional pride notonly to his country but also to the African continent.I wish to commend the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hiscontinued commitment to the ideals of international peaceand security. The people and Government of Mozambiqueare indebted to him for his dedication to the cause of peacein my country. He was  indeed  a key contributor to thesuccessful outcome of the United Nations Operation inMozambique (ONUMOZ).Fifty years have elapsed since the establishment of theUnited Nations. There could not be a better opportunity fora collective assessment of its achievements and of thedifficulties and challenges faced in its daily operations  aswell as of its future prospects on the threshold of thetwenty-first century.The creation of the United Nations following the endof the Second World War represents  in our view  the mostsignificant step forward in modern history  symbolizing acollective effort aimed at preventing the eruption of anotherglobal conflict and at making our world a much safer place.The shape of today’s world is therefore a cleardemonstration of the contribution of the United Nations inits 50 years of existence.While it is true that we are still faced with numerousimperfections  uncertainties and challenges  one cannot denythe fact that significant achievements have been made bythe Organization. Owing to the United Nations  it has beenpossible  to a great extent  to prevent global conflicts.Thanks to the efforts of the United Nations  virtuallyall peoples of the world are today free from colonialdomination. From this body  guided by the principle of self-determination  liberation movements  through the SpecialCommittee on decolonization  aroused awareness of theirindividual fate. Today  the majority of those countries arehere assembled as independent nations  fully exercisingtheir inalienable right to self-determination. This is whythe quest for peace and sovereign equality among nationshas turned peace-keeping and economic development intotwo fundamental challenges before the Organization. Allthis progress has been possible owing to respect for andcommitment to the purposes and principles enshrined inthe United Nations Charter.Ever since its independence  my country has attachedgreat importance to respect for and adherence tointernational law. Mozambique was only nine months oldas an independent nation when  in early 1976  its newGovernment decided to abide by Security Councilresolution 253 (1968) of 29 May 1968 regarding theimposition of sanctions against the minority regime in thethen Southern Rhodesia.Despite the very high price our people have paid fortheir commitment to the purposes and principles of theCharter  we feel honoured today to have contributed  tothe best of our ability  to the implementation ofinternational obligations. These facts were dulyrecognized in Security Council resolution 386 (1976) of17 March 1976  which  inter alia  emphasized that theapplication of sanctions by my Government  in fullcompliance with the decision of the Security Council constituted an important contribution to the realization ofUnited Nations objectives in Southern Rhodesia  inaccordance with the purposes and principles of theCharter. Indeed  four years later Zimbabwe attained itsindependence.The same applies to the common struggle for theeradication of apartheid. Mozambique was one of thecountries most adversely affected by apartheid and itsdestructive policies in southern Africa. As will berecalled  within a few years following its independenceMozambique gained international admiration for itssignificant achievements in raising statistical indicators inkey areas of national development — in particular  healthcare and education. Our economy was among the mostpromising and vibrant in the southern African region.The situation of impoverishment we are facing todayis a direct consequence of the war which ravaged ourcountry for so many years. Our present difficult situationis a direct consequence of the price we paid for ourcontinued commitment to the struggle against apartheid.18Both the war situation and the situation of impoverishmentin my country were created and promoted by the old racistregimes of former Southern Rhodesia and apartheid SouthAfrica.The peace that has prevailed in Mozambique since thesigning of the Rome Agreement three years ago and thevisible improvements in our economic situation underlineclearly that with positive support and encouragement by theinternational community Mozambicans can find appropriatesolutions to their differences and problems.As I speak on this subject  I am reminded of astatement made by President Chissano in response to theSpeaker of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa Mr. Freme Ginwala  during a State visit made to that sistercountry in February this year. On that occasion  the Speakerhad apologized in moving terms for the horrible crimescommitted against the people of Mozambique by successiveapartheid Governments in Pretoria in an attempt todiscourage the Government of Mozambique fromsupporting the cause of freedom and peace in the southernAfrican region. In his reply President Chissano stressed thatin so far as he was concerned the people of South Africahad nothing to apologize for because Mozambicans wereaware of the consequences of their determination to supportthe struggle for justice and peace  not only in South Africabut also in the whole region. The President emphasized thatin reality all the peoples of the region were victims of thesame disease  apartheid  the elimination of which called forsacrifices.Today  we all rejoice at seeing a free  united andnon-racial South Africa  poised to fulfil its domestic andinternational responsibilities in efforts for regional peace stability and cooperation among southern African nations.With the eradication of apartheid and with our countrysurrounded by friendly and peace-loving neighbours  peaceand stability are now a reality in Mozambique. SouthernAfrica is now a region of flourishing democracy. Together we are fulfilling our collective responsibilities for regionaleconomic development.Last January  at the end of the peace-keepingoperation in Mozambique  I came to New York and spoketo the Security Council about the progress made since theholding of the first multiparty general elections in mycountry. I indicated then that peace was indeed a tangiblereality in Mozambique. Today  I am once again honouredto reiterate  before this body  my Government’s highcommitment to national reconciliation  so as to ensure thatthe peace we have all worked for is there to stay  forever.Indeed  the advent of peace in my country has pavedthe way for Mozambicans to pull together for theeconomic development of the country. Accordingly  theGovernment that emerged from last year’s generalelections has drawn up a Five-Year Programme  from1995 to 1999  in which the maintenance and furtherstrengthening of peace  stability and national unity andreduction of absolute poverty  with emphasis oneducation  health  rural development and job creation  areour main objectives. Our Programme also aims atensuring the resettlement of returnees and displacedpersons and promoting the social integration ofdemobilized soldiers.In addition  we are addressing other pressing issuesbefore us. To this end I should like to emphasize myGovernment’s resolve to continue working towards alasting pluralistic democracy in our country. Accordingly we deem it essential to ensure the normal functioning ofour Parliament  the Assembly of the Republic. We believeits normal functioning constitutes one of the key factorsfor the consolidation of democracy in our society.Within this perspective  my Government has recentlyestablished an institution which will be dealing withelectoral issues on a permanent basis. The creation andconsolidation of a new institution which will superviseour future elections will serve  in our view  as animportant confidence-building measure for society and allpolitical parties  for it will ensure confidence in futureelections. As a matter of fact  we are preparing to beginnext year the holding of municipal elections  which willcomplement the process that was initiated by the generalelections in 1994.The upgrading of the technical capacity of thenational police is another Government key priority. Aswill be recalled  ONUMOZ was unable meaningfully toaddress the issue relating to the collection of weapons andtheir subsequent destruction. Needless to emphasize  thoseweapons represent a great danger not only to our ownstability but also to that of our neighbours.In this context  and on the basis of existingagreements between Mozambique and South Africa  jointoperations are currently taking place between policeforces of the two countries. As a result  thousands ofweapons and explosives have already been collected anddestroyed. Moreover  my Government is working harder19in order to ensure that our police force is better preparedand equipped to deal more efficiently with transboundarycrimes  particularly drug-trafficking and money-laundering.On the other hand  my Government considers it to beof the utmost importance that the upgrading of policetechnical capacity should go hand in hand with similarprogress in the strengthening of the judicial system  in orderto support the work of the police effectively by prosecutingviolators of our domestic laws and regulations. All possiblesupport for our national efforts in this regard will be greatlyappreciated.Another area of paramount importance in efforts beingundertaken by my Government is that of de-mining. In thisregard I am happy to tell the Assembly that the NationalDe-mining Commission has been established. We arecurrently engaged in final steps which will lead to theapproval of our national de-mining policy and programme.Even before the formal approval of such a policy andprogramme  national de-mining efforts are already visiblein the field throughout the country. With sufficientresources I believe we can make greater progress in gettingrid of land-mines nationwide.I wish at this juncture to thank all countries andinstitutions which have contributed to the de-miningprogramme in Mozambique  and I look forward to theircontinued support in the years ahead.In this connection I should like to take this opportunityto voice my Government’s full support for the initiativesunder way to eliminate and ban these horrible weaponsworld wide.In spite of all the difficulties  we see ourselves as anation determined to build a better future for our people.Our economy has grown by over 6 per cent during the firstsix months of this year. On the other hand  negotiationshave been concluded recently between the Government andtrade unions in order to find a common platform for thehardships deriving from the implementation of theEconomic Rehabilitation Programme that has been underway since 1987. In an attempt to address the increasing costof living our people are enduring in this process we haveagreed to raise the minimum wage.This is why we launch a sincere appeal to our partnersto abide by their commitments to a timely andunconditional disbursement of pledged funds within theframework of the Paris Consultative Group. Withoutfulfilment of those obligations  plans for a better future inour country may be in jeopardy  with all the concomitantnegative consequences for the consolidation of theongoing democratic process  particularly given theconcerns over the growing drought threat to our region.We  for our side  are committed to deepening furtherour economic and political reforms and to improving thesystem of tax collection  transparency and accountabilityin the management of public affairs.A lot has been said about the prospects of the UnitedNations. I agree that our future will depend on themanner in which we address the needed reforms of ourOrganization. As my predecessor  the now-Prime MinisterDr. Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi  emphasized last year in hisaddress to the Assembly  Mozambique shares a genuineinterest in seeing a more representative Security Council.As previous speakers have stressed  the legitimacy andefficiency of that body will greatly depend on itsrepresentativeness. Efforts must therefore be made toensure that the needed expansion of the Security Councilnot take place merely to accommodate the interests ofthose who are already privileged by the Council’s currentcomposition at the expense of the majority of nations. Arealistic and innovative approach is essential to ensurethat  in keeping with current new realities  the interests ofdeveloping countries are fully respected  both qualitativelyand quantitatively.The reform exercise must also take into account theneed for every nation to abide by its financial obligations.In that connection my Government  despite the well-known economic difficulties  has fully honoured itscommitments regarding assessed contributions to theUnited Nations regular budget. We are now takingmeasures to ensure that all outstanding contributions topeace-keeping activities are settled as soon as possible.We cannot expect a well-functioning and dynamic UnitedNations unless we provide it with the needed funds. It isonly through determined  concrete action that we can alldemonstrate our individual seriousness and commitmentto the purposes and principles of the Charter.The end of the cold war has given rise to mixedfeelings about our efforts to address regional conflicts.In Angola  the signing of the Lusaka Protocolbetween the Government and UNITA  coupled with thesubsequent progress made by the parties to the peaceprocess  has paved the way for a renewed hope in thatsister country. I believe that Angola is closer to reachinga political settlement that will ensure the attainment of a20lasting peace and tranquillity. My delegation encourages theSecretary-General to continue his efforts towards the fulldeployment of a peace-keeping contingent within theframework of the United Nations Angola VerificationMission (UNAVEM III).The attainment of a lasting peace and tranquillity inAngola will be the best contribution to the regional stabilityand economic development we have long sought insouthern Africa within the framework of the SouthernAfrica Development Community (SADC). In thisconnection  I am happy to recall that our Heads of Stateand Government  meeting last August at Johannesburg welcomed the admission of Mauritius as a new member ofour organization. With peace  democracy and growingpartnership among its members  SADC is graduallybecoming a vibrant and viable market ready to cooperatewith other regions in a variety of fields of mutual interest.Our efforts within SADC go beyond mere economicintegration. In addition to discussions on peace-keeping andpost-conflict peace-building mechanisms  we are alsoaddressing concrete issues aimed at preventing possibleconflicts between our nations. It is within this perspectivethat we view the ongoing discussion on such matters as thecommon utilization of international water courses transboundary movements of people and goods  and crimeprevention and control.My delegation looks forward to a political settlementto the threatening situation in Burundi. It is our hope thatthe momentum created by the Secretary-General’s recentvisit to that country  as well as other important initiatives will encourage the parties to work for reconciliation in theinterest  not only of Burundi  but also of the Great Lakesregion as a whole.The need to stabilize the political situation in thatcountry is strictly linked to the future prospects of theongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda where mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes andthe untold suffering of innocent civilians. No one wouldwish to see it repeated ever again.Given what the Secretary-General in his annual reportdescribes as the“combination of ethnic polarization in Burundi andRwanda  massive circulation of arms  porous bordersand transborder movements of refugees” (A/50/1 para. 888) political settlement in either country  coupled with theearly return of refugees and displaced persons  is vital toavert a greater tragedy in the Great Lakes region. MyGovernment therefore urges all the parties concerned towork towards this noble goal.With regard to Liberia  my delegation welcomes theentry into force of the cease-fire on 26 August as a resultof an earlier agreement by the Liberian factional leaders.Similarly  we view the swearing in of the State Councilon 1 September 1995 as an important contribution topeace in that country. We believe that with tolerance andcooperation among the parties  elections in Liberia cantake place within a year as the first step towards a lastingpeace and tranquillity in that country.The prospects for peace in Liberia open new hopesfor the settlement of the conflict in neighbouring SierraLeone. My delegation encourages the parties concerned towork together in the search for a negotiated settlementwith a view to bringing about a lasting peace andtranquillity in that country.In the Middle East  we welcomed last year  theimplementation of the Peace Accords between Israel andthe PLO  which resulted in autonomy for Gaza andJericho. Today  we note with satisfaction that furtherprogress has been made in this peace process  culminatingin the recent signing in Washington of new and promisingagreements between the parties. This is  indeed  a stepforward which we must encourage and support. MyGovernment looks forward to similar progress in futurenegotiations on outstanding issues  including the GolanHeights  the status of Jerusalem  and other equallyimportant issues for the final settlement of the deep-rooted conflict in the Middle East.The situation in East Timor continues to be a matterof concern to my Government. In this context  mydelegation takes note of the Secretary-General’sassessment of the progress made so far in the negotiationsbetween Portugal and Indonesia with a view to finding apolitical settlement to the conflict in that country. It is ourhope that the forthcoming ministerial meeting scheduledto take place in London in January 1996 will lead tomeaningful results.Dialogue  not war or use of force  is the best choicefor solving conflicts. It is through dialogue that nationsand peoples of the world can effectively promote theinternational peace and security for which we are alllonging in the years ahead. Therefore  dialogue must be21further encouraged and supported wherever it is sought  beit in the countries of the former Yugoslavia  Somalia orelsewhere around the globe.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  the questfor peace and economic development must be viewedwithin the context of the principles enunciated by theSecretary-General in his report entitled “An Agenda forDevelopment: recommendations”  where he rightlyunderlines that development  in its numerous dimensions “should be recognized as the foremost and most far-reaching task of our time.” (A/49/665  para. 4)During the last few years the developing countries ingeneral  and the least developed countries in particular  inspite of the existing hurdles  have made significantprogress in their continued struggle to reverse economicand social stagnation. Within this framework  they haveundertaken far-reaching political and socio-economicchanges through the implementation of tough structural-adjustment programmes  the promotion of human rightsand fundamental freedoms and good governance. Inaddition to renewed commitments to conflict resolution peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-buildingmechanisms  the efforts undertaken by developingcountries should be supported and encouraged by theinternational community if we are to succeed in ourcommon endeavours for peace and development in ourrespective countries.As indicated by the President of the GeneralAssembly in his inaugural address  quoting Pope Paul VI “Development is the new name for peace.” (OfficialRecords of the General Assembly  Fiftieth Session Plenary Meetings  1st meeting  p. 9)All peoples and nations of the world must be committedto peace and development and pursue them withdetermination in the new international setting if we are tobuild a better and safer world for all. This is ourchallenge for the next century."
"114",4857,"MRT",50,1995,"On behalf of the delegation of the IslamicRepublic of Mauritania it gives me pleasure to convey toMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  our warmestcongratulations on his unanimous election to the presidencyof this session of the General Assembly of the UnitedNations. We are convinced that his well-known personalskills are the best guarantee for the success of the work ofthis session which acquires special significance as itcoincides with the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations.I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Amara Essy  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the sisterrepublic of Côte d’Ivoire  who led the work of the forty-ninth session in an excellent and praiseworthy manner.I should also like to take this opportunity to reiterateto Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  the confidence of my country and oursupport of his efforts so that the Organization may fullyperform its proper role and succeed in defusing hotbeds oftension throughout the world.We have clearly stated  on previous occasions  that thedeteriorating economies of the developing countries and thewidening gap between the rich and poor countries are thetwo principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds oftension and bloody wars that  more often than not  wipe outevery economic achievement  plunge the peoples ofdeveloping countries into cruel suffering and deprive themof the right to lead a decent life of security  stability  anddevelopment towards a better future.As we have noted in the past  the fact that structuraladjustment programmes neglect the necessary assessment ofthe social cost of such adjustment and focus on correctingthe macroeconomic balance  has had the effect of causingsuch programmes to fall short of achieving the desiredpositive results. In this connection  we had voiced concernover the possibility that the deterioration of the economicconditions of developing countries would limit the impactof such international instruments as environmentalconventions and programmes that promote the rights ofchildren and women  and human rights in general.Today we note that despite the convening of numerousinternational conferences such as the World Summit forChildren in New York  the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna  theInternational Conference on Population and Developmentin Cairo  the World Summit for Social Development inCopenhagen  and the Fourth World Conference forWomen in Beijing  there is nothing on the horizon yetthat may give cause for hope that radical solutions to themany problems besetting the most vulnerable peoples inthe poorest countries throughout the developing world arebeginning to emerge.While these international conferences  in addition tothe Agenda for Development of the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations have drawn the broad outlines offuture policies that would deal with such problems  nospecific formulae for putting those policies into practicehave emerged yet. On the contrary  we note that thedeterioration of the terms of trade and the reduction inofficial development assistance (ODA) have continuedand have been the two principal causes that aggravate thestifling economic crises which have so many third worldcountries in their grip.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which  since1984  has been engaged in a determined battle that aimsat restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficultdomestic  regional and international conditions  has madetangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomicbalance and reducing its foreign debt  a fact that isattested to by international financial institutions.In striving for these objectives  my Government under the wise guidance of His Excellency the Presidentof the Republic  Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’ Ahmed Taya have pursued liberal economic policies that neglect not asingle aspect of economic and social development.These economic policies that we pursue encompassthe following broad sectors: road building  theelectrification of cities  combating desertification development of water networks  combating illiteracy  theempowerment of women and development of the child education for all  and health coverage for the wholepopulation. In seeking to achieve these objectives  theGovernment of Mauritania focuses on developing theagricultural  mineral and fisheries sectors which form thebackbone of our economy.In view of the nature of such development plans andsocial policies the Government of the Islamic Republic ofMauritania have participated in all the negotiations thatled to the adoption of the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea  which entered into force on 1614November 1994  and participated also in the negotiationswhich culminated in the conclusion of the United NationsConvention to Combat Desertification in Those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification Particularly in Africa  signed in Paris on 14 October 1994.It is our fervent hope that the international community willmake available the resources required for theimplementation of this Convention which will benefitprincipally the African countries that are most affected bydrought and desertification.The United Nations  which will commemorate itsfiftieth anniversary  in a few days’ time  is now required toadapt to the realities of the age in order for it to be able toface up to the challenges of a world that is being torn apartby regional conflicts and whose progress towards prosperityis obstructed by very complex social and economic crises.Such a situation requires us to undertake the necessarystructural reforms and to make available to the Organizationthe necessary material means and moral support that wouldenable it to discharge the tasks entrusted to it.We have indicated here in the past that the spread ofdemocracy and respect for human rights constitute the mostimportant gains made by the international community. Wehave indicated also that democracy should not be limited tothe national framework of any individual State but mustextend to the relations between States.Proceeding from this  we have reiterated  on manyoccasions  that we support increasing the membership of theSecurity Council in consonance with the behests ofdemocratic transparency  the principles of equality ofStates  and in accordance with Article 24 of the UnitedNations Charter  which stipulates that in carrying out itsduties the Security Council acts on behalf of all theMember States. In view of this  it is essential that theCouncil should reflect the universal nature of theOrganization.We also consider it necessary to restructure theSecretariat in order to revitalize it and enhance itsefficiency. The Economic and Social Council must berestructured so that it can discharge the tasks entrusted toit. The activities of the Secretariat and the specializedagencies must be coordinated so that efforts may not bewasted and the modest resources available for resolvingdevelopment problems could be put to optimum use.As our overriding concern will always be the searchfor peace  my country spares no effort in supporting theinternational endeavour to replace war and tension withpeace and stability throughout the world. We haveencouraged and continue to encourage the use ofpreventive diplomacy in order to avoid new humantragedies. This is an approach that has always led tosatisfactory results.In the Middle East  there is stronger hope that theinternational efforts which have been deployed since theMadrid Conference will put an end to the tragedy of thePalestinian people and restore to that people its legitimateright to establish its own independent State. The signingof the Declaration of Principles on the autonomy of theGaza Strip and Jericho  on 13 September 1993  the Cairoagreement  on 4 May 1994  the agreement between Jordanand Israel and  finally  the Taba accord  which was signedin Washington on 28 September 1995  on theimplementation of the second phase of the Declaration ofPrinciples  gives us hope that peace in the Middle East isnow on the horizon. We do hope that there will beprogress on the tracks of the peace process initiated withSyria and Lebanon and that solutions to all the unresolvedhumanitarian issues related to this conflict may be foundin order for a just and lasting peace that would be basedon the principles of mutual respect to promote fruitfulcooperation and brotherly relations between all thepeoples of the region.It is fitting here to congratulate the parties directlyconcerned and all the countries that  from near or far have supported the efforts for peace. We also encourageall the parties concerned to keep moving forward so thatthe opportunities for peace which are available today maynot be wasted. If those opportunities are frittered away the situation is bound to become more complicated.In that same region of the world  the residue of theGulf war  unfortunately  are still taking their toll. TheIslamic Republic of Mauritania  which  from the verybeginning  given its commitment to international legality has totally rejected any infringement of the independenceand territorial integrity of fraternal Kuwait  and called forresolving the question of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees now wishes to declare its rejection of any infringement ofthe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Mauritaniabelieves it is now time to put an end to the suffering ofthe brotherly Iraqi people.In the same context  the fraternal State of the UnitedArab Emirates continues to claim its legitimate15sovereignty over the islands of Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunband Abu Moussa. Mauritania reiterates its support for theUnited Arab Emirates in this respect.In the Maghreb  the United Nations continues todeploy efforts towards organizing a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. We hope that the UnitedNations  which has enjoyed our country’s full support  willovercome the remaining obstacles and succeed inorganizing the referendum within the time-frame set by theSecurity Council so as to achieve a just and definitivesettlement of the Saharan question.As we did last year  and as we have done on everyoccasion  we call for the lifting of the embargo imposed onthe fraternal people of Libya  in the light of the LibyanArab Jamahiriya’s stated readiness to cooperate with boththe United Nations and the other parties concerned  sincethat embargo is detrimental to the interests of all thepeoples of the Maghreb.In Africa  we are still concerned over the continuanceof armed conflicts in several brotherly African countries.Whereas our Liberian brothers have succeeded  throughdialogue  in concluding the Abuja Agreement and settingout plans that we hope will restore peace to that country.The situation in Somalia  regrettably  has not changed  andthe afflicted Somali people is still threatened withextermination by fratricide and famine.We also hope that our Rwandan brethren will succeedin resolving their problems at the negotiating table. Wewelcome the progress achieved by our Angolan brethren whose efforts have led to the signing of an agreement forpeace and for the settlement of their political problems. Wehope the sustained efforts of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity will continue until thesebrotherly countries can enjoy peace so that their peoplesmay devote themselves to rebuilding all that has beendevastated by civil wars.We note with satisfaction that in Europe the membercountries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization haveadopted a new posture vis-à-vis the Serbian aggressionagainst the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I shouldlike to voice the hope that in future greater determinationwill be shown in dealing with this problem increasinglysternly until such time as the Serbs agree to a just andcomprehensive solution that would guarantee all the peoplesconcerned the right to sovereignty on their territory and theright to live in peace within secure  internationallyrecognized borders.The many humiliations suffered by the UnitedNations forces at the hands of the Serbs and themassacres of innocent Muslims perpetrated by the Serbsin Bosnia and Herzegovina make it necessary for theinternational community  particularly the permanentmembers of the Security Council  to impose respect forinternational legality and to restore the credibility of theUnited Nations by putting an end to the bloodshed thathas gone on for several years in that part of the world.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations affords an opportunity for giving deepthought to finding the best means of facing up to thechallenges of our times and to equipping our Organizationwith the military capability and material resources thatwould enable it to address problems at the internationallevel with a single standard based on the principles ofequality and justice. The same should apply to theOrganization’s activities in the areas of peace-keeping andaid for development  as well as in its endeavours toensure that the world will enjoy prosperity  peace andbrotherhood and to promote freedom  democracy andrespect for human rights."
"115",4903,"MUS",50,1995," It is with much pleasure andgreat satisfaction that I join the previous speakers who havealready congratulated the President on his election to thepresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.The participation of his country  Portugal  at the UnitedNations has always been active and constructive. Mydelegation  therefore  is confident that under the President’swise and able leadership our Organization will progressfurther towards its goals. And we assure him of our fullestcooperation and support in the tasks that devolve upon him.May I take this opportunity to express our sincereappreciation to the President’s distinguished predecessor His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  for theadmirable and effective manner in which he conducted thebusiness of the forty-ninth session.Let me also renew my delegation’s homage toMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the efficient and committedmanner in which he is carrying out his mission asSecretary-General.Every year  we seize the opportunity of the session ofthe General Assembly to share our views and concernsabout the state of international relations. In this fiftieth yearof the existence of our Organization  I particularly wish toaddress the Assembly from the perspective of a small islandState.The end of the cold war and the breakup of the Sovietbloc  the globalization of the world economy and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization to overseeinternational trade  the emergence of China as an economicgiant  the liberalization of the Indian economy and SouthAfrica’s return to the community of nations  in such a shortspan of time  have all contributed to rapid changes in theglobal economic scene.My country shares the belief that regionalization isa first prerequisite for smooth integration into a globaleconomic pattern. It was natural  therefore  that the regionof the Indian Ocean could not remain isolated from themovement towards regionalization  despite the fact thatthe Indian Ocean countries form a heterogeneous zonewith a multiplicity of economic systems  politicaltraditions and cultural experiences. It is in this perspectivethat Mauritius hosted  in March this year  the IndianOcean Rim (IOR) initiative. Built on the foundations ofhistoric interchanges between nations in the Indian Ocean the IOR initiative could be seen both as a geographicalreality and a natural economic entity. Its objective  asclearly outlined at the first meeting  is to establish aregional forum  tripartite in nature  that will bring togetherrepresentatives of Governments  business and academiafor the purpose of promoting economic cooperation in theregion. Although the IOR initiative has been launchedwith an initial group  may I hasten to add that the IOR isopen to all the countries of the Indian Ocean region. Aswe go along  the initiative will expand progressively toinclude other countries  on the basis of a coherentprogramme and plan of action.Other existing groupings  such as the CommonMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)  theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) — towhich organization my country has recently beenadmitted — and the Indian Ocean Commission  havealready contributed significantly to greater interaction inour region  and it is our hope that this new initiative willfurther pave the way for a dynamic integration of theIndian Ocean region into the global economic pattern. Inthis regard  we look forward to  and will highlyappreciate  the support of major regional groups andcountries in the implementation of this laudable initiative.Indeed  while we are making considerable efforts toensure the prosperity and advancement of our countries we are also very much aware that this cannot be achievedwithout the assistance of major players in the globaleconomy. At the same time  it is important that  at a timeof growing interdependence among States and economies efforts must be made to include developing countries inthe international economic decision-making process so asto achieve effective management of the global economy.The Bretton Woods institutions — namely  theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund —16should be able to devise new ways and means ofresponding to the development needs  priorities andspecificities of developing countries by providing adequateresources without stringent conditionalities. I should likehere to appeal to the international financial institutions toput aside  when circumstances demand  their first andforemost role of bankers and act more as partners in theglobal development process. For it is becoming increasinglyclear that development problems cannot be solved bycountries on their own  whatever be their sense ofcommitment and purpose. Africa  where countries areafflicted by deep-seated and chronic problems  is one suchexample.My country  therefore  welcomes the views expressedby the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Development and in particular supports his démarches to alleviateproblems and sufferings on the African continent. We wishin this regard to see the rapid implementation of the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development in Africa in the1990s and the Cairo Agenda for Action on RelaunchingAfrican Economic and Social Development  as well as therecommendations of the Bandung Asia-Africa Forum.Africa  we know  is not alone  and we were gratified inSeptember last year by President Clinton’s statement at thereception for African nations to the effect that“The United States has been  and will continue to be a partner in Africa’s success story”.This is comforting  and we wish to see more concrete stepsin this direction.I wish also to seize this opportunity to pay tribute totwo decades of partnership between the countries of Africa the Caribbean and the Pacific and those of the EuropeanUnion  through the Lomé Conventions. In a few weeks’time Mauritius will have the privilege and honour ofhosting the signing of the second financial protocol ofLomé IV. While I pay tribute to this concrete example ofeffective partnership between the North and the South  it isour sincere hope that our partners of the European Unionwill continue to support its traditional friends despiteemerging demands nearer home.Economic and socio-cultural progress cannot besustained if man does not remain at the centre ofdevelopment. In this context  education  training andinformation play a fundamental role. We firmly believe thatit is extremely important to invest in human resources. Inkeeping with this belief  education and training are providedfree of charge at primary and secondary levels in mycountry  to boys and girls and to men and women alike.An educated and trained individual is in a betterposition to respond and adapt to the changing needs ofsociety and the developments taking place around him. Assuch  he is able to provide faster and better results. Oneof the scourges of developing nations remains aninadequate level of education and the lack of trainingfacilities and access to the latest information. Developingcountries  in fact  run the risk of being left outside thenetwork of rapidly evolving information technology. Andyet can anyone deny the absolute need for small islandStates like mine to be connected to the rest of the worldthrough up-to-date information networks? Therefore while the eradication of illiteracy and the provision ofeducation facilities should continue to remain a toppriority of the United Nations  we should add to this thetransfer of information technology.Women are a major agent of development  and theyhave often been disadvantaged in their quest for educationand training. Of course  to the United Nations  theadvancement of women is not a new cause. The year1975 was proclaimed International Women’s Year followed by the United Nations Decade for Women. Sincethen  major United Nations conferences  such as the EarthSummit  in Rio  the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna  and others have repeatedly brought the plightof women to the fore  the most significant being therecent Beijing Conference. The agreements concluded atBeijing recognized the pivotal role of women in oursociety and laid down the foundations for theirparticipation as equal partners in development activities.More important  however  will be the “after” Beijing —the need to get down to the implementation of decisionsarrived at and the need to find ways and means ofbuilding the bridges to allow for greater involvement ofwomen in national and international matters.The world this year befittingly witnessed two otherimportant United Nations conferences: the World Summitfor Social Development in Copenhagen and the Reviewand Extension Conference of the States Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) in New York.The Summit on Social Development called attentionto the impact of the world economic system on the poorand underprivileged and helped to project new ideas foralternative models of social development. It also allowed17the renewal of the world commitment to resolve theproblems of poverty  unemployment and social exclusion.For its part  the non-proliferation Treaty  which cameinto force in 1970  is important in several ways. Itenshrines an undertaking between the five nuclear-weaponStates to begin serious nuclear disarmament negotiationsand the non-nuclear countries not to acquire nuclearweapons in return for access to peaceful nucleartechnology. It is a major international agreement the aim ofwhich is to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and buildconfidence among the nuclear-weapon States towards areduction of their arsenals. The Treaty also provides thebasis for legitimate trade in nuclear technology for peacefulpurposes.The indefinite extension of the nuclearnon-proliferation Treaty in May this year can be considereda landmark in the history of mankind  which has committeditself to free the world from the threat of nuclear weapons.Unfortunately  the optimism generated by the indefiniteextension of the Treaty was short-lived in the wake of theresumption of recent nuclear testings. These activities aredefinitely not encouraging signs for the conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty in the foreseeable future.In our region  however  we are confident that theAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  which wasrecently finalized in South Africa  will go a long waytowards contributing to international peace and security. Itcovers a large part of the Indian Ocean and the AtlanticOcean  both containing major sea routes of the world. Mydelegation sincerely hopes to see the speedy entry into forceof this Treaty  which  among other issues  encompasses theintegrality of the territory of States members of theOrganization of African Unity as a nuclear-weapon-freezone.The Vienna Conference was a turning-point for worldperception of human rights. We hope that the principles andobjectives enshrined in the 1993 Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action on human rights may in time berecognized and effectively respected in all corners of theworld. My country has always upheld human rights andfavoured their promotion and protection. But at the sametime  in the field of human rights  we believe that we haveto move with caution lest we run the risk of damaging theinterests of those very individuals and societies that we arepurporting to protect in the short run.Nevertheless  this should not prevent us fromcombining our best efforts in all good faith to bring abouta just and equitable society by trying to win theconfidence of the peoples  societies and Governmentsrather than by threatening them economically  militarilyor otherwise. The upholding of human values and upliftof humanity should continue to remain our main concernat all times and in the best interests of humanity. It is forthis reason that we should seize every opportunity toapplaud the restoration of human rights and democracy regardless of other considerations. We are delighted therefore  at the long-awaited liberation of Mrs. Aung SanSuu Kyi this year  which we feel has opened up newavenues for dialogue in Myanmar.During the past few years in particular  the UnitedNations has become increasingly identified in the publicperception with the Blue Helmets. The growing focus onthe activities of the peace-keepers is such that theirsuccesses and failures often affect the credibility of ourOrganization. Peace-keeping is an important tool forconflict resolution; its success depends to a large extenton a strong political will on the part of Member States  aclear mandate to the peace-keepers and solid material logistical and financial support. However  one of the mainfactors for conflict resolution remains the earlyidentification of potential conflicts and tensions. Whilearms and weapons can be used to threaten andtemporarily silence those involved in the conflicts  lastingpeace can be achieved only through moral persuasion  theremoval of fear and despair  and the instilling of hope andsecurity in the minds of people. The need  therefore  tostrengthen the arms of preventive diplomacy becomesimperative.In the recent past  the United Nations has beenincreasingly called upon to carry out peace-keeping andpeacemaking operations. In fact  the number of demandsmade on the Organization is now straining its resourcesalmost to the breaking-point. The erratic and reluctantdisbursement of contributions by some Member States hashighlighted the shortcomings of such operations andexposed the limits of this approach in ensuring peace andstability. We therefore need more than ever to place muchgreater emphasis on preventive diplomacy and allocatemore resources to this activity. We believe that  in thelong run  the cost of supporting programmes in18preventive diplomacy would be far outweighed by theactual costs of dispatching Blue Helmets around the world.In this respect  we urge the international communitystrongly to support regional initiatives  such as themechanism for conflict prevention  management andresolution of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Theexperience of my country as a result of my own personalparticipation in several ministerial missions organized bythe OAU in the context of this mechanism has convincedus to put greater reliance in this approach. My delegationwould therefore like to appeal to this body to make a strongcommitment to the realization of this very importantprogramme.The establishment of an early-warning system andthreat-assessment unit at the United Nations could equallysupport the proposed OAU early-warning system. Thiswould go a long way towards preparing the United Nationsto deal with the contemporary challenges of peace-keepingand peace-building at a more realistic cost. Yet I wouldappeal for more cohesion and harmonization among thevarious conflict-prevention and conflict-resolutionmechanisms in order to avoid duplication of efforts.(spoke in French)At this point  my delegation should like to refer to theincreasing activities of the francophone movement in theareas of conflict prevention and peace-keeping. Wewelcome the encouraging results of the work of the recentconference of French-speaking countries on conflictprevention  which took place in Canada. Among therecommendations of that conference  we note in particularthe one relating to the support of the francophonemovement for the pan-African mechanism for conflictprevention  management and resolution.It is true that the movement has no great means at itsdisposal  but it has none the less been able to lendconsiderable support in the recent past to certain UnitedNations programme in the area of human rights and theprocess of democratization. With respect to those two areas I also wish to highlight the important activities of themovement over the past two years in the countries of theAfrican Great Lakes region following the tragic events thattook place there.In December  at Cotonou  my Prime Minister will bepassing on the presidency of the movement to the Presidentof Benin. I wish to take this opportunity to express mygreat satisfaction at the way in which  during his term ofoffice  the political dimension of the French-speakingmovement’s work on the international level hasdeveloped. I should like to express the hope that thispolitical facet of the movement will in future be able toplay a growing role in international forums in striving forthe realization of lasting peace in the world.(spoke in English)We are already witnessing promising developmentsin conflict resolution in regions such as Angola Mozambique and the Middle East. We commend therecent initiatives in Bosnia and exhort all partiesconcerned to continue to intensify their efforts to find along-term solution  and hope that the long-awaited peacein this region is achieved not under the threat of guns  butthrough the goodwill  understanding and tolerance of allconcerned.My delegation recognizes that the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations provides a golden opportunity forthe re-examination and the renewal of the United Nationssystem  and welcomes the initiative launched in theGeneral Assembly to negotiate a reform of the SecurityCouncil. We believe that the present 15-membercomposition of the Security Council does not reflect therealities of the economic and political changes of the pastdecades. In its present composition  the Security Councilcan neither claim to take into account the positions ofnations in the next 50 years  nor reasonably pretend tospeak on behalf of 185 nations for the maintenance ofworld peace and security. The Security Council hasindeed the main task of maintaining peace and security.However  the concept of world security has itselfundergone a huge transformation. We are now more atrisk from the threat of economic  social  cultural andreligious upheavals and turmoils than from the outbreakof war resulting from conflicts between States or a groupof States. Consequently  if the Security Council is tocommand full respect in all parts of the world and enjoylegitimacy  it should undergo a complete overhaul.In the context of the current exercise on theexpansion of the Security Council  we believe that theclaim of India  the largest parliamentary democracy  to apermanent seat on the Security Council is legitimate. Inthe same spirit  countries from other regions  includingsmall island States  could equally aspire to permanentseats in an expanded Security Council.The world has gradually been reduced to a globalvillage. The regions of the world and their peoples 19although still widely separated geographically  are fastrealizing that the future of the world community lies in acommon shared goal. We are increasingly becoming awarethat the world is one family  and that if we are to assure abrighter and better future for coming generations  we haveno other choice than to continue our efforts towardspreserving and promoting a strong United Nations that willbe able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity justice and shared economic progress.In Mauritius  in spite of the existence of many culturesand religions  we have been successful in promotingpeaceful coexistence. We have always believed that nomeaningful progress can be achieved in the absence ofpeace and harmony. We have always believed in our peopleand have actively promoted the culture of tolerance andmutual respect. We remain deeply committed to theprinciples of democracy and justice. The path of toleranceand mutual respect for different faiths and religions and theacceptance of unity in diversity laid down under theinspiring leadership of the Father of the Nation  SirSeewoosagur Ramgoolam  since independence in 1968 andfollowed through relentlessly by our present Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth have been largely responsible for theharmonious way of life in Mauritius.In conclusion  I should like on the occasion of thefiftieth anniversary of our Organization to share with theinternational community our rich experience of living inpeace and harmony."
"116",4940,"MWI",50,1995,"Allow me to congratulate thePresident on his election to his high office at the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. The Government and thepeople of the Republic of Malawi hold him and his greatcountry  Portugal  in high esteem. His appointment topreside over the deliberations of the Assembly during thisimportant session  as the United Nations commemorates itsfiftieth anniversary  is an indisputable reflection of therecognition of his eminence by the international community.My delegation is confident that he will guide thedeliberations of the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion.At the same time  allow me to pay tribute to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côted’Ivoire  who  in spite of the complexity of the issues andthe difficult constraints which confronted the UnitedNations during his tenure  guided the work of theforty-ninth session with admirable skill  dignity andvision.It is indeed very difficult to have to speak todayafter His Holiness the Pope  lest those words which thismorning flew up to high rafters of this building beforgotten. We in Malawi feel that perhaps it was our fateto be scheduled to speak after him. The Assembly willrecall that the Pope talked about the moral aspects ofnationhood  politics and relations between nations. TheAssembly will also remember how he gave the wordfreedom a new dimension and meaning  saying that manwill insist on it  whether small or big. The Assembly willalso remember the moral responsibility he put upon thehuman being  both as an individual and as a member ofthe community of what is really a small planet. One needonly fly a few miles up in the air from this little planet which we call Earth  to see that we all really look likelittle rabbits dashing from one foxhole to another.However  as human beings  we also resemble God  ourcreator. To me it seemed as if our call to speak after him this afternoon  was an occasion to try to strengthen whatHis Holiness the Pope left with us this morning.The twentieth century is soon coming to an end.Historians will remember and record it as the century ofthree great phenomena  I think. The first was theestablishment of a power structure  as demonstrated bythe rise of the great experiments: the experiment indemocracy built on capitalism and respect for individualrights and the experiment in socialism based on a socialcontract for a community with a common purpose. Theconflict of these ideas would lead to the emergence ofwhat would dominate the world’s political ways duringthe first 45 years of this Organization’s existence: thecold war.The second great phenomenon that the Pope referredto was the fall of the empires built by the EuropeanPowers from Asia to Africa and the proud rise ofcolonized people to independence. The third — andperhaps the most heart-rending — phenomenon of thiscentury was that of racism. We saw it first in SouthAfrica and later began to see it rearing its ugly head inthe twilight of this century.15General Assembly 21st plenary meetingThe curtain of this act finally falls on the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. Let us remember the joyand ecstasy with which the former colonial countriesemerged into independence as Members of this body. Whatgenius woke up to think of and  later  to found thisOrganization? What idealism sustained it? Yet a darkshadow haunted it in its growth; and now  as thecelebration of the fiftieth anniversary is upon us  wesomehow realize that perhaps the cold war  that IronCurtain  was used by the great Powers  in the name ofdemocracy  human rights and justice for all  simply to keepa balance of power.Malawi does not wish to seem bitter in expressingsome of these thoughts; but 50  even in a mere human life is the age at which soul-searching is important. Along withmany others  Malawi sowed the seeds of its own gorgon 30years ago — what the Pope referred to as the totalitariantotem. The pattern of Presidents-for-life and one-partyautocracies bred a series of dictatorships supported by theinterests of the cold war’s great Powers.When perestroika knocked on the door  man heaveda sigh of relief. The cold war had ended. We in Malawiwere not left behind. A new dawn broke in the land oncedescribed by Africa Watch as a place where silence rules.Last year Malawi stood up in this Assembly to declareproudly that a people cannot be kept down for ever byman’s inhumanity to man. Thanks to the action of theUnited Nations  Malawi fought  this time not forindependence  but for democracy. A referendum in 1993and a general election  supervised by this world body andother friends  on 17 May 1994  gave birth to a new country.This is what the Pope referred to as “hope”.Today  a year and five months later  the four estatesof democracy are taking root in Malawi. We now have anelective executive and a pluralist parliament with one of themost active and articulate oppositions slowly learning thecomplex art of debate and the art of give-and-take. Inaddition  we also have an independent judiciary protectingthe bastion of the rule of law from which all human rightsare protected and nurtured and we have an independent andfree press.These four estates are almost a novelty in Malawiafter 30 years of autocracy and a dictatorship responsiblefor the most vicious abuse of human life. Above all  it isimportant to remember that pathological hero worship is theprice people pay for losing their self-respect. There istherefore cause to celebrate the 50 years of the life of theUnited Nations — especially for Malawi for  from theland of the dead  we have come back to the land of theliving.We are astonished  however  that at this moment ofrebirth Malawi — and possibly other countries — seemto have been abandoned. Could this be what the Pope wastalking about — the small nations — those which havepower  whether it be economic or military? Where arethose great friends of yesteryear  the great friends of thedays of the cold war? We are astonished that as we arerejoicing in our new democracy they are now standingaloof watching our skeletons of hitherto silenced andabused citizenry feeding the flickering fires of democracyagainst the howling winds of poverty  hunger and disease.In this wider breakthrough of understanding in theuniverse  let us be thankful that on this tiny planet thereis on the East River in New York a piece of land wherepeople meet to discuss problems — some no bigger thanan ant-hill and some larger — thankful that somewherethere is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu wherelilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes!After 30 Years of educated leadership we are stillone of the least developed countries in the world  highestin the rate of illiteracy and the most highly indebted  butthe most beautiful in nature and the one best qualified perhaps  for a Marshall Plan.Malawi is among those countries in the world thathave a high incidence of the HIV/AIDS infection. Thispandemic has seriously affected the young and activesegment of the population  which is the hub ofdevelopment activity in all sectors of the nationaleconomy. We commend the untiring efforts of the WorldHealth Organization and other institutions which  togetherwith my Government  are actively engaged in tacklingthis pandemic.But perhaps I might add that  above all  theConference on Women held in Beijing brought to thefore  at least for us  the entire issue of trying tounderstand the whole question of man’s responsibilitytowards man and the importance of the idea of hope andsustenance in recognizing the role of women  for in mycountry 70 per cent of the economy and 70 per cent ofhuman love and care and 70 per cent of all that makes anation admirable is in the hands of women.How can one understand those who caused so manybombs and mines to be planted in Mozambique andAngola? How do they think of the women and children16General Assembly 21st plenary meetingwho wake up with new hope and who go to fetch water orplant their plantations and who find themselves blown upby those who should have cared much more than to playwith such weapons — such utterly senseless weapons ofdestruction?Until recently my country hosted a large number ofrefugees from Mozambique when that country wasexperiencing civil strife. The size of the refugeecommunity  which peaked at over a million  has nowdecreased as refugees are returning home since theconclusion of a peace accord between the then warringFRELIMO government and the forces of RENAMO.However  despite the ongoing repatriation of therefugees back to Mozambique  a strong legacy ofenvironmental degradation is left behind. Deforestation overgrazing  and the destruction of roads used by reliefsupply vehicles are some of the problems which resultedfrom the presence of the refugees.In addition  Malawi is playing host to a number ofrefugee communities from around Africa — from Rwandaand Somalia — although their numbers have grownnowhere near those reached by our brothers and sistersfrom neighbouring Mozambique.The Government of Malawi would like at this junctureto express its most sincere gratitude and appreciation forthe kind and invaluable assistance received from the UnitedNations system  particularly through the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  as well as from donor Governments andagencies  and non-governmental organizations at a timewhen we most needed help.Since the region experienced severe drought in the1992 and 1993 crop seasons  with a mild recovery in 1993and 1994  rainfall has continued to be erratic in southernAfrica. The economy of Malawi  which is almost entirelyagro-based  has been hard-hit  resulting in chronic foodshortages. This season has not been any better. Once again the country faces severe food shortages  which theGovernment has to meet through importing grain  mainlymaize. Is this a test of our democracy? Can a democracy even a classical Grecian one  grow on an empty stomach?Against this background is the programme for thealleviation of poverty  which the new Government ofMalawi has enunciated in order to tackle the chronicpoverty which it inherited from the previous regime. Thepoverty-alleviation programme seeks to target the ruralpoor  who are in the majority as the primary beneficiary.A poverty-alleviation fund has been set up  along with aMalawi social action fund  which is a component thereof.The programme is multisectoral in approach and aims atpromoting the education and health sectors among others.The Government has  in this regard  introduced freeprimary school education and has also tried to increasethe number of schools.My Government would therefore like to thank theUnited Nations system and the donor community and themany other institutions in the private sector — especiallythe missionary sector — which have extended assistancein our development endeavours  for if our courage andhope had not been evoked by the Catholic bishops ofMalawi I would not be speaking here today. I am aproduct of the 30 years of exile which totalitarianismimposed on my country.The success of the poverty alleviation programmetherefore becomes a major aspect of our hopes andexpectations. The new culture of tolerance has created ahighly conducive climate for investment. We havetherefore opened the door to prospective investors tocome  explore and take advantage of the opportunitieswhich exist in other areas such as tourism  irrigation mining and other sectors of the economy.Malawi has noted with interest the ongoing effortsto reform the United Nations system. We have observedin particular the various proposals that have been putforward on the reform of the Security Council. TheSecurity Council is  truly  an important organ of theOrganization. It is therefore proper and fitting that anorgan of such high standing should operate in anaccountable and transparent manner. In addition  Malawisupports measures aimed at enhancing equitablerepresentation in an effort to reflect the existinginternational political configuration as well as thecomposition of the United Nations.As Malawi consolidates genuine freedom anddemocracy it is pleasing to note that the rest of thesouthern African region has unwaveringly embraced thisnew culture of political pluralism and tolerance. Moreimportant  those countries which have for long beendevastated by civil strife have either resolved or are in theprocess of resolving their misunderstandings.Malawi welcomes encouraging moves towards thedemobilization of combatants of both the AngolanGovernment Forces and the National Union for the Total17General Assembly 21st plenary meetingIndependence of Angola (UNITA) under the third UnitedNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). Wefully commend the invaluable role which we  the UnitedNations  are playing in Angola.In South Africa  the post-apartheid Government ofPresident Nelson Mandela is now firmly in place.Incidentally  I am glad I can pronounce it properly  for it isnot “apartheid” but “apart hate” — put apart and hate. Thedemise of “apart hate” brightened prospects for peace andcooperation in southern Africa. Malawi therefore calls uponthe international community to render unflinching supportto the new and emerging democracies in the region so thatthey do not slide back to anarchy and authoritarianism.The Malawi Government is concerned about the slowpace at which the identification of eligible voters isproceeding in Western Sahara. We appreciate the efforts ofthe United Nations to extend its Mission for theReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) as a show ofgenuine commitment to resolving this long-standing issue.It should  however  be noted that without the commitmentof the principal players in the matter the current efforts willall be in vain. We therefore call upon the Government ofthe Kingdom of Morocco to allow the United NationsMission a free hand in its operations so that the deadline ofJanuary 1996 for the holding of a referendum can be met.Malawi has noted with a good deal of concern thehorrendous massacres of innocent people in the CentralAfrican country of Rwanda. However  despite the continuedexistence of ethnic tensions  the efforts of the UnitedNations to ensure that peace finally descends upon thistroubled area have not faltered. To this end  myGovernment earnestly commends the role played by theUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) to which we have made a modest contribution of militaryobservers as a demonstration of Malawi’s commitment tothe restoration of peace.The militarization of the refugee camps outsideRwanda is a source of great concern to Malawi. Wetherefore call upon the international community to do itsutmost to reverse the reported inflow of weaponry into therefugee camps  and appeal to the people of Rwanda toexercise political maturity in order to avoid a degenerationof the situation into the tragedy of yesteryear  especiallywhen the mandate of UNAMIR expires on 9 December1995.My Government is encouraged by the progress beingmade in the Middle East peace process. We commend thecourage and determination of the Government of the Stateof Israel as well as the leadership of the PalestineNational Authority to move ahead. The two playersdeserve the unflinching support and applause of theinternational community to ensure that elements which areopposed to the peace process do not succeed.On the other hand  we have observed with remorsethe tragedy which has unfolded in the countries of theformer Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Innocent civilianshave been the most hurt in the shifting fortunes of war inthe Balkan region. Understandably  the United Nationsand the rest of the international community can play onlya limited role in the resolution of the conflict. MyGovernment  therefore  calls upon the principal players inthe region to cooperate with the international communityin finding a lasting solution to the conflict.It is the hope of my Government that the Koreanpeople on both sides of the thirty-eighth parallel willsustain and strengthen contact  with the aim of breakingthe existing impasse in the reunification of the dividedpeninsula.In the same vein  my Government favours anyefforts the United Nations may undertake with the aim ofresolving the issue of the international status of theRepublic of China on Taiwan in a manner which wouldbe acceptable to both the Government of the People’sRepublic of China and the authorities in Taiwan.As the United Nations celebrates 50 years ofexistence  let us take full stock of the work of theOrganization since its birth. Let us retrace our steps andweigh our achievements and failures so that we mayapproach the twenty-first century with renewed vigourand commitment. Let us not lose sight of the ideals whichthe Organization stands for as we continue to uphold thenecessary flexibility for its adaptation to current trends.Lastly  to those who love and cherish democracy letthe word go out  lest we forget  that the name“Nyasaland” at one time represented the biblical Davidand Goliath in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland which  if it had been given birth  would have made thescript for that region a different story. When the bordersthat defined our nationhood opened again and we becamepart of Mother Africa and the rest of the world  our StatePresident  Bakili Muluzi  burst out of a suffocatedMalawi  which had become a prison  and invited theworld to come and rejoice with us. The silent Malawianswho had crept out of Malawi  cautious not to speak to18General Assembly 21st plenary meetingothers about the pain of imprisonment and death in theirprison country  now saw a new leadership  not only inPresident Muluzi  but in the people of the countrythemselves. If these 15 months of the new Malawi have notmeant much to the World Bank  the fatigued donors and thesceptical theoreticians  let them remember the followinggreat words of Pliny:“There is always something new out of Africa. Itspresence on this continent  like the great seas thatsurround it  are legendary. Ignore Africa to yourperil.” (Pliny the Elder  Natural History  VII  77)In the same breath  we plead to you here again andagain: listen to what was said at the United Nations socialsummit meeting  at the United Nations women’s summitmeeting and during the International Year of the Child.There is no hope for mankind in the twenty-first centuryand after without a United Nations based on those threegreat occasions. Malawi pleads to those great nations thathave grown up with the ideals and ideas of human giants ofthe world not to jump off the ship that carries us all. Noone can say  “Stop the world  I want to get off.”On behalf of the people of Malawi  I thank Membersof the General Assembly for their attention."
"117",4986,"MYS",50,1995,"Let me first congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. I wish you a successfulpresidency. Appreciation is also due to your distinguishedpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  who providedthe leadership during the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.The General Assembly is meeting in the midst ofhectic schedules of events to commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. Some of us have becomepreoccupied with these celebrations. We should ask whetherthese activities are merely media events or could seriouslycontribute to a better United Nations. Will the high pointof the fiftieth anniversary be reduced to a specialcommemorative meeting condensed into a declaration ofgood intentions which no one seriously cares for  orshould we resist the tendency to celebrate  to expendmillions on galas and parties and to eulogize throughrhetorical speeches the anniversary of the establishment ofthe United Nations? After all we cannot even answer thebasic questions of where we stand and what the UnitedNations is  whipping boy or serious  enduring player.Admittedly it is easier to raise questions than to findanswers. But these questions must be raised and theydeserve to be answered. In its fiftieth year the UnitedNations system finds itself criticized for being unable tohandle basic and critical political  economic and socialissues. Despite earlier hopes of a just world orderfollowing the end of the cold war  what we still see is aUnited Nations which dances to the grating music of themajor Powers  in total disregard for the high principlesand objectives pledged at its formation. We will have toconclude that the narrow national interest of the few isstill what the United Nations is all about. Also  theprinciple which largely moves the major Powers  thatwhat they need for themselves must influence theirdealings with the needs of others  is fully operative making nonsense of interdependence  social compassionand justice.And so we must forget the promise of aninternational political leadership that can collectivelycome to grips with the myriad issues for a shared survival.Confrontation between States  intra-State conflicts economic and military threats  the dehumanizing effects ofpoverty: all these are heightened rather than diminished bythe end of the cold war. The contradictory impulses ofinterdependence and isolationism are more evident thanever before. Not only is humanitarianism drying up fast  butwhat survives is replete with conditionalities. The UnitedNations presents a shattered image with a threadbare moralauthority  despite the important early successes indecolonization and the subsequent elimination of apartheid.The victors of 1945 have clung tenaciously to thelevers of power. They control the high ground  exercisinginfluence and power as nakedly as when they were colonialPowers. Only the masks have changed. The multilateralorganizations created on the eve of war’s end were and stillare structured to further their economic interests and thepursuit of their strategic political goals. The SecurityCouncil  the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund have merely become the instruments of powerperpetuation. Less than six months ago  we witnessed theuse of the United Nations to push through  draconian-like the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. Before the ink wasdry  some of the nuclear Powers proceeded to test theirdiabolical weapons. What  may I ask  qualifies somecountries to possess the means of mass destruction inperpetuity? It is time that the nuclear-weapon Statescommitted themselves to nuclear disarmament through aprogrammed reduction of their nuclear arsenals within aspecific time-frame  beginning with the immediate cessationof all nuclear tests and culminating in their totalelimination. Soon it may be too costly and too late.Perversely  the major Powers not only continue tocompete in developing ever more destructive conventionalweapons but also compete to sell arms. And when somedeveloping countries buy arms the Western-controlledmedia accuse them of indulging in arms races.We seem to have inherited a world in which moralconsiderations have no real role to play in which acts ofrealpolitik have no moral consequences. Tears appear to beshed about the human tragedies in Bosnia  Rwanda  Liberia Somalia and Chechnya  but many have become desensitizedto the horrors that flash across our screens. The Charterincorporating the idealism and dreams of 1945 is morehonoured in violations of it than in adherence to it. Tell us:How have the principles of the Charter on the non-use offorce and the illegality of claiming territory acquired byaggression been of help to the Bosnians? What protectionor solace has the genocide Convention been to thoseslaughtered in Rwanda  Bosnia  Cambodia and Chechnya?The lesson for the peoples of these countries is clear: nointernational order or international ethos will be defendedunless the major Powers see that their vital interests areat risk.The United Nations has been party to the double talkin Bosnia  insisting that morality has no place in peace-keeping since the impartiality that peace-keepers had tomaintain required them to eschew making any judgementabout the rights and wrongs of the situation. I ask theUnited Nations whether there can be a middle groundwhere genocide and “ethnic cleansing” are concerned. Iask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whetherhe is obliged to defend the moral principles in the UnitedNations Charter or whether he should console the dyingand the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewherewho are suffering worse fates.Is there not  in the context of the larger picture  aspecial role for the United Nations to provideinternational leadership? Clearly the major Powers havefailed to provide leadership  choosing only to act infurtherance of their national or domestic politicalinterests. They continue to harp on human rights and thesanctity of human life but they act only when they run norisk.Admittedly  blame must also be apportioned to manyof us in the third world. Some of us have led our peopledown the path of despair and misery. With the demise ofcolonialism there was the promise of freedom anddevelopment. Yet many succumbed to the temptations ofcreature comfort  failing to further the rights and welfareof our own people. But then  when we were colonies  theonly form of government we knew was authoritariancolonialism. It is too much to expect some of us  at themidnight flag-lowering  suddenly to become democraticand sophisticated.The threat of a brutalized world has never been moreevident than in the Serb programme of “ethnic cleansing”in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the massacres in Rwanda.For a long time the major Powers were opposed to takingstrong measures against the Serbs. We are seeingbelatedly some sense of purpose in the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) bombings and efforts tonegotiate a solution. However  we should be cautiousabout rushing towards solutions that reward aggressionand genocide. It is possible that some in the West and inthe United Nations had longed for Bosnia’s quick defeat.It would have saved them from making any decision. But2the Bosnians refused to oblige. In Rwanda the Europeantroops withdrew when the massacres began. And in Somaliafailure to understand the situation led to the victims fightingtheir United Nations saviours.The United Nations Secretariat must take some of theblame for all these brutalities. In Rwanda it truly shirked itsduty  while in Bosnia it sent in a protection force whichwas instructed not to protect the Bosnians. Why it shouldbe called the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) has been a mystery until recently. It wasthere to protect itself. It makes a distinction betweenpeace-keeping and peace-enforcement. If there is peace tokeep  why are military forces needed? Are not the forcesput there because of the possibility of breaches of thepeace? And when there are breaches the forces must stopthem  if peace-keeping is to be meaningful. But  instead when peace is broken the United Nations threatens towithdraw and leave the victims to their fate.Fortunately  in Palestine  another historical flash point efforts continue to be made towards durable peace. Thatpeace process must result in a Palestinian homeland  aviable State at peace with its neighbours. The attempts toweaken the present Palestinian leadership by underminingits credibility will only result in the rise of extremism anda protracted and bloody intra- Palestinian conflict whichwill spill over into Israel and elsewhere.The absence of international leadership andcommitment is evident in the area of development as well.The rhetoric of development is increasingly devoid ofmeaningful content. The North has turned its back oncommitments relating to development assistance. Yet suchis the concern for the survival of insects and plant life thathuman development must be stopped if it is suspected itmight endanger a few animals or plants. That there areplenty of the same species elsewhere is consideredirrelevant. And so one-fifth of the world’s populationremains mired in poverty  having been denied developmentassistance by the rich and the powerful. The latter haveretreated into their regional clubs and cosy arrangements forperpetuating unconscionable levels of consumption. Someof the countries of the South have tried to pull themselvesup literally by their bootstraps. But the moment they appearto succeed the carpet is pulled out from under their feet.Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) privileges arewithdrawn and their records on human rights  democracy and so on  are scrutinized in order to obstruct their progress.Some among the more successful countries of theSouth have been enticed to join the rich and the strong  sothey may not lend what little strength they have to theircompatriots.Commitment to the environment should not beturned into an occasion for recrimination and the pointingof fingers. Worse  it should not be politicallyinstrumentalized to disadvantage the South. Developmentcan take place without irreparable damage to theenvironment. Forcing the developing countries to remainundeveloped in order to preserve the environment for therich is manifestly unfair. Yet the environmental obstaclesplaced in the way of the poor South will do just that beggaring the poor to enrich the already rich.Poverty itself creates an environment that is asdamaging to humanity as any other kind of environmentalpollution. Obviously  we need to determine our priorities.Do we keep the poor permanently poor so that the richcan enjoy the environment  or do we sacrifice theenvironment a little in the interest of relieving poverty?We in Malaysia accept that economic developmentshould not be at the expense of other groups or futuregenerations. Environmental sustainability  social equityand a culture that allows for the fulfilment of humanneeds must replace the culture of materialism. TheWestern consumer society  which is spreading worldwide  requires ever-increasing consumption to keepproduction and profits continually rising. For this  morefuel is needed  and the trend in the use of fossil fuels inrecent years is alarming. Yet very little is being done tocurb such wasteful use of a depleting resource  while thedevelopment of renewable resources  such as hydropower meets with all kinds of objections. Progressivelyindustrializing Malaysia has the capacity and theresources to design and implement a model ofdevelopment sensitive to the needs and cultural values ofdeveloping countries without imitating the flawed Westernmodel. We ask only that misguided crusaders should keepout. These modern-day imitations of the Communistagitators would do well to look to their own countries’wasteful consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions.Social disintegration is a serious problem as theworld’s population becomes more urbanized. This is nothelped by the West’s seeking to impose its moral values.The institutions that hold society together are now beingundermined. At the Beijing Women’s Summit  despite aconsensus cobbled together to alleviate the sufferings ofwomen  the mad quest for personal freedom took onemore tradition-bashing step. People  it seems  cannot befree unless they have sexual freedom  a freedom that3rejects the inhibitions of traditional and religious values  ofmarriage and family as institutions of society. Sexualfreedom will render fidelity meaningless as much as itrenders marriages anachronistic. The new liberalism extendsto a new definition of the family  which is to includehomosexual pairs  unmarried women with children byunknown fathers  groups of men and women living togetherwith no fixed partners  and many other combinations.If the West wants to be liberal and sexually free  thatis its right. What is wrong is the attempt to impose itsmorality  or lack of it  on the rest of the world  and inBeijing that was what it tried to do. The United Nationsshould not lend itself to this kind of undemocratic disregardfor the rights of others.Of late there has been much talk about reform of theUnited Nations. Clearly  there is a need for this after 50years of the United Nations carrying the tattered baggage ofthe last world war. Surely the results of that war cannot bereflected in the structure and procedures of the UnitedNations for ever. It has to end some time  and the fiftiethanniversary is as good a time as any for burying the relicsof past follies.Since democracy seems to have displaced religion asa faith  it is fitting that there should be democratic reformsin the United Nations. Some of those countries which hadvested themselves with infallibility and permanency havenow become second-raters. New players have emerged thatshould be accorded recognition. A more equitablerepresentation on the Security Council is a must. Thismeans that permanent seats should be given to regions possibly determined by a regional mechanism.The veto power should be dropped. Under nocircumstances must the Security Council be made aninstrument of any one country.Reform must also extend to the financing of theUnited Nations. It is wholly unacceptable that MemberStates  especially the rich ones  should fall into arrears withimpunity and yet exercise special rights and influence. Themembership rules must be applied to one and all. Newbases for assessment should be laid down  taking intoconsideration the wealth  or lack of it  of Members.Various global taxation schemes  including modestlevies on global air travel  a tax on global speculative flowsof capital  a tax on the exploitation of mankind’s commonassets on the seabed and a tax on the trade in weapons ofwar  have all been proposed. Of those  the last one  basedon the principle that he who profits from the tools of warmust contribute to the maintenance of peace  meritsurgent attention and adoption.Reform of the United Nations also requires thecleansing of the bureaucratic Augean stables in theSecretariat. The morale of the international civil serviceis at its lowest ebb. The excesses and the fat must betrimmed  but failure to do so must not be used as anexcuse for not paying dues or for opting out.It is heartening to note that the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) andother United Nations economic agencies have nowacknowledged that linking trade and non-trade issuesserves no useful purpose either for the developed or forthe developing countries. Unemployment in the developedcountries is due not to workers’ in developing countriesworking hard to compensate for their lack of othercompetitive advantages  but  rather  to the profligate waysof the developed nations  with their high wages andunemployment benefits. Why it is assumed that workersin developed countries would work when they are to bepaid for not working is a mystery on a par with the ideathat people would be happy and productive if the diligentwere paid as much as the indolent.The reform of global institutions must encompass theBretton Woods institutions. Their energies and resourcesmust be channelled towards the battle against thepollution caused by poverty worldwide. The BrettonWoods institutions have to cease acting as debt collectorsfor the mighty and the rich bankers  who  in turn  mustlearn to live within the rules of their own creation  withregard to taking commercial risks which go hand in handwith the pursuit of gain. A return to their originalmandates — to promote balanced development  in thecase of the World Bank  and to enforce monetary andfiscal responsibility in all countries  irrespective of theirstatus in the global economy — is a first priority. Reformmust include a re-evaluation of the governancearrangements at the Bank and the Fund through arealignment and reallocation of quotas and shareholdingsthat take into account the changed structure of the worldeconomy. New arrangements for governance mustrecognize the growing clout of the newly emergingeconomies that now contribute to a rising share of globaloutput  to trade and to capital flows.The debt millstone weighs heavily on the poor. Thisburden must be eased  especially for the poorest nations ofAfrica and Asia. Malaysia hopes that effective actions willbe taken forthwith  taking into account decisions made atthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly on findinga durable solution to the external-debt problem ofdeveloping countries.While bilateral debts extended by donor countries haveover the years been restructured and rescheduled — thoughwith humiliating conditions imposed by the Paris Club ofcreditors — multilateral institutions  led by the WorldBank  have steadfastly refused to consider restructuring debtowed to them. The World Bank continues to increase itsprofit levels and amasses reserves which today stand inexcess of $16 billion. Why are these reserves  built frompayments by developing countries  not used for debt relief?And why do we allow the intransigence of one or twocountries to preclude the issuance of special drawing rightsby the International Monetary Fund? These and other issuesmust feature in a reform of the Bretton Woods institutions.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization offer aglimmer of hope for rule-based trading relationships.Malaysia applauds and welcomes the underlying principles and we pledge ourselves to play by the mutually agreedundertakings.Regrettably  powerful trading nations threaten  throughunilateral actions  to undermine the carefully negotiatedagreements. The deliberate creation of regional tradingblocs  the introduction of managed trade and the attemptsto link human rights  environmental considerations andlabour codes to trade are major threats which  ifimplemented  would dim the hope of a free environment fortrade. We reject such attempts. The new protectionism willreturn the world to a bygone era when trade wars led tomilitary confrontations.Finally  we have the new threats with the advent ofthe information age. The poor countries have long sufferedfrom biased reporting by the world media  controlled by thedeveloped world. Now the computer network created forthe spread of knowledge and information has becomepolluted by the irresponsible dissemination of filth throughit. Someone is making money from this filth.The world community must find a way to keep outsuch filth and to provide for legal action to be taken againstits purveyors by aggrieved countries  even when theybroadcast from outside their borders. They should beallowed to bring these miscreants to trial in the aggrievedcountries  under their laws. After all  we have already hadmany instances of extraterritorial application of the lawsof some countries without so much as a by-your-leave.Freedom of information is fine  but even in this ageof freedom we cannot allow morals to be completelyundermined in order to enrich the merchants of porn andfilth.When all is said and done  we still have to admitthat the United Nations is the only truly multinationalOrganization where the voices of small nations can beheard. We support the United Nations  but we mustcorrect the tendency to make it an instrument of the richand the powerful. The United Nations must stand on theside of the collective needs of people and nations in orderto serve all mankind."
"118",5013,"NAM",50,1995,"Mr. President  Namibia joinsthe preceding speakers in extending sincere congratulationsand best wishes to you upon your unanimous election. Thisalso goes for your esteemed General Committee  of whichNamibia is a proud member.This historic session of the General Assembly —marking the golden jubilee of our Organization — coincideswith the fifth anniversary of Namibia’s independence brought about through a long and bitter struggle and thesacrifices of the Namibian people and  no less  inpartnership with the United Nations  which played a crucialrole in the process of our country’s decolonization. We arefilled with immense joy and satisfaction over this happycoincidence.The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire  mygood brother and colleague  His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy  presided over the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly with great skill  wisdom and dedication. Icommend him for a job well done and  in particular  forbringing excellence and industry to this important office all aimed at partnership and development. In this context Namibia will fully cooperate with the presidency of theGeneral Assembly and the Secretary-General in pursuit ofour common objectives that have been assigned to variousopen-ended working groups aimed at restructuring andstrengthening the United Nations.This special commemorative session of the GeneralAssembly will bring together a record number of worldleaders including  naturally  the Head of State of theRepublic of Namibia  Mr. Sam Nujoma  for a bigcelebration  collective stock-taking  introspection andreflection  and for renewed commitment to action on thebasis of a new vision for the future and rededicationtowards peace  development  gender equality  toleranceand brotherhood in this  our one global village.The cardinal purposes and principles of the Charterof the United Nations  since its adoption in 1945  havebeen these: to save lives  to liberate all those everywherestill in bondage  to promote democratic ideals and values to protect and defend human rights and civil liberties —codified subsequently in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights — and  above all  to protect succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war  which has wroughtso much devastation and human suffering in the world inthe course of this century.In furtherance of these purposes and principles andtheir early realization  our illustrious Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has applied his mind andenergy to the challenges of our times by formulating twoseminal documents — “An Agenda for Peace” and “AnAgenda for Development”. These timely and compellinginitiatives call for international cooperation  as well as forthe allocation of new and additional resources. Indeed they also place domestic obligations on Governments andcivil societies alike.Specifically  in the context of the fiftieth anniversarysession of the General Assembly  the Secretary-Generalhas submitted a comprehensive annual report  completewith focused recommendations for action on variousfronts. Namibia therefore pays a well-deserved tribute tothe Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in the serviceof the United Nations and for fresh initiatives to furtheradvance peace and development in the world.Reviewing history and past achievements  on thisoccasion marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United5Nations  is necessarily in order. At the same time  however balancing present challenges and opportunities requiresleadership  vision  commitment and courage on the part ofworld leaders. Let us hope that this commemorative sessionwill show the way forward and achieve the desiredobjectives.The most important of all the commitments that theglobal community must fulfil is to use the collectivepolitical will and resources of the States Members theUnited Nations“to promote social progress and better standards of lifein larger freedom”.This is the soul of the Charter of the United Nations.Today  the world is united behind the promotion ofdemocracy  respect for human rights and the rule of law.Let me  however  hasten to add that the eradication ofpoverty on a sustainable basis  through the provision ofadequate education  health care  employment and housingand the empowerment of women  needs to be placed at thetop of the priority list of the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies  which have been playing a vital rolein social and economic development.With the hindsight of 50 years  we know that theUnited Nations was at the start  and remains today  morethan a mere response to the horrors and circumstances ofthe Second World War and its tormenting legacies. It is asacred trust of life itself and an indispensable vehicle forthe preservation of civilization  in the interests of all nationsand peoples.One of those tormenting legacies was the cold war.The hopes and expectations of millions the world over wereheld hostage for decades by the politics of confrontationand the division of the world into hostile military blocs andrival ideological camps. This resulted in the derailing of thepurposes and objectives for which the United Nationsstands.The arms race and espionage  as well as competingalignments  seriously sapped the vital resources  time andenergies of nations  creating more and more hotbeds oftension  thus militating against peaceful coexistence andmutually beneficial inter-State relations.Fortunately  a nuclear holocaust was averted. A thirdworld war did not happen. But violence  distrust andmilitary build-up characterized world affairs for a very longtime. During this dangerous period the planet Earthteetered on the brink of a ghastly disaster. In the face ofall this  men and women of peace  wisdom andcompassion  from all corners of the Earth  kept raisingvoices of reason and appealing for sanity  disarmamentand dialogue.Decolonization is perhaps the most laudableachievement of the United Nations. The world witnessedan unprecedented and unstoppable wave of demands  bymillions the world over  for freedom and the exercise ofthe right to self-determination. This  happily  led to theachievement of independence by so many countries inAsia  Latin America — especially the Caribbean — andAfrica  which swelled the membership of the UnitedNations beyond 100. Today the number of Members  at185  is more than three times the original number — the51 founding nations of 1945.In Namibia  the moment came for the UnitedNations to put its resources where its convictions andresponsibilities were. It demonstrated its firm commitmentby providing necessary funds and technical capacity to theUnited Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) which facilitated Namibia’s smooth transition tonationhood in 1990. This success story stands out todayas a model of successful United Nations peace-keepingand decolonization.Other major United Nations success storiesfollowed — in Cambodia  El Salvador  Mozambique andHaiti. We hope for the same positive outcome in Angolaand other places. In all these cases  what ensured successwas a combination of political consensus  peace-keeping peace enforcement and humanitarian assistance.It has been said many times in so many ways that ifthe United Nations had not existed  collective yearning tocreate it would have been irresistible. That is whyNamibia attaches great importance to its membership ofthe United Nations. Since joining the United Nations Namibia has been playing an active role in all theactivities of the Organization. Namibia participated in thepeace-keeping operation in Cambodia and sent electionobservers to Angola under United Nations auspices.Namibia also sent a legal expert as a rapporteur torepresent the Human Rights Commission in Somalia. Butmore than that  Namibia has been paying its assessed andvoluntary contributions on time and in full  for we believemembership is not enough: without resources theOrganization cannot carry out its mandate.6As we look towards the next millennium  I should liketo state the position of the Government of the Republic ofNamibia on the following issues: regional cooperation;international economic cooperation; major United Nationsconferences; nuclear disarmament; and reform of the UnitedNations.Regional cooperation: in southern Africa  memberStates of the Southern African Development Community(SADC)  which now includes Mauritius  have combinedtheir efforts to bring about genuine reconstruction anddevelopment in our subregion. Peace is a prerequisite ofdevelopment. Without sustainable development  there canbe neither peace nor stability. While achievement of peacehas created favourable conditions for socio-economicdevelopment in southern Africa  the scars of apartheid anddestabilization remain. For example  to realize theseobjectives  States members of SADC have decided to pooltheir resources in order to implement joint projects in thefields of energy and water. With this in mind  severalprotocols were signed at the recent SADC Summit inJohannesburg.Additional areas in which SADC member States arecoordinating their policies include de-mining  combatingcrime  gun-running  drug-trafficking  money-laundering illicit cross-border trade  and other forms of criminalactivity. It is hoped that these efforts will lead to an idealsituation allowing for free movement of people  capital goods and services  thereby transforming SADC into acommunity of shared experiences and aspirations.Moreover  mechanisms for conflict resolution  politicalconsultation and peace-keeping are enjoying high priorityamong these regional concerns.I felt reinforced after listening to the inspiringstatement delivered this morning by my brother andcolleague  His Excellency  Mr. Alfred Nzo  Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of South Africa. May Ireassure him here of Namibia’s firm commitment tocontinue working closely with the Government and peopleof South Africa for the achievement of genuine peace stability  development and prosperity throughout southernAfrica.The completion of the Trans-Caprivi and Trans-Kalahari highways connecting land-locked neighbouringcountries to the Namibian port of Walvis Bay will furtherstrengthen regional cooperation  trade and integration. Wedo all this pursuant to the letter and spirit of the AbujaTreaty establishing the African Economic Community.There is no doubt that a successful SADC will strengthenthe African Economic Community.On international economic cooperation  Namibiasubscribes to the view  emphasized by the Economic andSocial Council at its last meeting  that developmentcannot flourish in the midst of conflict and instability. Itfollows from this that mutually beneficial economiccooperation is not possible as long as an unjustinternational economic system exists. Until we all becomeequal partners in the global economy  developingcountries  especially African countries  will for everremain underdeveloped. Contrary to the views beingexpressed in some quarters  Namibia maintains that theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Developmentand the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization have played a vital and constructive role inassisting developing countries.The strengthening of South-South cooperation ismore than ever a vehicle that is needed for theenhancement of the trade and economic development ofthe countries of the South. Namibia therefore supports theSouth Centre and appeals for financial and materialcontributions to its programmes.It is also Namibia’s firm belief that the recentlyinaugurated African-Latin American Institute  withregional headquarters in Namibia and Uruguayrespectively  will further strengthen South-Southcooperation. Namibia also welcomes the emerginginitiatives aimed at encouraging horizontal dialogue andcooperation among SADC  the Association of South-EastAsian Nations  the Common Market of the South(MERCOSUR) and other economic groupings of thecountries of the South.As regards major United Nations conferences  wemay say that never before in the history of ourOrganization have the social needs of humankind takencentre stage. Humanity has recognized that conservationof the environment is tantamount to preservation ofhuman life; respect for and protection of human rights isthe basis for democracy  good governance anddevelopment; addressing population issues within theframework of development is necessary in order toidentify the impact of socio-demographic trends on thewell-being of people; peace is not only the absence ofwar but also a necessary condition for the attainment ofsocial and economic development; and gender equality iscentral to development and peace.7The realization of the commitments made at all theseconferences should form the centrepiece of the agenda forthe twenty-first century.For Namibia  protection of the environment isenshrined in our Constitution. The promotion and defenceof democracy and human rights have become the vitalpillars of Namibia’s Government and society. In keepingwith the Programme of Action adopted at the InternationalConference on Population and Development in Cairo Namibia has fully integrated population issues into its FirstNational Development Plan.Similarly  the commitments we made at the WorldSummit for Social Development continue to be a toppriority of the Government. The Law Reform Commissionis finalizing recommendations to the Namibian Parliamentfor enactment of the necessary legislation.Namibia is proud of its contribution to the preparationfor the Fourth World Conference on Women and thehonour bestowed upon its delegation to serve asRapporteur-General at that Conference  in Beijing. Ittherefore goes without saying that Namibia will doeverything possible to ensure implementation of thePlatform for Action adopted at the Conference.The scientific and technological achievements ofhumankind should be used for peace and development. Allweapons of mass destruction must be destroyed. The timehas come for complete nuclear disarmament.Furthermore  Namibia calls upon the nuclear-weaponStates to fulfil the commitment made at the last Conferenceon the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand to move speedily towards the destruction of all nuclearweapons. In this regard  Namibia deplores the new spate ofnuclear testing. Namibia will continue to participate activelytowards the early completion of the draft treaty of thedenuclearization of Africa.With regard to United Nations reform  Namibiabelieves that the decision-making machinery of the SecurityCouncil  as it exists today  cannot effectively serve theinternational community in the twentieth century. Thephenomenal numerical growth in the membership of theUnited Nations must be reflected in representation on theSecurity Council. The reform  restructuring and enlargementof the Security Council should reflect the cardinal principlesof sovereign equality of all States  universality  democracyand transparency. It is only in this way that the authority legitimacy  credibility and effectiveness of the SecurityCouncil can be ensured.Namibia sees no problem in the addition of Germanyand Japan as permanent members of the Security Council.But at the same time  it is Namibia’s strong view thatAfrica  Asia and Latin America are entitled torepresentation as permanent members as well as throughthe allocation of additional seats in the Security Councilfor non-permanent members. What we seek is theacceptance of the principle. The mechanism of how tobring this about is the subject of ongoing consultations inthe relevant Open-ended Working Group. The new worldorder has no place  in Namibia’s view  for the outmodedveto power  and it must be abolished.The new world order  which is thought of asoffering the best hope for economic cooperation and freetrade  should liberate itself from the remaining shacklesof the cold war and replace confrontation with dialoguewherever differences still exist.Namibia welcomes the latest agreement onPalestinian self-rule  signed between the State of Israeland the Palestinian Authority. We look forward to theearly achievement of a comprehensive  just and lastingpeace in the Middle East  leading to the establishment ofa Palestinian State.The decolonization of Africa is not yet complete.Namibia therefore supports the early exercise by theSaharan people of their right to self-determination on thebasis of a free  fair and transparent referendum inWestern Sahara  under the joint supervision and controlof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity.There can be no military solution to the conflict inBosnia and Herzegovina conflict. Therefore  Namibiaurges all parties involved to end the suffering of theirpeople and find a lasting and peaceful political solution tothat conflict.As the year comes to an end  it is heartening to notethat the conflict in Liberia has been resolved with theestablishment of a broad-based  multi-party provisionalGovernment. We welcome this wholeheartedly. Let ushope that this is a good omen for the resolution of theconflicts in Somalia  Sudan  Burundi and Sierra Leone.Since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol on Angolalast year  the peace process in that sisterly country is8making steady progress. The spirit of reconciliation anddialogue is permeating the entire society  encouraged by theregular face-to-face talks between President José Eduardodos Santos of Angola and Mr. Jonas Savimbi of UNITA. Itis Namibia’s sincere hope that the pledges made in Brusselsat the recent round-table conference on Angola will betranslated into actual resources for reconstruction anddevelopment in that country  a neighbour of ours.Africa is long overdue to root out  once and for all  allthe criminal activities of mercenaries  which  like acts ofterrorism  stand condemned in the resolutions of both theUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity. Thelatest coup on one of the islands of the Comoros has madethis an extremely serious matter which now calls for urgentaction by the international community. Namibia thereforewelcomes the action taken to restore the Government andlaw and order on the island.The address His Holiness Pope John Paul II deliveredfrom this rostrum yesterday was a thoughtful messageconveying optimism  hope and good will as we stand on thethreshold of the next millennium. The Pope stresseduniversal love and family  subjects which embrace theentire human race.Let me conclude by expressing my sincere wish thatthis historic commemorative session of the GeneralAssembly will not fail to highlight public awareness of thework of the United Nations and the continued relevance ofthe Organization to the lives of individuals andcommunities everywhere. The vision of the founders 50years ago focused on the welfare and security of succeedinggenerations. Nations and peoples  as represented by non-governmental organizations  should move forward togetherinto the next millennium for a better world in whichchildren will feel safer."
"119",5058,"NER",50,1995,"Allow me at the outset  on behalf of my delegation  toextend my warm congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. Coinciding as it doeswith the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization  your election is indeed evidence of theesteem in which you and your country  Portugal  are heldby the international community. You can be assured ofthe full cooperation of the delegation of Niger.To your predecessor  Foreign Minister Amara Essy who has just added to his rich career the record of a jobwell done here  I convey my best wishes for success inhis future activities.In this transitional year in our Organization’s history I should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the dynamic manner inwhich he is performing his duties at the head of ourOrganization.10A half century has gone by since the creation of theUnited Nations at San Francisco in 1945. Hence  this year’ssession affords us a unique opportunity to recognize theimportance of the historic gesture by which the leaders ofthe day created the Organization as well as to renew ourfaith in the ideals and principles of the Charter  whichunquestionably stands as one of the most importantdocuments available to mankind for building the world oftomorrow. For young States like Niger  which acceded tointernational sovereignty 35 years ago  it would be remissto overlook the forceful role the United Nations has playedin the emancipation of peoples and its invaluablecontribution to the progress of mankind as a crucible ofinternational cooperation in the political  economic  socialand cultural spheres.Fifty years after the creation of the United Nations thethreats created by the cold war  which long paralysed it have disappeared  making way for healthier and moreconstructive cooperation between States. This new climateenabled the Organization to extend  a year ago  anemotional welcome to South Africa following its successfulvictory over the system of apartheid  thus closing aftermany years one of the most painful items on its agenda.Since the Madrid Conference  the Middle East too hasmoved along the irreversible path to peace  crowned by thesignature on 13 September 1993 of the Agreements onautonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho.However  this new climate has also created other kindsof threats  threats as formidable as those of the cold-warperiod and just as disturbing to the peace of many peoples.Conflicts that intermingle nationalism  ethnic rivalries andreligious intolerance have erupted in many parts of theworld. Democracy  notwithstanding the progress it hasmade  is finding it hard to take root in countries whereworsening poverty  malnutrition  disease and environmentaldeterioration mete out indescribable suffering.In other words  the global context in which the presentsession of the General Assembly is meeting is far fromgiving grounds for complete optimism. This session shouldfurnish us with an opportunity for a fruitful analysis ofways to create a better world  a world free of suchatrocities  a world in which mankind will no longer sufferand in which the ideals of peace  true development andjustice will prevail.The situation of my country  Niger  like that of manyother African States  is still fraught with difficulties of allkinds arising out of a disastrous economic environment. A50 per cent devaluation of our currency  the CFA franc in January 1994 dealt a severe blow to the living standardof the population.The economic recovery expected as a result of thisfairly drastic monetary step has been delayed  for thecollective and uniform nature of the measure made itunsuitable to the specific situations in the variouscountries affected. Unable to count on a significantincrease in its raw-material exports  Niger has  on thecontrary  experienced an unreasonable increase in thepressure of its external debt and the cost of imports.Despite that  my Government  in conjunction with theBretton Woods institutions  has undertaken a programmeof economic structural adjustment based on a policy ofsystematic restructuring of the public and semi-publicsectors combined with a balancing of macroeconomicaggregates based on a substantial improvement in Staterevenues and a reining in of public expenditure.Politically speaking  the democratic process enteredinto in 1990 is being pursued and expanded  although itcontinues to experience the growing pains that accompanyany new experiment — excesses and abuses of new-foundfreedoms  a tendency to civic impunity  the excessivegrowth of all kinds of interest groups  special interests and so on. However  the existence of active trade unions an independent and free press and a dynamic civil societyare creating the basis for a lasting democratic structurecapable of ensuring respect for the rule of law andcontributing to the gradual growth of a democraticculture.After less than four years of institutionalizeddemocracy  Niger held elections for President and for theLegislature. The holding of the last set of elections for theLegislature  advanced to January 1995  was entrusted toan independent electoral commission headed by amagistrate and made up primarily of persons from theNon-Governmental Organization sector  and from humanrights organizations and organizations advocatingdemocracy. Several international observers witnessed thevote and all of them said that it was a model oftransparency and equity. These elections resulted in amajority in Parliament for the opposition parties. Thus since that time  Niger has been living under a regimewhere the presidential minority does not coincide with theparliamentary majority. This so-called cohabitation regimeis the most delicate form of the distribution of11constitutional powers and of relations between the differentinstitutions of the Republic. Despite all the difficultiesinherent in the exceptionally delicate and unprecedentedexperience we are undergoing  the regular functioning ofthe institutional machinery has never been found wanting.The Supreme Court  the institution entrusted withinterpreting the Constitution and stating the law on the basisof which the operation of the Republic’s institutions can beensured  has played a crucial role. Systematic reliance onthe machinery of law has been an option of principlesupported by the entire political community  whichconstitutes its dedication to the rule of law and to thestability as well as the security of the country.It is precisely to ensure the country’s security andstability that my Government undertook all the efforts thatfinally led to the Agreement of 24 April 1995  between theGovernment and the leaders of the Tuareg rebellion  joinedtogether in the Armed Resistance Organization. As theAssembly knows  since 1991 there has been in the northernpart of Niger an armed rebellion claiming to represent theTuareg community and calling for the establishment of afederal regime  which it believes is the only one that canprovide its people with free self-government. Thediscussions undertaken with the leaders of the rebellionconstantly stressed the need to avoid useless bloodshed  andto focus on dialogue  the major focus of which would bethe best interests of the country. Thanks to mediationefforts by the friendly countries of Algeria  Burkina Fasoand France  to which I once again extend the gratitude ofthe Nigerian people  we were able on 24 April 1995 to signa definitive peace agreement. That agreement  based on theprinciple of respect for the constitution  which enshrines theindivisibility of the Republic  emphasizes two mainelements: first  at the political level  the agreementrecommends the acceleration of the establishment ofdecentralized structures and a consequent devolution ofadministrative and political powers to those structures;secondly  at the economic level  the agreement recommendsthe implementation of a special programme of economicand social development in the northern part of the country.With respect to the first aspect of the commitmentsundertaken in this important agreement  the responsibilityof the Government is almost exclusive. But that is not trueof the second aspect. Indeed  it is quite clear that themotives for this rebellion  which started at the very timewhen the country had embarked on the road to democracyand institutionalization of freedoms  are primarilyeconomic. The northern area of Niger  after the past fewyears of cyclical draught  was in a highly precariouscondition due to the upheaval of its ecosystem. Livestockgrazing became highly problematic  condemning nomadiccommunities to wandering and inducing in them a feelingof malaise  which quickly led to claims for a separateidentity. The only way to deal appropriately with thisrebellion  which is  after all  only a symptom of the realdifficulties faced by these people  is to restore hope to allof these hard-hit regions. That is why the peaceagreement provides for the holding on 30 and31 October 1995 of a round-table meeting involving allthe countries and institutions linked to Niger  with a viewto preparing a special development programme for thenorthern area. I appeal to all those who wish to helpNiger definitively restore and consolidate peace to kindlylend their support to this undertaking.On the international level  the tragic conflicts inRwanda  Somalia  Liberia and the former Yugoslavia —to refer only to them — bear witness eloquently to thefragility of the international order that emerged from theend of the cold war  and also to the inability of presentstructures to provide an adequate collective responsewhen national stability breaks down and when the ensuinginternal conflicts give rise to unspeakable suffering.The situation of Rwanda is among those which given their gravity and their undermining of the basicprinciples of our Organization  deserve special attention.My country is following with great attention the effortsundertaken for a year now by the authorities of Rwandato overcome the consequences of the tragic events thattook place there and to consolidate the work for nationalreconciliation and lasting peace.The situation in Liberia  after a series of initiativesleading to the establishment of a new Council of State has taken a truly positive turn. This is an opportunity forme to extend my congratulations to the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and to allthose whose help has been so useful  in particularPresident Sani Abacha of Nigeria and President Rawlingsof Ghana. I wish to congratulate the people of Liberia ontheir courage and encourage them to persevere on thepath of peace and hope that they have paid so dear aprice to find again.In Angola  Niger is following closely the progressachieved along the path to peace and we congratulatePresident Dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi. Niger is followingwith the same attention the developing situation inWestern Sahara and we deplore the slow pace of theprocess for the restoration of peace there.12With regard to the sanctions imposed on Libya by theSecurity Council  Niger believes that the constructiveproposals made by the authorities of that country constitutea serious basis for a resolution of this crisis  whoseconsequences are so burdensome to the Libyan populationand to neighbouring countries such as Niger.Outside of our continent  Niger welcomed the signingon 13 September 1993 in Washington of the Agreementsbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israelenvisaging autonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Theensuing dynamic led — after very hard work — to asignificant breakthrough with the signing of the Agreementon 28 September 1995 in Washington which extendsautonomy to the West Bank.The long tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina  aMember State of the United Nations  gives rise to manyquestions about the capacity of our Organization to ensurerespect even for its principles. The Muslim population ofthat country has suffered too much from the inconsistencies improvisations and hesitations of the internationalcommunity  while the Bosnian Serbs  grand masters offait accompli politics  have been allowed to calmly continuetheir abominable practice of “ethnic cleansing”  callingseriously into question the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Niger welcomed the military pressure exercised uponthe Serbs by our Organization and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization last September  and we warmly welcome thelatest peace initiatives led by the United States of Americawith a view to the return of peace to that region. We hopethat this great stride will provide a basis for bringing aboutjust and lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Fifty years after its creation  the United Nations muststrengthen its mission of promoting dialogue andcooperation between peoples. It must  even more than inthe past  work to limit tensions as far as possible  and tosettle conflicts when they erupt but  in particular  to preventsituations that could threaten international peace andsecurity.In this spirit  in this special year in the life of ourcommon Organization and in accordance with the principleof universality enshrined in Article 4 of the Charter  Nigerhas advocated the establishment of an ad hoc committee tolook into the question of the representation of Taiwan.The end of the cold war has not helped to shield theworld from the emergence of local conflicts any more thanit has made it possible to remove the heavy burdenweighing on mankind as a result of the stockpiling andimprovement of weapons. However  it is now anestablished fact that disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have apivotal role to play in preventing conflicts and promotingpeace and social and economic development. For thisreason  we can congratulate ourselves on the results of the1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.This Conference  in addition to agreeing on an indefiniteextension of the Treaty  agreed that a comprehensivenuclear test-ban treaty would be concluded in 1996 at thelatest. Niger wishes to reaffirm its deep desire to see thenegotiations now under way lead to the conclusion of atreaty that comprehensively bans nuclear tests  that isuniversal and that can be effectively monitored.Our attempts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons should not make us losesight of the threat of conventional weapons and the needto control them.Niger is pleased to applaud here Mali’s initiativewhich this year led the Secretary-General of ourOrganization to dispatch a mission to the subregion ofWest Africa to assess the negative impact of the illicitcirculation of small arms upon the States of thesubregion. We support the recommendations made by theSecretary-General following that mission and we retainthe hope that the international community  which gavemassive support to the relevant resolution  will give thebacking that is indispensable for the implementation ofthese recommendations.In recent years  our Organization has investedheavily in conflict prevention and management. Manyresources and a great deal of time have been devoted tothis area  sometimes to the detriment of developmentmeasures. My delegation  however  remains convincedthat there is no greater threat to peace than the currentstalemate in dialogue between rich and poor countries andthe widening of the various inequalities that have ensued.This session is taking place at a time when the worldeconomic situation is riven by deep-seated imbalances.Although some regions have seen considerable progress in other regions delays are becoming worse every year sometimes leading to unprecedented crises. The poorestcountries seem to have been left on the sidelines of theprogress that the world economy has enjoyed. In somecountries the very structures of the State have fallen into13complete disrepair and populations have been plunged intothe deepest distress. Poverty  hunger and illiteracy plaguemore than one-fifth of the world’s population and in manyparts of the world the situation is becoming dangerouslyworse.The African continent is requesting  as a priority andurgently  the solidarity of the international community. Theweaknesses of its structures persist and frequently growworse. The current improvement in growth rates are stilltoo weak to compensate for 15 years of economic decline.Economic performances are disappointing even in countriesthat have undertaken considerable reform.Despite the international community’s commitments inthe framework of major conferences and summits of everykind  flows of official development assistance are falling offevery year. At a time when developing countries need itmost to support their reforms  official developmentassistance has fallen drastically and the general malaisesurrounding this assistance  christened “donor fatigue”  isgrowing worse and worse.My country regrets that not even the Economic andSocial Council high level segment on the development ofAfrica  including the implementation of the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s nor the Mid-Term Global Review of the Implementation ofthe Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries for the 1990s which has just ended  has made itpossible for the international community to arrive at a setof concrete measures that can reverse this trend by creatingconditions for sustained and lasting economic recovery anddevelopment in the poorest countries.The silent crisis of poverty  disease and illiteracyshould inspire the international community to tackle theroots of the evil by adopting a preventive and moreconsistent approach to the resolution of these problems. Theroots of the problem include the burden of external debtwhich continues to hamper the development efforts ofdeveloping countries. Although we recognize the efforts toreschedule and write off debt under the Naples Terms  wemust point out that this is not enough.Donor countries are fully aware that they  along withthe multilateral financial institutions  are the main creditorsof our countries and that a large part of the debt servicingthey finance simply returns to their treasuries and those ofmultilateral institutions.Financial flows on favourable terms are not usuallyenough to make up the financing deficit of poor countries.Comprehensive and lasting solutions are needed ifproblems are to be solved once and for all.The radical structural reforms that developingcountries  especially the least developed among them have undertaken in their economies have proved to bevery costly in social and political terms and have not beengiven sufficient support by the international community.Although structural adjustment remains indispensable toremedy serious economic imbalances  the needs andpriorities of the poorest and most vulnerable peopleshould not be neglected. Adjustment and transformationmust be designed to improve the well-being ofpopulations. There is good reason to encourage in practiceGovernments to persevere  but they must also be helpedto attenuate the severe impact of such reforms. Thestruggle against poverty was one of the principal topics ofthe World Summit for Social Development inCopenhagen last March. The international communitymade courageous commitments  which we welcome  inparticular the commitment to supply the financialresources necessary for integrated strategies to combatpoverty  unemployment and social exclusion. We remainhopeful that these commitments will be translated intoaction and initiatives at both the national and internationallevels.The Fourth World Conference on Women that hasjust recently ended in Beijing is also a landmark of ourtime in so far as the international community reaffirmedthere the importance of the role of women  the main actorin and beneficiary of development  and committed itselfto devoting greater resources to improving the status ofwomen and their access to the political and economic lifeof our countries.The Agenda for Development  which is now beingdrafted and unanimously heralded as complementing the“Agenda for Peace” should provide the internationalcommunity with a new opportunity  in addition to justreaffirming principles  to focus on producing resourcescommensurate with the task of implementing concretedevelopment initiatives.A whole series of world conferences in recent yearshas enabled us to forge a new vision of globaldevelopment and to define the measures needed to turnthat vision into reality. The international community musturgently give tangible proof of its commitment toprogress along the path it has chosen.14Any delay can only make the remedy that much moredifficult and costly. The commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  marking a half-centuryof the existence of our Organization  is highly symbolic andwe would be ill advised not to make judicious use of thesesymbols. This is such a rare occasion that I believe wemust take advantage of it."
"120",5104,"NGA",50,1995,"I am delighted toaddress the General Assembly in the year of its fiftiethanniversary. On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  Iconvey warm congratulations to the President on hiselection to preside over the General Assembly at itsfiftieth session. We are confident that in carrying out hisduties he will bring his wisdom  competence anddiplomatic skills to bear on the work of the Assembly.We congratulate his friendly country  Portugal  andreaffirm the warmth of the bilateral relations between ourtwo countries.Let me also convey our sincere thanks to hisdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy of Côte d’Ivoire  for the outstanding manner inwhich he conducted the affairs of the General Assemblyat its forty-ninth session. I also wish to express mydelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for thecourageous manner in which he is responding to thechallenges of his office.The uniqueness of the current session is not lost onmy delegation. It is not only a solemn occasion to reflecton the achievements and difficulties of our Organizationduring the past 50 years  but also a golden opportunity tochart a new way forward. We therefore hope that thework of this and future sessions of the General Assemblywill continue to be inspired by the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter.The establishment of the United Nations in theaftermath of the Second World War marked a turningpoint in the history of international relations. As anintergovernmental Organization whose principal tasksinclude the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  the promotion of international cooperation for7development and the progressive development andcodification of international law and respect for humanrights  the United Nations best epitomizes the will of thepeoples of the world to live together.We in Africa attach great importance to this fiftiethanniversary  as in 1945 the vast majority of our countrieswere not independent and therefore could not participate inthe processes leading to the signing of the United NationsCharter in San Francisco. It is gratifying  however  thatfrom being represented by only four countries on thatoccasion  Africa has since grown to be the largest regionalgroup within the Organization. This is in accordance withthe universalist aspirations of the United Nations.The phenomenal growth in membership evokes happymemories of the transition of a large number of MemberStates  particularly from Africa and Asia  from colonialdependencies to nationhood. For many years the UnitedNations was the catalyst in this process. Our continentalorganization  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) from its inception in 1963  similarly embraced thisobjective as a primary preoccupation. It was my country’sprivilege to be associated at the regional and global levelswith the struggle against apartheid and for freedom andself-determination on the continent.The United Nations is perhaps best known for itsendeavours in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. This remains a major preoccupation  as eventssince the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civilconflicts and political instability in many countries particularly in the developing world  have become endemic with grave consequences for international peace andsecurity. These conflicts  which have their origins in among other things  new nationalisms  ethnic differencesand religious bigotry  constitute a test of the internationalcommunity’s will to meet the new challenges and provideappropriate solutions.On this occasion  therefore  it is the hope of theNigerian delegation that the Assembly will make sustainedefforts to take decisions that will significantly enhance theprospects of global peace and security. We expect thatfurther thought will be given to redefining the role of theUnited Nations and its perspectives on preventivediplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-buildingas continuing imperatives in crisis management and conflictresolution.Given that the maintenance of international peace andsecurity is a shared responsibility  the United Nationsshould undertake to realign and strengthen its cooperationwith regional organizations and arrangements. This is notto underestimate the need for Member States to makeserious efforts to prevent war and civil conflict throughconfidence-building measures and the formulation andimplementation of appropriate domestic policies. In thisregard  we cannot but reaffirm the continuing validity ofthe peaceful resolution of disputes through mediation conciliation  arbitration  judicial settlement and respect forapplicable international laws.We deplore the growing arms race and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  on whichvast resources are now being wasted. The nuclear geniehas left the bottle and cannot now be led back into it; thetrauma of Hiroshima and Nagasaki persists and continuesto haunt the international conscience. Let us thereforeresolve that such a tragedy will never happen again. Thetime for disarmament under effective international controlis now.Although progress towards the achievement ofgeneral and complete disarmament has been slow  wewould like to commend the United Nations for its role inthis sphere. Nigeria regards the agreements banningbiological and chemical weapons as landmarkarrangements. We must remain committed to the ultimategoal of the total elimination of all weapons of massdestruction.On its twenty-fifth anniversary  in May of this year the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) was extended indefinitely. Developments sincethen have seriously undermined the confidence we haveall reposed in the Treaty and its regime  and haveregrettably cast major doubt on the commitment ofMember States  particularly the nuclear Member States to disarmament. In our view  efforts to achieve this mustremain fundamental and include the conclusion of acomprehensive nuclear- test-ban treaty by 1996  the cut-off in the production of fissionable materials for weaponspurposes  and the granting of security assurances by thenuclear-weapon States to non-nuclear-weapon States in alegally binding instrument.In our continuing efforts to ensure a peaceful andsecure environment for the development of the Africancontinent  Nigeria is delighted to welcome the successfulcompletion of the negotiations on the Treaty of anAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone  which was endorsedby the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council ofMinisters in June 1995. By this action  African leaders8have given concrete expression to their collectivecommitment to make the continent a nuclear-weapon-freezone. It is our expectation that during this session theinternational community will respect this initiative throughthe endorsement of the Treaty. We hope that the nuclear-weapon States will ratify the protocols to be annexed to theTreaty.The framers of the Charter of the United Nations did in fact  recognize that peace and development go together.Among the high purposes of our Organization is thepromise of economic and social achievement by all peoples.To this end  a good deal of effort has been made by theUnited Nations and its agencies to support theimplementation of programmes of action initiated bydeveloping countries at national  subregional and regionallevels. We commend these agencies for their efforts intackling the problems of social and economic development.In discussing the general issue of development  werecognize the primacy of the United Nations in promotinginternational cooperation for development. It is in thisconnection that we have welcomed the contribution of theSecretary-General in his Agenda for Development. For usin Africa  development is a question of survival. We placea particular premium on it as we confront the challenges ofpoverty and underdevelopment.While the unsatisfactory economic situation of Africahas been the subject of many international conferences  theresulting programmes of action have remained largelyunimplemented. Such programmes include the UnitedNations Programme of Action for African EconomicRecovery and Development 1986-1990 and the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the1990s  adopted in 1991. The failure to implement theseprogrammes has been due primarily to the lack of will andacceptance of a concept of economic interdependence byour development partners. Yet  it remains important thatdevelopment should be seen as an integral and indivisiblewhole  an objective to be pursued collectively in the globaleconomy.The economic crises confronting the developingcountries are multifaceted. I would  however  like to stressthe pre-eminent need for the international community toresolve the external-debt crisis  which is a key impedimentto growth and development in our respective countries.Most African countries devote a large proportion of theirforeign exchange earnings to debt-servicing. It has therefore  been difficult for these countries to also pursuesustained economic development objectives. It is clear thatNigeria — as  indeed  most other countries of ourcontinent — faces limited possibilities for theimplementation of their economic reform programmeswithout urgent and adequate debt-relief measures.We believe that development cooperation shouldengender genuine interdependence  mutual interest andbenefits in the context of global partnership. In theexpectation that the developed countries will support andindeed assist the developing countries in theirdevelopment efforts  we call for fuller cooperationbetween the two sides. The initiative to hold the Asia-Africa Forum in Bandung  Indonesia  in December 1994 as a follow-up to the Tokyo International Conference forthe Development of Africa  was bold and imaginative.The conclusions and recommendations of these initiatives which are also critical  need to be faithfully implemented.The integrated approach to development beingpursued by the United Nations is right and deserves to becommended. In this regard  we welcome the outcome ofthe recently concluded World Summit for SocialDevelopment and Fourth World Conference on Women.These conferences have helped to promote women indevelopment and to enhance their role in public affairs.We acknowledge the interdependence of societies asunderscored by these conferences  and the fact that allcultures have a contribution to make at the crossroads ofcivilization and development.While recognizing the achievements of the UnitedNations  it is fit and proper  at this point  to identify alsothose areas in which the Organization has not fullyrealized its objectives.On peace and security  it should be acknowledgedthat the United Nations has a commendable record ofsuccess. Since its founding  it is significant that there hasbeen no global war and that the end of the cold war hasenhanced the prospects for cooperation and the lesseningof tension. However  new conflicts have emerged whichhave defied solution by the United Nations. It is evidentthat the challenges of peacemaking  peace-keeping andpeace-building require new perspectives and commitmentsfrom Member States. Moreover  while seeking to providesolutions to these conflicts  the United Nations mustaccept that it has a limit to its capacity. It should therefore  not micromanage the internal politicalarrangements of countries in conflict. It is equallyimportant that the United Nations be seen to betransparent and even-handed in crisis management in allregions. Furthermore  the United Nations should do more9to cultivate and cooperate with regional organizations andarrangements in conflict resolution.On decolonization  the balance sheet of the UnitedNations performance is largely positive. However  thelegacies of colonialism and the challenges of nation-building have created difficulties for new States. Thesedifficulties have resulted in the inability of many of the newStates of the developing world to conduct their domesticand external relations in a manner consistent with theprovisions of the Charter. The experience of a number ofthese States indicates that powerful members of theinternational community continue to insist on their modelsas standards for universal behaviour and application. Thepolitical and economic lives of the new States are furthercircumscribed by international financial institutionsdominated by the economically strong. These institutions which are as old as our Organization  have yet to adapt tothe new economic realities and needs of the new Statesthey seek to serve.With regard to development  the objectives of theCharter have remained largely unfulfilled in view of thegrowing economic disparities between a minority ofdeveloped countries and the vast majority of countrieswhich are classified as developing. Regrettably  dialoguebetween the North and the South  which is vital toeffectively address this imbalance  has reached a deadlock.This dialogue needs to be relaunched in order to achieve ajust and equitable world order for sustainable development.Since joining the United Nations 35 years ago  Nigeriahas played its part in upholding the purposes and principlesset forth in the United Nations Charter. It has also pursuedits objectives with dedication and commitment. Fromdecolonization to peace-keeping  we have spared neitherefforts nor resources in fulfilling our obligations under theCharter. Our record in peace-keeping speaks for itself.Within the ambit of South-South cooperation  Nigeriahas extended assistance to other developing countries particularly in Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific. In oursubregion  we are in active partnership with the countriesof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) to accelerate development through cooperation.It is our hope that ECOWAS will become an essentialcomponent for continental integration as envisaged underthe Abuja Treaty on the African Economic Community.To avoid any doubt  I wish to state that we in Africahave long accepted that the primary responsibility for thedevelopment of our continent rests squarely on ourshoulders. But the reality of our experience is that wehave had to fight on the two fronts of political andeconomic reforms at the same time. Few regions of theworld have borne such excruciating burdens in theirdevelopment process. This calls for understanding andencouragement rather than indifference and benignneglect. Consequently  in addition to regional integrationefforts  we in Nigeria have undertaken bold economic andpolitical reforms. On the economic front  the currentAdministration in Nigeria has deregulated the economyand created new incentives for domestic and foreigninvestments.On the political plane  Nigeria has embarked oncourageous reforms. In spite of unforeseen difficulties andthe complexities of the Nigerian situation  we havecontinued to make steady progress in our determinedefforts to establish a veritable and enduring democraticpolity. Indeed  only three days ago my Head of State General Sani Abacha  announced a comprehensiveprogramme of transition to democratic rule and the finaldisengagement of the military from power. Thisprogramme was carefully drawn up taking into accountthe objective realities of our national situation to ensurenot only an orderly transition  but also theinstitutionalization of durable democratic structures ofgovernance at all levels.While we recognize and appreciate theunderstandable concerns of our foreign friends and theinternational community at large  we hope that duesupport will be given to our endeavour in the fullrealization that a democratic Nigeria  the most populousblack nation on Earth  is an asset to itself and has muchto offer the international community.In order that the United Nations might be betterequipped to discharge its responsibility as a forum forharmonizing the actions of nations  it is essential that theongoing process of revitalization and institutional reformsbe intensified. This is necessary if the United Nations isto assert its central role in the establishment of a newworld order. It is also vital if the United Nations is totruly reflect the equity and geographical balance that arecritical for its efficiency and authority.Nigeria  therefore  reaffirms its support for theexpansion of the Security Council both in its permanentand in its non-permanent membership and  in thisconnection  my delegation renews the offer made by ourcountry to serve the international community as apermanent member in the expanded Security Council.10As we look to the future  it is obvious that theeffectiveness of the United Nations will depend on thecollective will and support of its entire membership. Thereare two levels of responsibility in ensuring a strong andvibrant United Nations. The first is what the United Nationsitself must do; the second  and more important  is what wethe Member States accept to do to enable the Organizationto respond effectively to our collective quest for peace freedom  justice and development. In pursuit of theseobjectives  Nigeria is determined to continue making itscontributions."
"121",5149,"NIC",50,1995,"It is a pleasure for me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly onthis  the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. I alsowish to extend our recognition to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and to the outgoing President Mr. Amara Essy.We are convinced that one of the most importantitems of this session must be support for the effective andsubstantive reform of the United Nations.The only way to approach the construction of a newinternational order is by renewing our faith inmultilateralism and giving the United Nations its central indispensable role in the search for lasting solutions to thecomplex problems that all our societies are experiencing.Half a century has passed since the founding of theUnited Nations. With its successes and setbacks  itsaccomplishments and its problems  the United Nations hasshown that only organized international cooperation willmake it possible to prevent new conflicts. It is impossible18to imagine today’s world without this universal institution.The profound changes that have taken place since that eraand the demands of the future make it necessary for theUnited Nations to be renewed  revitalized  reformed andstrengthened.It is valid  then  for us to ask ourselves what the newvision of our United Nations is in a changing  global andinterdependent world. The transformation of the UnitedNations cannot be separated from the profoundtransformations that democracy itself is undergoingthroughout the world. Our Organization must be reformedon the basis of the new conception of democracy.The concept of democracy in the world has changed.Democracy is no longer a static concept  nor is it limitedonly to the internal affairs of States. Democracy is apatrimony of values that are common to all humankind.Today’s democracy is dynamic  and in order for it to takeon a profound character  it should be understood as anunfinished work that is always in transition.Today I should like to emphasize various aspects ofthis international democratic transition  which is closelyrelated to the transition that our Organization must undergo.First  we are moving away from the political agendaand moving towards the social agenda. The World Summitfor Social Development  held in Denmark  reminded us thatthe ultimate objective of all our efforts is to improve theliving conditions and quality of life of our peoples. OurOrganization was born in the geopolitical era  marked byEast-West confrontation and bipolar division. Today we arepassing towards a world divided into economic blocs wheresocial policies are demanding their rightful place at centrestage.Our Organization has the duty to facilitate thistransition from a world divided between military Powers toa world where democracy  economic efficiency and socialjustice crown a new world order.Secondly  democracy is passing from centralizeddecision-making to broad participation by citizens insociety. In this way we are moving from formal democracyto participative democracy  where power and choice aresomehow returned to communities. This transition meansmore opportunity for dialogue and internal consensus withinour societies. As has been said on other occasions  theconcept of international peace gives way to the concept ofinternal peace within our States. Last year the Secretary-General himself said  at the luncheon he gave for Heads ofState  that wars are no longer waged between States but rather  within our nations. That is why it is so importantto promote reconciliation and negotiation in dividedsocieties.Thirdly  we are moving from bureaucracy to goodgovernment. This transition requires that special attentionbe given to the reform and modernization of the State.Efficiency and effectiveness should now be the new termsfor public administration.Fourthly  we are passing from the unilateralperspective that has characterized the world to a focus ongender that opens the doors for the full  activeparticipation of women in the great tasks of our times.Equality and equity between men and women is a basicprinciple for achieving the true development ofinternational society. In this regard  the recent Conferencein Beijing opened up a new chapter for us  leadingtowards this new goal.Our Organization also has to assimilate the transitionfrom a partial concept of development to an integratedconcept of sustainable development. This new conceptrequires us to combine the political dimension with thesocial  cultural  economic  ecological and even ethnicdimensions of development processes.Central America  a region that emerged intodemocracy from out of the ashes of war and conflict —a region  as the President of El Salvador  Mr. ArmandoCalderón Sol  said this afternoon  is going through a newstage in its history — has also adopted a new model ofsustainable development that makes ours the first regionin the world to try  through the concrete fulfilment ofcommitments in all areas  to make a reality of theagreements of the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment.We Central Americans are moving from the modelof military security centred on the cold-war poles ofpower to the new model of democratic security. TheUnited Nations should therefore lead the way in this newconcept of security  which is not limited to the militaryaspect. Rather  human security should be the new axis ofthis new model of world security.Today we Central Americans are discussing a treatyon democratic security  developed by Nicaragua  thatenshrines this new concept of security  which is no longerbased on number and quality of weapons  but  rather  onthe quality of human life  the efficiency of democratic19institutions  civil security  the fight against drug trafficking terrorism and arms trafficking and cooperation in all areas.We Central Americans have concluded that democracy andits improvement are the best way to strengthen regionalsecurity.We must be aware that we are also going through atransition to what we call preventive democracy. By this wemean that we should strive to anticipate conflicts and theircauses in order not to have to resolve them later with thepeace-keeping forces of this Organization. That is why wehave always said that the best peace-keeping operation isthe one that we can avoid  that we never have to carry out.This also means rechannelling efforts into the area ofpromoting human rights — no longer treating this subjectas a mere list of violations of fundamental rights andfreedoms devoting great efforts to the promotion of respectfor those rights and human freedoms.In its reform process  our Organization should alsotake into account that commerce and investment are ceasingto be merely economic factors; they are becoming agenuine element of support for those democratic processesthat demand to form part of economic development. Thebattles waged before on the battlefield are now waged ininternational markets. What we must understand is thatthere  too  a battle for the sustainability  progress anddevelopment of democracy is taking place.We are also making the transition from a worlddivided between opulence and poverty to one with a newfocus on establishing a real alliance for developmentbetween the countries of the north and the countries of thesouth. The era of confrontation should give way to a newera of cooperation directed at reducing the inequalitiesbetween a rich and prosperous north and a dispossessed andpoor south.We need to make the transition from an era ofinequality of opportunities to an era of democratization ofdevelopment. By this I mean  at the internal level broadening the base of the benefits of progress for asteadily growing number of small and medium-sizedbusinessmen. At the international level democratization ofdevelopment implies sharing the benefits of progress in amore equitable manner between countries.It is not possible to make a deep revision of thestructure of our Organization without looking at theprofound changes that have taken place in the world andwhich are enriching and broadening many of our values concepts and goals while presenting new challenges.For this reason it is very important to see that thereform of the United Nations rests on this global renewalof democracy  whose consolidation constitutes thefundamental political priority for the new world order weare all building.I would like to emphasize here that the new andrestored democracies  which met in Managua in 1994 have much to do with and much to say about the futureand the values of our Organization. The consolidation ofdemocracy in the societies that lived through thetotalitarian doctrines of this century is fundamental tosustaining this new vision of the United Nations.My country has always counted on the invaluablecooperation of the United Nations to complete a transitionprocess characterized by its complexity. The UnitedNations has accompanied us on our road from aNicaragua at war to a Nicaragua at peace; from aNicaragua divided and without democratic institutions toa new Nicaragua that today enjoys complete freedom. Thesame United Nations is accompanying us in the processof strengthening the advances made  with the benefits ofeconomic development.I would like to recall with special gratitude thevarious resolutions of this General Assembly  requestingMember States and international financial institutions tocontinue to lend their support to Nicaragua in a wider andmore flexible manner  taking into consideration theexceptional circumstances of our country.Nicaragua now faces the challenge of successfullyending the first stage of its transition process  givingspecial attention to overcoming dire poverty  to themodernization of its institutions and to the improvementof its productive capacity. Nicaragua is preparing to holdits next elections in 1996  thus taking a new step in theconsolidation of its democratic institutions. It is worthrecalling that six years ago this Organization  for the firsttime in its history  participated in observing elections  andthat happened in Nicaragua. Today I want to invite theUnited Nations to participate as an observer again  inthese new elections which will mark a transcendentalstage in our democratic process.These challenges make indispensable our continuingcollaboration with the United Nations system and withfriendly countries in establishing once and for all strongfoundations for economic and social development and fora lasting peace. The United Nations still has much to doin Nicaragua.20I would like to refer now to the subject of the reformof this Organization. We need to move forward urgently inthe matter of the democratization of the United Nations andall its main organs. In this endeavour Nicaragua fullysupports an increase in the number of members of theSecurity Council  in order to ensure the equitablerepresentation of all regional groups  among the permanentmembers as well as the non-permanent. In this context  wesupport the entry of Germany and Japan  countries that weare certain will make a significant contribution to theeffectiveness of the Security Council.We must redouble our efforts to promoteadministrative and budgetary reforms that will make ourOrganization more efficient. We consider it necessary tocontinue with the functional and organizationalstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council  whichshould maintain its role as the custodian of the economic social and cultural rights of Member States.We cannot speak of reforms in the United Nationswithout speaking of reforms in the General Assembly. TheAssembly must be revitalized  and it should coordinate itsactivities more closely with the other United Nationsorgans. The President of the Assembly should be givenmore specific tasks  in accordance with the newcircumstances I have already mentioned.There can be no reform of the United Nations withouta solution to the financial crisis through which theOrganization is passing. The continual budgetary problemsmust be examined in an honest  pragmatic way  since thecredibility of the Organization is at stake.We are convinced that the development programmewill be a strategy that is coherent  not only with the newvision of world development  but also with the goals andobjectives of the new or restored democracies. It isnecessary to have a creative programme for development with universal validity  which will combine assistance fordevelopment  trade  investments  the transfer of technologyand a reasonable solution to the problem of the debt and thenegative transfer of resources.One of the fundamental pillars of Nicaragua’s foreignpolicy is general and complete disarmament  nuclear as wellas conventional. Nicaragua is therefore concerned about therecent nuclear tests in the Pacific.Nicaragua is in solidarity with the 21 millioninhabitants of the Republic of China in Taiwan  and in thiscontext we call for resolution of the exceptional situation ofthe Republic of China through peaceful means  inaccordance with the principles of the peaceful resolutionof disputes between States and within the framework ofthe creation of an ad hoc committee of the GeneralAssembly.Nicaragua takes the opportunity once more to salutethe courage and determination of the South Africanpeople in the achievement of a new South Africa  unitedand non-racist.In Mozambique we hope that the process ofreconciliation will continue and that  finally  that patientbrother country will take the road to economic growthand development.Similarly  we hope that Angola will consolidate theestablishment of a strong and lasting peace  indispensablefor national reconciliation and reconstruction.As regards the Palestinian question and the MiddleEast  we are pleased with the positive and irreversibleevolution towards a just and lasting solution to theconflict. We warmly welcome the recent agreementsbetween Israel and Palestine.Our country continues to be alarmed by the situationin Somalia  Liberia and Rwanda  and considers thatgreater efforts are necessary on the part of theinternational community  and principally of the UnitedNations  to bring stability and peace to those countries.In Europe  in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina we are worried about the continuation of hostilities andhope for a peaceful solution to the conflict. TheNicaraguan Government greets with approval the JointStatement and Agreed Basic Principles  signed recently byBosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia and Yugoslavia.To end  I wish to say that today more than ever  onthe occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  Nicaragua and the majority of the peoples of theworld put our confidence in our Organization  since weconsider that the time has come for the United Nations toassume fully its responsibilities under the Charter.Nicaragua is ready  in its current conditions of peace andharmony  to support this new vision of the UnitedNations  also based on a new vision of democracy."
"122",5196,"NLD",50,1995,"It is a great pleasure forme to see you  Sir  presiding over this very importantsession of the General Assembly. As a politician with along and distinguished career  you are eminently qualifiedto guide us ably through the crucial coming months.It goes without saying that I fully endorse theintervention by Minister Solana on behalf of the EuropeanUnion. At this fiftieth anniversary session of the GeneralAssembly  I would like first of all to affirm the deepattachment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to theUnited Nations. The United Nations is the expression ofthe relatively new notion that nations and peopleanywhere in the world have the same rights and arebound by the same duties. For 50 years  this Organizationhas provided the basis for building a civilizedinternational community and we cannot afford to becynical about the United Nations.There is no alternative to the United Nations indealing with global challenges. It is up to us  the MemberStates  to make use of the Organization and to make itwork. This anniversary should be an occasion neither forself-congratulatory speeches nor for despondency. Rather it should inspire us to unite in a renewed effort to bringthe Organization into harmony with the demands of thetimes.In this age of instant communication and televisedimages  respect for human rights and solidarity amongnations can no longer be applied selectively. Aggression war crimes and massive violations of human rights  suchas those in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  trigger animmediate and massive response throughout the world. Itis impossible for people to remain indifferent to the fateof their fellow human beings anywhere — unless  ofcourse  they should be denied access to these means ofcommunication. However  the revolutionary growth ofcommunications has also created a gap between people’sdemands for action and the limited ability ofGovernments and organizations to satisfy these demands.The same observation applies to national decisionstouching on the security concerns of people in countriesaround the globe; and nowadays  these concerns includeenvironmental  ecological and all other aspects of humansecurity. Sovereignty has become restricted andcircumscribed because of new global interdependencies.It is an illusion to think that in this age States cancontinue to conduct their business in splendid isolationwithout regard for international public opinion andsensitivities. Again  as sovereignty becomes lessformidable a barrier and people organize themselvesfreely and globally in various ways  the need for global12regulation becomes more pressing. For this purpose  peoplelook to the United Nations. But can the United Nationsmeet these new demands?The crises in Bosnia and Rwanda illustrate the typesof conflict that at present pose the biggest threat to theinternational system. In many parts of the world ethnic racial and religious divides are resurfacing with avengeance. Where State structures are weak ordisintegrating  those divides may become battlegrounds forstruggles over land  water and other scarce resources.The response of the international community to thesepolitical and humanitarian emergencies has often beeninadequate  slow or hesitant. Lack of resolve in the earlystages of a crisis has forced Member States to scramblelater to close the gap between their acts and their wordsand to restore lost credibility. There is a certain tendency totake words for deeds and to be satisfied with words alone.Language is a currency whose value depends oncorresponding behaviour. For the United Nations to becredible  its language must be credible  and its language canonly be credible if it is matched by its deeds. These aresimple  basic rules  not only in banking but also in politics.Unfortunately  it can be convenient to forget these rules forreasons of political expediency. In such cases a higher pricemust be paid at a later stage.The war in former Yugoslavia is a tragedy for itspeople  but it also exemplifies the dangers threatening theinternational order. The fatal practice of “ethnic cleansing”has been unanimously condemned by the internationalcommunity. Those warnings have not been heeded  and themad dream of ethnic purity is still being pursued. Thepractice of “ethnic cleansing” has  moreover  set in motiona cycle of revenge and further violence.The end of the war may now come into sight  thanksto forceful international intervention and a shifting balanceon the ground. The current diplomatic initiative is designedto exploit this opportunity and finally to create conditionsfor true peace. We should do everything in our power toassist the negotiators in their mission. But for theinternational community  represented by the United Nations the question also remains of whether it should haveintervened earlier  and with greater decisiveness.Members of all the parties to this conflict have atvarious times committed crimes and breaches ofinternational law. But there is a difference in the scale ofhuman rights violations and criminal responsibility.The Bosnian Serb side has from the beginningresorted to “ethnic cleansing” and acts of terror againstthe civilian population as a systematic tool in itscampaign  and therefore its leaders carry primeresponsibility for initiating these practices.The latest and perhaps largest single crime wascommitted against the population of the former Bosnianenclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa. The victims were livingin areas declared safe by the Security Council. The Serbbehaviour has been condemned by the Security Council but the United Nations and its Member States cannotescape sharing some of the blame for not living up to theUnited Nations commitment. We  the Member States  hadconvinced ourselves — and what is more  our Bosnianprotégés — that a largely symbolic United Nationspresence would be sufficient to deter aggression. It didnot. We have been proved cruelly wrong  and as a resultthe populations of the enclaves paid a terrible price interms of human life and displacement at the hands of theBosnian Serbs. The Netherlands  whose small contingentof Blue Helmets was powerless to prevent the onslaughton Srebrenica  is deeply shocked by the massiveviolations of human rights which were committed by theSerb aggressors.We share the Security Council’s deep concern aboutthe fate of the former inhabitants of Srebrenica who havenot been accounted for. There are strong indications thatthousands were murdered in cold blood. It is a disgracethat the Bosnian Serbs have not honoured theircommitment to give immediate and full access torepresentatives of international organizations to investigatethe situation of those who are missing. In the interest ofthe credibility of any future peace agreement  we cannotacquiesce in the Bosnian Serb refusal to cooperate on thisand other human rights issues. We expect the same kindof cooperation from the Croat and Bosniac authoritieswith regard to verification of reports about human rightsviolations in areas under their control.If similar calamities are to be prevented in thefuture  we  the Security Council and the troopcontributors  must ensure that the operational aspects ofthe Council’s resolutions have a solid foundation inmilitary planning and available capabilities. This includesthe political will to use those capabilities when needed.Therefore  in the future no mandate should be given13before the means and the readiness for implementation areassured.Srebrenica and Zepa have also shown thathumanitarian action can never be a substitute for decisivemeasures against a party which perpetrates aggression andmassive human rights violations. Humanitarian assistance important though it undoubtedly is in itself  risks beingtainted in the eye of the public if it is perceived as asubstitute for decisive action going to the root of theproblem.In order to avoid the repetition of violent outbursts the seeds of future wars must be eliminated. These seedsoften lie in the ruthless exploitation of situations ofpotential conflict by unscrupulous politicians and localwarlords. To deter such action  justice must be done and beseen to be done.The establishment of the international criminalTribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda mayprove to be an important step in the right direction  and inmore than one respect. For the second time in history  afterNuremberg and Tokyo  the international community isholding individuals responsible for their actions duringwartime and in the initiation of war. So  hopefully  theblame for atrocities will not be put on entire peoples  whichwould call for massive revenge in the future  but on thosewho are personally and directly responsible. We hope thatthe creation of these Tribunals will prove to be a catalystfor the establishment of a permanent international criminalcourt.The question of United Nations credibility in Bosniaand Rwanda points to a broad range of issues related toUnited Nations reform in the domain of peace operations the structure and work methods of the Security Council finance and the economic and social area. Let me commentbriefly on each of these.At last year’s session of the General Assembly I notedthat a more rapid response by the United Nations mighthave prevented the genocide in Rwanda. My suggestionwas that in order to deal with emergencies like these weshould consider creating a permanent brigade which couldbe deployed almost instantly once the Security Council hadtaken a decision. In the months thereafter this idea wasexplored in a series of consultations in New York and at aninternational colloquium organized in the Netherlands.These discussions resulted in the Netherlands non-paper ona United Nations rapid deployment brigade  which wasdistributed to all Member States last April.But the idea of a United Nations brigade should beseen as a contribution to the wider debate on UnitedNations peace operations. The most logical manner toaddress the problem of rapid response would be  in myopinion  a small  standing United Nations force whichcould fill the time lag between a Security Councildecision and the deployment of national contingents.However  the Netherlands will support and activelycontribute to any proposal that represents an intermediatestep towards the longer-term objective of a UnitedNations force for rapid deployment.Against this background  we applaud the Canadianstudy on a United Nations rapid-reaction capability.Among other things  it recommends  as our colleague Mr.Ouellet pointed out  setting up a United Nations planningcell  which could function as a mobile headquarters andbe part of the vanguard concept. That is  it could be thenucleus of a force composed of national contingents underthe United Nations stand-by arrangements system. Wefully endorse this recommendation  which partly realizesthe idea I raised and in due course could lead to thecreation of a standing United Nations brigade. We shallbe in touch with other interested Member States in orderto coordinate practical suggestions with a view to possiblefurther political action.The continued viability of United Nations peaceoperations ultimately rests on the preservation of theirlegitimacy. This implies that the Security Council shouldbe made more responsive to the views of the UnitedNations membership at large. The transparency of theCouncil’s decision-making concerning peace operationshas already undergone noticeable improvements.Nevertheless  further adjustments are called for.Therefore  we support the creation of a mechanism for thediscussion of all aspects of peace operations with troopcontributors.The Assembly should address with the utmosturgency the critical financial situation of the UnitedNations. Without early agreement on financialcontributions  there can be no basis for the necessarybroad reforms. It is unacceptable that responsible MemberStates should carry the burden of making up for otherStates’ lack of financial discipline.These States are in contravention of the Charter which makes assessed contributions  once agreed  abinding obligation on Member States and  thus  ofinternational law. I strongly associate myself with theEuropean Union Presidency in calling upon Member14States to pay their contributions in full  on time and withoutconditions.The problem can be solved only if Member Statesparticipate actively in the current negotiations aimed atstrengthening and reforming United Nations financing andrefrain from unilateral actions. The Netherlands  for its part will participate constructively in efforts to arrive at asolution.The provision of the necessary resources would alsogive the United Nations the possibility of dealing moreeffectively with the promotion of the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples. But effective multilateral actionon socio-economic issues is not a matter only of financialresources. It will require new thinking on the future of theUnited Nations. The Secretary-General indicated the rightdirection last year  in “An Agenda for Development”  in hisanalysis of the five dimensions of development: peace economic growth  the environment  justice and democracy.A number of initiatives  some from within the Organizationand others  such as the Carlsson report  from outside  aimat strengthening  revitalizing and reforming the UnitedNations.The Netherlands recognizes the need for a thoroughdebate and early decisions on ways to improve theperformance and accountability of the United Nations. Wewelcome these initiatives  including the creation of theHigh-level Open-ended Working Group by the GeneralAssembly. I could imagine that three years from now  in1998  a ministerial conference could meet to agree on thebasis for the implementation of the High-level Group’sfindings.In the field of disarmament  the Netherlands attachesthe highest priority to the conclusion next year of acomprehensive test-ban treaty. In order to ensure that thenegotiations will reach this absolutely essential objective they should be given a strong political impulse.In this context  the Netherlands deplores the recentnuclear tests and fervently hopes that the othernuclear-weapon States will maintain their moratoriums. Adecision not to conduct any further tests would be of greatbenefit to the creation of a positive climate for theresumption of the negotiations and their successfulcompletion in 1996. Therefore  the Netherlands stronglyurges the nuclear-weapon States to desist from all furthertesting.Having said all this  I should like to close on a noteof hope and appreciation for what the United Nations hasdone and can continue to do in a number of veryimportant areas. I am thinking of the environment  thepopulation problem  human rights  the status of women democratization and social policy. In these areas  theUnited Nations is providing the infrastructure for theshaping and consolidation of a world-wide consensus andfor the practical realization of what this consensus isabout. Much of this happens through large-scaleconferences  with elaborate preparatory processesinvolving the various regions of the world and a widespectrum of both governmental and non-governmentalactors.The women’s Conference in Beijing is clear proof ofthe crucial role of these meetings in bringing about aglobal awareness of the issues at stake. These conferencesset norms and standards by which individuals and non-governmental organizations around the world can measurethe progress made by Governments and by the UnitedNations as a whole towards well-defined goals. Ifproperly implemented and monitored they can prove to bedecisive for the quality of life of future generations  andeven of our own  and for the credibility of ourOrganization."
"123",5241,"NOR",50,1995,"I wish first of all tocongratulate the President of the General Assembly uponhis election to his high office in the year of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. May I  at the same time extend my sincere thanks to the outgoing President  HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  for his excellent work.Fifty years ago  my countryman Trygve Lie becameSecretary-General of an Organization with a very modeststructure but with a “sacred mandate”  as he said in hisacceptance speech “to build a firm foundation for the peace of theworld”. (Official Records of the General Assembly First Session  Plenary Meetings  22nd meeting  p. 326)Since then  even greater demands have been made on theUnited Nations in terms of leadership  ideas  manpower andfinances. On the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary  wemust empower the United Nations to work with renewedvigour and effectiveness in promoting peace  human rights sustainable development  equality  justice and understandingamong peoples.Rather than being poised to take on new challenges however  the United Nations finds itself in a financial crisisof major proportions. The Secretary-General has recentlypointed out that the Organization is  in a technical sense insolvent — yes  bankrupt. Only prompt payment by asmall number of Member States has enabled it to continueto operate. The situation is more serious than ever beforebecause of the unprecedented amounts involved and the factthat one major contributor’s payment is being withheld andis expected to be unilaterally reduced in the years ahead.This desperate financial situation reflects theinadequate priority given to the United Nations by many ofits Members  which is in clear violation of their obligations.It may sound harsh  but  coming from a country whichconsistently pays $100 per capita to the United Nationssystem  I have difficulties in explaining to my ownelectorate that other rich countries are not even willing toprovide one tenth of that level.At the same time  I realize that the United Nationsassessment system should be reformed without delay.Moreover  experience has shown that the United Nationsitself needs to be reformed  restructured and modernized.Norway wholeheartedly supports the reform processlaunched to strengthen the United Nations system andmake it more representative and effective. This shouldinclude expansion of the membership of the SecurityCouncil and increased transparency of its methods ofwork.To meet the twin challenges of peace and sustainabledevelopment  the United Nations and its Member Statesshould proceed along five parallel paths.First  we must help increase local and regionalcapacity to handle conflict situations. For instance African countries have signalled via the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) that they are prepared to take on alarger share of the responsibility for solving their ownproblems. In response  Norway will cooperate withpartners in Southern Africa in building up standbyreserves of qualified personnel for peace operations underUnited Nations or OAU auspices.Secondly  more nations must be willing to contributeto the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Traditionaltroop contributors do not have the capacity to provide allthe personnel that will be needed in future peace-keepingmissions aimed at solving disputes  protecting localpopulations and providing humanitarian assistance. Boththe United Nations and the traditional troop-contributingcountries must assist potential troop contributors withcompetence-building measures  just as the Nordiccountries are now assisting the Baltic States.Thirdly  the rapid-reaction and standby capability ofthe United Nations must be improved. Norway isprepared to join in efforts to develop new  much-neededinstruments to deal quickly and effectively with crisissituations. The rapid-reaction capability must also includehumanitarian assistance. The United Nations shouldcontinue to play a central role in coordinatinghumanitarian relief efforts.Norway has given high priority to measures thatenable us to respond expeditiously to requests forassistance. We have established an effective preparedness10system for emergency assistance that covers both personneland matériel. Emergency equipment can be airborne within24 hours. Experienced personnel can be in the field within72 hours. In Rwanda  a fully equipped field hospital accompanied by the necessary personnel  was recentlydelivered at short notice to the United Nations  inaccordance with these procedures. With a view toimproving the United Nations response to supportrequirements  Norway has offered to provide facilities fora United Nations medical depot where medical equipmentand supplies for peace-keeping and humanitarian operationscan be stored and maintained.Fourthly  we must put even greater emphasis onconflict-prevention measures. The international communitymust be present in unstable areas and must provideeconomic incentives  mediation expertise and human rightsmonitors. Conflict prevention is the most effective way ofusing limited resources. Norway will continue to shoulderits share of the responsibility — for instance  in Guatemala where we are actively involved in the peace process together with the other members of the Group of Friends.Norway has established a special human-resource bank forhuman rights and democracy  which is able  at short notice to offer experts to assist countries and peoples in theirefforts to build democratic societies.The international community must be prepared to actdecisively when atrocities are committed. Serious crimesshould be prosecuted by an international criminal tribunal.The establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals in the formerYugoslavia and Rwanda has provided momentum for theefforts to establish a permanent court. The tribunal’s roleshould be limited to cases where national jurisdiction isunavailable or ineffective.Fifthly  on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary  wecall on the United Nations to take a decisive lead inpromoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.Efforts to improve global security must address the issuesof economic growth  development and poverty  whileensuring that the use of natural resources is kept within thecarrying capacity of the Earth. The United Nations mustbecome a driving force for sustainable development.The United Nations is the only forum with a mandateto tackle the truly global problems affecting theenvironment and the sustainable management of naturalresources. Let me offer some brief examples. TheConference on Straddling Fish Stocks provided aninvaluable contribution to the management of fisheryresources. We are also pleased that  just a few days ago  theUnited Nations Panel on Forests was able to take the firststeps to protect  preserve and manage the world’s forestsin a sustainable manner.I would like to stress the need for a concerted effortwithin the United Nations system to ensure that theresults from the major conferences in Cairo  Copenhagenand Beijing on  respectively  population  socialdevelopment and women actually become translated intolaw and realities  locally  nationally and at theinternational level.With a growing world population  we have witnessedthe spread of the gravest insult to human dignity —poverty. Our inability to eradicate poverty haunts ourcommon conscience. As long as the gap between rich andpoor  whether between States or within States  continuesto widen  we cannot claim to be on the right track. If weare to alleviate poverty  both donors and recipients mustmake more resources available for social welfareactivities. At least 20 per cent of development assistancebudgets and national budgets of recipient countries shouldbe allocated to the social sector.The conflict in the former Yugoslavia is far frombeing solved  even though the prospects for a negotiatedsolution now appear much better than they did untilrecently. Norway welcomes the agreement on basicprinciples which resulted from the Geneva meeting on8 September. The United States of America deservespraise for its persistent efforts in this regard. It is vitallyimportant that the members of the internationalcommunity  in particular the contact group countries continue their common approach to the solution of thecrisis. In this context  the United Nations and theEuropean Union mediators can make a valuablecontribution.The success of the mediation efforts depends entirelyon the readiness of the parties to compromise. Westrongly urge all the parties to show flexibility andrestraint  and to refrain from attempting to obtain furtheradvantages on the battlefield. Special attention must begiven to displaced persons  who  whenever possible  mustbe allowed to repossess their homes.The time has come to start reflecting on thereconstruction of that war-devastated region. This willrequire a sustained international effort. The UnitedNations system together with the European Union andothers must play a leadership role in coordinatingprograms in various fields  such as economic11reconstruction  humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees democracy-building and human rights. Local leaders havea heavy responsibility to prevent a new arms race  humanrights abuses and the renewal of tensions in the area.Norway will continue to support the process of buildingpeace and prosperity in the former Yugoslavia.I call on the General Assembly to lend its full andundivided support to the peace process in the Middle East.The new interim agreement is a significant and necessaryfollow-up to the Oslo agreement. Today we salute oncemore the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders for theircourage and determination. As Chairman of the Ad HocLiaison Committee to coordinate donor activities  I stronglyurge the donors to continue to support — for some donors to increase their support of — the Middle East peaceprocess by providing economic assistance to the Palestinianpeople. Our common interest in peace in the Middle Eastis the best argument for heavy economic support to thePalestinian areas.Nuclear testing is a threat to our search for commonsecurity and to the environment  and should be banned. Wedeeply deplore the Chinese and French tests  which we fearmay complicate the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on acomprehensive test ban treaty. We would once again urgeall nuclear-weapon States to refrain from further nucleartesting during the negotiations and until the treaty entersinto force.Land-mines are among the most insidious weapons incommon use. They cause indiscriminate and widespreadsuffering and continue to spread terror for years or evendecades after hostilities have ended. We call for a total banon the production  stockpiling  trade and use ofanti-personnel land-mines. In the absence of such a ban  weurge all countries to adhere to the United Nations 1980inhumane-weapons Convention. No strengthening of theland-mine Protocol will be effective unless adherence to itbecomes universal.Finally  let us seize the opportunity offered by thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to renew oursupport for the United Nations and its aims. Each and everyone of us must help to ensure that the United Nationsbecomes what we need and what future generations havethe right to expect: an effective tool to harness our strengthand unite us in maintaining peace  promoting socialprogress and protecting human dignity."
"124",5287,"NPL",50,1995,"I wish first of all  on behalf ofthe delegation of Nepal and on my own behalf  tocongratulate His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaralon his election as President of the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. He has been asked to guide ourdeliberations at a time of historic importance. Hisdemonstrated abilities  experience and wisdom are anassurance for us that we have made the right choice. Iassure him of the full cooperation of my delegation as heperforms his duties.I should like also to express my appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister of Foreign Affairs ofCôte d’Ivoire  for the excellent manner in which he steeredthe work of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.May I also greet the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to whom I wish toconvey the gratitude of His Majesty’s Government of Nepalfor his tenacious and tireless efforts for peace. Since hiselection to the office of Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali has succeeded in large measure in giving shape toUnited Nations debates through his proposals in theAgendas for Peace and for Development. We also share hisvision for better management of the Organization. As afunctional democracy with widened commitment to humanrights and justice  we await with great interest his Agendafor Democracy. These will be the areas of concern of theUnited Nations in the years to come.We are meeting here at a very important juncture. TheUnited Nations is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary  inpreparation for our march into the next century. Thisprompts us to do some new soul-searching about what kindof world we want to shape and what role we want theUnited Nations to play in it. These questions do not lendthemselves to easy answers  but together  at this moment we can begin the search.Fifty years ago the United Nations came into beingwith a mission: to maintain international peace andsecurity  to forge friendly relations amongst nations andpeoples  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rightsand to promote economic and social progress in largerfreedom. Despite the immediate onset of the cold war andthe resultant debilitating Power rivalry  the United Nationshas since remained actively engaged in fulfilling themission. It has had a great impact on the democratizationof international relations. Its efforts to promote economicand social development have borne fruit. No lessimportant has been its role in the broadening andstrengthening of international law. By helping toaccelerate the decolonization process and ensuring thepeoples’ right to self-determination  it has facilitated theemergence of many independent nations worldwide. Norcan we forget the Organization’s contribution to the fightagainst apartheid. Today  South Africa has emerged as ademocratic  non-racial nation — yet another proudMember of the world body  whose goal of universality ofmembership is near attainment. My delegation extends itsheartiest welcome and congratulations to our newestfellow Member  Palau.The world is undergoing a transformation ofmonumental proportions  generating fresh hopes andaspirations for peoples all over the world. The pace ofdemocratic reforms continues to surge and so do concernsfor the protection and promotion of human rights andindividual freedoms. A more liberal world-trade regime istaking shape. Economic interdependence is beingacknowledged as a fact of international life. The logic ofconfrontation is increasingly giving way to the logic ofconciliation and cooperation throughout the world. Webelieve that now is the time for us to seize this new-foundopportunity to make the Charter’s goal of attaining aworld of peace  prosperity  equality and justiceirrevocable and timeless.These positive developments notwithstanding  we arestill far from universal peace. Conflicts of enormouscruelty continue to plague the world. The scourge of warstill brings untold sorrow to large segments of mankind.We have witnessed  day in and day out  hundreds andthousands of innocent people falling victim to hostilitiesand the all-but-forgotten phenomena of “ethnic cleansing”and genocide. Thousands more are dying of starvation17and disease. Similarly  thousands are being forced to leavetheir homelands as refugees in different parts of the world.Bosnia and Herzegovina  Somalia and Rwanda present aterrifying picture of what has taken place. These appallingsituations challenge the ability of the United Nations and itsMember States not only to maintain peace and security  butalso to secure a minimum of basic human decency andneeds.That having been said  let me hasten to add that thedisappointments we experience are not solely the results ofthe Organization’s failure  but are basically the reflection ofa fast-changing global environment in which ourexpectations were unusually high. The United Nations wascalled upon to deal with situations for which it was notpolitically and logistically prepared. We take comfort in thefact that for every failed peace operation there have beennumerous others of which we can be justly proud and inwhich  but for a United Nations presence  the fatalitieswould have been vastly greater. The United Nations hashelped bring peace to Angola  Cambodia  El Salvador Haiti  Mozambique and Namibia. Even in the territories ofthe former Yugoslavia  the real good the United Nationshas done is being appreciated now. The 8 September peaceplan advanced by the Contact Group of five Powers andaccepted in principle by the concerned parties is a beaconof light at the end of the tunnel. My delegation supports theGeneva agreement on the principles of a settlement basedon the territorial integrity of the States of the formerYugoslavia within internationally recognized borders.My delegation also notes with great satisfaction notonly that the peace process in the Middle East is gainingmomentum  but that it has become irreversible. The signingof the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Washington on 28September by Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat in the presence of President Clinton  King Hussein ofJordan and President Mubarak of Egypt  is a turning pointin the history of the Middle East. Nepal earnestly hopesthat talks will soon resume between Israel and Syria andbetween Israel and Lebanon so that a just and lasting peace as envisaged by the United Nations  can be guaranteedthroughout the region.The return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haitihas been a gain for the United Nations and democracy. Theprocess of peace-building and strengthening of democracyis taking hold in that country. My country is proud to be apart of this process through our participation in the UnitedNations Mission in Haiti.In its primary function of maintaining internationalpeace and security  the United Nations has peace-keepingoperations as an important tool for conflict resolution. Mycountry has a long history of participation in these peaceefforts. From the United Nations Observation Group inLebanon in 1958 through the United Nations EmergencyForce  the United Nations Operation in Somalia andseveral others to the current United Nations ProtectionForce in the former Yugoslavia  the United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon and the Mission in Haiti  Nepalhas committed its troops  military observers and civilianpolice personnel to United Nations peace initiatives. Manyof our peace-keepers have laid down their lives in theperformance of their duties. I stand here today to reaffirmNepal’s continued response to any call for a contributionto the peace efforts of the United Nations.Peace-keeping operations have of late becomemultifunctional. Their functions have extended beyond thetraditional role of monitoring cease-fire and truceagreements. They have been drawn into multifarious reliefand humanitarian duties in excessively difficult anddangerous situations. Because of a lack of clarity inmandates and the absence of contingency plans andreinforcements  which should have been clearly foreseen not only have our Blue Helmets been forced to standaside as the posts they were manning were overrun: theyhave also been held hostage  chained and humiliated intheir dignity as men and soldiers. Such sorry spectaclesshould not be seen again. The mandates for the newgeneration of peace-keeping operations must be clearlydefined. Above all  it is essential that the capacity of theUnited Nations to serve the interests of peace in a timelyfashion be increased. In this connection  I should like toreiterate my delegation’s support for the initiativeconcerning the stand-by forces to be made available to theUnited Nations within pre-agreed response times for anynew or expanded peace-keeping operation.In the final analysis  peace-keeping operations areonly a temporary arrangement. Real solutions lie ingetting at the root of the problem  which can best beovercome by promoting economic development protecting human rights  securing social justice andaffirming democratic principles. Without real progress inthese areas  international peace and security will remainan unattainable goal. It is therefore imperative to restorethe balance between the United Nations political andmilitary activities and its economic and socialprogrammes.18The 1990s have often been described as a period ofunprecedented changes marked by the end of the cold war the cessation of Power rivalries  economic globalization andinterdependence  a greater flow of capital  goods andservices  and the widespread dissemination of ideas througha revolution in communications. A huge peace dividendwas expected to accrue to the global economy. But thesehopes have been dashed because the condition of theneediest countries  including the least developed and land-locked  has actually declined in the past five years. Aconstructive dialogue and partnership between developedand developing countries based on a mutuality of interests interdependence and shared responsibility has notmaterialized. Many developing countries have carried outpainful structural reforms but the socio-economic outlookhas not been encouraging for them. Ironically  even the newworld trade regime  promising fresh trade and developmentopportunities for many countries  will have an adverseimpact on the economies of the least developed ifsubstantial corrective measures are not taken in time.A number of important conferences in recent yearshave underlined both the inadequacies and the promises ofinternational cooperation. Agenda 21 of the Rio Conferenceon Environment and Development remains largely on paperfor want of necessary resources. The central role of humanbeings in development was affirmed last year by theInternational Conference on Population and Development.The Copenhagen World Summit for Social Developmentrecognized three interrelated concerns of the UnitedNations: poverty  unemployment and the disintegration ofsocieties. The Fourth World Conference on Women  inBeijing last month  sought to address the basic Charterprinciple of absolute equality between men and women inthe contemporary world order.Individual human beings and the improvement of theirlots are at the centre of all development  as is emphasizedso eloquently by the Secretary-General in his Agenda forDevelopment. Peace  economic growth  the environment justice and democracy are now recognized to be the fiveintegral dimensions of development. Greater resources andpolitical will are urgently needed to transform our promisesand commitments into action. Strengthening rather thanweakening the principal development arms of the UnitedNations  such as the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Children’s Fund  the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development and theUnited Nations Population Fund; a reformed Economic andSocial Council; reforms within the United Nationsstructures; and increased cooperation between the UnitedNations bodies and Bretton Woods institutions are key to anew approach to meaningful international developmentcooperation in the next half century of the UnitedNations.The last decade of the century has also opened upexciting possibilities to prevent the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and to decelerate the armsrace. As host to the United Nations Regional Centre forPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  Nepalhas been a strong consistent believer in institutionalarrangements for the strengthening of the worlddisarmament campaign. We believe in international regional and subregional dialogues for the enhancementof openness  transparency and confidence-building and forthe promotion of disarmament and security. The majorfocus of disarmament measures in 1995 was the Reviewand Extension Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty held in New York in April-May. Notonly did the Conference strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime by extending the Treaty for anindefinite period  it also adopted a widely hailed packageof decisions  emphasizing the need for the establishmentof a comprehensive disarmament regime to meet thesecurity concerns of all countries through the fulfilmentof commitments undertaken by the nuclear-weapon States.These commitments include the speedy conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty  legally binding securityassurances to non-nuclear-weapon States against the useor threat of use of nuclear weapons  the unimpeded non-discriminatory transfer of nuclear technology for peacefulpurposes  a cut-off in the production of fissile materialsfor weapons purposes and the eventual elimination of allnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Wetherefore express our deep disappointment at theresumption of nuclear testing. We sincerely hope thatthese series of tests will not impede the conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty in 1996.Nepal also extends its support for initiatives for acomplete ban on chemical  biological and other inhumaneweapons such as anti-personnel mines. I wish here topoint out that in the post-Second World War era  morethan these categories of weapons  conventional weaponshave caused the most misery to mankind. Theconsideration of conventional weapons should also be apriority of United Nations efforts. May I take thisopportunity to reiterate our position as to the utilization ofthe resources released by disarmament measures fordevelopment  particularly in developing countries.19It is entirely proper that the approach of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations should have spurred avariety of serious studies on the future of the Organization.Among these  the consensus resolution prepared andnegotiated by the President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session on the strengthening of the UnitedNations system is of great relevance at the present time.While high-level working groups have been patiently busypreparing recommendations to improve the financialsituation of the United Nations and concerning theexpansion of the Security Council  Nepal believes more ina coordinated and integrated approach to making ourOrganization more efficient  effective and adaptable to thechanging times.There appears to be universal recognition that theSecurity Council  the principal organ of the United Nationsprimarily responsible for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  should more fully reflect the realities ofthe contemporary world.The perpetuation of exclusive rights may not bejustified  especially without the proper accommodation ofother pressing considerations. There is undoubted consensuson the need for an increase in membership. If an increasehas to be effected in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories  the basic principles of regional and democraticrepresentation should not be vitiated. In the selection ofmembers of the Security Council  due regard should ofcourse be specifically paid to the contribution of MemberStates to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. However  particular consideration should be givento ensuring that no region should be under-represented orunrepresented  and that a minimum of balance is maintainedin the overall membership between the industrial North andthe developing South.It is painful to see the United Nations afflicted withfinancial problems. In our view  this is not due to faultyassessment systems. The non-payment of acceptedobligations is largely to blame. The present deficit of morethan three and half billion dollars amounts in fact to morethan three times the regular budget of the Organization.While we are prepared for a review of the currentassessment systems based on the doctrine of capacity topay  and while we believe that no one country should beasked to assume excessive burdens  we urge that MemberStates pay their dues on time. We note that the Secretary-General has been forced to resort to cross-funding ofregular budget deficits from the peace-keeping budget. Thisis obviously not fair to troop-contributing nations  many ofwhich are developing countries. The withholding of thereimbursements due to them shifts the burden from richcountries to poorer ones.In conclusion  I wish to touch briefly on the regionalcooperation activities taking place in the South Asianregion. The South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC) will celebrate its tenth anniversaryin December this year. Through the medium of SAARC Nepal is pursuing a policy of promoting regionalcooperation in a pragmatic and result-oriented manner.We have identified and are engaged in various areas ofcooperation  from the suppression of terrorism to fightingdrug abuse and trafficking  from environmentalpreservation to poverty alleviation. The South AsianPreferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA)  which isentering into force this year  is one of our importantregional cooperation measures. Nepal looks forward toworking together with our regional partners with greatervigour and determination to bring about regional peace stability  progress and cooperation."
"125",5351,"NZL",50,1995,"May I first take thisoccasion to congratulate Ambassador Diogo Freitas doAmaral of Portugal on his election to the presidency ofthe Assembly in this important fiftieth anniversary year.I should also like to offer a special welcome toPalau as the one hundred eighty-fifth Member. Palau’saccession does signal honour to us as a fellow PacificState.Here today I want to talk about making our globalneighbourhood a safer place for all of us; the progressthat has been made in the years since the end of the coldwar  and what still needs to be done. Memories are short;it is hard to recall the degree of mutual suspicion thatcoloured global politics just a few years ago.We have made great strides in recent times. Theworld community has achieved much in its efforts tomake the world safer  and more stable. But we need tomove on to reinforce our achievements in controlling reducing and abolishing the horrific weapons of massdestruction. We have yet to see the dividend we allexpected to flow from the end of the cold war.The transition to a post-cold-war world is not easy.We are painfully aware of that. In recent years though we have been encouraged to believe that a new worldorder was achievable. One of the reasons for this hope this optimism  was that the nuclear scourge had receded.For the first time in 50 years nuclear Powers werecommitted to build down rather than to build up  todecommission and destroy rather than to commission andconstruct.However  recent events have cast a cloud over thatbrief period of optimism. New Zealand does not believe18that continued nuclear testing  wherever it takes place contributes to a safer world. On the contrary  nucleartesting sends the wrong message to States which do possessor which aspire to the possession of nuclear weapons. Italso tells them that the development of these weapons isstill acceptable.The nuclear tests which have taken place since theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons wasextended have disturbed the delicate balance achieved atthat Conference. New Zealand believed then  and continuesto believe  that indefinite extension was the right option.The world needs a strong non-proliferation regime  one thatcannot be called into question by changing globalcircumstances. But the Conference went further than that the vast majority of participants making it very clear thatthey were against nuclear testing. They also wanted tomove towards the nuclear-free world envisaged in article VIof the Treaty. The cavalier disregard  and dismissal of theviews of the many  has led to considerable disillusionment.It will take a long time to restore the trust that had beenthere.New Zealand and the rest of the South Pacific regionhave long stood tall and proud in opposition to nuclearweapons and their testing. We abhor testing wherever itoccurs. But the decision to resume testing in what we seeas our home region has particularly angered the people ofNew Zealand. The leaders of the South Pacific Forumnations expressed their outrage at their meeting just twoweeks ago. They were able to recall the painful memoriesin the region  going back to atmospheric testing conductedbetween 25 and 50 years ago.The South Pacific has not been alone in its oppositionto nuclear testing. Governments  parliamentarians andpeoples from every region of the world have spoken up inanger  alarm and dismay. The two Governments which arecontinuing to test nuclear weapons must heed the voice ofthe international community. They are dancing to a tune noone wants to hear.In these circumstances  New Zealand  along with arepresentative group of like-minded States  will submit anappropriate draft resolution to the First Committee of thisAssembly.Testing is a backward step  and I condemn it. It is nottoo late. All that China and France need to do is listen tointernational opinion and announce that their testingprogrammes have ceased.I want to welcome the commitment by three of thenuclear-weapon States — France  the United Kingdomand the United States — to a genuine ban on nucleartesting: a prohibition on any nuclear explosions  no matterhow small. This is what we have always called for: acomprehensive ban — where the word “comprehensive”means just that. We are pleased that it is attracting serioussupport.New Zealand calls on the two nuclear-weapon Statesthat have not yet indicated full support for this approachto do so quickly. Time is short. The deadline for thenegotiations is 1996  and the international community isholding the Conference on Disarmament accountable formeeting that deadline and producing a treaty that isgenuinely comprehensive in scope.In this regard  the General Assembly has becomeincreasingly concerned about the lack of accountability inthe Conference on Disarmament. Limited andunrepresentative membership has been a large part of theproblem. Enlargement is long overdue. New Zealandwelcomes the progress made in recent weeks in Geneva and we express our gratitude to Morocco for its efforts inthis regard.However  the real test will be whether by the timewe meet here again next year the new members will havebeen able to take their seats. For the moment  theoutcome is still not satisfactory. I recall that democraticrepresentation was once at the heart of a tea party inBoston. Let us hope that there will not be a tea party inNew York in 1996 on membership of the Conference onDisarmament.I also urge the members of the Conference onDisarmament to look beyond the conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty. New Zealand wants to seean international agreement banning the production offissile material for nuclear weapons. That would beanother important step towards negotiations on the totalelimination of nuclear weapons. We urge the Conferenceon Disarmament to resolve its procedural differences andget the negotiations under way.I should add that at the Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons we raised the idea ofnegotiating an agreement to ban the future production ofnuclear weapons. That could take us a step closer toeliminating the nuclear threat.19But it is also important to address the issues relatingto conventional weapons.I wish  first  to address the issue of land-mines. I wantto congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff for theway they have picked up this issue and raised publicawareness around the world. The Conference organized inGeneva this year was most timely — but more is needed.Both financial and technical resources need to be madeavailable to help dispose of the millions of treacherous life-and livelihood-destroying mines that have already been laid.I pledge New Zealand’s ongoing assistance in this work.Of course  disposal alone is not the answer. Urgentprogress needs to be made to deal with these hideousweapons  which go on claiming the lives of innocentpeople — farmers  their children  shopkeepers  collectors ofwood  carriers of water — long after conflicts have ceased.I ask all the participants at the Conference which openedthis week in Vienna  which has as its main aim the revisionof international law on land-mines  to work together toachieve the tightest possible restrictions on these totallyindiscriminate weapons. I want to work to eliminate thementirely from the world’s armouries.This leads one to the broader questions of armstransfers. We are profoundly disturbed at the unnecessaryand irrational increase in arms transfers. At a time when globally  resources are desperately needed for development for the environment  for health  why is it that even modestmeasures  such as enhancing the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms are still being resisted?Neither peace nor development is advanced if Statesput increasingly scarce economic resources into the defencesectors of their economies. Far too much of the globaleconomic capacity is going into armaments when thecitizens of the world desperately need better health  bettereducation and a better future for their children.The widespread availability of conventional arms andthe resurgence of ethnic nationalism have  together produced a very dangerous cocktail  which poses a majorthreat to stability in the post-cold-war era. The need forMember States to maintain a collective approach inaddressing these challenges has never been greater.Events in the former Yugoslavia over the past yearhave presented an enormous challenge to the internationalcommunity. New Zealand fully supported the firm responsemade by this Organization and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to the murderous shelling of Sarajevo late inAugust. The diplomatic efforts now under way  includingthe very important constitutional agreement reached lastTuesday  offer some prospect for bringing to an endalmost four years of a most appalling conflict.Some have been dismissive of the achievements ofthe United Nations in the former Yugoslavia. That however  is to overlook the saving of tens of thousands oflives and the substantial relief of suffering. This is whyNew Zealand  despite its geographical distance from theregion  has been willing to play its part. I believe that one day  the United Nations mission in Bosnia will enjoyrecognition of the successes it has achieved so far.It is a little too easy to focus on the problems of theUnited Nations. We need to remember its successes aswell. I think of Cambodia and Mozambique  of ElSalvador and Haiti  of Namibia and Angola and of thecontributions to peace in various parts of the Middle Eastover the years. Even in Somalia  where a politicalsettlement proved elusive  massive famine was relievedthanks to the United Nations.The United Nations is unique. It is called on to dealwith the most intractable problems — the ones that othersput into the “too hard” basket. And it works under theclosest public scrutiny of Governments and the world’smedia.New Zealand strongly supports practical steps toimprove peace-keeping management. We have  in fact provided additional specialist personnel to the Departmentof Peace-keeping Operations at our own expense. Wehave contributed to the strengthening of the Secretariat’scapacity in the demining area. And we shall continuethese commitments because we believe that they are sonecessary. We also entered into the United Nationsstand-by arrangements earlier this year  and we hope thatthese will provide a clearer focus for peace-keeping andits planning.We have also studied with interest the Secretary-General’s recommendation  in his Supplement to “AnAgenda for Peace”  that the United Nations shouldconsider the idea of a rapid-deployment force. I wish tocommend the ground-breaking work that has already beendone by Canada  the Netherlands  Denmark and others.My discussions yesterday with Ministers from these andother countries were encouraging to me. Progress can andshould be made in this area.20At about this time last year I spoke to the GeneralAssembly about a number of elements that I considercritical to the conduct of peace-keeping operations. Theseincluded a sustainable financial system  transparent politicalaccountability  clear objectives  a credible legal regime thatguarantees the security of United Nations personnel and  ofcourse  the availability of resources so that objectives canbe met quickly and efficiently.Progress has been made. We were especially pleasedto see the Convention on the Safety of United NationsPersonnel opened for signature during last year’s session.We urge those that have not signed it to do so  and soon.We owe that to the thousands who have served  and areserving  in the United Nations operations worldwide.The improved procedures for consultation between theSecurity Council and troop contributors  initiated byArgentina and New Zealand  have now been in place foralmost a year. Pleasing as this is  we still have some wayto go. It is up to those of us who contribute troops toUnited Nations operations to ensure there is no slippage inthese procedures.Regrettably  however  we do not appear to have asustainable financial system. I am gravely concerned that despite all the warnings here in this Assembly last year delegations have not made any real progress in the WorkingGroup addressing the financial crisis. The UnitedNations — this United Nations — ran out of cash in mid-August. The arrears of Member States in respect of theregular and peace-keeping budgets have reachedunprecedented levels. It is nothing short of a tragedy thaton the eve of our celebration of the fiftieth anniversary  theUnited Nations  this body of ours  is on the verge ofbankruptcy.At this critical point in the United Nations history  weneed political will  not more words. “Words pay no debts” as Shakespeare wrote. We need new ideas  not recycledplatitudes. And  above all  Members must pay their dues on time  and in full.We do stand here at a crossroads. In taking stock ofthe United Nations 50 years  we have much on which toreflect. There have been good times  and there have beenbad times. Reform and revitalization must stay on ourminds. I wish to assure you  Sir  and all other members  ofNew Zealand’s commitment to help remould theOrganization to that which will be needed to work for allof us as we head towards the twenty-first century."
"126",5396,"OMN",50,1995,"At the outset allow me  onbehalf of my country’s delegation  to congratulate Mr.Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidencyof this important session of the General Assembly. Hisunanimous election to this high office attests to the role thathis friendly country  Portugal  with which my country hasenjoyed centuries of ties  plays in the international arena.His election is also testimony to his ability and widediplomatic experience which  we are sure  will enable theGeneral Assembly to achieve the results we hope for.I should also like to take this opportunity to payspecial tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  theForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire  for the skill andconstructive manner in which he steered the work of theforty-ninth session.The convening of this session coincides with thefiftieth anniversary of the international community’sagreement to establish the United Nations in order tosafeguard international peace and security after theexperience of two world wars. We are aware of thesignificant role that the United Nations has played eversince the end of the Second World War in maintaining thebalance between the world Powers during what was knownas the cold war era. That outstanding role of the UnitedNations was at the heart of the international cooperationthat was given concrete form in enabling the peoples of thethird world  with the help of the United Nations  to freethemselves from the shackles of colonialism in Africa  Asiaand South America. The United Nations bodies andspecialized agencies helped the newly independent States toorganize their socio-economic resources thanks to thepersistent efforts of the Secretaries-General who headed theSecretariat and the respective Executive Secretaries of thespecialized agencies. Here it is only fitting to rememberMr. Dag Hammarskjöld  the Organization’s secondSecretary-General  who gave his life while working onbehalf of the United Nations in the Congo in 1961. Weshould also remember those who were at the helm of theSecretariat beside Mr. Hammarskjöld — Mr. Trygve Lie the first Secretary-General  U Thant  Mr. Kurt Waldheim Mr. Jávier Perez de Cuéllar and the current Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros- Ghali — who have allplayed a significant role in strengthening mutualunderstanding amongst nations and helped the world tofind peaceful solutions to its conflicts.The history of the United Nations is full of manyother figures who played an important role in promotingits march and in serving international peace and security.By way of example I mention Count Bernadotte  theInternational Peace Mediator in Palestine; General Burns the Commander of the International Emergency Force inthe Middle East; Mr. Gunnar Jarring  the InternationalPeace Mediator between the Arabs and Israelis after thewar of 1967; Mr. James Grant  the late Executive Directorof the United Nations Children’s Fund; Sadruddin AgaKhan  the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees for many years; the late Olaf Palme  formerPrime Minister of Sweden; the late Willy Brandt  formerChancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany;Mr. Brian Urquhart  the former Under-Secretary-Generalfor Political Affairs; and many other brilliant figures whoworked tirelessly and faithfully in these corridors.We should also like to mention in particular thegreat achievements of the United Nations in theframework of its specialized agencies. Nobody can denythe achievements of these agencies in their respectivefields of competence such as food and agriculture  scienceand education  civil aviation  architecture  reconstruction health  postal services and telecommunications meteorology  intellectual property  development  theliberalization of trade  not to mention the brilliantachievements of the humanitarian and developmentorganizations such as the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP)  United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF)  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) and the UnitedNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugeesin the Near East (UNRWA) as well as the remarkablerole played by the other relevant regional organizationsand committees within the framework of the UnitedNations.These achievements constitute part of the rich assetsaccumulated by the United Nations over the 50 years thathave elapsed since it was established with the aim ofmaintaining international peace and security. We believe18that although the Organization has come a long way inlaying the foundations of international peace and security global peace in its broadest sense has yet to be achieved.Therefore  it is incumbent upon us all to support the UnitedNations in its forward movement in that direction so thatthe edifice of peace and international security may becompleted and maintained.The establishment of the World Trade Organization(WTO) with the aim of organizing and coordinating worldtrade  eliminating the obstacles that obstruct access toforeign markets and encouraging the movement of capitaland investment is another milestone on the way towardsconsolidating the edifice of international peace and security.The WTO should receive every support from theinternational community. The agreement on itsestablishment under the auspices of the United Nationsshould be an incentive and a challenge to the developingcountries to promote the level of their economic and socialdevelopment  increase their productive capacity and upgradethe level of their services in order for them to qualify tointegrate their interests with those of the developedcountries.By the same token  the establishment of the WTOwith the aim of achieving international economic balanceon a basis of justice  equality and sustainable development in no way remits the developed countries’ obligationstowards supporting and assisting the developing countriesin working for that integration of their economies with theeconomies of the developed countries. As a matter of fact those obligations are stipulated in the WTO agreement.In the context of the United Nations action toconsolidate the foundations of international peace andsecurity  the Organization has managed  after 14 years ofstrenuous efforts  to conclude the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. The entry intoforce of that Convention on 16 November 1994 is butanother example of international cooperation in order toestablish an equitable  just international order to govern theocean space. Also  the recent efforts in this context withregard to Part XI of this important international Conventionwill no doubt enhance its universality.In the area of disarmament  the United Nations hasperformed an outstanding role  even at the height of thecold war  as evinced by the signing of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The signingby more than 159 States of the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction isyet another historic United Nations achievement. TheConvention was the first to deal with the elimination ofthis category of overkill weapons on a global scale. Itpaved the way for agreement on the elimination of allother weapons of mass destruction.As regards the protection of the environment  theinternational community has witnessed the dedication ofworld leaders at the 1992 Rio Conference to the task ofhalting the degradation of the environment. The UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change  theConvention on Biological Diversity and Agenda 21 thatresulted from this unique Conference have laid thefoundations of a world partnership that addresses theproblems of desertification  poverty and the degradationof the ecosystem which arise from the unrestrained use ofnatural resources.All these conventions and programmes have gone onthe record book as uncontested achievementsaccomplished by the United Nations. Such achievementsapart  however  the United Nations has proved to beunable to cope with regional political issues that haveinternational dimensions and are closely related to risksthat could jeopardize international peace and security.When the cold war ended  regional problems erupted onthe heels of each other and faced the United Nations andregional organizations alike with a real challenge.With regard to the Middle East question  which webelieve to be one of the most significant issues thatconcern the world at large  an important breakthrough hastaken place on 28 September 1995  when the Israeli andPalestinian sides signed an historic accord in WashingtonD.C. that provides for the expansion of Palestinian self-rule. While we commend the accord  we voice the hopethat it will enable the Palestinian people to achieve theobjective of extending its authority over its own land andof building its national entity. My country also hopes thatthe progress achieved on the Palestinian-Israeli track willlead to the activation of the Syrian-Israeli and theLebanese-Israeli tracks. Lack of progress on those twotracks is a negative signal that does not serve the interestsof a just and comprehensive peace. If such peace is to beachieved  we believe that the negotiators on all sides haveto put behind them all the residual suspicions and politicalnegativism of the past  free their political will and look atthe present with a futuristic vision of a world that nolonger knows geographical boundaries thanks to thetechnological progress we now witness in every aspect oflife.19In Iraq  the Iraqi Government has yet to respond to allthe requirements of the relevant Security Councilresolutions so as to allow the lifting of the embargoimposed by the United Nations on Iraq. We  in commonwith others  were greatly surprised at the serious  importantinformation disclosed recently by the Iraqi Governmentregarding its programme of weapons of mass destruction.Regardless of the reasons that led Iraq not to disclose theseprogrammes in the past  the confidence of the internationalcommunity in Iraq has been dealt a severe blow becauseIraq had concealed this information in spite of the requestsfrom the Special Commission. In the light of these newdevelopments which necessitate the continuation of thework of the Special Commission for a long time to come my country appeals to the international community todouble its efforts towards mitigating the suffering of thebrotherly people of Iraq. By the same token  Iraq isrequired  now more than ever before  to reconsider itsrejection of Security Council resolution 986 (1995) which in our view  provides Iraq with a good opportunity toreduce some of the suffering of the brotherly people ofIraq.We call on Iraq once again seriously to provide all theinformation and means still in its possession to the SpecialCommission. We hope that Iraq’s compliance andcooperation in this matter will give the United Nationsaccess to the crucial information regarding the Iraqiprogrammes on weapons of mass destruction and pave theway towards the eventual lifting of the embargo fromwhich the Iraqi people have endured record suffering overthe past five years.In the context of Iraq’s commitment to SecurityCouncil resolutions  in particular resolution 686 (1991)  wecall on the Iraqi Government to cooperate further with thetripartite Committee that deals with the question of Kuwaitidetainees and the expatriates of other countries detained inIraq  and to provide the said committee with detailedinformation on those detainees. Any progress made in thisdirection will be viewed as a demonstration of the goodintentions of Iraq and its desire to cooperate with otherStates.In Somalia  despite the persistent efforts of the UnitedNations and other regional organizations  the situation inthat country gives no cause for optimism due to the totaldisregard some Somali leaderships show towards theinterests of the brotherly people of Somalia.In Afghanistan  although the United Nations hasdeployed and continues to deploy special efforts to restorepeace to this war-ravaged country  there is no abatementof the hostilities and bloodshed caused by the strife of thedifferent factions in that country. On the other hand  weview with optimism the progress achieved in the peaceprocesses undertaken by the United Nations in Angola Mozambique  and Liberia  and call upon the internationalcommunity to deploy all possible efforts towards themitigation of the suffering of the people of Rwanda whocontinue to be in the grip of ethnic and political conflictsbetween the warring factions in their country.In the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  despitethe United Nations and the commendable efforts of itspeace-keeping forces to halt the bloodshed in thisfledgling republic in the heart of Europe  the insurrectionof the Bosnian Serbs and their continued defiance of theinternational community have resulted in frustrating allthose concerted efforts. The recent events in Krajina andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air raidson Serbian positions have restored a certain degree ofbalance between Bosnia and the Serbs who seem tounderstand nothing but the logic of force. This has shownthe validity of the logical call to enable the Governmentof the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise itslegitimate right to self-defence.In this connection  obviously  the Agreement ofPrinciple signed under the supervision of the ContractGroup at Geneva on 3 September 1995 by the ForeignMinisters of the Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia  and the former Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbiaand Montenegro) constitutes a significant step towardspeace. However  it is the duty of the internationalcommunity to exert great efforts to overcome thedifficulties facing the United Nations and to ensure thatthe principles agreed on are translated into lasting peacein the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.There is no doubt that such regional issues face theUnited Nations with a real challenge and pose seriousthreats to international peace and security. In addition they have created human tragedies as a result of suchatrocities as “ethnic cleansing” and the horrors of famineand mass killings  not to mention the heavy financialburden they have put on the resources of the worldeconomy and on the people who have fallen victim to theatrocities. In the light of all this  how can the UnitedNations face up to all these responsibilities at a timewhen its ability to deploy efforts is receding because ofthe over-bureaucratization of its various organs and failureby many Member States to honour their financialobligations? The situation is complex  but it is one that20can be dealt with by restructuring United Nations organs ina more cost-effective manner so that the goals set may beachieved over the short-  medium- and long-term inconsonance with basic objectives so that the Organizationmay enter the coming century equipped with firminstructions to make international peace and security thebasic underpinnings of social and economic development.With regard to the Security Council  my country feelsthat while preserving the tasks entrusted to it  we must alsofind an effective mechanism to enable the GeneralAssembly to make an effective contribution in dealing withcrucial international issues so that all Member States mayparticipate in implementing United Nations resolutions andprogrammes in line with the provisions of the Charter  inthe interests of international peace and security as well aseconomic and social development. Proceeding from this my delegation calls upon the international community tosupport the efforts of the United Nations as the principalbody entrusted with addressing various crucial questionsthroughout the world. Those are our policies at all levels.At the regional level  my country seeks to build bridges ofdialogue and cooperation between all countries in the beliefthat this serves the interests of international peace andsecurity. We also seek to encourage and support all regionaland international groupings in the same spirit and with thesame goals in view. At the national level  my countrydeeply believes that the maintenance of regional andinternational peace provides the most important means ofimplementing our national economic and social plans. WithGod’s will  we have managed to settle with our neighboursthe problems regarding our borders  which has afforded usa golden opportunity to channel our national capabilitiestowards the implementation of our ambitious nationaleconomic and social programmes.Benefiting from the past wealth of economicexperience and in pursuit of the economic objective Omancharted 25 years ago  my Government  with the assistanceof such international bodies as the World Bank and othereconomic experts  organized a conference on the futureperspectives of the Omani economy by the year 2020 which was held at Muscat  the capital  on 3 and 4 June1995. With the participation of a broad segment of thepublic and private sectors of Omani society and a selectnumber of international organizations and world economicfigures  that conference laid out the basic lines of theOmani strategy for future Omani development  amongwhich are the development of human resources  thepromotion of women’s participation therein  thedevelopment of the private sector so that it may become thedriving force of the national economy  the encouragementof economic diversity  the encouragement of a suitableeconomic balance between the economy of Oman and therest of the world and the conservation of the environmentand its exploitation for peaceful purposes. MyGovernment’s peaceful endeavour to implement thosestrategies represents the best means by which my countrywill enter the next century on a solid basis  that wouldenable the Omani people to expand their economicresources and benefit from the technological progress wefeel will govern the world economy and all its means ofproduction and marketing.This option  with regard to the means of nationaldevelopment  will surely serve the cause of peace andsecurity. God willing  we look forward to a future filledwith promise for our future generations."
"127",5442,"PAK",50,1995,"I extend to you  Sir  mydelegation’s felicitations on your well-deserved electionas President of the General Assembly at its fiftiethsession. We have no doubt that with your experience andwisdom  you will add much to this historic session. Wealso pay tribute to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  who presided over the Assembly at itsforty-ninth session with great distinction and wisdom.To His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  ourSecretary-General  I would like to pay a special tributefor all he has done for peace and the promotion of theUnited Nations Charter.To the Republic of Palau  a new Member of ourOrganization  I would like to say  “Welcome”. We lookforward to working closely with that country.We are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of our Organization. On this momentousoccasion  as the Secretary-General aptly observed in hisreport (A/49/1)  we must resolve to“appreciate and strengthen the accomplishments ofthe past  to recognize and meet the challenges of thepresent  and to design and implement a plan for theUnited Nations of the future.” (A/49/1  para. 12)We must seize this historic opportunity to forge a globalconsensus behind development  in all its dimensions  asthe lasting foundation for international peace and securityand as the greatest hope of humanity.Pakistan has been strongly committed to the noblevision of the United Nations Charter ever since itsindependence. We have continuously abided by its17principles. We reaffirm our faith in their timeless validity.Pakistan will continue to extend its support and cooperationto the collective efforts of the world for peace.After exactly 50 years  retrospection evokes mixedfeelings. Yet members of our Organization have much tocelebrate. The decolonization process  the elimination ofapartheid  humanitarian assistance and handling of refugeesituations are some of the areas where the United Nationscan be proud of its achievements. But much remains to bedone.The end of the cold war provided a historicopportunity to build a new edifice of peace and prosperity:a system in which international relations would beconducted in a spirit of justice  equality and democracy;where poverty would cease to exist  through internationalcooperation for development; where human rights especially the right to self-determination  would bepromoted and protected; and where aggression would beeffectively and collectively challenged wherever andwhenever it occurred.Regrettably  this has not happened. Now  more thanever  it seems that the powerful countries are imposing theirwill on the United Nations. The decisions and theresolutions adopted by it reflect the interests of a few ratherthan the good of all. The provisions of collective securityare being invoked selectively. Human rights standards arebeing defended more vociferously in some situations thanin others. While in some cases aggression has beenforcefully and decisively resisted  in others it has remainedunchecked and even rewarded.Jammu and Kashmir is a case in question  where theMuslim majority continue to be denied their right to self-determination promised to them by Security Councilresolutions. These resolutions remain unimplemented. Thedenial of the right to self-determination led to a massiveuprising in the Indian-occupied Kashmir in 1989. Demandfor the exercise of this fundamental right was met with abrutal reign of terror unleashed by the Indian occupationforces. It continues unabated and is being pursued withmalicious intensity  with devastating consequences for thecivilian population of this internationally recognizeddisputed territory. In Kashmir the principles of the UnitedNations Charter  international law and international moralityhave been violated with impunity. The massive andwidespread human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmirhave been graphically documented by a large number ofinternational human rights organizations.Since I stood at this rostrum a year ago  tensionshave further escalated in South Asia. One billion peopleof South Asia are holding their breath as threats of warkeep emanating from the leaders in New Delhi.Jammu and Kashmir continues to burn. The sons anddaughters of Kashmir continue to be killed  maimed executed  tortured and dishonoured. Will the new year ofthe United Nations bring an end to the rape of Kashmir?Will the beginning of the next half century of the UnitedNations see the implementation of its resolutions onKashmir?The Jammu and Kashmir dispute was not brought tothe Security Council by Pakistan. It was India whichmoved this dispute before the United Nations. The peopleof Kashmir are looking to this body to deliver them theirright to self-determination  as promised to them by thisbody  by the international community and by India andPakistan.Since I stood before the Assembly a year ago hundreds of Kashmiris have been killed by the Indianforces. Holy places of the Muslims have been razed to theground by the Indian occupation forces. The holiest of theholy shrines  Charar-e-Sharif  was burned to ashes. Thecity of Charar-e-Sharif was torched. Is it not ironical thatthe great Sufi saint  Noor-ud-Din Wali  buried in theshrine there was a man who preached love and tolerancefive centuries ago to all humanity  and not just toMuslims? Hindus  Buddhists  Christians and Sikhs alsoseek spiritual solace at his grave. The disdainful act ofdesecration of this symbol of peace and harmony by theIndian forces has not extinguished the spirit of freedom inKashmir.The occupation forces  now numbering more than600 000  use torture  killings and brutality against thepeople  against its leaders  and even against innocentjournalists. The people of Kashmir were outraged at thekilling of a journalist  Mushtaq Ali  in the bomb blast atthe BBC office in Srinagar. The whole of Kashmir wentinto deep mourning at this wanton killing. But Indiarefuses to look truth in the face.The people of Kashmir and Pakistan are deeplyshocked at the killing of the Norwegian tourist by thekidnappers of the Al-Faran Group. We join our Kashmiribrothers in condemning this horrible act against aninnocent tourist  and we demand the release of theremaining four tourists. We have extended every possiblecooperation to countries whose citizens’ lives are still in18danger  but we have a right to ask: Who are Al-Faran?Nobody seems to have heard of this group ever before.There is too much circumstantial evidence which points anaccusing finger at New Delhi. We do not want rhetoric; wedo not want to score points. We want the safety and thefreedom of these innocent tourists. Pakistan calls for anindependent and impartial inquiry into the hostage-taking byAl-Faran  under the auspices of the United Nations  so thatthose responsible for this act can be brought to justice.India continues to harp on the issue of elections inJammu and Kashmir. Let it ask the All Parties HurriyetConference  the representative party of all Kashmiriorganizations in Jammu and Kashmir and the sole voice ofthe Kashmiri people  whether they want elections  or aplebiscite and the implementation of the Security Councilresolutions.Kashmir is an international dispute. India cannotinternalize it behind the garb of bilateralism. If this “non-principle” was allowed to prevail as the basis for thesettlement of disputes  then there would be no internationalmorality left. There would be no international order  andthe world community could say farewell to peace. It wouldbecome the law of the jungle.In the meantime  along the Line of Control in Kashmirour people are being killed daily and injured by cross-border firing and rocketing. Access to over 80 000 of ourpeople in the Neelam Valley has been cut off by dailyIndian firing.India claims that Pakistani militants cross intoKashmir. In good faith and in order to ascertain the veracityof the Indian allegations  I wrote to the President of theSecurity Council last year asking for the expansion of theUnited Nations Military Observer Group in India andPakistan (UNMOGIP) on both sides of the Line of Control.India’s response to this constructive proposal was a firm“No”. Instead  it deployed 800 troops per kilometre andbuilt three Security Zones along the Line of Control. I ask:Can there be cross-border violations after such heavyfortifications? By what logic can they reject our proposalfor increasing United Nations observers? The answer isobvious. They want merely to score points in internationalforums. They want to build an argument against Pakistan.They want to convince the world that it is not the Kashmiripeople who are alienated from India  but Pakistan that isturning a blind eye to militants crossing the Line of Controlfrom our side.I ask you to ponder this Indian posture. In historythis has always been the language of the aggressor  ofthose who want to maintain the status quo. I cannotbelieve that Indian authorities are so naive as to believethat the Kashmiri uprising is foreign- inspired. OtherPowers have also made such mistakes in the past  muchto their dismay and ultimate discomfiture. India mustlearn from history. The march of history has never been and never will be  altered by a systematic falsification offacts or a string of blatant lies. The people of Kashmirhave rejected the Indian occupation. No amount ofrepression  no amount of killings  gang-rapes  torture ormining of villages will deter the people of Jammu andKashmir from winning their right to self-determination.This truth is being lost on New Delhi. For our part we are prepared for dialogue. We are prepared formediation by the Secretary-General or by the President ofthe Assembly  or by any peace-loving country under anymodality  under any arrangement.We are prepared for peace. We want conflictresolution. We want talks but the talks must be on thesubstantive issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Talks must aimat achieving settlement. Talks must be on the basis of astructured agenda. Once the issue of Jammu and Kashmiris resolved  it will open the door for a solution to allother Indo-Pakistan disputes. But our offers of talks havefallen on deaf ears. India now hides behind a newsubterfuge that talks should be unconditional  that talksmust be without an agenda. We cannot accept thisbecause during the last 23 years under the SimlaAgreement  the two Foreign Secretaries met seven timeswithout any result. Every time a meeting takes place theIndian side states that Kashmir is an integral part of Indiaand not an international dispute. This is a negation of theUnited Nations Security Council resolutions. This is anegation of the Simla Agreement  and I quote article 6 ofthe Simla Agreement  which states “Both Governments agree ... to discuss further themodalities and arrangements for the establishment ofdurable peace and of normalization of relations” including“a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir”.The Simla Agreement is fully within the framework ofthe United Nations Charter.19Then we are told that the Security Council resolutionsare outdated. What will the world look like if countrieswere allowed unilaterally to reject United Nationsresolutions  and if this deviationist stance were to becomea universal principle of international morality? Can moralitybecome outdated? Can evil become good with time?Instead  India has gone on to a feverish arms race.When they exploded their nuclear bomb in 1974  we toldthem not to push South Asia into a nuclear arms race. Butour warnings were not heeded and now  along with itsmassive blue-water navy  which threatens the shores ofAfrica and Asia  they have launched into an arms race inSouth Asia. Their Prithvi missiles are Pakistan-specific. ThePrithvi missile is a tension multiplier: it gives Pakistan onlythree minutes’ response time.What are they arming themselves for? Who threatensthem in Asia? Their leaders talk of extending the Indianmilitary and naval might to the shores of the Indian Ocean.In this day and age this approach is downrightanachronistic.During the Eighth Summit of the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  which washeld in New Delhi in May this year  President Leghariurged Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Indianleadership not to take this fateful step. He urged the Indianleadership to come to the table and solve the core Kashmirdispute. He also warned that if India continued with thisfeverish race for arms  and now for missiles  then Pakistanwould have no choice but to rethink its options within theMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).Having fought three wars to defend its territory  thepeople of Pakistan feel threatened. That is why peace isimportant. That is why peace is vital for Pakistan. But Iwant to make it absolutely clear — and let there be nodoubt about it in anyone’s mind — that the people ofPakistan have the will to survive  and survive they will withdignity and honour.One fifth of humanity  a billion people  live in theseven countries of South Asia. The world is passing us by.Our people are trapped in poverty  in hunger  in disease andunemployment. Don’t our people deserve better? Don’t theydeserve a chance? Don’t six countries have a right to livein peace in South Asia? It is our earnest hope that those inNew Delhi who threaten war should look at the state ofpoverty of their own people. We hope that they have thepolitical will to ensure the peaceful settlement of disputes and there will be many peace dividends if peace comes toSouth Asia.Peace will be worth their while. Trade will flourish mega- projects in the Gulf  from Iran and from CentralAsia will bring prosperity to our peoples. I hope thatbetter counsel will prevail in New Delhi and I hope thereare still men of peace and vision left in India who willnot be the prisoners of the acrimonies of history but willlook to the future of a billion people.The Secretary-General  in his 1995 report on thework of the Organization (A/50/1)  has recognized theaggravation of relations between India and Pakistan as aresult of increasing incidents of violence in Jammu andKashmir. We would like  in particular  to facilitate thesearch for a lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute. Wehope that India will also accept the United NationsSecretary-General’s offer of good offices  as Pakistan hasdone. We also sincerely hope that the United NationsGeneral Assembly will use its authority to exert pressureon India to stop immediately the brutal violations ofhuman rights and to implement the Security Councilresolutions which ask for the holding of a plebiscite inJammu and Kashmir.What has been happening in Bosnia andHerzegovina for the past few years is a monumentaltragedy. The world has witnessed a Member State of theUnited Nations being made victim of brutal aggressionand its people subjected to atrocities  massive violationsof human rights  ethnic cleansing and the abhorrentpractice of genocide — acts which would put the horrorsof the Second World War to shame. The killing fields ofSrebrenica and Zepa are sadly reminiscent of Auschwitzand Buchenwald. Yet the international response has beentotally inadequate and has often come too late. TheBosnian Muslims were left to defend themselves againsta vastly superior military machine  their hands tied by anunjustified arms embargo.Pakistan strongly reiterates its firm support for thedemand by the Bosnian people for the lifting of the armsembargo. For its part  Pakistan remains stronglycommitted to offering every possible assistance to thepeople and Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Wemust seek credible international guarantees for thepreservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Bosniaand Herzegovina.If one step is taken towards peace  the world ofIslam is prepared to take two steps more. We have taken20note of the action taken by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) countries and of the establishment ofthe rapid reaction force. We urge the NATO countries notto relent on the air strikes until the Serbian aggressors anddelinquents are made to pay a price for their deeds and toact like civilized people. Unless peace is fully restored anda just and equitable settlement is in place  the OIC willreserve its right to challenge the illegal United Nations armsembargo on the Bosnian people.We fully support the Croatian efforts to recoverKrajina and their other territories from Serbian militaryoccupation. We demand that in the settlement Srebrenicaand Zepa be restored to their original United Nations-designated safe-area status. We also demand that Kosovoand Sanjak be protected from Serbian “ethnic cleansing”.The Declaration of Principles signed recently in Geneva issomething we consider well-begun but only half-done.There are many pitfalls  and we see many dangers in theimplementation of the Declaration of Principles. A lot morevision and courage on the part of the world community willbe required if the entire peace plan is to be fullyimplemented. We hope that the United Nations  theEuropean Union and NATO will demonstrate the couragerequired to resolve the crisis in the Balkans.The situation in Afghanistan makes us very sad. Thepeople of Afghanistan wait in anguish for peace to returnto their tortured land. There appears to be no end to thefighting between the various groups. One and a half millionAfghans are still in my country. They too  like us  look tothe United Nations and to the OIC to bring peace to theirland.I should like to state here unequivocally  and with allthe responsibility at our command  that in no way have weinterfered in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. We wouldalso urge that no other country do so. We would urge otherStates not to increase the suffering of the Afghan people bysupporting one group or the other. We should all supportUnited Nations Special Representative Mahmoud Mestiri’smission to bring peace to Afghanistan  a peace based onaccommodation for all factions and all groups. This peacecan be achieved only through mutual accommodation andnational reconciliation. In the last 18 months  our Missionhas twice been subjected to mob attacks. In the second one 26 of our officials were injured  including Ambassador QaziHumayun  and one staffer was killed. This is mostunfortunate. We hope that the sanctity of the Mission willbe respected and that the Vienna Conventions will behonoured.For over a decade  Pakistan supported the legitimatestruggle of our Afghan brothers against foreignintervention. Once this intervention was ended  Pakistanpromoted accords among the Afghan parties and factionsfor a peaceful transition from war to peace. It was as aconsequence of the compromise achieved in theIslamabad accord of May 1992 that President Rabbanitook office. His Government was to be a transitional oneand was to prepare for a broad-based and populargovernment representing all regions and political forces inAfghanistan. Unfortunately  as the Secretary- General’sSpecial Representative  Mr. Mestiri  has clearly stated  theregime in Kabul did not allow the promised transition toa representative government to take place.In large measure because of this refusal to live up tosolemn agreements  fighting in Afghanistan has beenendemic during the past few years. The fortunes of warrecently turned against President Rabbani’s regimebecause it became increasingly unpopular with the Afghanpeople. A regime in Kabul whose de facto legitimacy wehave not questioned  a regime in Kabul that todaycontrols only 5 of about 32 provinces in Afghanistan: thisregime has tested our patience again and again.This regime chooses to punish unarmed and innocentstaffers and the Ambassador. It chooses to burn down ourEmbassy and its premises. But this has not madePakistanis angry at the Afghan nation. It has merely madeus sad  because this regime has forgotten the 14 years ofthe support given and the sacrifices made by the peopleof Pakistan for their freedom. Instead  it chooses to pleasethose who destroyed their country  who killed andmaimed millions of Afghan men  women and children who destroyed houses  who destroyed people’s lives  whoplanted millions of land-mines across the country — alarge number of which have yet to be removed. By thesewanton acts  which go against the Vienna Conventions the Kabul regime wants to win the favour of those whoseek to fish in the troubled waters of Afghanistan.The Kabul regime seeks to survive with the help ofmilitary support from the enemies of the Afghan nation while it rules through a minority. It seeks to conquerAfghanistan through military force. This is againsthistory. This will not happen. The regime is forgetting thecode of honour of the Afghan nation. While we inPakistan are sad at what has happened to our countrymenin Kabul  the chivalrous Afghan people are angered andincensed. We take no responsibility for what the Afghanpeople will do to vindicate their honour. They know thatthere never was  and never will be  interference from21Pakistan. The world knows that a faltering regime alwayswants to lay its follies and its internal defeats at thedoorsteps of others  and for this the Afghan nation willdemand  and get  retribution.However  this provocation will not deter us from oursteadfast path of neutrality towards the Afghan people andthe unity of Afghanistan or from non-interference inAfghanistan’s internal affairs or our abiding friendship andbrotherhood with the Afghan nation. In the meantime  wewould like to assure the people of Afghanistan that we shallstand by them in their hour of trial. We shall not abandonthem.Pakistan was closely associated with the third round ofUnited Nations-sponsored inter-Tajik talks. While I paytribute to the United Nations Special Representative Ambassador Píriz-Ballón  for his statesmanship  which ledto the main elements for peace in Tajikistan  let me addthat our role too was to bring about national reconciliationin that country. We shall continue to cooperate with theUnited Nations to bring about complete peace in ourfriendly neighbour Tajikistan.The events in Azerbaijan  too  are a matter of deepconcern to us. We fully support the efforts of PresidentGaider Aliyev for an equitable settlement of the Nagorny-Karabakh dispute; a settlement which is based on theremoval of aggression against Azerbaijan.We fully support the Middle East peace process. Wehope that the Palestine Liberation Organization-Israeliaccord is implemented in letter and spirit without anyrecourse to delay by Israel. We have supported the Jordan-Israeli peace accord and favour a negotiated settlement ofrelated issues  especially the Golan Heights  southernLebanon and Jerusalem.Pakistan continues to be deeply concerned over thesituation in Somalia. The United Nations  along with theOrganization of African Unity  the Arab League and theOrganization of Islamic Conference must endeavour topromote an early political solution in that country and itseventual reconstruction.In other areas which impinge on the peace andstability of the world can be seen the lack of progress inthe field of disarmament of weapons of mass destruction particularly in the field of nuclear weapons.The end of the bipolar world based on hostile campshas removed the impediments to pursuing the goal ofnuclear disarmament. Yet the goal remains elusive. It isincomprehensible why commitments cannot be translatedinto reality. The agreements reached on the reduction ofstrategic arms still fall far short of the expectations raisedby the end of the cold war. The world should resolve toremove the scourge of nuclear weapons from the face ofthis earth.Until nuclear disarmament is realized  the nuclear-weapon States should give unconditional securityassurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States. In thiscontext  the Conference on Disarmament should establishan ad hoc committee right at the beginning of 1996 tonegotiate a legally binding convention on securityassurances. The Conference on Disarmament should alsocontinue its work on a comprehensive test-ban treaty forits early conclusion.Parallel to all these global efforts  regional avenuesshould be promoted for nuclear non-proliferation. Theconcept of nuclear-weapon-free zones is finally beingtranslated into reality in different parts of the world.Unfortunately  the proposal Pakistan made 20 years agoto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia hasnot even taken off because of the negative attitude ofcertain States in the region. Nevertheless  Pakistan hascontinued to advocate efforts to eliminate the dangers ofproliferation from South Asia. To that end  we have madeseveral suggestions. Regrettably  they have not evoked apositive response from India.Pakistan has also proposed conventionaldisarmament at the regional and subregional levels. Wehope that the Conference on Disarmament will deliberateupon this approach and evolve guidelines to bring at parthe weaponry and forces of the regional States.In our view  the emerging role of the United Nationsas a peace maker and a peace-keeper would greatly helpin achieving peace and harmony at the regional as well asthe global levels. We believe that preventive diplomacy isthe cornerstone of United Nations peace efforts. Pakistanhas been actively cooperating and participating in a majorway in United Nations peace-keeping efforts. It is amatter of immense satisfaction that today Pakistan is thethird largest troop-contributing country to United Nationspeace-keeping operations.Pakistan believes that certain operational realitiesmust be justified for the success of such operations. We22need a clear commitment from the international community accompanied by a clear political direction and a unifiedcommand structure.In order to ensure better and effective implementationof Security Council resolutions  there is a need for thoroughconsultations between the members of the Council  as wellas actual troop-contributing countries and the Secretariat  atall stages of any peace-keeping operation.As we enter the new millennium  our collectiveobjective should be to maximize economic growth leadingtowards the ultimate objective of human development. Topromote peace and prosperity  it is essential to facilitaterather than restrain the application of modern technologyfor economic and social development.Adequate official resources should be channelled tothose developing countries which are implementing far-reaching economic reforms and liberalization measures. Anet flow of official assistance should be directed inparticular towards the eradication of poverty  human andsocial development programmes and sustainable growth inthe developing countries. This is particularly true of Africa a continent which has been largely bypassed by theeconomics of the twentieth century. For our part  Pakistanextends full support to the United Nations developmentassistance plans for Africa and for the Sahel.Pakistan is encouraged by the conclusion of theUruguay Round  despite the partial and unequal response tothe trade interests of the developing countries. The globaleconomy is finally coming out of recession. New growth islikely to be generated mostly in the developing countries whose integration into the world’s financial and tradingsystem can immensely contribute towards global output.There is  therefore  a unique opportunity to create a just fair  equitable and non-discriminatory global economy.Free markets and open economies do not imply adisregard for the plight of the poor and the disadvantaged.This principle must be applied as much among nations aswithin nations. The aim must be to improve livingconditions for all within a dynamic economic framework.Pakistan welcomes the constructive outcome of the recentlyheld Conference on Population and Development  theWorld Summit for Social Development and the FourthWorld Conference on Women.We in Pakistan are particularly aware of the need toaddress the problems of the deprived segments of oursociety. Development initiatives  such as the Social ActionProgramme  are being formulated within the constitutionalframework. Our Constitution contains a number of articlesrelated to social integration with particular reference towomen and children and religious and ethnic minorities as well as those living in poverty. Special efforts arebeing made to ensure the full participation of women innation building. Pakistan’s approach to employment andpoverty eradication combines policies for national growth employment and price stabilization with programmes thattarget the poor and the vulnerable.Pakistan would like to reiterate the importance it hasalways attached to the reform of the United Nations.Pakistan supports the reaffirmation made by the Non-Aligned Movement that both the reform and expansionaspects of the Security Council should take into accountthe principles of the sovereign equality of States andequitable geographical distribution  as well as the need fortransparency  accountability and democratization in theworking methods and procedures of the Security Council.Pakistan remains strongly opposed to centres of privilegewithin the United Nations system. These areanachronistic  anti-democratic and contrary to theprinciple of sovereign equality.In conclusion  the challenges that Member States ofthe United Nations confront are indeed forbidding. Yetthe opportunities for genuine peace and universalprosperity are most promising. With good will andcooperation  all Member States can make significantprogress at this historic session towards the vision ofpeace  progress and human solidarity envisaged in theCharter of the United Nations. This is an extraordinarymoment of opportunity. The decisions we take today willdetermine whether the new era will be one of hope andprosperity or one of despair and deprivation. The choicesto build a peaceful world are therefore entirely in our ownhands."
"128",5485,"PAN",50,1995,"Allow me at the outset  Sir  to express mysatisfaction and that of my delegation at the President’selection to guide our deliberations. We have strong tieswith Portugal  based on the many cultural values that wehave historically shared on the fertile soil of the Ibero-American community. For this reason  it is a great pleasurefor me to offer Don Diogo Freitas do Amaral our sincerestcooperation and to congratulate him in advance  by virtueof his well-known qualities  on his successful leadership ofthis memorable fiftieth session of the General Assembly.The delegation of Panama wishes to take thisopportunity to express to the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our recognition of the skill intelligence and dedication with which he is fulfilling hisresponsibilities at the head of our Organization.This fiftieth anniversary has been a year rich inevents. Under the leadership of the United Nations  therehave been two major world gatherings — the WorldSummit for Social Development at Copenhagen and theFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing — whichhave focused the attention of the world on matters thatare highly complex and difficult because of their cultural social and political implications.It is gratifying to see that these meetings havefundamentally mobilized women  who are increasinglyoccupying their rightful role  and that the Conferenceshave contributed enormously to convert the quest for asolution to the problems of the family and of children intothe responsibility of us all  and into a moral imperativethat transcends the healthy differences between us.Panama values as a substantive result the hopefulconsensus and the important guidelines agreed upon.We reiterate the responsibility of Panama in theNon-Aligned Movement  as well as our readiness toattend the Summit at Cartagena de Indias  Colombia  tocontribute to the necessary review  just as we greatlyvalue our participation in the Group of 77. In this context we reiterate our deepest solidarity with the leastdeveloped countries  with which we are cooperatingwithin our means.My delegation is convinced of the need to bring thisOrganization up to the level of its new and growingresponsibilities  and to adapt its functioning  itsprocedures and its structures to the new conditions that characterize contemporary international society. We areconvinced that this is a feeling shared by all MemberStates  and we believe that existing differences will in duecourse be resolved.Panama is following with great attention thediscussions taking place in the Working Groups on theSecurity Council  on the financial situation  on thesupplement to “An Agenda for Peace” and on the “Agendafor Development”. In particular  and in accordance withdecisions taken in the Rio Group  Panama believes that theincrease in the membership of the Security Council shouldaim at correcting existing imbalances in the regionaldistribution of membership  as well as changing itsprocedures and working methods  so that the Council canfunction in a transparent way  in keeping with the letter andspirit of the Charter. In this context  we support theadmission of Germany and Japan as permanent members ofthe expanded Security Council.We are convinced that the expectations of theinternational community for renewed action by the UnitedNations can be satisfied only if the financial crisisconfronting the Organization is overcome in such a way asto allow it to respond to the mandates of Member States.We are particularly concerned at the consistent trendtowards a reduction in funds for development andcooperation programmes  as well as proposals to reorientfood programmes towards emergency assistanceprogrammes.We consider the review and indefinite extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)to be of extreme importance  together with the approval ofprovisions for its periodic review. As a State party to theTreaty of Tlatelolco  which establishes the first nuclear-weapon-free zone  and as a coastal State of the Pacific Panama wishes to reiterate the Declaration of the RioGroup regarding the resumption of nuclear testing  becausethat practice has a negative impact on the delicatecompromises that this subject involves  as well as theGroup’s readiness to continue to negotiate treaties for thetotal prohibition of such testing  as well as the productionand use of chemical and biological weapons.Likewise  we vehemently reject all forms of terrorism wherever they exist  as well as expressions of racism andintolerance  which are incompatible with our status asmembers of the human race. Respect for human rights isand must be a fundamental part of the new universal ethics which my country has accepted as an integral part of ourvalue system and which my Government is completelyfulfilling.We are profoundly concerned at the overall situationof the African continent  whose peoples deserve the bestof destinies. Nonetheless  we are extremely pleased tounderscore the admirable example offered to us by theSouth Africans who  moving beyond racial or culturalmotivations  in a long and heroic effort that has caused somuch suffering  have put an end to the most odious formof discrimination — apartheid. The difficulties involvedin meeting  living together and working as equals in anatmosphere of tolerance and cooperation cannot concealthe important contribution being made today by theleaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership ofPresident Mandela  to whom we wish to accord a specialrecognition for having constructed the democraticfoundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation  fullyincorporated into the international community.In the Middle East  particularly in Palestine and inIsrael  we are delighted to see the efforts of twoGovernments and their respective leaders and peopleswho are struggling tirelessly to consolidate the peaceagreements and to move forward in building lastingpeaceful coexistence. Our country wishes to add its voiceof encouragement to all the forces involved in thisexemplary commitment  which contributes so much to thestrength of the United Nations system and to internationalethics. Panama  a defender of the rights of the Palestinianpeople and a sincere and constant friend of the Jewishpeople  as well as of the Arab peoples  believes it isappropriate for the international community to begin toadjust the direction of its own decisions in order tostrengthen what is new  to lend greater force to thatwhich unites us  in order to encourage those who desirepeace.Inspired by these events  the Member States of theUnited Nations should recognize the recent achievementsthat have been made and further encourage the parties tothe conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to find thepolitical will to arrive at firm  lasting agreements that willspare their own peoples the suffering and pain of beinginnocent victims of war  of racism and of intolerance. TheUnited Nations peace-keeping forces must be respectedand protected  because this is what their noble missiondemands and because this has been the decision of thecommunity of nations. The same message applies to otherareas of the world that are threatened by violence  or thatare subject to breaches of the peace.I believe it is appropriate to refer to the request madeby a large number of States  including Panama  to includethe item of the special situation of the Republic of China inTaiwan on the agenda of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. Panama supports this request because it isinterested in the unification of China. But since thateventuality is as yet unforeseeable as regards the “when”and “how”  we are convinced that both parties shouldcoexist and participate jointly in the internationalcommunity with equality and mutual respect. Panama  as acoastal country of the Pacific  and completely sovereign inthe inter-oceanic Canal whose neutrality opens it topeaceful use by all nations of the world  desires friendshipwith all States and wishes to normalize its relations with allusers of this inter-oceanic passage.The Torrijos-Carter Treaties provide for theculmination on 31 December 1999 of the process of thereturn to Panama of the inter-oceanic canal and adjacentfacilities and the agreed withdrawal of the troops andmilitary facilities of the United States. This exceptionaldiplomatic and political event constitutes an example of thepeaceful and just settlement of disputes between a worldPower and a small country  which today have excellentrelations of friendship and cooperation based on trust andmutual respect  as is appropriate for two States committedto efforts to consolidate prosperity  peace  security anddemocracy on the continent.The regime of neutrality of the Panama Canal  inestablishing freedom of transit for ships  withoutdiscrimination  promotes the strengthening of aninterdependent world with an increasing trend towardsinternational cooperation. It also provides in our hemispherea concrete example of a system of collective security whichensures the peaceful uses of that inter-oceanic canal openly  on equal conditions  both in times of peace and intimes of war  for ships of all flags and nations of the world.From this rostrum we reiterate the invitation to StatesMembers of the United Nations to adhere to the Treatyconcerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of thePanama Canal.We are and shall remain the Western hemisphere’skey to the immense Pacific. President Ernesto PérezBalladares’s recent successful tour of Asia  following hisattendance at the Quito Summit of the Rio Group  and hisacceptance of the invitation of the President of the UnitedStates to go to Washington reflect the desire to reaffirmclearly our decision to establish the closest political diplomatic and commercial relations with all nations in thegeographic arc from Japan to Australia  through thePhilippines  and including all the other coastal States ofthe Asian continent. In keeping with this  we areinterested in being admitted to the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council  as is appropriate for a country thatis essentially maritime and commercial.We therefore wish to continue to be the point ofconvergence  the meeting-point  of races  cultures andcivilizations. We wish to continue to express our naturalhistorical and geographical calling  which inspired theAmphictyonic Congress of Panama of 1826  initiated bySimón Bolívar  the Liberator  and which later madepossible the emergence of the Organization of AmericanStates  the United Nations  the Contadora Final Act andthe Rio Group — cornerstones of agreement  dialogue peace and regional and universal democracy.This explains that our openness to the Caribbeanbasin  in entering the Association of Caribbean States  ourincorporation into the Central American IntegrationSystem and our admission to the Andean Group as apermanent observer are basic to our foreign policy  whichinvolves intense activity to create bonds of integration andcooperation in the framework of fruitful  openregionalism. In this context  we believe it extremelyimportant to express our encouragement for the effortsbeing made by the Secretary-General and his Group ofFriends in the negotiations aimed at bringing peace at lastto the noble people of Guatemala. We welcome the factthat Contadora is once again becoming a point ofreference in the painstaking negotiation of nationalconciliation for that fraternal people. Panama is honouredto have hosted very recently the parties that reached theinitial agreements to bring lasting peace to Guatemala.We welcome the achievements of the EuropeanUnion and its members  and recognize the value of itsimportant contribution to international cooperation. Weencourage it to complement this contribution byintensifying trade with our own country and our regionthrough renewed readiness to facilitate access for ourproducts to its markets. We are conscious that Panama isa bridge not only to the Pacific  but also to the Atlantic which opens up new opportunities with the States of theEuropean Union. We are following with optimism andattention developments in the countries in transition  withwhich we wish to have close relations and increasedexchanges.Panama  which is today a stable and securedemocracy respectful of human rights  with a Governmentthat represents with full legitimacy a people determined3to shape for itself a great future of peace and well-being wishes to remain the cross-roads of international trade  opento all parts of the world  where  in an era of globalizationand market integration  the goods and services that are theprincipal wealth produced by nations can circulate.Because of everything we are and everything we wishto remain  we are here today to share the opportunities thatarise from a new situation  which  because it is not imposedby the manifest destiny of others  promises to open uppaths towards a great future of cooperation and integrationwith the region and the world.Panama is particularly proud to invite the members ofthe international community that use our inter-oceanicwaterway to join us in September 1997 in our capital forthe Universal Congress on the Panama Canal  where all thedirect and indirect beneficiaries of this marvel of themodern world can see the progress in the smooth transferof the administration and control of the Panama waterwayat the end of this century  and consider its modernizationand enlargement so that in the twenty-first century it cancontinue to be the most efficient  most competitive andsafest means of maritime transport for the exchange ofmerchandise and products vital to the economies of manycountries of the world. Recognizing the importance of thismatter  the General Assembly  at its third plenary meeting held on 22 September 1995  made it agenda item 162 forthe fiftieth session  under the title “Universal Congress onthe Panama Canal”.We invite representatives to participate with us in thedevelopment of the infrastructure of transport and trans-isthmus communications to serve the continent and theworld  with the creation — already under way — in ourcountry  on the banks of the inter-oceanic Canal betweenthe Pacific and the Caribbean  of a large port for thestorage and handling of goods  which will complement theoperation of the modernized Panama Canal. We also inviterepresentatives to participate in the City of Learningproject  a great international centre for the exchange ofcultures and knowledge  being promoted by our country onthe banks of the Canal.We also wish to say that we have offered theAmerican hemisphere our territory and all the infrastructureand installations necessary to establish a multilateral centreto combat drug-trafficking and related crimes. Panamaraised this matter at the recent Summit of Heads of Stateand Government of the Rio Group  which endorsed the ideaand has put it to the President of the United States  BillClinton  because we believe that we can succeed in thisenormous struggle only if all countries coordinate theirplans and actions. At the same time  we strongly supportthe holding of a second international conference againstthe use of and illicit trafficking in drugs in order to dealwith a problem that has become universal in scope.Panama  as a founding Member of this Organizationand a signatory of the San Francisco Charter  has beenwith the United Nations for its 50 years  carrying on withit step by step  day by day  observing its magnificentachievements and its great difficulties  which for some areoverwhelming. But this is not a time for fear or regrets;it is a time for new endeavours  a time to promote newforms  ways and means of international cooperation  witha view to generating  by cultivating the complementarydevelopment of our national individualities  the cultural economic and human resources that can enable us to befree of poverty and backwardness and to open an ever-broadening road to understanding  tolerance  peace andprosperity as we enter the third millennium."
"129",5532,"PER",50,1995,"Mr. President  on this important occasion  allow me toextend the congratulations of the people and Governmentof Peru upon your distinguished and well-deservedelection to preside over the work of the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly. We are confident that your broadexperience and ability will make Portugal’s presidency ahigh-water mark in this exceptional anniversary markinghalf a century of the United Nations Organization.Peru  like all the nations gathered here  is facing atime of awesome changes in social  political andeconomic practices and in international equilibria as thiscentury draws to a close. Those changes have altered ourvision of the world and introduced positive elements ofcardinal importance  but have also left questions andshadows that cause the greatest concern. Moreover  theshared approaches that have characterized these last fewyears do not in themselves resolve many of thesubstantive problems of the international system  such asthose pertaining to collective security  economic andsocial development and the defence of the perennialvalues that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life forpeoples and individuals.During the space of a decade my countryexperienced the worst social  political and economic crisisin its 174 years of history as an independent nation. Apainful and futile internal conflict  brought on byintransigence and ideological utopianism  added to thewaste of public resources and Governments overwhelmedby the nation’s problems  led Peru into a deep internalcrisis with grave international consequences. Over the last10five years  the Government of President Alberto Fujimorihas succeeded in overcoming the internal confrontation restoring a healthy and vigorous economic order and re-establishing Peru’s international ties. In this context  it isvery important to stress that we have set forth on the wayto turning external difficulties into patterns of normalcy andthe potential consolidation of our relations withneighbouring countries  with which we wish above all tocultivate cooperation.All of us here are aware that threats to internationalpeace and security arise from the deterioration of the social economic and institutional fabric of States  and that theirworst effects  such as internal armed conflicts  drugtrafficking  corruption and the inevitable sequel of thoseills  poverty  are the seed-bed in which internationalconflicts tend to germinate. And all sensible people alsoknow that the antidote to those ills is to be found in thepermanent values common to all of mankind’s greatcivilizations  the values that should guide the effectiveeffort of the international community to overcome thoseacute evils.We have left behind the international systemdominated by the cold war between the super-Powers andthe absurd faith in philosophical and political determinism.If we wish to build a world of justice and peace  we mustdispense with the rhetorical exercises to which we becameaccustomed during that fortunately bygone era. We needobjective points of reference for the international systemthat will avoid unilateral interpretations or interpretationsthat disregard the principles in force to bring about civilizedcoexistence among nations. And this requires us to refutethe cynical idea that the values of the international systemdo not exist  or that they are entirely subordinate torelations of force between nations.All of this implies taking initiatives to enhance anddefend objective principles of international law  as the onlypossible foundation for the present international system. Wesee with great concern how ethnic  geographical andutopian myths and revisionisms are becoming a boundlesssource of suffering for millions of men and women in ourtime  gravely disturbing fragile international balances.The struggle of the Cold War undermined the legalprinciples concerning avoidance of the use of force  respectfor international treaties and the principle ofnon-intervention. Today  we have a duty to look uponinternational law with a new gaze; we must understand that although international law does not in itself resolve theworld’s problems  it will make this world safer and morehabitable  and ensure that its points of reference are morestable. We have before us the intellectual challenge ofclarifying the content of the central rules of internationallaw in order to strengthen their legitimacy  and we alsohave the obligation to improve the effectiveness ofinternational law  in both bilateral and multilateralrelations.At the same time  we must not overlook the fact thatthe security and development of nations rests  today morethan ever  upon respect for the social and intellectualfeatures that are peculiar to each culture  unquestionablyfalling within a universal conception based on respect forindividual freedoms. We must resist attempts to imposeuniform “models” that prejudge and discriminate betweenthe world’s varying cultural forms. We must seek unity indiversity and must not accept conditionalities that areoften advanced by groups foreign to the democraticrepresentation of States  whose effects upon our culturesare negative.There are those who argue that  having overcome theideological conflict that divided the world for 45 years we are now entering into a conflict of civilizations as thelast phase in the evolution of the modern world’sconflicts. Without accepting the determinism implicit inthat view  we cannot fail to observe that a lack of respectfor the cultural diversity of the human species couldindeed become a source of profound disputes.There has also been talk of the vanishing sovereigntyof States as a fait accompli  and it is claimed that thiswould legitimize asymmetrical intervention by somenations in the lives of other nations. The word“sovereignty” evokes armies  ships and cannons and hasan ominous ring to it. However  if we take an objectiveview of the matter  we cannot affirm that this is so. In itsessence  sovereignty is above all plenary legal andpolitical competence within a constitutional order. If weare today actively seeking integration in many regions ofthe world and if States  through various multilateraltreaties  are diminishing their jurisdiction over certainaspects of their economic and social life  that is takingplace because States  in the exercise of that plenarycompetence known as sovereignty  are voluntarilydelegating the exercise of specific jurisdictions to aninternational organization for the greater good of aparticular international space. In so doing  States do notderogate from their constitutions nor do they lose theircapacity to conclude international treaties as they see fitor to legislate on countless other matters. And so webelieve that those who are seeking new legal and political11definitions of sovereignty should take care to respect itsessence  which is nothing other than respect for theconstitutional independence of the various countries of theworld.Peru opted for a republican and democratic regimebased on a division of powers and officials elected by freeand universal suffrage. Its government is a limitedgovernment that leaves broad areas of social  political andeconomic life open to the free choice of its citizens.However  this limited Government is not a minimal Statewithout social functions  for it has active responsibilitiesand an important agenda to pursue in order to free thepoorest citizens from a culture of dependency and integratethem fully into the life of the country. Peru seeks toharmonize transmission of the valuable cultural traditions ofits people with the imperative needs of an open regionalismand the defence of a coherent  legitimate and justinternational order.Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during thisfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes thatthe Organization should give serious thought to its futureand to the course which international society is taking  soas to achieve a more complete vision encompassingdifferent international realities based upon mutual respectand fairness among Member States. We must take intoaccount the new regional realities and seek machinery thatis functional  economical and efficient  not hampered bysecondary issues or limited to powerlessly denouncing thecontradictions of the international system  in order to ensurethat the United Nations can be faithful to the purposes andprinciples that inspired its creation.We believe that we must discard the pragmatism thatstyles itself realism and defend the fundamental principlesof a balanced and just international order. Peruvians believein defending the perennial values of mankind  individualfreedoms  international law as an objective benchmark forinternational order  respect for the world’s cultures and theconstitutional independence of all the world’s nations. Withthese beliefs  we pledge ourselves anew to the renewal ofthe international system."
"130",5579,"PHL",50,1995,"It is with special fervourthat I congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral  on behalf of thePhilippine delegation  on his election as President of theUnited Nations General Assembly in this landmark session.Let me also express the gratitude of my delegation to Mr.Amara Essy  the Foreign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire  for theexcellent leadership which he provided us at our forty-ninthsession. Our tribute goes also to the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali and to the men and women of theSecretariat  who  in the course of the past year  carried outtheir indispensable tasks under circumstances of greatdifficulty for them and for the Organization.In three weeks  most of the world’s Heads of State orGovernment will gather in this Hall to commemorate thefiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. Theywill no doubt recall how the founding fathers of ourOrganization convened in San Francisco  animated by theirresolve to transform the world. It was a world devastatedby a global war. Like most wars  it was ignited by thepropensity and ability of nations to use force to acquireterritory and resources  to avenge past wrongs  or topromote  at the expense of others  the security andwelfare of their people.This was the world which the United Nations wascreated to transform. Our founding fathers were idealisticenough to insist that questions of war and peace hadultimately to be resolved in the hearts and minds of menand nations; but they were realistic enough to recognizethat practical measures and considerations were necessaryto deter the use of force and mitigate its effects. Theywere realistic enough to concede that States that held apreponderance of military force had to be allowed a largemeasure of authority and responsibility; but they wereidealistic enough to hope that those States would use theirpower for the good of all.With the hindsight of 50 years  we can see that theUnited Nations has not fulfilled the vision that thefounders had for it  but it succeeded well beyond what itwas reasonable to expect of it at that time. The world wasspared yet another global cataclysm. The quiet work ofthe United Nations  particularly through its specializedagencies  advanced the well-being and raised the standardof living of countless millions around the world.Sadly  however  these considerable achievementswere offset  in a fundamental way  by the continued andrepeated defiance of the United Nations proclaimedpurposes by so many men and nations  in so manyinstances. Almost from the beginning of the existence ofthe United Nations  and despite the United Nations  manpersisted in his ability  propensity and willingness to useforce in order to achieve his national or ideological ends.If peace was kept on a global scale  it was only becausethe mutual threat of nuclear annihilation deterred thelaunching of full-scale war. In the international economy countries sought to beggar their neighbours through theunabashed use of a full range of protectionist andmercantilist tools.Today  however  in the fiftieth year of the UnitedNations  we can say with a measure of plausibility  thatthe world has indeed been transformed; and we can hope with a degree of realism  that the idealistic vision of theUnited Nations can be substantially attained.One of the central aims of the United Nations — theliberation of colonized nations — has been largelyachieved. The world’s most mightily armed Powers havepulled back from the brink of nuclear annihilation. Nolonger do nuclear-armed ideological camps face eachother in deadly confrontation  and mankind’s survival no16longer hangs in the perilous balance of mutual nuclearthreat. The Philippines is gratified by the decision earlierthis year to extend indefinitely the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls for theconclusion early next year of a comprehensive test-bantreaty that would put an absolute end to all nuclear testing.The international community has reached agreementon the elimination of other devices of mass destruction andof inhumane weapons. In particular  the Philippines urgesthe ratification and the strengthening of the 1980Convention on the Prohibition of Restrictions on the Use ofCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed tobe Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects.We call for the early entry into force of the Convention onthe Prohibition of the Development  Production andStockpiling of Chemical Weapons and on TheirDestruction  and the full implementation of the Conventionon the Prohibition of the Development  Production andStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons andToxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.In place of the use and threat of force  more and morenations have resorted to dialogue and reconciliation indealing with disputes among themselves or with theirneighbours  even in the case of conflicts which the“realistic” had considered to be insoluble. Almostthroughout its entire existence  the United Nations has beenseized with the conflicts in the Middle East. But only fourdays ago  Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization with the approbation of other States in the area  tookanother significant step on the difficult road to peace. InSouth Africa  where a minority regime long oppressed themajority with systematic cruelty  a multiracial Governmentnow administers the country with success that has surpassedeven the world’s most fervent expectations. In LatinAmerica  old territorial disputes are now the subject ofdialogue and consultation.In our own region  the political settlement of theconflict in Cambodia and the emergence of an electedgovernment in that long-suffering country stand ascrowning achievements of the United Nations  as well as ofthe countries of the region — a triumph of negotiation overthe force of arms. We welcome the accord that was sopainstakingly crafted a year ago to avert the developmentof nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula. We urge theresumption of serious talks between North and South Koreaas a further contribution to peace and reconciliation in ourregion. The Government of Myanmar has agreed on acease-fire and has undertaken negotiations with all but oneof the minority nationalities in Myanmar  a remarkabledevelopment in a country riven by inter-ethnic conflict forso long.Matching the spread of the spirit of dialogue andreconciliation  faith in the efficacy of market forces andeconomic liberalization as a condition and stimulant ofdevelopment has been sweeping the world. Policiesarising from this faith have unleashed the productiveenergies of many of the world’s people  a developmentlargely responsible for the remarkable economic growthof countries in many parts of the world. Liberalization ofinternational economic transactions and the resultinginterdependence of the global economy have raised thestake of nations in one another’s prosperity and have thusconsiderably brightened the prospects of enduring stabilityand peace. Thus  the Asia-Pacific Economic CooperationCouncil  of which the Philippines is an active foundingparticipant  is devoted solely to economic collaboration.But one of its salutary by-products is thestrengthening of peace and security in the Asia-Pacificregion  for now APEC participants have a growing stakein one another’s economic progress and political stability.We find in my country  the Philippines  a microcosmof the global trend of political reconciliation  economicliberalization  and regionalism. The peace talks that weare undertaking with rebel groups in the spirit of nationalreconciliation have brought a new stability to the country providing the atmosphere of tranquillity so necessary forthe resurgence of the economy.The military rebels have availed themselves of aprogramme of amnesty. Many of them now pursue theirambitions for the country through the legal politicalsystem  with one of them recently elected as a Senator ofthe Republic. The Government has been negotiating inEurope with the self-exiled leaders of the CommunistParty  which is now legal in the Philippines and whosemembers are free to contest Philippine elections.With the assistance of the Committee of Six of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  under thechairmanship of Indonesia  negotiations are taking placewith the Moro National Liberation Front. Thesenegotiations have resulted in a cease-fire and agreementon more than 80 per cent of the points at issue. Peace inthe southern Philippines has made possible anextraordinary surge in the economic growth of thatregion. We have opened wide the doors to the Philippineeconomy  welcoming foreign investment  letting in thebracing wind of foreign competition. We have lowered17our barriers to trade in fulfilment of internationalcommitments or through unilateral measures.One of the results of these structural reforms is agrowth rate that is respectable even by the standards of ourfast-growing region. There are bright prospects for thecontinuation of this growth rate because it proceeds fromsolid policy foundations and is taking place within a systemof pluralistic democracy  respect for human rights  and therule of law.We have strengthened our bonds with our neighbours through the Association of South-East Asian Nations aboveall. We have dealt with border questions and territorialdisputes  including the conflicting claims in the SouthChina Sea  through peaceful dialogue and consultation.The general improvement in global security  the risingtide of global prosperity  and the intensification of regionalcooperation should give rise to hope  but it should notinduce complacency  as new threats have arisen to confrontus and old ones have swollen in magnitude and virulence.The dissolution of power blocs has unleashed latenttribalism that had been under authoritarian constraint. Oneof the most savage manifestations of this has been takingplace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.International terrorism has become a global menace.The illicit trade in drugs undermines the fabric of society.Trafficking in women and children is a crime that cries outfor international cooperative countermeasures.The recent resumption of nuclear testing by two of thenuclear-weapon States poses an immediate threat topeople’s health  the natural environment  and thenon-proliferation regime. We repeat our condemnation ofthese tests and ask that they stop — now and forever.Even as the notion of economic liberalization has beenalmost universally embraced as a condition and catalyst fordevelopment  many countries have resorted to inventivemeasures of disguised protectionism. Numerous developingcountries continue to labour  like Sisyphus  under thecrushing burden of foreign debt.Shortages of labour in resource-rich or rapidlyindustrializing economies have induced the large-scalemigration of workers across national boundaries. Theirpresence in foreign lands has placed them in positions ofvulnerability that require international cooperation for theprotection of their rights and dignity as human beings.The Philippines calls upon all States to ratify theInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rightsof All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.The Philippines is at one with the Group of 77 in callingfor a United Nations-sponsored global conference oninternational migration.My delegation intends to pursue with great vigourGeneral Assembly resolutions on violence against womenmigrant workers and on trafficking in women and girls.These are some of the more outstanding challengesthat confront the United Nations as it enters its secondhalf-century and approaches the next millennium. TheUnited Nations  however  cannot respond to thechallenges of today and the next century with theorganization and procedures of 50 years ago. The natureof the new threats to international peace and securityrequires a review of United Nations peace-keepingoperations in order to streamline them and make themmore effective.At this stage  I must stress that  whatever measuresare agreed upon  they must be financed adequately  inproportion to the capacity and degree of responsibility ofMember States and not by sacrificing any developmentprogrammes.The United Nations is in a desperate financialsituation. We cannot demand that it fulfil tasks that weare unwilling to finance. We cannot simply use the UnitedNations and then withhold from it the resources neededfor its effective functioning. Year after year  we call forbetter management of the United Nations. The Philippinessupports this call  and strongly articulated its position inthis Hall last year.At the same time  we must point out that the UnitedNations cannot be managed efficiently if it is constantlyuncertain of the resources available to it. We thereforeappeal to all Member States  particularly the largercontributors  to make up their arrears  to pay their dues and to pay on time.We have of late heard the proposition that in tryingto achieve economy and efficiency in the United Nationswe should look to the economic and social area  to thosebodies whose mandate is to advance the interests of thedeveloping countries — abolishing agencies here  guttingprogrammes there. We support the streamlining ofmultilateral development institutions and programmes. Butwe cannot accept moves to abolish the development18agencies in the name of the ""division of labour"" or“comparative advantage”. What the international communityneeds to do with respect to these agencies — and theBretton Woods institutions and the regional developmentbanks — is to augment their resources  not to reduce them.We deplore the position of some Powers that refuse to raisetheir contributions to the international and regional financialinstitutions  but in their desire to maintain a dominant rolein those bodies prevent others from increasing their ownshare.We have all come to this session ready to address thequestion of reform of the structure of the Security Council.The Council’s structure is no longer adequate to meet thenew and enlarged demands upon its mandate and no longerreflects the size and composition of the United Nations. ThePhilippines fully supports the enlargement of the Council’smembership in order to ensure the equitable representationof all regions and of the developing countries.Any reform  however  must go beyond the question ofmembership. The question of the veto must be reviewed  asmust the Council’s working methods and procedures  inorder to ensure the greatest transparency possible and theparticipation of as broad a range of countries as possible.The vital nature of its decisions requires no less.At the same time  the growing importance of the roleof the United Nations requires that its membership  as wellas its functions  reflect the realities of today. Accordingly we need to consider the proposition that  in the highinterests of universality  no significant group of peopleshould be left without representation in the United Nations.In this fiftieth year  as we recall the foundingprinciples and fundamental goals of our Organization  as wereview its mandate and as we assess its strengths andweaknesses  its achievements and shortcomings  we mustnever lose sight of the fact that all our labours in theUnited Nations have as their centre and object the humanperson — his or her security  dignity and well-being —above ideology  above religion  above even the State itself.With the shrinking of this planet Earth  a processhelped in no small measure by the United Nations itself hundreds of millions more people are crying out for theirown empowerment and for the universal respect of theirrights and dignity.In this fiftieth year of our Organization  we in theUnited Nations must heed their cry if we are to keep faithwith its mandate and mission."
"131",5639,"PNG",50,1995,"It is anhonour for me to address this Assembly on behalf ofPapua New Guinea and in my capacity as the Chairmanof the South Pacific Forum  which met three weeks ago.At the outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral upon his election to preside over theGeneral Assembly at this session  which also marks thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations; and tocongratulate also his predecessor for the efficiency andfairness with which he conducted the forty-ninth session.In my capacity as the Chairman of the South PacificForum and on behalf of Papua New Guinea  I warmlywelcome the Republic of Palau  a sister country from ourregion  as the 185th Member of the United Nations.As we mark this fiftieth anniversary  our celebrationsare tempered by the fact that many of the dreams and idealsof the United Nations remain elusive. A world of greaterfreedom  prosperity and security - the fundamental goals ofthe United Nations Charter - unfortunately has not yet beenattained. Much remains to be achieved by the UnitedNations  and that  to a great degree  depends on thecollective support of each and every Member nation.Papua New Guinea retains a strong belief that theinternational community cannot do without the UnitedNations  despite its shortcomings. If it was necessary in theaftermath of the Second World War  it is even more sotoday. In 50 years  the United Nations has contributedimmensely to positive international interactions and hasprovided the codes of conduct that today we take forgranted in our international dealings.As one of many countries governed under the watchfuleye of the United Nations before becoming a full Memberat independence  Papua New Guinea is firmly committed torejuvenating and strengthening the world’s paramountinternational Organization.Everything that needs to be said for the good ofhumanity has been said many times over in this very Hall.Noble and practical sentiments have always been expressed often in the strongest terms. What too often have beenlacking are political will and international statesmanship.Therein lies the difference between wishful thinking andturning our hopes and dreams for humanity into reality.On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  I am proud to say that Papua New Guineapledges full commitment to the principles and objectives ofthe Organization.We should together strive to build a better world forthis generation and for those to come  in the next 50 yearsand beyond. In areas where the United Nations has beensuccessful  we have to recommit ourselves  and where ithas not been successful  now is the time to correct andrebuild inadequate systems. Our ultimate objective must beto promote a more effective  more accountable  moreresponsible and more caring United Nations  capable ofmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.We must consider very carefully how we should usherin and embrace the twenty-first century. The end of onecentury and the beginning of another provides us with anatural period of reflection and self-examination. It is timeto resolve to untangle  and rid ourselves of  all that hasstopped us from creating a better world.For that reform  we require a fresh start with greaterdetermination  less cynicism  and hearts open more widelyto the plight of all humanity. That is our collectivechallenge between now and the year 2000. Theinternational community must demonstrate the necessaryresolve  courage  vision and moral will to make this worlda better place.In setting the agenda for a better future  we mustfirst understand our shared history. We must know thatwithin the United Nations  our collective search for truepeace is deeply rooted in events that took place justmonths before this Organization came into existence.I speak of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima andNagasaki. They did not just change our world forever —these events changed the very way we think. Effectivelythe closing acts of the Second World War  they forcedupon the world an urgency in the search for peace. It isan urgency that has never been lost  as morality and theheart of man battle to keep pace with technology in all itsforms.It is a race that the United Nations is running. It isa race that it cannot afford to lose.If peace is in the hearts of men  and men in turn arethe heart of nations  and nations the heart of the world then we must fully realize just how profound a change wemust undergo to find true peace. The extent to which theworld discovers and embraces peace will be reflected inthe way it faces up to other threats to humanity.One of the challenges that I believe is eating awayat the health and lives of all nations is the abuse ofdrugs — and it truly is a world problem.The drug trade preys upon the youth of the world shattering the lives of individuals and the peace andprosperity of communities. It has truly established its ownfoul “united nations”.The criminals — and they are criminals of thelowest order — have broken down barriers of nationality politics  race  religion and culture far more successfullythan has this Assembly  as they ply their evil trade.The networks they have established makemultinational corporate giants look like small players  and2have become so entrenched that they can be met only withan equally determined and broad-based internationalresponse.That task must be placed at the door of the UnitedNations because  quite simply  no other group  no nation can take them on alone.Victory in the battle against the drug barons willrequire the same qualities needed in every other seriousendeavour of the United Nations — political will andcollective determination. Without these factors  we risklosing generations to destructive substance abuse. The priceis too high. We must fight as one against this evil.It is battles such as this that collectively we must takeup. If we do not commit ourselves to fights for decencysuch as this one  we will never find the courage required toattain true life and peace in this world.On the question of the expansion of the SecurityCouncil membership  we urge the five permanent membersof the Council to join us in looking critically at thecontinuing relevance of their privileged positions and toconsider how the Security Council might operate moreeffectively.Papua New Guinea fully supports the permanentmembership of Japan and Germany on the SecurityCouncil.We are also aware of the need to support sharedobjectives and decisions with adequate resources. We areespecially concerned that the ongoing financial difficultiesshould be resolved promptly  so that the United Nations canfunction to its full capacity.No one should rest satisfied while we are faced withthe perpetuation of social and economic disparities betweenand within nations — largely the result of parochialinterests being pursued at the expense of genuine humanconcerns.It is precisely this short-sightedness that has resultedin United Nations failure in some areas in the past.Decency and justice must prevail in fact  and not justin words.Papua New Guinea  as an active participant in andbeneficiary of the Lome Convention between the EuropeanUnion (EU) and the African Caribbean Pacific Group ofStates (ACP)  is greatly honoured to currently hold thepresidency and the chairmanship of all Lome Conventioninstitutions  including the ACP-EU Joint Assembly  theACP Council of Ministers and the ACP Committee ofAmbassadors.We feel confident that we will play a substantiverole  under the Lome Convention  in addressing theseinequities. We are also hopeful that the international tradeand economic situation will improve with the advent ofthe World Trade Organization  with protections to ensurethat the weak are not manipulated by the strong.The problems of debt management and servicingcontinue to plague many developing countries. In tryingto address them  we do not believe there are universalsolutions. Every case must be dealt with individually andon its own merits. To do otherwise will simply causeserious social and political dislocation.In this regard  international lending institutions suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund(IMF) should demonstrate the requisite sensitivity andtact. We do not believe there is a single recipe for allproblems  particularly as they relate to structuraladjustment programmes of the type which we in PapuaNew Guinea have only recently ploughed through andadopted  after refinements to meet our own particularcircumstances.We live in a rapidly changing world  and it is aworld dogged by confusion and distortion as it strugglesto set new bounds of acceptability and compatibility.With the decline of the cold war  our optimistichearts thought we might at long last enter a period ofpeace  security and prosperity. Much of that optimism hastoday given way to doubt and concern.The challenge to the resolve and the resources of theUnited Nations is arguably as great as it has ever been —in Bosnia  the former Soviet Union  Rwanda  Somalia andelsewhere.Some of these trouble-spots have highlighted theUnited Nations problems and been a source of acuteembarrassment to the United Nations  which has too oftenbeen reduced to shameful impotence. The tragedy — theoverwhelming tragedy — of this is that lives have beenlost; people have died in huge numbers. The simple factis that so many of them would still be alive today if the3United Nations had more effectively fulfilled its role onceit had decided to intervene.When we lay this accusation at the door of the UnitedNations  let us make no mistake about it: we do not andcannot distance ourselves from these failings. We  themembers  are the United Nations. We are responsible forwhat it does  or fails to do. We must lay much blame at thedoor of the Member States which  collectively  have solacked political will and moral courage.The reforms that will bring about increased politicalwill and a more humanitarian view must occur within eachand every Member nation. As the United Nations celebratesits fiftieth anniversary  we would like to stress that if itwants to be a true world forum  then it should exclude nocountry  large or small.At a time when reconciliation is supersedingconfrontation the United Nations  in accordance with thespirit of preventive diplomacy  should do its best to easethe tensions between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Peaceand prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region are at stake.On a global scale  we thought there was a hope forpeace and prosperity on the horizon when the internationalcommunity gathered in Rio for the Earth Summit onEnvironment and Sustainable Development.We all pledged and acknowledged at the Rio Summitthat something had to be done  because humanity wasendangered by environmental degradation and climatechange  and we adopted “Agenda 21” as the frameworkdocument.All Governments took the document firmly in hand but sadly their grip today appears to have slackened.This experience and others call into question theusefulness of further global conferences  when the resultsof the ones already held are so generally disappointing.We have had all the special world conferences  suchas the ones in Barbados on small island developing States in Cairo on population  in Copenhagen on social issues  inBerlin on climate change and the recent Fourth WorldConference on Women  held in Beijing — although infairness to the latter  we should give it more time toproduce results. We should consider a moratorium on suchgatherings until we begin to see practical benefits comingthrough. The talking has been done; it is now time foraction.Environmental issues have become an all-encompassing international agenda. In the context of aninterdependent world  we have a collective responsibilityguided by the framework of international conventions tomanage and develop our resources sustainably. The goalsof sustainable development can be realized only througheffective intergovernmental cooperation and throughregional and international efforts.For its part  the South Pacific Forum  made up of 16nations  including Palau  which joined at the most recentForum  has adopted both national and regional strategiesto develop and implement environmentally soundprogrammes. Together with our fellow members of theMelanesian Spearhead Group  we have become party tothe Lakatoro Declaration on Oceania Cooperation onDenuclearization.Papua New Guinea and the other 15 members of theSouth Pacific Forum recently expressed extreme outrageat the French Government’s resumption of nuclear testingat Mururoa and resolved to review the status of theirdialogue with France. In total disregard of our stand France detonated its second nuclear test  at FangataufaAtoll  at 9.30 a.m.  Papua New Guinea time  on Monday 2 October 1995. Consistent with the resolution of theSouth Pacific Forum nations  I now  regrettably  in mycapacity as Chairman of the Forum  announce thesuspension forthwith of all post-Forum dialogue withFrance.I am pleased to report that the twenty-sixth SouthPacific Forum paid close attention to the changed regionaland world security situation. The Forum’s concept paper“Securing Development Beyond 2000” looked at securityissues well beyond the scope of military threats andmilitary solutions. We focused on increasing security ona sustainable basis by promoting trade  transport andtourism in and for our region. We addressed the need forregional arrangements on environmental damage  naturaldisasters and other emergencies; as a result  we areworking to have a comprehensive and detailed plan ofaction for the region.That is a Forum document to which we are party;but for Papua New Guinea’s part  we have our ownnational guiding document  “The Pacific Plan”  for ourrelations with our Pacific neighbours.In considering Pacific issues  the Forum wasconscious that small island States are very vulnerable andhave unusual needs. Their economies are constantly under4threat from natural disasters such as cyclones  volcanoesand the looming danger of rising sea levels. When suchStates are hit by cyclones  it is akin to the ravages of war and their economies and infrastructures face severe strainsthat seriously hamper and set back their development.Papua New Guinea therefore appeals to the internationalcommunity to render support consistent with the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States to assist their efforts toachieve greater self-reliance.Small nations  including many in the Pacific  havesuffered from declining international concern since the endof the cold war. Geo-economic considerations have largelyreplaced the geo-political considerations of the past  withnew webs of alignment replacing the old and familiar ones.This has forced regionalistic tendencies upon nations  whichin some respects has crippled moves towards a true globalpartnership.Member nations will be aware of the internal crisisthat Papua New Guinea has faced on Bougainville  one thathas demanded enormous energy  time  patience andresources from the Government of my country. I ampleased to inform the Assembly that my Government  sincetaking office in August of last year  has wholeheartedlysought a successful resolution to the Bougainville situation so far with notable success. Please allow me to express theappreciation of the people and the Government of PapuaNew Guinea to the United Nations  and to theSecretary-General’s office in particular  for the cooperationand understanding extended to us throughout this process.I am thinking particularly of the support the United Nationsoffered to the Bougainville Peace Conference of Octoberlast year  which  I am pleased to say  with the comingtogether of the South Pacific peace-keeping force  put fleshon the words of the Secretary-General on the value ofregional approaches to conflict resolution. I believe thattoday the benefits of that wise policy are there for all to seein the situation on Bougainville  which has vastly improvedover the past 12 months.We also wish to assure the international community ofour absolute commitment to human rights in dealing withthis situation  as guaranteed in our Constitution. Indeed  itis a fundamental regard for the right of all our people tolive free and peaceful lives that has driven me and myGovernment to search tirelessly for a resolution to thiscrisis.There is no such thing as a minority group in PapuaNew Guinea because we come from numerous and diverselinguistic  cultural and social backgrounds. We have over800 tribes and languages among 4 million people  in acountry the size of Malaysia. In effect  we are allminorities in our land. As such  every group has alegitimate place in Papua New Guinea.For us and for other developing nations  the focus ofsocial issues falls squarely on the question of empoweringpeople to eradicate poverty  get an education and livehealthy lives. When that is achieved  the people are thenin a position to expand their participation in the socialand economic development of their nation. Without thosebasics  theirs is simply a battle for survival.Increasing marginalization of the poor and ofminorities remains a major problem within every country regardless of economic or political status. We support theview that a new paradigm of development has to redefinethe needs of people in terms of securing the basics of lifesuch as housing  food and water. This can be achievedonly by empowering people through decision-making andthrough direct participation in the development process.In that connection  I wish to draw the attention ofthe Assembly to a report to be prepared by theSecretary-General on the United Nations initiative onopportunity and participation  which I hope will receivethe serious consideration it deserves.One of the hallmarks of United Nations achievementhas been the decolonization of peoples under colonialdomination. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations  we can proudly testify that theUnited Nations has generally fulfilled its duties andresponsibilities with respect to the decolonization process.My country and many others represented in this Hall aretestimony to the honourable achievements of thisOrganization in decolonization. Less than three weeks agomy people joyfully celebrated the twentieth anniversary ofthe independence of Papua New Guinea.While we acknowledge and commend the UnitedNations for its decolonization achievements  its task is notyet complete. There are still many Territories undercolonial domination of one form or another. Inrecognition of the unfinished task relating to colonialism the General Assembly has adopted a resolutionproclaiming the International Decade for the Eradicationof Colonialism. This carries great hope for those who arestill under the yoke of colonialism.5The end of apartheid in South Africa brought a greatsense of relief and enlightenment  not just there butthroughout the world. In that vein  colonialism — anotherblight on humanity — should be done away with andconsigned to the pages of history as a degradingphenomenon of a bygone age.There is a need to take a case-by-case approach inaddressing the problems of the Territories under colonialadministration to ensure that the wishes of the peopleconcerned are adequately and realistically taken intoaccount in determining their eventual political status.In our immediate region  we are keen to see thedecolonization process in New Caledonia allowed to take itsdue course  consistent with United Nations principles andpractices. While we acknowledge the progressive attitudetaken by the French Government with regard to NewCaledonia  we are concerned that certain negative andcounter-productive policies still exist. In that regard  we callon France to fulfil its decolonization responsibilities quicklyand with dignity.The eradication of colonialism before the year 2000will place us on a more enlightened plateau. It will makethe world a better place  more equipped to take on thechallenges of the future with justice and dignity for all.The United Nations undoubtedly stands for humanity.It provides the best possible avenue to peace  security andprosperity. While we all acknowledge the worthy objectivesof the United Nations Charter  no country can claim that ithas given full and complete support to the Organization.Unfortunately  the United Nations has time and againbeen used for parochial pursuits  whether in respect ofpeace-keeping  human rights or environmental areas or inSecurity Council deliberations. In this very imperfect world it would be naive to have ever expected perfect solutionsfrom the United Nations. I say again that it is  however  anOrganization that my Government strongly believes theinternational community cannot do without. If the UnitedNations did not exist  we would have to invent it. Fiftyyears on  our task is to reinvent it  to make it better  toallow it to fully and ably serve humanity. This is a mostnoble goal that must be pursued with pragmatic intensityand determination.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is thetime for each and every Member nation to recommit itselfto the purposes and principles of the United NationsCharter. We must do it for peace  and with the vividrecollection of Hiroshima and Nagasaki never far way. Ifwe are to welcome the new century as we should  thenthe United Nations Charter provides the yardstick for thechallenges ahead.There are many global issues confronting us today and the United Nations provides us with the bestchance — the only chance — of handling themsuccessfully. So let us act for the sake of all humanity. Inthis global age we must mend our ways. We must thinkwith global heads and attend to humanity’s needs withglobal hearts. Only then will our attitudes have kept pacewith the realities we face. Only then can we leave a betterworld for our children."
"132",5685,"POL",50,1995,"At the outset  Ishould like to express warm congratulations to thePresident of the General Assembly  His ExcellencyMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  a distinguished statesmanand eminent jurist from friendly Portugal.We also follow with particular appreciation theactions of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose dedication to the cause of peace andeconomic and social development meets with universalapproval.Three months ago  the celebrations of the fiftiethanniversary of our Organization were inaugurated at ameeting of Nobel Prize winners in San Francisco. Fiftyyears have passed since the end of the Second WorldWar  which began with the aggression of the forces of theThird Reich against Poland in the early hours of 1September 1939. As a historian and also an eyewitness tothose days  I have a moral right to recall from thisrostrum that it was Poland that put a stop to appeasement a policy that was futile then and is futile today  a policywhich  in the long run at any rate  never pays  anywhere.For Poland  the first victim of the Second WorldWar  that war lasted the longest: five years  eight monthsand eight days. It ended in victory  but a victory whichdid not bring the Polish people complete freedom. It wasonly 45 years later that we achieved the goal for whichPolish patriots had fought with dedication: a free andsovereign State in a new  democratic Europe.5Already during that most terrible of wars to date thought was being given to peace and ways of making itendure. Mindful of their tragic wartime experiences peoples and States sought to rid the world once and forever of wars and the sufferings they inflict. That is how theUnited Nations was born. From the very start  Poland  afounding Member  has played an active part in the activitiesof the Organization  whose principal purposes were topreserve and consolidate international peace and security ensure peaceful social and economic development and theright to a decent existence and promote respect for humanrights.The cold war and East-West bipolarity swiftly dashedthe newborn hopes for the relaxation of tensions and peaceuntroubled by political or ideological disputes. Although happily  a global nuclear cataclysm has not come to pass for which much of the credit is undeniably due to theUnited Nations  post-war history abounds with tensions  andhumanity has  more than once  found itself on the brink oftotal war. Instead of providing for recovery from theravages of war and for human well-being  increasingresources were spent on maintaining a singular balance —the balance of terror through the arms race. The world wasdivided at Yalta into two hostile camps. Many States  inCentral Europe for instance  ended up in the Eastern blocagainst the will of their people. If I refer to Yalta  it is notmeant as a reproach for a pact that was so heinous forPoland: it is as a warning against future Yaltas  whereverthey might be concluded or whomever they might threaten.We want a Europe without political or other divisions  fortheir consequences would be the same.Following the geopolitical transformations thatoriginated in Poland in the 1980s and proved unstoppablein the face of the aspirations to freedom of the peoples ofthat part of Europe and of Asia  the world has becomeinfinitely safer. East-West confrontation has disappeared for ever  it is hoped  and the terms “East” and “West” haveregained their old  purely geographical connotations. Yetthe world  though no longer bipolar  has not been freedfrom conflicts. Hitherto dormant or suppressed  tides ofnationalism have surfaced with renewed vigour  oftenfuelled by intolerance  ethnic and religious strife or outrightracism.Six years after the commencement in 1989 of greatchanges in the world political map  the anticipated newinternational order has failed to materialize. The UnitedNations and all its Members are still actively looking foreffective and equitable answers to the new problems thathave emerged since the end of the cold war. These politicalchanges present a unique opportunity to build a newsystem of peaceful cooperation  not of mere coexistence.Our desire is to seek a new world order  one that willensure full security to all States and provide conditionsfor their swift social and economic development  while atthe same time giving all individuals the opportunity toexercise fully their human rights  to which they areentitled. Of course  there would not be room for any kindof intolerance  manifestations of ethnic  religious or racialhatred  including shameful anti-Semitism.Poland is aware of  and acknowledges  themomentous role which the United Nations plays in therealization of these goals. An Organization founded by 51States has grown to become a universal structureembracing almost all the countries of the globe. It is however  not only the number of Members that haschanged: its tasks have also kept growing steadily. Whileoriginally the political military question anddecolonization predominated  in time the scope of UnitedNations interests widened  and today it would be hard toidentify a single domain where the United Nations systemis not involved. Expectations of the United Nations havegrown likewise  often excessively  since they were notbacked by sufficient political will to provide theOrganization with appropriate instruments  which areindispensable if it is to live up to these expectations. Ihave in mind one of the basic fields of United Nationsactivities — conflict prevention and settlement. Here theUnited Nations lends itself relatively easily to attack. Oneoverlooks  however  how much the character of conflictsnow confronting the international community haschanged. Conventional conflicts between States are nowincreasingly giving way to internal conflicts  as inRwanda  in Somalia and  up to a point  in the formerYugoslavia. The traditional mediation role of the UnitedNations peace-keeping forces  discharged with the consentof the parties to a conflict  has frequently becomeimpossible in present-day conditions. In many cases United Nations peace-keeping missions come up againstthe dilemma of having to depart from the principle ofnon-interference in the internal affairs of a State tornapart by civil war. Should one remain indifferent andignore human suffering in such a situation? It is we  theStates Members of the United Nations  which are oftencalled upon to answer this question unequivocally  and weare not always able to do so. Inevitably  this adverselyaffects the success of the mission  the blame for which isall too often and all too easily placed on the UnitedNations. One tends to forget that we are the UnitedNations.6Poland takes the view that when a direct threat isposed to international peace and security  the UnitedNations — if it is to be an efficient instrument of collectivesecurity in accordance with the Charter — must beequipped to do its job. We can draw up a long list ofconflicts and wars which were brought to an end thanks toUnited Nations efforts. Millions of human lives have beensaved  owing to humanitarian relief action organized by theUnited Nations — but an equally long list can be producedof undertakings which ended in failure. The fiftiethanniversary should  no doubt  prompt critical reflection onthe subject. Defeats and mistakes must not lead to theabdication of efforts. They should encourage the taking ofsteps to reform and remodel what must be changed  andthus make the United Nations a truly modern Organization adapted to new circumstances and measuring up to therequirements of the period and its challenges.In today’s interconnected and interdependent world even the most powerful nations cannot cope alone withsuch global issues as  for example  the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  the spread of drugs  hungerand poverty  the pollution of the environment  acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)  and increasinglyrampant terrorism — in short  all the ills that are appearingas we approach the end of the century. Consequently  weneed to bolster the trend towards enhancement ofmultilateral institutions  including the United Nations and itssystem. It was in this spirit that the President of Poland Lech Walesa  spoke at San Francisco last June when hereferred to the Organization’s shortcomings in criticalterms.Poland is not only playing its full role in this process:the creation of a new international order is the focal pointof its foreign policy at the subregional  regional and globallevels. Fully sovereign and independent  today’s Poland isone of the largest and most populous countries in Centraland Eastern Europe. It strives actively to contribute toensuring the stability of a region of importance toEurope — a region that forms a natural geographical cultural and economic bridge between Europe’s historicallyevolved parts. Hence  the basic task of the foreign policy ofthe Republic of Poland is active participation in  and acreative contribution to  the building of a new Europe —one without divisions and conflicts  ensuring well-being andsecurity to all its inhabitants.In practice  this policy is manifested in unremittingefforts to integrate Poland into European and Atlanticstructures  in acknowledgement of their role as guarantorsof the security  stability  democracy and economicdevelopment of our continent.The priority of our foreign policy agenda is entryinto the European Union. The Union had its origins in thedays of the Marshall Plan  to which Poland declared itsaccessibility; this was subsequently withdrawn underpressure from outside. Because of the systemicdifferences and the delay in economic and socialdevelopment that ensued in the intervening years  theprocess of adaptation is bound to be difficult  costly andprotracted. We are  however  convinced that this is nottoo high a price to pay for joining a regional organizationwhich  more than any other in history  has been able toensure its members — apart from political integration —prosperity  a high level of social security and the higheststandards of protection of individual rights and freedoms.Expansion eastwards by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and the European Union issynonymous with the consolidation of the zone ofstability in this once conflict-prone region.In a foreign policy statement in the PolishParliament four months ago  I said that Poland was notpursuing  and would not pursue  two different foreignpolicies: one Western and the other Eastern. In otherwords  while seeking to join Western European structures we attach great importance to cultivating friendly relationsand all-round cooperation both with our immediate andwith our more distant neighbours. We are pursuingcooperation with these States within the framework of theexisting subregional organizations and are working for itsexpansion. We are bound to our neighbours by treaties ofgood-neighbourly relations  friendship and cooperation.We will spare no effort to eradicate as soon as possibleall vestiges of mutual prejudice and any grievances stillharboured by our societies.Poland attaches major importance to theconsolidation and expansion of such all-Europeanorganizations as the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the Council of Europe and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe(ECE). We support the OSCE role in resolving armedconflicts in our part of the world  in cooperation with theUnited Nations. We therefore welcome with satisfactionthe Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal established bythe OSCE last May. Our active participation in the workof the Council of Europe results from our strong beliefthat it is of enormous importance in the process ofdissemination  reinforcement and development of7democratic institutions and mechanisms for the protectionof human rights on our continent.Finally  reference must be made to Poland’scontribution to the work of the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe. Thanks to its long experience inefforts to overcome the economic divisions that Europeinherited from the recent past  the ECE has a role to playin the process of the economic integration of Europe.At the same time  I wish to declare Poland’s strongsupport for the useful activities of the regional commissionsin general. They should be responsible for coordinating  ineach region  the local projects of the United Nationssystem  especially its specialized agencies  and becomeregional focal points for the promotion of sustainablegrowth and human development. The same applies to suchsubregional initiatives as the Central European Initiative the Council of the Baltic Sea States  and the CentralEuropean Free Trade Association.While concentrating  understandably enough  onproblems connected with the transformation of our politicaland economic systems  Poland is paying due attention todevelopment processes and trends in the world at large. Weare systematically expanding our economic and politicalcontacts with nations on other continents. We areincreasingly concerned at the scale of the economicproblems looming in North-South relations. Thedevelopment disparities and contrasts in this area call for anurgent intensification of the efforts of the whole world  andthe more advanced countries in particular. We are notalways in a position to provide developing countries withaid matching their expectations  but we shall provide it tothe extent we can.We note with satisfaction the vitality of the Non-Aligned Movement  which has been cooperating with theUnited Nations for many years and which  despite so manychanges  remains unfailingly active on the internationalstage. This Movement played a paramount role in bringingthe era of colonialism to an end  has successfully assistedyoung nations to secure their rightful place in the world andis now laying the foundations for a new era of post-cold-war relations between States  free of global confrontation.Over the last three years  under the presidency of Indonesia the Non-Aligned Movement has ably redirected its prioritiesin order to focus its attention on economic development. Itembarked on this task on the basis of fruitful dialogue withthe developed countries and has greatly contributed tonarrowing the gap between the latter and the nations itrepresents. We take note in particular of the spectacularprogress made by the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) in terms of development  and weacknowledge its efforts to extinguish old conflicts andprevent new ones  to build confidence and to search fornew security formulas. Poland is interested in politicaldialogue and economic cooperation with this group ofStates  both bilaterally and within a broader Europe-Asiaformula. Central Europe also has many characteristics andinterests in common with the States of Latin America andtheir groupings. At the last session of the Economic andSocial Council we gave forceful expression to oursolidarity with Africa. We believe that cooperation with and the provision of assistance to  the African continentis in the best interests of the international community.For its part  Poland is fully conscious of itsobligations to the world community  as manifested by itsactive participation in the work of the United Nations —an organization where States  large  small and medium-sized  like Poland  participate democratically  as far asthey can  in a mutual effort to transform the world. Weare prepared to assume additional obligations in regard tointernational peace and security. That is why we have putforward our candidacy for non-permanent membership ofthe Security Council in the elections to be held during thecurrent session of the General Assembly.Consistent with the obligations embodied in theCharter of the United Nations  the maintenance ofinternational peace and security is central to Poland’sforeign policy. Proof of our commitment to this goal hasbeen the participation  since the 1950s  of soldiers andofficers of the Polish army in United Nations peace-keeping operations  and more recently in those launchedunder the auspices of the OSCE.For many years now  Poland has traditionally beenamong the 10 States fielding the largest contingents inUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  despite itsmounting financial problems due to the growing delays inthe reimbursement of the expenses incurred. Poland isgravely concerned at the increasingly frequent instancesof disregard for the status of peace-keeping personnel such as Blue Helmets being attacked or taken hostage foruse as human shields  a practice of which United Nationsmilitary observers from Poland have also been thevictims. It is for this reason that the entry into force ofthe relevant Convention and its rigorous observance areextremely urgent.It is also essential to streamline the functioning ofpeace-keeping operations. We note with satisfaction the8progress already made in this field. However  recent eventsin the former Yugoslavia demonstrate the need for furthersteps to be taken to ensure the effectiveness of action especially in emergency situations. This issue is particularlytopical in view of the multiplication of extremely bloodyand dangerous internal armed conflicts. The evidentimpotence of the international community in such situationsis due to the fact that  as numerous examples in the last fewyears bear out  international organizations  by their verynature  are not prepared for active intervention in internalconflicts. These examples also demonstrate that the onlypossible basis for the resolution of an internal conflict is anaccord between the warring parties. We therefore believethat the primary task of the United Nations is to striveunflaggingly  as it has often done so effectively in the past to bring the parties to a conflict to the negotiating table  tobroker an agreement between them and to supervise itsimplementation. The relevance of preventive diplomacy toboth intra-State and international conflicts  and the UnitedNations role in that respect  were rightly recalled by myAustralian colleague  Senator Gareth Evans.Another key facet of international security is the issueof disarmament. In this area we welcomed  with joy andrelief  the indefinite extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  arrived at last Mayby consensus. We pay tribute to the wisdom andfarsightedness displayed by all participants  withoutexception  at the Review and Extension Conference in NewYork.The road that has brought the world to an unbelievablebuild-up of nuclear arsenals was long and costly. Today werealize that embarking on this same road in the oppositedirection  towards disarmament  will be equally long  costlyand complicated. The indefinite extension of the NPT wasan act of enormous significance. The next task — no lessdifficult and just as momentous — will be the conclusionof a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  which shouldtake place no later than in 1996. Special importance  in ourview  should also be attached to the entry into force andpractical implementation of the Convention on theprohibition of chemical weapons  an instrument whichPoland ratified last July. In all these matters  Polishdiplomacy has played  and will continue to play  an activerole.Poland believes that progress in disarmament in thefield of weapons of mass destruction should be paralleledby a simultaneous and equally tangible effort in the field ofconventional weapons  a category of arms that over the lasthalf-century has inflicted tens of millions of casualties incountless regional and internal conflicts. The inescapableconclusion is that the United Nations needs to go beyondthe limited aims of the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms and that the problems of conventionalarms control and disarmament have to be put on theagenda of the Conference on Disarmament. This isimportant not only because of the specific nature of thecontemporary conflicts the United Nations has to dealwith  but also because of the need to put an end to themounting wave of internal and international terrorism inan increasing number of countries. There can be no doubtthat terrorism and organized crime in general  as well asillegal traffic in radioactive materials and drugs  representtoday a serious threat to security. Determined action istherefore needed. Its success will depend on broadinternational cooperation within the United Nationssystem — I refer to the Vienna institutions — as well asoutside the United Nations system.Economic development is an extremely importantand  in recent years  increasingly significant sphere ofactivity of the organs of the United Nations system.Economic development problems  together with socialissues  have been the subject of a number of majorinternational conferences. The agendas of conferencesalready held and those of the ones to be convened in thenext two years address virtually all development-relatedproblems. What is now indispensable is to concentrateefforts on the conscientious and coordinatedimplementation of their decisions  a matter of whichaccount should also be taken in the planned reform of theUnited Nations system.We appreciate the incipient changes that areappearing in the attitude of the Bretton Woods institutionswith regard to the question of the social dimension ofdevelopment processes  especially the elimination ofpoverty and unemployment. These issues clearly stood outat the Copenhagen social summit and at the session of theEconomic and Social Council held in Geneva earlier thisyear. This bolsters the hope that the efforts of the poorercountries to cope with the contingencies of socio-economic development will obtain external financialsupport. We do not share the view that developingcountries or  for that matter  nations that  like Poland  arein the throes of transformation  are contributing tounemployment in the more developed parts of the world.We do not accept the argument that trade with low-wagecountries might threaten the economic stability of suchdeveloped countries. According to the findings of thelatest studies by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development  the less-developed9countries represent  first and foremost  new markets that areof interest to multinational corporations. Let me note in thisconnection that Poland has been recently classified as oneof the world’s 10 biggest emerging markets.Specific opportunities have also been created by theconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment ofthe World Trade Organization. In the short term  however the liberalization of world trade could be too great achallenge to the weakest partners  especially in Africa. Weare in favour of safety-net arrangements for countries inthis category.We also perceive a development paradox of our times:cut-backs in agricultural production in some parts of theworld because of excessive stocks of food and for purposesof checking falling prices are paralleled by the existence ofendemic famine areas in other parts of the world. In aninterdependent world such as ours  there is somethingbaffling in this situation. The United Nations should be theforum in which to address this difficult and conscience-troubling problem. The solution is not simply one ofredistribution. The crux of the matter lies in helping thesecountries to help themselves by stimulating their capacityfor self-reliance instead of perpetuating their dependence.Lastly  the third area crucial to the well-being offuture generations  to which Poland attaches particularimportance  is the question of human rights. Today  sixyears into the process of democratic change  Poland canpride itself on having a legal system which meets the mostrigorous international standards in the field of respect forand comprehensive protection of human rights.Poland has not confined itself to taking care of internalproblems in that regard. In the past few years it has beenpursuing wide-ranging activities in the United Nationsorgans concerned with human rights and the developmentof international mechanisms for their protection.Undoubtedly  in this field the Vienna Human RightsConference of 1993 was a landmark event. Polishdiplomacy was extremely active both at the preparatorystage and in the course of the Conference. From the outsetwe strongly endorsed the establishment of the Office ofHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  which was one ofthe principal achievements of the Vienna Conference. Sincethe appointment of Ambassador Ayala Lasso to thisimportant post we have given him our full cooperation andsupport.Of its very nature  the United Nations does not havethe means to force either States or armed groupings torespect the rights of citizens and to comply withinternational obligations in this field. Violations ofhumanitarian law and the laws of war are rife. The timidresponse to the systematic reports by the Human RightsCommission’s Special Rapporteur  the former PolishPrime Minister  Tadeusz Mazowiecki  of drastic violationsof human rights in the former Yugoslavia resulted in hisresignation from his mission. We note with satisfactionstatements from this rostrum recognizing the significanceof his endeavours.The upgrading of the status of human rights withinthe structure of United Nations organs  the GeneralAssembly included  is essential. The basic tasks of ourOrganization in this field should be the promotion ofpermanent international dialogue on the protection ofhuman rights  the development of mechanisms foroverseeing compliance with international obligations andthe increase of technical assistance by rich andexperienced nations to countries which lack the necessaryresources. Appropriate funds for this purpose should bemade available to the High Commissioner and the Centrefor Human Rights in Geneva.Ever since the foundation of the United Nations 50years ago the tasks facing the Organization have grown innumber and complexity. The political and economicenvironment in which these tasks have to be coped withalso keeps changing  as demonstrated by the decisions ofthe latest major Conferences — in Cairo  Copenhagen andBeijing. That calls for the continuous adaptation of theorganizational structures and procedures to new tasks andchanging circumstances. It is imperative to enhance themethods of cooperation between the United Nations andregional organizations like the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS) and the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC). Equally important is the effort furtherto develop the system of international law so that it canregulate more adequately and with greater precision therights and obligations of its subjects in the ever growingnumber of areas of their mutual relations. The importanceof these problems  United Nations reform included  hasnot escaped the attention of our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.The reform of the United Nations is therefore apressing task. It is necessary in respect of the principalorgans  the Security Council and the Economic and SocialCouncil in the first place  and the countless subsidiarybodies. Poland appreciates the results of efforts made so10far to enhance the work of the Security Council. As aresult  we have a Council which is both more efficient andmore than ever responsive to the need for greatertransparency in its proceedings. Poland wishes to express itssupport for the acceleration of steps aimed at an appropriateexpansion of the Council’s composition  to render it morerepresentative without detriment to its effectiveness. Thereform of the Organization must aim at upgrading itsefficiency and remedying its financial situation  whilekeeping intact the basic principle of the sovereign equalityof all its Members. However  the most important issue isefficiency  without forgetting that  as an intergovernmentalOrganization  the basic task of the United Nations is tocement partner-like cooperation between its Members  andrecalling that it can act only on their authority. The ultimatesuccess of the reform will be the best contribution we canmake to the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization.Let me add the voice of Poland to all those statementswhich  on the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations conveyed from this rostrum unequivocal assurances ofconfidence in the future of our Organization and in itsability to cope with the challenges that face us on thethreshold of the twenty-first century. For its part  Poland isready to participate in these efforts for the sake of futuregenerations so that  in contrast to my own  they will neverexperience war  be it hot or cold  and so that they can livein a world founded on principles of cooperation  good-neighbourly relations and mutual trust."
"133",5711,"PRK",50,1995,"On behalf of the delegation of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea  I should like firstto congratulate you  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  onyour election to the presidency of the current session ofthe General Assembly  demonstrating the deep trust andexpectation of Member States of the United Nations. It isour hope that through your efforts this session will becrowned with good results.I should also like to express appreciation to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisactivities and efforts in strengthening the United Nationsand enhancing its responsibility and role.Fifty years have passed since the end of the SecondWorld War and the foundation of the United Nations. Allthe people on our planet recall those historic days withunusual feelings.Over the last five decades  the world’s people havefollowed the path of independence and sovereignty  peaceand development  and this process has helped themfurther confirm their determination and commitment tocreate a new  free and peaceful world.For the Korean people  the last five decades havebeen a period of hard struggle against all forms ofchallenge and difficulty  and also a period of proudsuccesses and victories in realizing independence underthe banner of Juche.The entire population of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea celebrated the fiftieth anniversary ofthe founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea as a grandand victorious festival  with great national pride andconfidence  in the wake of the fiftieth anniversary ofKorea’s liberation.The strengthening and development of our Party andthe progress and prosperity of our Republic are thebrilliant fruit of the outstanding idea and wise leadership5of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung and the respectedsupreme leader Comrade Kim Jong Il.The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim IlSung devoted his whole life to the prosperity of thefatherland and the happiness of his people  to world peaceand the common cause of humankind  and performedimmortal exploits which will be recorded in the annals ofhistory. Our great leader is the saviour of our Koreannation  the Tangun nation  and the founding father ofsocialist Korea. His great revolutionary exploits will remainimmortal  along with his august name. The great leaderComrade Kim Il Sung is always with us.More than one year has passed since the death of ourrespected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il Sung  duringwhich there has been neither a political vacuum norinstability in our society  and everything has gone well inall fields — political  economic  military and cultural.Socialism of our own style  based on the Juche idea has made steady progress  since respected General KimJong Il has energetically guided all the affairs of our Partyand State  including military and foreign affairs  for morethan three decades  always working together with the greatleader Comrade Kim Il Sung for the well-being of thepeople.The respected General Kim Jong Il is the supremeleader of our Party and State and the Supreme Commanderof our revolutionary armed forces. He practices thebenevolent politics of love for and trust in the people basing himself on boundless loyalty and filial piety as wellas noble moral obligations towards the fatherly leader.It is the greatest fortune and a unique blessing ofleadership for our people to have Comrade Kim Jong Il  thegreat leader of our Party and people  as the supreme leader.Today our people absolutely respect and trust the respectedGeneral Kim Jong Il  who successfully carries forward therevolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by the fatherlyleader  and they entrust their destiny to him and marchforward vigorously under his leadership.Rallying closely around the respected supreme leaderComrade Kim Jong Il in single-hearted unity  our peoplewill make our country  our fatherland  more prosperous anddefend and glorify our own style of socialism  centred onthe popular masses  which is independent and unique  inline with the life-long teachings of the fatherly leader.It is with feelings of great pride mixed withheartbreaking bitterness that we recall the last 50 years.As the Assembly is aware  the division of thecountry and nation imposed the catastrophe of war on thenorth and south of Korea. Consequently  both sides stillsuffer from the tragedy of mistrust and confrontationtoday  when the world is moving towards détente andpeace. It is indeed aberrant that the legacy of the coldwar  dating from the 1940s  continues into the 1990s  andthere is therefore no justification whatsoever for itscontinuation. The failure of Korea’s reunification willleave the situation on the Korean peninsula indefinitelyunstable  and this will not be helpful to peace in eitherNorth-East Asia or the rest of the world.Since the early days of the national division  therespected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il Sung putforward a number of reasonable proposals for the peaceand peaceful reunification of the country and devoted allhis efforts to their realization until the last moment of hislife. In particular  15 years ago the fatherly leaderadvanced a proposal for national reunification throughconfederation  based on the concept of one nation and oneState  two systems and two Governments. This proposalfully reflects the reality in the north and south of Korea characterized by the differences in political ideas andsystems  as well as the Korean people’s desire fornational reconciliation and reunification on the principleof neither side conquering or being conquered by theother.Upholding the Ten-Point Programme for the GreatUnity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of theCountry  proposed by the respected and beloved leaderComrade Kim Il Sung  and in accordance with the threeprinciples of independence  peaceful reunification andgreat national unity and the proposal for a confederalreunification  we will make our best efforts towards theunity of the whole nation  on the basis of patriotism andthe spirit of national independence  and towards theestablishment of an independent  peaceful and neutralreunified State of Korea.There is no change in our position with respect tothe North-South dialogue. We are prepared to resume itwhen the atmosphere is created in favour of suchdialogue. However  the North-South dialogue  whichbegan after painstaking efforts  has been wrecked by theSouth Korean authorities  and the atmosphere is not yetready for the resumption of the dialogue.6When our fatherly leader passed away  Heads of Stateand Governments of the world  even those whose countrieshave no diplomatic relations with ours  expressedcondolences for his death. However  the South Koreanauthorities  far from expressing condolences for themisfortune of their fellow countrymen  ordered the wholeterritory of South Korea put on an emergency alert pointing their guns at our Republic. Worse still  theycracked down on the South Korean people who weremourning the death of the father of the nation.Nevertheless  the South Korean authority still refuses toapologize for this grave  unethical crime  because of whichhe is denied a seat at any dialogue by the Korean people inboth the north and the south  as well as abroad. If the SouthKorean authorities are sincere in their desire to havedialogue with us  all they have to do first is apologize forthe crime they have committed against their fellowcountrymen.Another main stumbling-block to the resumption ofinter-Korean dialogue and reunification is South Korea’sNational Security Law  which defines the fellowcountrymen in the north as the enemy and criminalizes anySouth Korean contacts or dialogue with the people in theNorth. The National Security Law allows no room at all forelementary rights of democracy and freedom in SouthKorea today. This medieval law is invoked to suppress andpersecute a large number of people  including youths andstudents calling for the democratization of South Koreansociety and pro-reunification patriots who have visited thenorth. This has resulted in a total freeze on and blockade ofmulti-channel dialogues  contacts and exchanges betweenthe north and south. All these facts demonstrate that as longas the National Security Law remains in place  violatinghuman rights ruthlessly and antagonizing the dialoguepartners  freedom and democracy are inconceivable inSouth Korea  and the North-South dialogue and peacefulnational reunification will be simply unfeasible.Voices calling for the abolition of the NationalSecurity Law can be heard not only in South Korea butalso in various other parts of the world. Last year theUnited States Department of State urged on two occasionsthat South Korean authorities abolish their National SecurityLaw  and many delegates called for its abolition at meetingsof the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Thereis no justification whatsoever for the maintenance of theNational Security Law  which is anachronistic and evil. Fordialogue and contacts  free travel and exchanges betweenthe north and the south of Korea  all legal and physicalbarriers  such as the National Security Law and the concretewall dividing the Korean peninsula  should be removed atan early date.The top priority on any agenda for ensuring peaceand security and hastening national reunification on theKorean peninsula is the establishment of a new peacearrangement. In this regard  as we have made clear morethan once  the outdated system of the Korean armisticeshould be replaced with a new peace arrangementbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea andthe United States  which is primarily responsible forpeace on the Korean peninsula. The north and south ofKorea adopted the Agreement on Reconciliation  Non-Aggression  Cooperation and Exchanges between theSouth and the North in December 1991  which is a defacto  written  inter-Korean peace arrangement. All thatthe north and south have to do is put into operation sucha peace arrangement that commits both sides to non-aggression.What remains to be done now is for the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea to establish a new peacearrangement with the United States  which holds the realmilitary commanding power in South Korea. This processcannot be delayed any longer  both in view of thecontemporary trend shifting towards peace and détenteand away from confrontation and in the current context ofthe implementation of the Agreed Framework between theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates.The United States must fulfil its responsibility androle in working out a new peace arrangement that willreplace the system of armistice  a typical cold-war-eralegacy still existing on the Korean peninsula. Once legaland institutional mechanisms for such a peacearrangement are in place between the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States  thetension on the Korean peninsula will be defuseddrastically. This in turn will facilitate the smoothimplementation of the inter-Korean agreement and provehelpful in stabilizing the situation in North-East Asia andthe Pacific as well.When both the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States work together with mutualtrust  they can resolve those issues that still remainoutstanding on the Korean peninsula. This has beenproved by the process of resolving the so-called nuclearissue on the Korean peninsula  about which the worldcommunity had once been deeply concerned.7The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and theUnited States signed the Agreed Framework in Geneva inOctober of 1994  and since then they have both been takingpractical steps to implement it. We have honored ourcommitment by freezing our graphite-moderated reactorsand their related facilities  and in return the United Stateshas been working towards progress with respect to thelight-water reactor project to be provided to the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and a number of other agreedareas.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has  infact  fully implemented its obligations under the AgreedFramework between the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States  and this  indeed  goes farbeyond the obligations to be fulfilled by a State signatoryto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsunder the Safeguards Agreement with the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.There will be no complicated problems that cannot beresolved smoothly if international commitments areimplemented as sincerely as the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea has done. The point at issue is how theUnited States will go about proceeding down the road  andwe are closely following the course of its actions.If the United States remains as sincere in its approachas it was during its discussions with the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea on the nuclear issue  the issuesrelating to the establishment of a new peace arrangement onthe Korean peninsula will certainly be resolved smoothly.The continuation of the armistice status in Korea stillties down the relationship between the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United Nations to continuingbelligerency. The establishment of a new peace arrangementon the Korean peninsula is a matter that deserves the dueattention of the United Nations  which has to work hard todo its part in promoting the arrangement’s realization.This is the only logical course both in terms of wipingclean the slate of the past unsavory relationship of theUnited Nations with the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea  a dignified United Nations Member State  and in thelight of implementing resolution 3390 B (XXX)  calling forthe dissolution of the United Nations Command andreplacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peaceagreement.The United Nations should do all it can to boldlyeliminate the old legacy of the cold-war era and to helpestablish a new peace arrangement on the Koreanpeninsula.I would like to take this opportunity to express ourprofound thanks to the Heads of State and Governmentand the peoples of various countries for their support encouragement and firm solidarity with the Korean peoplein their just cause of peace on the Korean peninsula andKorea’s peaceful reunification.Today  on its fiftieth anniversary  the United Nationsis faced with heavy tasks if it is to work more activelyand effectively for the consolidation of world peace andsecurity  the advancement of social and economicdevelopment  and the common prosperity of humankind.In conformity with the purposes and principles enshrinedin its Charter  the United Nations should make asubstantial contribution to the efforts of all countries andnations to safeguard national independence andsovereignty and to build a new  free and peaceful worldwithout any forms of domination or subjugation.An important priority in the fulfilment by the UnitedNations of its own mission and role is to make sure thatthe application of the principle of international justice andfairness is in place. International justice and fairness arevital to the United Nations activities. However  a minorityof big Powers are exercising their privileged rights andbehaving themselves in a high-handed manner  inopposition to the United Nations Charter  while a majorityof small and weak nations are denied their well-deservedpositions. Still worse  intolerable events have occurredwhich ignore the desire of the developing countries andviolate their interests.The United Nations should refrain from any actsrunning counter to the principle of international justiceand fairness in its activities and  moreover  should notunjustly apply double standards that enable certaincountries to abuse the United Nations in pursuing theirown political purposes.The United Nations should respect the sovereigntyand interests of the small countries and treat all countrieson an equal footing  and should prove itself worthy of itsprestige as a world body that substantially contributes toworld peace and security  to the economic developmentof each country and to the greater welfare of peoples.Many countries in the world today are fully justified intheir call for the restructuring and democratization of theUnited Nations. The United Nations will not be able tofulfil its own mission and role unless it adapts to the8changes of the times  lives up to the aspirations ofhumankind and overhauls some impractical structures andauthority.The restructuring of the Security Council is mostessential for the democratization of the United Nations.One of the key points in the expansion of SecurityCouncil membership is to accord priority to the developingcountries that form an absolute majority of the UnitedNations membership  and apply the principle of equalregional distribution with due consideration given to thenumber of countries in each region. A country like Japanwhich has not apologized enough for  and wiped the slateclean of  its past wrongdoings is not entitled to become apermanent member of the Security Council. Another pointis that the veto rights of the permanent members of theSecurity Council should be abrogated. The removal of theveto system will mean removing the major stumbling-blockto the democratization of the United Nations and theelimination of the legacies of the cold-war era that haveencouraged hegemonistic and high-handed actions by aminority of big Powers. At the same time  the power andauthority of the Security Council should be curtailed  whilethe General Assembly should be given more power  andopen access to all the work of the Security Council shouldbe available  including to its informal consultations. For aresolution of the Security Council adopted on behalf of theUnited Nations and calling for sanctions or the use of forceagainst its Member States to come into force  the resolutionwill have to be approved by more than two thirds of theMember States at the General Assembly.Disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  is stillone of the most important problems placed before theUnited Nations.A number of signs of progress in the field ofdisarmament have emerged since the end of the cold war.However  the process of nuclear-weapons reduction is stillmoving at a snail’s pace  and the concept of what approachshould be taken to the existence of nuclear weaponryremains elusive. The continuing pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of their respective monopolies of nuclear-weapons capability only keeps alive the danger to us ofnuclear wars and nuclear proliferation.The nuclear-weapon States must turn around andmeasure up to the desire and aspiration of humankind tolive in peace on this planet by carrying through theuniversal and complete abolition of nuclear weapons in linewith the present-day trends in favour of the establishmentof nuclear-weapon-free and peace zones.Today  the question of development has assumed avery serious dimension for the absolute majority of thedeveloping countries. It is  indeed  encouraging to notethat the preparation of the Agenda for Development thatbegan at the initiative of the developing countries  with aview to the enhancement of the functions and role of theUnited Nations in the field of development  is now in thehome stretch. If the Agenda for Development is tocontribute substantially to the development efforts of thedeveloping countries  it should be directed primarilytowards the establishment of equitable internationaleconomic relations and the removal of gaps between therich and the poor — between the North and the South. Atthe same time  we should not allow any attempts to usethis development issue as a means to interfere in theinternal affairs of other countries by relating it to the so-called protection of human rights.Today  the non-aligned and other developingcountries are working hard to achieve South-Southcooperation and establish the South-South economicorder. The United Nations should accord priority to theresolution of development issues and take concrete stepsto help establish fair and equitable international economicrelations that will assist the developing countries in theirdevelopment efforts and encourage South-Southcooperation.At present  the national independence andsovereignty of several countries are ruthlessly trampledunderfoot in different parts of the globe  and disputes andconflicts  both religious and ethnic as well as region-wide which in some cases escalate into catastrophic wars continue unabated. It is  indeed  painful to see that peaceand security are tattered and people are falling victim todisasters.We consider that disputes among countries andnations should be resolved peacefully through dialogueand negotiations in conformity with the interests of thepeoples of the countries concerned.Today  all the justice- and peace-loving countriesand nations in the world are dynamically struggling tocreate a new independent world  overcoming allchallenges and difficulties  looking ahead to the twenty-first century from the heights of the present vibrant era.9We actively support the just cause of the peoples ofthe members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) in favour of peace  stability and commonprosperity in their region  and the just cause of all otherAsian peoples in favour of building a new  independent andprosperous Asia.We support the Arab peoples in their struggle for afair and comprehensive resolution of the Middle Eastquestion  including the Palestinian issue  and the Africanpeoples in their efforts for independent development oftheir countries  overcoming all social and economicdifficulties.We extend our active support and encouragement tothe Cuban people in their just cause in favour of firmlysafeguarding the country’s sovereignty and the gains ofsocialism  and express our solidarity with the peoples ofLatin America in their endeavours towards peace andprosperity in their region.We support the people of the non-aligned and otherdeveloping countries in their efforts to achieve social andeconomic development and establish an equitableinternational political and economic order.The Government of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea and the Korean people extends  and will continueto extend in the future  active support and solidarity to thepeoples of all the countries in the world in their efforts tobuild a new society and independent world against all formsof domination and subjugation.I would like to take this opportunity to express ourdeep thanks to the United Nations organs  specializedagencies and non-governmental organizations  including theUnited Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs  and tovarious Governments for the humanitarian steps they haveall taken in connection with the recent flood damage in ourcountry.The foreign policy of the Government of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea remains unchanged.The independence  peace and friendship advanced by thegreat leader Comrade Kim Il Sung in his lifetime and nowbeing implemented by the respected supreme leaderComrade Kim Jong Il are the cornerstone and principle ofthe Government’s foreign policy  and its correctness andvitality have already been powerfully demonstrated in actualpractice.Independence is vital to the life of our Republic andthe key factor in its domestic and foreign policies. Theindependent policy of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea not only guarantees the unique character andstability of our own-style Socialist system  but also makesa substantial contribution to peace and security in north-east Asia and the rest of the world.True to the lifetime teachings of the fatherly leaderComrade Kim Il Sung  and under the wise leadership ofthe respected supreme leader Comrade Kim Jong Il  theGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea will continue as before its steadfast commitment toindependence  to uniting with the peoples of all thecountries of the world advocating independence  tostrengthening further ties of friendship and cooperationwith them  and to carrying through faithfully its duties inthe accomplishment of the common cause of humankindfor world peace and security.The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea wishes to assure the Assembly that  togetherwith various other delegations  it will exert its sincereefforts towards successful debates on the agenda itemsplaced before this session of the General Assembly."
"134",5756,"PRT",50,1995,"It will doubtlessbe understood if  before beginning my statement  I express as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal  the particularsatisfaction which I feel in seeing an illustrious fellowcountryman  Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral  an eminentpublic figure and a professor at my alma mater  theUniversity of Lisbon  presiding over the work of the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. Allow me to convey mywarmest and fondest congratulations to you  Mr. President and  at the same time  my gratitude to all Member Statesfor the vote of confidence in Portugal that this represents.I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague fromCôte d’Ivoire  Mr. Amara Essy  for the dedicated andcompetent manner in which he steered the work of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.To you  Mr. Secretary-General  I reaffirm myadmiration for the way in which you have carried out yourfunctions during a period in which the United Nations isincreasingly called upon to intervene ever more actively inmany fields of international life.In his statement  my Spanish colleague has already setout  in the name of the 15 States of the European Union certain positions which are also shared by Portugal.Nevertheless  I would like to refer to some matters whichare of particular importance to my country.Peace continues to be the primary objective of  andthe biggest challenge faced by  the United Nations.The proliferation of peace-keeping operationslaunched by the Security Council in recent years and thehigh levels of human and financial resources committedto them are indicative of the commitment and collectiveefforts of the United Nations system and its MemberStates.The results achieved in some countries — and I ampleased to refer here to the case of the United NationsOperation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and the recentdevelopments in the peace process in Angola — arereason enough to indicate that we should not reduce ourlevel of commitment nor the scope of our activities. Weshould  however  also be flexible and creative  here aselsewhere  in order to avoid the rigidity of models andadapt peace-keeping operations to the specific conditionsof each case.While it is true that the United Nations must notabdicate its mission of helping to restore peace  webelieve that we should focus our efforts  above all  on theprevention of conflicts.The Agenda for Peace requires effective coordinationof the various Departments and agencies of the UnitedNations system in order to provide an integrated view ofthe many factors which contribute to the development ofcrises. In the search for peace  the question of thecomplementarity between the United Nations andintergovernmental organizations of a regional nature isalso particularly relevant.With this in mind  Portugal has actively supported since the beginning  the creation and implementation ofthe mechanism for conflict prevention  management andresolution established by the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) at the Cairo Summit in 1993. We have alsoparticipated in the search for the means which will permitthe strengthening and efficacy of those instruments.Along the same lines  while holding the presidencyof the Western European Union (WEU) during the firsthalf of this year  Portugal put the issue of conflictprevention on the agenda of that organization and focusedthe need for WEU to develop support mechanisms in thisregard.23Also  in the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE)  where preventive diplomacy is thefoundation of its activities  Portugal has contributed so thatthe Organization can continue to have a decisive role toplay in the maintenance of stability in a region which runsfrom Vancouver to Vladivostok. Alongside the securitymodel for the twenty-first century  this will surely be oneof the subjects that will receive in-depth treatment at thenext OSCE Summit  which will take place in Lisbon at theend of next year.With regard to disarmament  as another of thecomponents of the efforts in favour of peace  Portugalwelcomes the historic decision taken by consensus on11 May this year in this very Hall to indefinitely extend theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Also encouraging is the progress obtained at theDisarmament Conference  especially with regard to theincreased expectations of rapidly completing acomprehensive test ban Treaty.The results of the high-level meeting  held last July that resulted in donations towards a voluntary UnitedNations fund for de-mining should also be stressed here. Inthat context  Portugal announced that it would be making abilateral contribution.Equally  I welcome the negotiations currently underway in Vienna for the revision of the United NationsConvention on Conventional Weapons.The enlargement of the Disarmament Conference isurgently required  keeping in mind the need for astrengthening of the negotiation of international legalinstruments  as well as their observance by an increasingnumber of States.There can be no peace in the world while largesections of the world’s population continue to live beneathlevels considered fundamental for human dignity. Integratedand sustainable development  focused on people  istherefore the other great challenge which cannot beseparated from the search for peace. The Agenda forDevelopment and the Agenda for Peace constitute a singleunit — one makes no sense  nor can it be achieved  withoutthe other.In this context  it is necessary to recognize the need torevise the entire system of international development aid and to reflect on the role that  in this area  should fall to theUnited Nations. Ours should be a global and coherentvision.The integrated and sustainable development whichwe desire must be pursued on all fronts: at the economiclevel  to be sure  but also in the consolidation anddeepening of democratic institutions; in the promotion ofhuman rights across the board; in the increasingparticipation of women in the most diverse sectors ofsocial and political life; in the defence of the rights ofchildren  ethnic minorities and all underprivilegedmembers of society; in humanitarian assistance; and in theprotection of the environment.To achieve all these goals  we must implement thedecisions taken at major United Nations conferences  forit is at these conferences — those of Rio de Janeiro Vienna  Cairo  Copenhagen and Beijing  as well as theforthcoming conference in Istanbul next year — that the“Agenda for Development” gradually takes shape.Non-governmental organizations  as well as othergroups through which the vitality of civil society isdemonstrated  are privileged agents in aid anddevelopment  and are our partners in the “Agenda forDevelopment”. This is due to their particular capacity ofpenetration in the field  of making contact with the peopleand of understanding their real needs.Of all areas of development  there are two inparticular to which I would like now to turn: theprotection and promotion of human rights  and theimportance of the environment.The protection and promotion of human rights is aconstant priority of Portuguese foreign policy. Wecontinue to believe in the importance of critical dialoguein order to reach the fundamental objective of respect forthose rights  and we are following the activities of theHigh Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights.The fact that protection of the environment isinextricably linked to the notion of balanced developmenthas led it to gain an increasing relevancy in our foreignpolicy concerns. In this context  I wish to refer inparticular to the oceans  especially with regard to thedevelopment of a balanced management of fish stocks andmarine resources.As Portugal’s territory includes two archipelagos —the Azores and Madeira — I would like to stress our24particular sensitivity to the problems faced by small islandStates in development and environmental issues.Furthermore  I express my hope that the InternationalYear of the Oceans  a Portuguese initiative adopted by theGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session  will provide anurgently needed opportunity for a full debate on thesequestions. We will strive in that direction and hope that theholding in the same year in Lisbon of Expo 98 — anexposition on that subject — will result in a fruitfulcoordination of these efforts.The legislative activity of the United Nations inmaintaining the ecological balance and the management ofinternational waterways is of special importance. Portugalintends to follow with particular interest the work on thisissue that is being undertaken by the International LawCommission. We hope that in the near future a conventionon this matter will be adopted which would includeinternational norms of responsibility — applicable underdomestic or international jurisdiction.In the context of an “agenda for development”  Iwould like once again  to underline my personal convictionand the position of Portugal that Africa must quiteobviously be one of the priorities of the internationalcommunity. We were therefore pleased to welcome theannouncement made by the Secretary-General in Lisbonconcerning the launching of the “United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s”.The forthcoming conference for the Great Lakesregion  convened under the sponsorship of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) toaddress the tragic situation of a number of countries of thatregion  will certainly constitute a test of the truecommitment of the international community to the Africancontinent: a test of the capacity to identify the objectives ofpeace and development; a test of the much-neededcomplementarity between the United Nations and regionalorganizations.Despite the persistence of disturbing cases of politicaland social instability in a number of countries of thecontinent  as well as  of course  the open conflicts andserious violations of human rights which still continue  it isonly fair to recognize that in many African Statessignificant steps have been taken towards the peacefulsettlement of conflicts and the consolidation of theprocesses of political and social democratization.I am pleased to be able to say that the majority ofthese processes were carried out under the aegis of theUnited Nations  and Portugal is proud to have activelyparticipated in a number of them: in the internationalstructures of support to the process of democratictransition in South Africa; in the negotiations which ledto the Peace Accord in Mozambique  having beenrepresented in all the commissions created by that Accordand in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique(ONUMOZ); and as part of the troika of observers of thepeace process in Angola.With this process in mind  I hope that  following themeetings held at Lusaka  Franceville  and now Brussels between the President of the Republic of Angola and theleader of UNITA  steps will continue to be taken towardsa definitive reconciliation of the Angolan family whilestrictly complying with the Lusaka Protocol  whichrestores the spirit of the Bicesse Agreement signed inPortugal in 1991.It is equally important  keeping in mind SecurityCouncil resolution 1008 (1995)  Lusaka Protocol beadequately encouraged by the international community. Icannot fail  therefore  to express my concern over thedelay in the deployment to Angola of all the forces andcontingents of the United Nations Angola VerificationMission (UNAVEM III)  where Portugal is alreadypresent with a communications and logistics unit  as wellas a number of staff officers in the command structureand civilian  military and police observers.The tragic human suffering and the terrible materialdestruction brought about by more than 20 years ofconflict also require that the international community —following the round table on Angola being held inBrussels under the auspices of the United NationsDevelopment Programme — continues to respondgenerously to the humanitarian aid needs and thechallenge of reconstructing the country  particularly in theareas of demining and the social reintegration of thedisplaced and the demobilized.The New Agenda for Africa is pressing. It shouldlead to the promotion of vast integrated programmes ofdevelopment aid which would coordinate  in the mostefficient manner possible  the resources of theinternational community. It should seek to support andencourage African countries to choose the path of peace political democracy  stability and social justice  respectfor human rights and economic development.25The strengthening of the ties which link Portugal tothe five Portuguese speaking countries is and shall remaina constant goal of my country’s foreign policy.While talking of the ties that unite the countries thatspeak Portuguese  I wish to underline the importance of themeeting which  last July in Lisbon  brought together theMinisters of Foreign Affairs of Angola  Brazil  Cape Verde Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Portugal  and Sao Tome andPrincipe.That meeting permitted the reaffirmation of purposewhich motivates those respective Governments with regardto the institutionalization of the community of Portuguesespeaking countries. We hope that this next year will witnessthe formalization of this community  which  to all intentsand purposes  already exists in the hearts and souls of itspeoples and has become more and more concrete in manyways.At a time such as this  when we are celebrating thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and assessing itssuccesses and its failures  we cannot but  unfortunately include the question of East Timor among the latter.The 20 years which have passed since the illegaloccupation of East Timor and the denial of the exercise ofthe right to self-determination of its people  far fromallowing the question to be forgotten and the status quo tobe consolidated have  on the contrary  worsened thetensions and focused ever more strongly the attention ofworld public opinion.The lesson of these last 20 years has been that forcesolves nothing in East Timor nor will it ever resolveanything. Without a solution which  in conformity with theCharter and international law  takes into account thelegitimate rights of its people  including that of freelyexpressing themselves on their political future  there will beno peace or respect for human rights in East Timor.I wish to reiterate here the commitment of Portugaltowards finding  through peaceful and negotiated means such a solution. With that aim in mind  we continue tocooperate with the Secretary-General in the process ofdialogue which  under his auspices  we have maintainedwith Indonesia.Despite the fundamental difference which continues toseparate us on the core of the problem  we believe that theprocess of dialogue  with all its difficulties  registered verysignificant progress: representative Timorese personalitiesfrom various political sectors have now becomeassociated with this process.We have always held that the rights and primaryinterests at stake in this question are those of theTimorese people  and that their voice and their wisheswill have to be heard in order for a solution to be found.I sincerely hope that this first step marks the beginning ofa new  more positive and constructive phase of theprocess of dialogue concerning East Timor  one whichwill lead us more quickly to the end of this tragicsituation.I turn now to Europe. The situation in the formerYugoslavia continues to be a principal motive of concern.We are naturally encouraged by the results obtained at theMinisterial meeting held in Geneva on 8 September congratulate the members of the Contact Group forobtaining those results and hope that the meeting beingheld here today in New York will drive the processforward. At any rate  the consolidation of the results stilldepends on keeping the international community united on the cohesion of the Contact Group  and on closecoordination of the initiatives and actions taken byinternational organizations. Portugal will continue toparticipate actively in these efforts and we shall maintainour presence on the ground while it remains useful andnecessary.In its relationship with Latin America  Portugal has as is well known  very strong human  historical andcultural ties: with Brazil  for reasons known to all  butalso with the other countries of Latin America  withwhich we are seeking an ever-closer relationship. Tieswith Latin America will always occupy an importantplace in Portuguese foreign policy. This is made clear byour active participation in the Ibero-American Summits ofHeads of State and Government.We welcome the fact that Latin America is todayclearly giving new value to its role in the internationalsystem. Portugal resolutely supports the projects forregional Latin American integration and  as a member ofthe European Union  favours the establishment of wideagreements with institutions of regional integration —namely  the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUL) and other processes of integration underway on the American continent. I am referring also to theconsolidation of the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA) and the future establishment of afree-trade area in the Americas.26Portugal  both bilaterally and within the framework ofa number of organizations such as the European Union  theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and theWestern European Union  has promoted the strengtheningand deepening of ties with the countries of the Maghreb  aregion of fundamental importance today for the security stability and development of the entire Mediterranean area.Therefore  a number of European Councils  beginningwith that of Lisbon  have detailed new ideas and newinstruments of partnership that relate to a number of areasand that will bring closer together the two shores of theMediterranean; they will be decided upon at theforthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelonain November.Portugal continues to follow closely the progressreached in the Middle East peace process  especially asregards the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.We must pay tribute here to the courage with which bothsides have pursued the path of peace; they have frequentlyencountered obstacles — sometimes tragic ones — but theyhave not remained hostage to them. Proof of this is theimportant accord to be solemnly signed in Washington injust a few days. I hope that this atmosphere of dialogue willalso be consolidated among the other parties.Portugal  both within the European Union andbilaterally  has contributed to the assistance for thePalestinian people and for the support of its structures.Turning to Asia  I must first mention with satisfactionthat  as a result of the close cooperation between Portugaland China and in full respect for the joint declarationbetween those two countries  the process of Macau’stransition continues to be carried out in a harmoniousmanner. The common objective of both countries in thisprocess remains constant: to guarantee the stability andprosperity of that territory and the maintenance of itsspecial characteristics  in the framework of the transfer ofadministration in December 1999.Portugal recognizes the increasing importance that theAsian continent is assuming on the international stage. Mycountry feels that it has profound historical and cultural tiesto that region. In this context  my Government hopes thatthe meeting planned for next March in Bangkok willconstitute a significant step towards an ever-more-open andwider dialogue on all questions of mutual interest to theEuropean Union and Asia.To achieve the fundamental and primary goals ofpeace and development  and to face the situations I havereferred to  the Organization must undertake a realisticexercise of self- examination.It is  above all  essential for the Organization to havea sound financial foundation. I do not believe I amexaggerating by stating that we are in the midst of a crisisthat is without precedent and that  if not promptly andbravely addressed  will surely lead the Organization torupture. At this point  two stages appear available to us inthe search for a solution: strict payment in full and ontime of our obligations; the need for corrections whichwill permit a reduction of expenses or their fairerdistribution amongst us.With regard to the first point  I cannot avoidcriticizing the attempts to renege on commitments whichhave already been made  by consensus. How can anexpense be adopted by consensus but its paymentrefused? What kind of credibility can then be expected inwhat concerns international commitments?As to the second aspect  reforms are necessary thatwill reflect each State’s capacity to pay and the alterationsto that capacity. In this spirit  my Government responding to an appeal made by the Secretary-General took the initiative earlier this year to increase voluntarilyits contributions to the peace-keeping budget. Thus wehave moved from group C to group B on the scale ofassessments. The decision will mean a five-fold increasein our initial contributions. We took this decision becausewe consider that it is a step in the right direction in whatconcerns the financial reform of the Organization. Wetook this decision to express our commitment to theimportance and success of the work of this Organization.We took this decision because we knew this increasemight benefit other countries that are experiencingtemporary difficulties. We hope that our move will befollowed by other States whose economic situation has like Portugal’s  improved in recent years.It is not merely in the financial area that the UnitedNations must contemplate reform. Equally important isthe reform of the Security Council  which must in thenear future reflect the political  economic anddemographic realities of the contemporary world. In thiscontext  an adequate and balanced representation of allregions of the world would confer on the Council greaterefficacy in the formulation and implementation of itsdecisions and would make it the beneficiary of widesupport from all Member States  which would  in this27manner  feel duly represented on it. It is undoubtedly acomplex process  an evolutionary one  in which differencesremain profound and which will necessarily be based on acompromise solution.I cannot conclude without reaffirming here thecandidature of Portugal for one of the two non-permanentseats on the Security Council attributed to the WesternEuropean Group for the period 1996 through 1997. Ourcandidature is based on a number of reasons.First  because we believe  as a country with auniversalist nature accustomed to contact with all regions ofthe globe for more than five centuries and to understandingand accepting different cultures and civilizations  that wewill be able to contribute to the search for solutions in strictcompliance with the purposes and principles set out in theCharter of the United Nations.Secondly  having been only once before a member ofthe Security Council  we understand that countries likePortugal have not only the right  but also the duty  toparticipate in that body more regularly.In this context  I would like to underline here thesituation of countries like Portugal — in fact  the majorityof those represented here — that  based on democraticprinciples such as that of rotation  can  wish to  and shouldbe able to  contribute to international peace and security.And this they can do in a particularly constructive manner as  by not pursuing geo-strategic interests of hegemonicregional promotion or of any other type  they can  on thecontrary  contribute by being accessible  available andmoderate in the search for compromise solutions.On the other hand  through our participation in peace-keeping operations  our voluntary increase of our financialcontributions to the Organization  our participation inimportant United Nations organs  we consider that we areready to carry out the role which we may be called uponto play.We are ready to listen and not to impose. We placeour trust in negotiation and not on pressure; we supportwhat is fair and balanced  and do not consider anyformula which does not seek to build bridges for thecreation of consensus solutions.In candidatures such as this  to achieve the goals setout  some are tempted to adopt attitudes which are ofgreat visibility  but which are of a merely superficialnature. Others are tempted also to promise that which isquickly forgotten  or even to make commitments which inthe end are unfulfilled.On our part  we prefer to rely on the inherent meritsof our candidature and  in this context  to actively pursuein a committed manner  the defence of our positions ideas and proposals.We believe  therefore  in the support and warmwelcome that the candidature of Portugal for the SecurityCouncil will receive in the elections to take place duringthe next session of the General Assembly.Next month we will celebrate at the highest level  ina solemn session  the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  which will provide an opportunity for reflectionon the future of this Organization. Portugal hopes that astrengthened determination of all Member States willemerge to reaffirm the principles and values of theCharter and result in the better adaption of theOrganization to the complex realities of international lifetoday.This is certainly a great challenge. New generationshope that we will be able to face these responsibilities."
"135",5802,"PRY",50,1995,"At the outset  allow me to express my bestwishes to you  Sir  and to congratulate you on yourelection. I assure you of Paraguay’s most completecooperation.I also wish to express my appreciation and gratitudeto Ambassador Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire for the wayin which he guided the work of the General Assembly atthe last session.At the same time I am pleased to convey to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  thecongratulations that I bring on behalf of the Governmentand people of Paraguay for the commendable efforts thathave been made. I wish to express once again  on behalfof Paraguay and the President of the Republic  JuanCarlos Wasmosy  our full support for the United Nations of which Paraguay was one of the founders.We are living in an exceptional year  an importantone  marking the first 50 years of the United Nations.I myself was one of the fortunate witnesses of thebirth of the Organization after the Second World War.Life then led me to work for 25 years as a staff memberwithin the structure that was created. I believe that theUnited Nations has essentially fulfilled the aspirationsplaced in it for peace  security  efforts to establish a moreequitable international legal order  and the commitment todevelopment for all the peoples of the world.Undoubtedly  we must admit that in spite of theefforts made  we cannot say that we have been as10successful as we would have wished in the sphere ofpolitical achievements.On the contrary  in the economic and social fields  inwhich the Secretary-General and the different agencies ofthe United Nations system can take their own decisions there is an immense wealth of great achievements  some ofwhich are truly extraordinary. By way of example wewould like to mention the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea  successes as regards decolonization invariable and universal support for individual andcollective human rights  the openness and liberalization ofinternational trade  the immense mass of statistical datacollected and published in the fields of demography economics  health  education  and so on.Without attempting to be exhaustive I should like toemphasize our admiration for the world summits — for thedefence and protection of the environment in Rio deJaneiro; the International Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo; the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen; the World Summit forChildren; the recently concluded Fourth World Conferenceon Women in Beijing; and the equally hoped-for andawaited United Nations Conference on Human Settlements(Habitat II). The contribution that these summits have madeto mankind is truly historic.I should also like to highlight my Government’sappreciation for the report of the independent WorkingGroup on the future of the United Nations  many of whoseobservations and recommendations we share.Without attempting to elaborate on the immenseagenda of this session we would like to emphasize the needthat Paraguay feels for a greater adaptation of the UnitedNations to the new and changing realities at the same timewe support  where possible  the greater strengthening of theentire system  not only to preserve peace through law butalso to strengthen security with a view to the harmonizedand integral development of all peoples the world over.In this context Paraguay continues to support thereform of the organs of the United Nations  strengtheningthe General Assembly  democratizing the Security Councilwith the presence of more non-permanent members andrestricting the power of veto. Among the new permanentmembers it would be vital to ensure that there is equitablerepresentation for Latin America and other continentsamong whose representatives we mention by way ofexample Japan  Germany and Brazil.All this would be impossible if States in accordancewith agreed contributions were not to confront positivelyand conscientiously the serious problem of financing thesystem. In keeping with its means Paraguay is up to datein the payment of its assessment and we would like toemphasize the need to rationalize resources and improvethe administrative efficiency of the United Nations.We have also said in the past that the allocation offunds for programmes and projects in the world by theUnited Nations is unbalanced in that only 8.66 per cent ofthe programmes are allocated to countries of LatinAmerica whereas other regions have 50.42 per cent and40.67 per cent respectively.Paraguay is following closely the enormous effortsbeing made by the United Nations concerning peace anddevelopment.As regards the maintenance of peace  Paraguaywishes to refer to a few specific points.Regarding agenda item 27  I am pleased at thecontinued economic openness in the sister republic ofCuba. It is a pleasure to recall that the great hero  poet political leader  writer and teacher  José Martí was ConsulGeneral of Paraguay in New York and that hiscontribution to my homeland was at the time  andcontinues to be fruitful.In this context Paraguay reiterates its full support forthe Rio Group as regards its declaration in favour oflifting the embargo on Cuba and we repeat our supportfor the changes required in accordance with the will ofthe people and with respect for the self-determination ofpeoples and the principle of non-intervention.Regarding the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina Paraguay supports the different courses of actionpromoted by the General Assembly and monitored by theSecurity Council through the efforts of the United NationsProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees andother related agencies.My country has not lost hope thatthe strength of reason and the inspiration of humancompassion will  in the near future  alleviate theenormous suffering and sacrifices of those peoples thatare separated now by hatred and violence.Paraguay shares the concern of the internationalcommunity regarding the conflicts in Rwanda andBurundi and other parts of the African continent.11The very diverse actions of the United Nations inother parts of the world deserve our respect and oursupport. Without being exhaustive in our listing we wouldlike to refer to the problems that have existed in ElSalvador  Haiti  Iraq  Kuwait  Angola  Mozambique Somalia  Western Sahara  Liberia  and in Lebanon  Cyprus Cambodia  Georgia  Tajikistan  and so on. The UnitedNations is contributing or has contributed actively withobserver missions or assistance missions and with peace-keeping forces in a world that is experiencing so muchupheaval.We continue to be hopeful as regards the peaceprocess between Israel and its Arab neighbours in theMiddle East. Paraguay is gratified by the recent agreementsbetween Israel and Palestine and we hope that new progresswill soon be made in those lands which were the cradle ofthree universal religions and their magnificent cultures.Of course Paraguay supports the work of the UnitedNations with a view to achieving disarmament  whether itbe in regard to conventional  biological  chemical or nuclearweapons. In the same context  Paraguay expresses itsconcern also at the nuclear tests being conducted indifferent parts of the world.The struggle against the terrible scourge of terrorismis one shared by Paraguay in an increasingly unitedframework of international cooperation to eliminate theproblem at its very roots.Paraguay would like to mention its hope that as aresult of the talks between the two parties  a just andequitable understanding will be reached to resolve thesituation of the Republic of China  in keeping with theprinciple of universality enshrined in the Charter.Regarding agenda item 27  I am pleased at thecontinued economic openness in the sister republic of Cuba.It is a pleasure to recall that the great hero  poet  politicalleader  writer and teacher  José Martí was Consul Generalof Paraguay in New York and that his contribution to myhomeland was at the time  and continues to be fruitful.In this context Paraguay reiterates its full support forthe Rio Group as regards its declaration in favour of liftingthe embargo on Cuba and we repeat our support for thechanges required in accordance with the will of the peopleand with respect for the self-determination of peoples andthe principle of non-intervention.Regarding the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina Paraguay supports the different courses of actionpromoted by the General Assembly and monitored by theSecurity Council through the efforts of the United NationsProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees andother related agencies.My country has not lost hope thatthe strength of reason and the inspiration of humancompassion will  in the near future  alleviate theenormous suffering and sacrifices of those peoples thatare separated now by hatred and violence.Paraguay shares the concern of the internationalcommunity regarding the conflicts in Rwanda andBurundi and other parts of the African continent.The very diverse actions of the United Nations inother parts of the world deserve our respect and oursupport.

Paraguay is gratified by the recentagreements between Israel and Palestine and we hope thatnew progress will soon be made in those lands whichwere the cradle of three universal religions and theirmagnificent cultures.Of course Paraguay supports the work of the UnitedNations with a view to achieving disarmament  whetherit be in regard to conventional  biological  chemical ornuclear weapons.

In this contextwe view as very fruitful the cooperation between the UnitedNations and the Latin American Economic System andcooperation between the United Nations and other regionalgroups. Particular emphasis should be placed on horizontalcooperation.We consider the question of convening an internationalconference for development to be of vital importance asone of the measures needed to ensure long-term economicgrowth in all countries  particularly the developingcountries.Recent financial disturbances on our continent  wheredebt  loans and speculative capital combined to create awidespread and only recently resolved crisis  oblige us toreassert the fundamental demand for sustainabledevelopment and for effective and broad internationaleconomic cooperation  as was highlighted in theconclusions of the Rio Group at its recent meeting at Quito.Paraguay is pleased to affirm before the Assembly thatits democratic process is continuing to grow stronger dayby day. In accordance with the National Constitution  theGovernment has guaranteed and will continue to guaranteeall freedoms and compliance with the covenants on civiland political rights we have signed.We cannot fail to note that the United NationsCommission on Human Rights  in its 1995 conclusions withregard to our country  has recognized Paraguay’sachievements in this field. At the same time  we cannotdeny the enormous needs to which we must respond.Democratic transition in our country has not receivedthe hoped-for material support. Apart from the contributionof the European Community and Japan  we have had todeal with our social and economic problems out of ourresources. That alone explains why we have been unable toresolve all social conflict.In shouldering the task of coming up with answers  werepeat that we shall be doing so without digressing from themoral principles of fairness and the principles of the UnitedNations  but we do ask for greater support for ourdevelopment from the international community. For thatreason the people of Paraguay were shocked — and  wemust say  indignant — to learn of the attempts by certainEuropean and United States banks to bring before theSwiss courts claims of debts that were never sanctionedby Paraguay authorities and that arose out of fraudulentoperations that were carried out in Italy and that are nowbeing investigated and judged in those countries.Paraguay has honoured and will continue to honoureach and every one of its international commitments  butwe can never agree to the payment of debts unrelated toour legislation and contrary to every principle of law.The recent Conference of the Rio Group at Quitocame out vigorously in favour of productive investmentand discouraged speculation  which does not createemployment and which is unfortunately characteristic oftoday’s climate. In this connection  our Government iscontinuing with its plans concerning the Paraguay-Paranáwaterway. This waterway is not a new project or designto be created from scratch but  on the contrary  somethingthat already exists as a work of nature and that must beimproved  without curtailing it  by means of riverchannels that will be suitable for open navigation at alltimes for the transit of goods and persons. The ecologicalSummit at Rio de Janeiro strengthened Paraguay’sawareness of the need to protect the environment  andsince this waterway already exists in its natural state  theenvironment — and I would emphasize this — will in noway be damaged.As of 1 January 1995 the Southern Cone CommonMarket  MERCOSUR  which is a customs union  hascomplemented and integrated the economies of Argentina Brazil  Paraguay and Uruguay into a market coveringover 200 million persons and 12 million squarekilometres  the world’s fourth largest regional entity. TheTreaty of Asunción  which brought MERCOSUR intobeing five years ago  is based on two key principles namely  international democracy and internationalsolidarity. It is a flexible system of integration that seeksto include the economies of the sister Republics ofBolivia and Chile and that may eventually be joined withthe Andean Pact.Paraguay is very enthusiastic about the fruitfulnegotiations under way with the European Union aimedat establishing a broad zone of free trade that would coverEurope and MERCOSUR. Under the outstandingpresidency of Spain a broad framework agreement is nowbeing studied in the European Union  and we hope it canbe signed in Madrid at the end of this year.13Paraguay is firmly convinced of the need to moveforward with the process of creating in MERCOSUR suchsupranational entities as an administration commission anda law tribunal.Paraguay’s pro-tem presidency of MERCOSUR sawthe entry into force of a customs union that has undergonesteady development  as well as the initiation of theunderstanding with the European Union. We have justhanded the presidency over to Oriental Republic ofUruguay.Within MERCOSUR  Paraguay is carrying out a free-trade policy  the most open such policy in South America corresponding as it does to article 8 of the Charter of theInternational Monetary Fund  which provides for the totallyunrestricted movement of capital.Paraguay is aware that it must reduce the size of itsarmed forces so that the sums invested in it can betransferred to the social sector  but without losing sight ofits need for security and without impairing the efficiency ofthose forces. Fortunately  there is understanding of thevarious mandates and the cooperation needed to make thischange. In Paraguay at the present time we are examiningthe possibility of participation by our armed forces inUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  and we havebegun to send officers to participate in training courses.We appreciate the financing of the programmes andprojects in our country by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  the World Bank and the Inter-American Bank for Development. We are grateful to theInternational Monetary Fund for its very effective guidance.Drug trafficking is not a problem in Paraguay  whichis neither a centre of production nor a consumer market.The only problem it causes is created by the transit towardsthe industrialized countries  which is facilitated by our longborder. Through its own efforts  and without externalassistance  Paraguay is combating this scourge and hasachieved significant successes. Public and private corruptionis the scourge of the whole world today  and it is beingtackled by our Government. In this connection  Paraguayfirmly supports the draft inter-American convention againstcorruption submitted by the Government of Venezuela to itspartners in the Rio Group.Paraguay is proud of its contribution to andmembership in the Rio Group. This is a flexible organcreated as a way to resolve a precise conflict  and it hasprovided such good results that it has continued to exist asa framework for broad  political dialogue that is becomingincreasingly relevant and important. Its establishment byfounding members of the Organization of American States(OAS) has given it a particularly coherent and timelypolitical standing. We are encouraged at the practical turntaken by the Summit Meeting of American Presidents atMiami  especially at the Ministerial Meeting at Denver Colorado.Before concluding my statement I wish to say thatthe Government of Paraguay wants to highlight thepositive understanding achieved with the Republic ofArgentina for solving the ecological problem of thePilcomayo river. The sister Republic of Bolivia has nowjoined us in a tripartite agreement to redress this problemin an area ripe for regional development  thanks to thecooperation of the European Union.Last year we mentioned the need to create within theUnited Nations system a fund for progress in science andtechnology  particularly for the developing countries. Inthis regard we would like to appeal especially to ourpartners from the South. Without science and technologyfor our economic  social and political elites  developmentis impossible. The gap between the industrializedcountries and our own countries in this respect is so largethat it is a matter of fairness and necessity to reduce it.Above all  it is question of bringing about a free transferof agricultural and food technology that can make itpossible for us to live in social peace.As the United Nations completes its 50 years ofexistence  it has passed many milestones in humanhistory. Knotty problems that seemed insoluble yesterdayhave now been left behind.A nuclear crisis  which threatened almost twogenerations of the human race  now seems unthinkable.The world can no longer be explained from the standpointof two ideologies whose triumph or defeat could bedecided only by a major war  which was fortunately avoided.The contest between authoritarianism and freedom isover. Although there are large areas of the world wherefundamental rights are not enjoyed  the benefits offreedom enshrined in the declarations and covenants ofthe United Nations are not at issue.We cannot forget that since 1819 there have been353 wars  but none of them has been between well-established democracies.14There is a widespread and growing awareness thatmany major issues can be resolved only by pooling ourefforts. The issues of the environment  women  educationand children  as well as a large majority of the other issueson this grand Assembly’s agenda  are impossible to resolvethrough the efforts of one nation-State. This fact isconfirmed every day. Today we forget that not long ago when our Organization already existed  there was no debateover the internal affairs of countries and that nointernational intervention was allowable. If the Charter wererewritten today it would be startling to see the changesArticle 2  paragraph 7.All this happened in the era of the United Nations. Westill lack the perspective to assess it  but we are sure thatthe result is positive. We have not gone backwards; wehave not even stopped.We are again hearing voices that emphasize thedefects of the Organization. The criticism would seem trueif we lost sight of the major changes for the good ofmankind that have come about with the existence and thehelp of our institution. Through me  my country reiteratesits support for vital and necessary reforms. This is ourresponsibility  and it is the best tribute we can pay to thosewho conceived  shaped and developed the Organization.But these changes will be valid only if we rememberthe principle of the sense of history  as Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali pointed out. In recent years weParaguayans  in setting out anew on the path of democracy believed that we were impelled not only by a desire toimprove our living conditions  obtain the benefits ofprogress and ensure well-being for all. We understood thatwe were part of a shared adventure with universal roots that we were a nation that  in order to understand itself needed to understand others.For this reason  we stand before you with a convictionthat I hope will last for ever: that the great majority ofpeople believe that with the United Nations it will bepossible some day be possible  perhaps very soon  to findnew forms of cosmopolitanism. That sense of historyobliges us to think once again in terms of the world — thiswill  of course  be our new activity — so that morality maytriumph in politics and that the separation of the two willhave been but a moment in the history of our race.To paraphrase Hegel  we can say  “What are we?What shall we become?”"
"136",5867,"QAT",50,1995,"At the outset  it gives me great pleasure to congratulateHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on hiselection to the presidency of this historic fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly. His election reflects the esteem inwhich Member States hold his country  the friendly countryof Portugal  and the confidence that his diplomatic talentswill make possible the successful culmination of the workof this important session.I should also like to express my delegation’s esteemfor his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  forthe competent way in which he conducted the work of theforty-ninth session.It is also my pleasure to express Qatar’s fullconfidence in and esteem for the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In fact  he is doing a great deal toserve this international Organization  and has beenextremely assiduous in implementing its noble principlesand strengthening its role in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.I should like to congratulate the Member States thathave recently joined the Organization. We hope that thoseStates will be active participants in and will contributeconstructively to the activities of the United Nations and tothe defence of its principles.This fiftieth session is being held at a historic andcomplex turning point in history  where extreme complexitycharacterizes the concepts relating to international relations.These concepts  because of their diversity and the erraticcourse they follow  create a number of serious difficultiesand obstacles that face the emergence of the desiredinternational order. All this has taken concrete form in theresurgence of inter-ethnic and inter-racial extremist conflictsthat threaten the very foundations of international society which should continue to be based on tolerance and theprinciples and values of the United Nations. Hence the needto redouble our efforts to put an end to such conflicts andto contain their consequences and the threats they pose tothe international community. While expressing ourappreciation for the efforts that have been made by thisOrganization to cope with the deplorable events that havetaken place in Somalia  Rwanda  Burundi and Bosnia andHerzegovina  we are mindful of the difficulties thatobstruct such efforts and make it difficult for theOrganization to find the desired solutions to thoseproblems.On top of all this  it is patently clear that theSecurity Council  which has adopted pertinent resolutionsto solve these problems  has come face to face withobstacles that hampered the achievement of the desiredsolutions. The continued presence of such obstacles hasaffected the credibility and standing of the UnitedNations. In the post-cold-war period  the United Nationshas been put to the test in the areas of peace-keeping andthe maintenance of international peace and security.Hence the urgent need during this fiftieth anniversary tomake every effort to fundamentally reform the UnitedNations to enhance its effectiveness and its standing. Ithink we all aspire to the goal of reforming the UnitedNations  and my country attaches particular importance toit; it would strengthen the effectiveness of theinternational Organization and enhance its image.We know that the obstacles facing the SecurityCouncil have been the reason behind the demand forreforming that principal organ with the Charterresponsibility for the maintenance of international peaceand security. A high priority is given to this reform of theSecurity Council which tops the list of the desiredreforms of the United Nations. As for the State of Qatar it attaches particular importance to efforts to reform theCouncil and to increase its membership proportionatelywith the increased membership of the United Nationsitself. We must also bear in mind the need to increase thenumber of permanent seats to ensure balancedrepresentation. The great challenge the internationalcommunity faces as it strives to reform the SecurityCouncil is to achieve a balanced membership and toensure that the changes will make for increasedeffectiveness. We should also speed up reform of theworking methods and procedures of the Security Council.We must review the right of veto and rein in its use asthat right has frequently been used against the interests ofthe international community and in favour of individualStates.Proceeding from its conviction that internationalpeace can be achieved only through disarmament andrestraining the arms race  particularly with respect to18weapons of mass destruction and that halting theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of themost important foundations of international peace andsecurity  the State of Qatar welcomed the Convention onthe Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and supported the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  even if itconsiders that the indefinite extension of the Treaty willnever achieve the desired result unless all States accede toit. We therefore hope that all the States which have not yetacceded to the Treaty will do so.Qatar continues to believe that Israel should accede tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand should place its nuclear installations under thesafeguards regime of the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) as a prelude to the implementation of theGeneral Assembly’s resolution establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. This would contributeto equitable  balanced peace and stability in that vital regionof the world.Since His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani became Emir  he has stressed Qatar’s adherence toits regional and international obligations  and hasemphasized that Qatar will act through international andregional organizations in strengthening international peaceand security. By joining our brethren in the GulfCooperation Council  we have set a course towards theachievement of the noble goals that reflect the aspirationsof the peoples of the Gulf after peace  stability  cooperationand prosperity.The security of the Gulf is one of the major concernsof its peoples. Our region has witnessed two major wars during which our peoples have made great sacrifices thathave taken the shape of financial burdens which wecontinue to shoulder at a time when we move towardsdevelopment and modernization. We are determined toovercome the negative effects of those two wars and tospare the region any further conflict. Moreover  Qatar ismaking efforts to establish good relations with all States ofthe region on the basis of good-neighbourliness  mutualrespect  non-interference in the internal affairs of others respect for international legality  and the settlement ofproblems by peaceful means through dialogue  mediation orrecourse to the International Court of Justice.Proceeding from this  we support resolution of thedispute between the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran with respect to the three islands bypeaceful means.With regard to Iraq  our position remains unchanged:Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity must be preserved.Iraq must implement all Security Council resolutions.Iraq’s recognition of the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of the State of Kuwait  and of its internationalboundaries  in accordance with Security Councilresolution 833 (1993) is a very important step in the rightdirection towards full implementation of all SecurityCouncil resolutions  a fact that should speed up themitigation of the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi peoplewho continue to face an acute shortage of essential goods especially foods and medicine.Inspired by the guidelines established by HisHighness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al Thani  Qatar hasbeen participating  to the best of its financial and humanabilities  in addressing the major issues of the Gulf regionand of our Arab and Islamic nation. Qatar  therefore  fullysupports the activities of the Gulf Cooperation Council which are in the interest of the well-being of all ourpeoples. It is our hope that security and stability will soonreign in our region  for this is an integral part of thesecurity and stability of the Middle East at large. To thatend  Qatar is continuing its good offices and its efforts toimprove the situation in the Arab world and toconsolidate Arab solidarity  which will make it possiblefor the nation to pursue its special role in the history ofcivilization.It is on the basis of these principles that we havewelcomed the Middle East peace process. We hope thatit will prove successful and that it will at long last bringa just and lasting peace to the region and lead to Israel’scomplete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab andPalestinian territories  including the Golan Heights southern Lebanon and  particularly  Al-Quds Al-Sharif.This will make it possible for the Palestinian people toregain its right to establish a State of its own  on its ownsoil  with Al-Quds as its capital.Qatar welcomes the expanded autonomy of thePalestinians under the agreement signed last Thursday atWashington between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Wehope this agreement will open the doors that lead to peaceand stability in the region and will prove to be animportant step towards full implementation of theDeclaration of Principles signed by the two parties inSeptember 1993.19By the same token  Qatar wishes to voice its deepconcern at the fact that talks between Syria and Israel arelagging behind. We hope for substantial progress on thattrack so that the Israeli occupation of the Syrian ArabGolan may come to an end. We hope also that there will beprogress on the Lebanese-Israeli track  so that southernLebanon may be freed from the Israeli presence underwhich it has been the victim of much aggression andoppression.It is our hope that a just and lasting peace will beestablished on the basis of the Madrid formula and therelevant Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1978) and on the basis of the land-for-peace formula. We therefore call on the General Assemblyto reaffirm all prior resolutions on the question of Palestineand the situation in the Middle East  so that the goal of ajust  comprehensive peace can be achieved.My Government follows with great concerndevelopments in Afghanistan  Somalia and Chechnya. Weappeal for the intensification of international efforts to bringpeace  justice and stability to those areas.We also reaffirm — as we have frequently done  bothofficially and in public statements — our solidarity with thepeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are concerned overthe continuing bloodshed  four years after the outbreak ofthe war. Together with many other States  we havedeplored the savage practices of ethnic cleansing pursuedby the Serbian forces under the eyes of the entire world.Those practices are totally against the most elementaryrules and norms of humanitarian law and the Charter of theUnited Nations.We welcome the military action undertaken by theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  in cooperationwith the forces of the United Nations  to put an end toSerbian aggression. We hope that those measures ofdeterrence will make it possible for peace to be achieved atlong last and that the international community will take avery firm and resolute stand  both through the UnitedNations and through the major Powers that are activelyinvolved  to guarantee the safety of the people of Bosniaand Herzegovina. By the same token  we hope that theweapons embargo will be lifted  in order for these peopleto defend themselves  to preserve the independence of theircountry and to ensure the triumph of the principles of theCharter. The Serbian barbarity they have endured hasengulfed even the safe areas.Qatar also supports the stance of the Contact Groupof the Organization of the Islamic Conference  whichdeems the embargo on weapons to be illegal and supportsthe fraternal Muslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.We are now at a critical stage in the conflict in theformer Yugoslavia. The international community must  ofnecessity  act to restore a just peace in the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina and to ensure that that countrymay enjoy stability  sovereignty  independence andterritorial integrity and get down to the business ofeconomic and social development. We hope that theSerbian war criminals will be duly tried and that this willbe a lesson to all such criminals.Qatar is profoundly convinced that peace anddevelopment follow the same path  that development is asnecessary for the international community as is peace. Itis possible to ensure continuous development only if thereis peace  and vice-versa. Since sustainable and long-termdevelopment is one of the cornerstones of genuine peace it is a high priority for the United Nations and theinternational community to focus on development particularly in the developing countries.A commitment to development in all its aspects is indeed  the very bedrock of the international economicorder — the new order that we all look forward to andhope that it will be based essentially on interdependence.The international community has already started to movein that direction  through the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade and the establishment of the WorldTrade Organization. This will help to strengthen themultilateral trade system  which is based on theliberalization and expansion of international trade.As confirmation of this  His Highness the Emir ofthe State of Qatar has extolled the merit  from Qatar’spoint of view  of particular political groups  saying that despite the fact that ours is a small country  we are tryingto react favourably to the new international situation inorder to find our proper place in it. We are also takingaction to strengthen the ways and means available to us for the achievement of that goal.Our economic objectives are the following: toexploit our own natural wealth; to export our products onthe best possible terms; to strengthen our industrial baseby consolidating and developing our current industriesand by creating new ones on the basis of our naturalresources  particularly petroleum and gas; to strengthenand encourage investment in all areas  making it possiblefor private capital to be involved in economic20development; and to emphasize infrastructure projects  asthese are the main requirements for socio-economicdevelopment.All this highlights the reason why we attach suchimportance to economic and social development as amainstay of international peace and security. That is whydevelopment has become a common goal for theinternational community. Having taken shape in a numberof international conferences  it should be adopted by all thenations of the world. We attach particular importance to theresults of the conferences that have been held in recentyears in the context of the importance accorded by theinternational community to this common goal  namely  theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  in Rio de Janeiro; the InternationalConference on Population and Development  in Cairo; theWorld Summit for Social Development  in Copenhagen;and the Fourth World Conference on Women  held inBeijing  to emphasize the role of women in developmentwith due consideration of the cultural differences betweenpeoples and the various noble ideals of the Islamic faith.It is our hope that the matters that were debated willnot be used as a pretext for interference in the internalaffairs of other States or as justification for discriminatorytreatment and the imposition of conditions on the provisionof economic assistance or development aid.I should like to refer in this context to the tendency toimpose  unilaterally or collectively  a carbon tax  for thepurpose  it is alleged  of protecting the environment. Thetruth of the matter is that the tax is a purely economicmeasure  which will impact negatively on the economies ofthe petroleum-exporting countries  particularly the GulfStates.The threats that face mankind at present and willcontinue to do so in the future are not all political ormilitary. Such threats as the deterioration of theenvironment on a global scale  poverty  underdevelopment drugs  epidemics of fatal diseases  terrorism and violationsof human rights which are becoming more and moreserious day by day  are not of a military or political nature.Regardless  they need to be addressed urgently and globalsolutions have to be found for them if they are not tobecome untreatable and threaten all humanity.In just a few days we shall be celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. This is an extremelyimportant occasion  reflecting as it does a genuine desire onthe part of the peoples of the world to preserve the UnitedNations as a strong and active Organization whosepurpose is to achieve noble goals and safeguard the futureof mankind. As we celebrate the anniversary  at thethreshold of the twenty-first century  it is our hope thatwe shall build a new United Nations that will lead us inthe direction of a new world of genuine peace  security under an effective international order that wouldguarantee the well-being of all people and preserve thedignity of man  a world where the strong will notdominate the weak or the rich exploit the poor; a worldwhere tolerance and well-being would not be far-fetcheddreams.If we mobilize the full potential of mankind we shallbe able  under the guidance of the United Nations and itsagencies  to usher in such a brave new world."
"137",5913,"ROU",50,1995,"Allow me first  on behalf of the Romaniandelegation  to congratulate Ambassador Freitas do Amaralof Portugal most sincerely  and all the members of theBureau of the General Assembly  on their elections.Romania is fully committed to the ideals and goals ofthe United Nations Charter and  as an active Member deeply appreciates the activity of the United Nations at thistime of an anniversary celebration when it is in the processof redefining itself in order to meet the present internationalrequirements and to anticipate what will happen in the thirdmillennium.Allow me to convey to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our deep appreciation for hissustained efforts to adapt the United Nations to the ever-increasing requirements of a totally changing world. I didthat already in Bucharest when he visited us last autumn.At that time we had a very useful exchange of views onproblems concerning cooperation between Romania and theUnited Nations and concerning the availability andopenness of the Romanian Government to support  andactively participate in  the global efforts of the UnitedNations.Romania is at present celebrating  not only the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of the United Nations  but alsothe fortieth anniversary of its admission to this worldOrganization. Despite its sacrifices and its importantcontribution to shortening the Second World War and thevictory of the United Nations coalition  Romania wasadmitted to the United Nations 10 years after the Chartercame into force. None the less  my country has proved itsresponsible commitment and its active role in the mostimportant debate on international matters and in promotingthe purposes and principles of the United Nations.In the six years since December 1989 the legislativeand institutional framework for a democratic society hasbeen constantly under development in Romania. The broadconsensus of all political forces in my country eloquentlyproves that we as a nation have opted to become a law-abiding State with respect for political pluralism  for amarket economy and for fundamental rights andfreedoms. The new institutions that have been establishedare now in operation and at the same time have beenconsolidated  thus contributing to the democratization ofour society and the acceleration of the process oftransformation  in keeping with the strategy forsocio-economic reform which my Government has.The complex reform programme has been unfoldingsuccessfully. In 1995 the reality in Romania differs fromthat at the end of 1992. The success of macroeconomicstabilization  and the improvement in the macroeconomyin general are an important argument for the integrationof Romania into the European Union as it is an argumentfor other countries of central Europe.That does not mean that reform in Romania is goingalong smoothly and without obstacles. As is the case withother central European countries  its implementationinvolves large social costs which require permanent socialsecurity measures.In this sense  I should like to emphasize the supportand encouragement that the United Nations has given toRomania and to other countries in transition  which showthe capacity of the world Organization to support thereform process.In this context  my delegation wishes to welcome theSecretary-General’s report entitled “Support by the UnitedNations system of the efforts of Governments to promoteand consolidate new or restored democracies”. We feelthat a substantial debate on this subject could define anew dimension for United Nations activity. Romania which next year is to organize the Third InternationalConference of New or Restored Democracies has decidedto make that meeting an important event for thepromotion of democratic values throughout the world.Romania’s political objectives are determined not bycircumstances but rather by its decisive commitment todemocracy  market economy  respect for human rightsand the need to ensure the country’s peace and prosperity.We believe that Romania’s integration into European andEuro-Atlantic economic  political and securitystructures — the principal goal of our foreign policy —will stimulate our own efforts at democratization andreform. At the same time  this demonstrates theGovernment’s willingness to make a noteworthycontribution to the achievement of the goals of thoseinstitutions and to the creation of favourable conditions37for stability and security in Europe as well as peace andsecurity in the world.By openly and unequivocally stating its basic interestin becoming part of the Euro-Atlantic economic  politicaland security structures  Romania is in no way neglecting itsrelations with its neighbours. Indeed  the furthering ofrelations with our neighbours  on a new footing  is aprimary concern.In this connection I would mention the recent initiativetaken by our President  His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu  whoinvited Hungary to join in consecrating the historicalreconciliation  on the Franco-German model — aremarkable example of success in the European spirit.Romania has solemnly stated its willingness toundertake all diplomatic steps to move beyond the stage ofpurely political statements and to make the notion ofreconciliation a fait accompli. The direct and unconditionalinvitation to Hungary to forge  with us  the future of ournations in a European spirit goes beyond a mere political-diplomatic step  envisaging as it does the establishment ofa social and political framework based on greaterconfidence and more intensive cooperation.To put it another way  for Romania reconciliationmeans a consciously assumed and systematically pursuedprocess. At the same time  it should constitute for our twocountries the surest way to achieve integration into the maininstitutions of the new Europe  thereby contributing to theconsolidation of stability and security in the region and thusin the rest of the continent.Romania’s initiative in launching an appeal toHungary to enter together into the historical reconciliationthat is so greatly desired is the natural result of a policy ofgood-neighbourliness and understanding that Romania hasbeen constantly pursuing with all its neighbours.Dialogue and pragmatic cooperation in various areasof activity with States from all regions of the world is moreover  another important direction of our foreign policy.The disappearance of the iron curtain gave birth to a vastand complex process of international détente by creating agenuine framework for dialogue and cooperation betweenStates.The renunciation of confrontational policies and thelessening of the nuclear threat created the conditions for theindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. We are convinced that that successwill assist the negotiations aimed at the elimination ofother weapons of mass destruction and lead to greatertransparency  both in the area of armaments and in thearea of security guarantees  as well as to a complete banon all nuclear tests.In recent years the United Nations has repeatedly putforward new concepts and mechanisms regardinginternational peace and security and economic and socialdevelopment.In that context  I am grateful for this opportunity torecall the constant support Romania has given the MiddleEast peace process by encouraging the continuation ofdialogue and contacts among the parties concerned. Inrecognition of its contribution to the positive results ofthat peace process Romania was invited to participate inthe multilateral negotiations on the Middle East. It isprepared to participate in working groups on regionaleconomic cooperation  water resources  the environmentand refugees. Totally convinced that reason will prevailand that the irreversible Middle East peace process mustbe supported  in the future also Romania will encourageand support understanding and cooperation among all thepeoples of the region. We sincerely hope that through thecommon efforts of all the parties involved  the UnitedNations and the international community  new progresswill be achieved so that a comprehensive solution to theproblems of that region can be found.The Yugoslav crisis continues to create deep concernin Romania  given its close proximity to the conflict zone.Romania has appealed many times to the parties involvedin the conflict to refrain from any action that might leadto the deterioration of the situation and to halt militaryactions and resume negotiations. Faithful to its position ofprinciple  Romania hails yesterday’s adoption  at theUnited States Mission to the United Nations here in NewYork  of a joint statement of supplementary principles fora constitutional settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Romania will actively support any proposal and anyrealistic action that will accelerate the pacification processin the territory of former Yugoslavia  including itspeaceful reconstruction.The political and military crisis in former Yugoslaviashows that attempts to achieve ethnic separatism and togain territorial autonomy on the basis of ethnic criteria orto establish ethnic enclaves are not viable solutions. Tothe contrary  they may become sources of conflict andcreate enormous suffering for the population.38I should like to reaffirm from this rostrum theRomanian Government’s decision to continue to strictlyrespect the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)  despite the immenseeconomic losses to our country. We do hope  nonetheless that the competent international institutions will take a morecareful look at the effects of the sanctions on third Statesand that they will rigorously and realistically assess the rolesanctions can play in the peace process. We hope thatStates that are in a position to do so  international financialinstitutions  competent bodies and United Nationsprogrammes and specialized agencies will all respond to theGeneral Assembly’s appeal in resolution 49/21 Aconcerning economic assistance to States affected by theimplementation of the sanctions against the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). At thesame time  we would be interested in seeing the SecurityCouncil take decisions  in line with the progress achievedin the political settlement of the crisis  with a view tolifting the sanctions.The situation in the eastern area of the Republic ofMoldova is still a source of some tension. We areconvinced that the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops whatever their form or denomination  from the territory ofthat independent and sovereign State remains the key to thesolution of the conflict in the eastern regions of theRepublic of Moldova. Indeed  we note with satisfaction thatthe international community shares that view. We welcomethe agreement reached between the Republic of Moldovaand the Russian Federation on the withdrawal of Russiantroops from the territory of the former country. We viewthis as a positive step that can contribute to increasedstability in the area  and we express the hope that thisagreement will become operational.The United Nations has quite rightly been given aprincipal role in designing a new world order  one capableof responding to the hopes and aspirations of peoples. Toachieve that goal  we believe  the United Nations mustadapt its structures to the requirements of economicdevelopment and must pay increased attention toharmonizing commercial practices  technical cooperationand monetary policies of Member States and internationalfinancial institutions.Recent United Nations activity has been marked by animportant series of summit conferences which have dealtwith topics of major interest to all mankind. Theseconferences have emphasized the urgency  the seriousnessand the complexity of the topics they have dealt with andhave expanded the sphere of action of internationalconsensus regarding programmes throughout the worldrelated to the environment  population  socialdevelopment  human rights and the status of women. Wefeel that the United Nations and Member States mustfocus their efforts on the ways and means necessary toimplement the decisions adopted by those conferences.In this sense  I should like to mention the Plan ofAction adopted by the Cairo International Conference onPopulation and Development. The usefulness of thisdocument was reconfirmed at a regional seminar on itsimplementation in the countries of Central and EasternEurope which was organized recently in Romania incooperation with the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA). At the same time  I should like to express myGovernment’s readiness to organize a similar meeting inBucharest next year to consider the progress achieved atthe regional level in implementing the provisions of thePlatform for Action adopted by the World Conference onWomen  held in Beijing.It is clear that the major global problems taken upby the United Nations cannot be resolved withoutadequate financial support. The unparalleled increase inthe number of major problems brought to the attention ofthe United Nations has not been accompanied by anincrease in necessary resources. The United Nations istoday faced with a severe financial crisis. One possibleapproach to this crisis should be to consider the moreeffective use of available internal resources  theelimination of duplication in activities  more effectivedocument control  productive use of human resources strict financial monitoring and a permanent process ofcost-benefit analysis.With regard to the use of resources  peace-keepingoperations deserve special mention. The unprecedentedincrease in these operations indicates  among other things a more active involvement on the part of the UnitedNations in the management of crises and in preventivediplomacy. This new trend has necessitated an increase inresources. If we take into account that the great majorityof present conflicts involving United Nations peace-keeping operations are internal  we have to admit that theinternational community has very limited means forexerting pressure. Continuing ineffective operations doesnot serve to achieve the goals of the United Nationssatisfactorily  and consequently the Romanian delegationsupports the trend towards a closer and more rigorousexamination of all decisions related to launching newpeace-keeping operations or continuing existing ones.39Romania has made known its interest in limiting andpreventing conflicts in different areas of the globe  not onlyby promoting and encouraging the discovery of politicalsolutions  but also by participating in United Nations peace-keeping operations in Iraq and Kuwait  in Somalia  inRwanda and in Angola. Romania is determined to make asubstantial contribution to such operations and initiatives.To this end  a special programme has been adopted toincrease our capacity to react adequately to any requestfrom the United Nations or other bodies while strictlyrespecting the principles governing the activities of theUnited Nations.If we look back over the long road the United Nationshas travelled during its half century existence and  inparticular  if we look at the efforts it has made to adaptitself to the dynamics of international life in the last fiveyears  we are convinced of the value and the historicdestiny of the United Nations. I should like to assure theAssembly that Romania  with its dedication to peace  itsdesire to cooperate at all levels — bilateral  regional multilateral — its firm commitment to protect internationalpeace and security  its commitment to democratic valuesand respect for human rights  is determined to support thecommon heritage of values of the United Nations. Ourpresence among the Members of the United Nations for 40years is based on the prestige and the moral authoritywhich the United Nations enjoys in the eyes of theRomanian people.For this reason  we shall  with all our energy and ouravailable resources  remain committed to the noble duty ofserving the ideas and principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations."
"138",5959,"RUS",50,1995,"First of all  allow me to congratulate mycolleague  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal Professor Diogo Freitas Do Amaral  on the occasion ofhis election to the high post of the President of theGeneral Assembly.Each of the 50 sessions of the General Assembly hasbeen a step for the international community on a difficultroad in search of peace within itself  for the strengtheningof the indispensable role of the United Nations. Thecurrent session will be marked as the anniversary sessionby the addresses to be made by the Heads of State andGovernment in late October. Russia’s views on theprospects and difficulties of establishing partnership in amulti-polar and interdependent world — and it is withequal partnership that we link our national and stateinterests — will be stated by the Head of the RussianState  President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.If half a century of experience of the United Nationsteaches us anything  it teaches us first of all that only theequality of States and respect for the diversity of cultures religions and national traditions can serve as the basis forsecurity and prosperity in the modern world. But theformula “unity in diversity” also presupposes everyone’scompliance with fundamental principles of internationallaw and order  respect for human rights and the6promotion of economic progress. This is the essence of theUnited Nations Charter  which identifies both commonideals and goals and equal rights and obligations for allStates without “double standards”.They say that generals always prepare for the last war.Politicians and diplomats have no right to prepare for thelast peace. On the contrary  it is necessary to avoid slippingback into a bloc mentality and dividing countries into“friends and foes”  whether in politics or in economics.We can indeed make the next 50 years an era of theUnited Nations if we accept as its basis the indivisibility ofinternational security and sustainable social and economicdevelopment for all.This question becomes more and more acute againstthe background of humanitarian disasters in Africa andother regions of the “third world”  and the social price ofthe initial stage of reforms in the post-socialist countries.No one will be able to hide from global problems behinddividing lines of national egotism and economicdiscrimination  or even expanding military alliances. Suchthings will not rein in  but rather spur on the spread ofinternational terrorism and drugs  and whip up the flamesof local conflicts and the arms race.One of the principles of the “Agenda forDevelopment” which is being formulated now should be theearly elimination of the remaining discriminatoryrestrictions in the world economy  trade and technologytransfer. In particular  Russia  which is successfullyimplementing unparalleled reforms  should be recognized asan equal trade and economic partner with an economy intransition.Such a strategy should also provide for the promotionof the economic rehabilitation of countries and regionsaffected by armed conflicts. The United Nations  itsspecialized agencies and Member States should immediatelybegin to address directly the problem of the economicrehabilitation of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia as awhole  whose peoples have suffered from war andeconomic sanctions that have been in effect for too long.Russia is ready to take an active part in these efforts  andwe do and will continue to contribute substantially to apolitical settlement. The real chances for such a settlementshould not be sacrificed to power or unilateral approaches.The international community should make equallygreat efforts to achieve progress in all aspects of the peaceprocess in the Middle East and the post-conflictrehabilitation of all States of that region. We congratulateIsrael and the Palestinians on the occasion of theirreaching an agreement in Taba  whose official signingceremony will take place on 28 September next inWashington under the chairmanship of President Clinton.We intend to continue our joint efforts with the UnitedStates and to make our contribution to the comingAmman summit conference.Europe needs a new model of general andcomprehensive security  without double standards ordividing lines.International dialogue on this issue is already underway. I believe that the active involvement of the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies is necessary to theefforts aimed at the development of this model.Incidentally  the General Assembly was born in the OldWorld.A new approach is required to disarmament issues inEurope. On the basis of the implementation of theConventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (certainlytaking into account new realities) as early as next springwe should arrive at new major agreements based on theunity of the vital security interests of the peoples of thecontinent instead of the bloc logic of the past.Our proposal to all nuclear-weapon States toelaborate a treaty on nuclear safety and strategic stabilityhas become even more timely.The indefinite extension of the Non-ProliferationTreaty establishes favourable conditions for this. Ourcommon task is to create the necessary politicalconditions for those States that have not already done soto accede to it as non-nuclear States. We consider itnecessary  as a matter of priority  to conclude as soon aspossible  but not later than 1996  work on thecomprehensive test-ban treaty. From this rostrum  Russiacalls for a universal and permanent moratorium onnuclear tests.The summit of the “Political Eight” on nuclearsafety  which is to be held next spring in Moscow at theinitiative of the President of Russia and which wasapproved in Halifax  will make a major contribution toglobal stability.We would like the United Nations to take urgentmeasures on the prevention of illicit trafficking in lightfirearms and the proliferation of anti-personnel mines. It7is these “light” firearms that have led to enormous humanlosses in Rwanda and Angola  Liberia and Bosnia Tajikistan and Abkhazia. Russia has already introduced amoratorium on the export of the most dangerous types ofanti-personnel mines. We urge other States to follow ourexample.This issue should be seriously considered in the UnitedNations Disarmament Commission. While supporting theactivities of the Commission  we believe that it shouldadopt a new agenda corresponding to the current scale ofcooperation in the area of security and to new threats andchallenges in this field.The problem of global adherence to a single standardin the area of human rights and basic democraticinstitutions is very acute. Russia  approaching free multipartite parliamentary and presidential elections  ismaking its own contribution to the establishment of thesevery standards. We invite observers from foreign States andinternational organizations to attend the forthcomingelections.It was not so long ago that dozens of agenda items ofthe General Assembly were devoted to the struggle againstapartheid. Now it seems unbelievable that this problem hasbeen solved  owing to a large extent  to the efforts of theUnited Nations. I sincerely welcome the accomplishmentsof the people and the Government of South Africa  headedby Nelson Mandela  in the democratization and creation ofa free  multiracial society.But did we manage to overcome the danger ofviolence arising through fascism  racism  and political andreligious extremism? Alas  the answer is far fromreassuring. That is why the international community has noright to abandon its efforts in this direction and must nottolerate the emergence of double standards.The signing of the CIS conventions on human rightsand fundamental freedoms and on the rights of national andlanguage minorities was the response of the CIS States tothe United Nations recommendations on the creation of asingle humanitarian sphere in this part of the world.However  much has yet to be done before a unitaryapproach to human rights can become a norm of life for among others  25 million of our compatriots in somecountries of the Commonwealth and the Baltic States. Adouble standard here is unacceptable.Russia is interested in the adoption at this session ofdecisions on such issues as the struggle against racism  allforms of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism  ensuringthe rights of minorities and the promotion of democracyand the rule of law in countries in transition. The UnitedNations should further pursue its policy of qualitativeimprovement of the international human rights protectionmachinery  primarily by strengthening its control andpreventive functions and enhancing its focus on specificaction. The policy of single standards must become anincontestable rule in the sphere of peace-keeping as well.Justice without force is powerless  while force withoutjustice is tyrannical.There have been many achievements in UnitedNations peace-keeping efforts. Without the Blue Helmets the world would be much more dangerous and dozens ofconflicts would have been much more bloody. We areproud that approximately 20 000 Russian servicemen areserving as peace-keepers in United Nations and CISoperations.However  if we want force always to go hand-in-hand with justice in the activities of the United Nationsand those who cooperate in them  strict observance ofSecurity Council decisions must be ensured. Here  theSecretary-General and his staff can always count on thesupport of Russia and  I am confident  of all otherMembers of the United Nations. The United Nationsshould be protected from setbacks like that which hasoccurred in Bosnia.In general  it is necessary radically to improveUnited Nations peace-keeping through precision of thecriteria and terms of the United Nations involvement inareas of tension; a close linkage between peace-keepingoperations and efforts to achieve the peaceful settlementof conflicts; the efficient operation of the wholefunctional chain — peace-keeping planning  commandand control. We are for the earliest possibleimplementation of the Secretary-General’s proposal on theestablishment of United Nations reserve forces.We welcome the conclusion of the Convention onthe protection of United Nations personnel  which Isigned today on behalf of Russia. This instrument willhelp to save lives of hundreds of peace-keepers in hotspots of the world.Peace-making activities undertaken by Russia and itsCommonwealth partners contribute to a considerableextent to ensuring regional and international stability. Weappreciate fruitful cooperation with the United Nations inTajikistan and Georgia. However  the United Nations8support of our collective efforts sometimes unfortunatelyreminds us of a saying: “Too little  too late”. Russia together with its CIS partners  expects the United Nationsto make a radical change in its attitude towards peace-making problems in our part of the world.During the 50 years of the existence of the UnitedNations  sanctions have been an instrument that theOrganization has used to deal with the instigators ofconflicts. Now  the time has come to give this instrumenta more selective and precise nature. The principal criteriain this regard are: distinct objectives underlying sanctions advanced coordination of conditions  and mechanisms forlifting them once the objectives are attained.As a newly elected member of the Executive Councilof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  Russia intends to make an essential contributionto overcoming a new global crisis  namely the tragedy ofmillions of refugees. To this end  we intend to seekpractical results from the international conference onrefugees and migrants within the post-Soviet space.At this session the General Assembly should give newimpetus to collective efforts by the international communityin combating crime  illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism.The explosions in Oklahoma and Paris  the taking ofhostages in Budennovsk and chemical terrorist attacks inTokyo — these are bells tolling for us all.Whatever agenda item we consider  we are convincedtime and again that the answers are to be found only on thebasis of a single standard: respect for the United NationsCharter and for the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations that have withstood the severe tests of the past fivedecades and are lighting the way into the twenty-firstcentury."
"139",6006,"RWA",50,1995,"On behalf of the Rwandese people and of my delegation as well as on my own behalf  allow me to extend toHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral my warmand sincere congratulations on his unanimous election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.This choice does credit to his talent and experience as adiplomat and statesman  as well as to his country.I am also pleased to take this opportunity to expressour appreciation and admiration to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  whosededication  competence and commitment during the forty-ninth session of the Assembly do honour to that greatdiplomat  who embodies the pride of his country and ofAfrica as a whole.Allow me also  on behalf of the RwandeseGovernment of National Unity  to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the skill anddetermination he has shown in discharging his duties qualities that have scored some notable successes for ourOrganization and have strengthened its credibility and theesteem in which it is held.20Let me take this opportunity to welcome into thisconcert of nations the Republic of Palau  admitted as the185th Member of the United Nations. The presence here ofits delegation expands the horizons of the Organization andopens one additional door of cooperation for us.For my delegation and myself it is a special privilegeto take part in this the fiftieth session  which includes thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. My delegation is pleased  on behalf of theRwandan people and Government  to be a part of theconcert of nations in celebrating this anniversary. Thecreation of this Organization following the Second WorldWar was aimed at preserving future generations from thescourge of war  genocide and other evils that had afflictedthe human race for centuries.The United Nations thus drafted a Charter whosefundamental principles are based on human rights  justiceand peace. My delegation wishes to take this opportunity topay tribute to the founding countries of this indispensableOrganization  who took the initiative to create a worldinstitution. From the time of its creation  the United Nationshas been an ideal forum for the peace-  justice- andprogress-loving peoples of the world. The celebration of itsfiftieth anniversary is an opportunity for us to take stock ofthe road we have travelled  to pause and look at ourobjectives and to revise our programmes with a view tobeing better prepared for the future. My delegation ispleased that for half a century the United Nations hasspared us world wars  and that it has been an indispensableinstitution for the promotion and maintenance of peace.As for the developing countries — those of theAfrican continent in particular — during these 50 years theOrganization has played an important role in the liberationof many countries from the colonial yoke  and theestablishment of numerous United Nations specializedagencies has turned it into an instrument of development inall economic  social  political and cultural spheres. If thanks to the existence of this worthy Organization  theworld has been able to avoid other world wars  it has notsucceeded in averting hundreds of conflicts between itsMembers or in intervening between Member States which for a number of reasons  have engaged in such conflicts bysupporting third countries. Since 1945 wars withoutexception have shifted from the northern to the southernhemisphere.Following the end of the cold war it has becomeimperative to reform and restructure the United Nations toenable it to respond to the aspirations of its Members especially developing countries that receive the leastbenefit.As for the Security Council  we must ensureequitable geographical representation and increase thenumbers of permanent and non-permanent seats. Thisrestructuring must provide Africa with some permanentseats  with all the rights and duties that these entail. Thisis the continent’s right  not a privilege. The SecurityCouncil is in great need of democratization and theintroduction of greater transparency  both among itsmembers and vis-à-vis other organs of the United Nationsand other States Members of the Organization.My delegation supports the idea of reforming theUnited Nations in order to achieve greater efficiency andto avoid duplication in the Organization and between itand the specialized agencies. Such reform should beaimed at strengthening certain institutions and  therefore should not be interpreted as having any other purpose such as the reduction of Member States’ contributions.I should like to conclude this introduction byrecalling once again that justice and development are keyelements for the reigning of peace and security in theworld. That is the raison d’être of this Organization andthe highest desire of the Government and delegation ofRwanda.This is the first time  since the tragedy of thegenocide and planned massacres in Rwanda began toafflict our country and people and the world at large  formembers of the new Government of National Unity ofRwanda to participate in this debate at the United NationsGeneral Assembly.We know quite well that speaking at the GeneralAssembly is not a simple rite  after which we can just gohome. We know that speeches made in this prestigiousforum are listened to  analysed and scrutinized  especiallybecause they are opportunities for nations to express thewill  aspirations and priorities of their peoples  as well astheir positions on international issues of the day; theymust go beyond purely national egoisms and contribute tointernational understanding and solidarity.The crime against humanity committed in Rwandawere crimes not just against the Rwandan people but alsoagainst the members of this body  who should give us afew moments to submit some reflections on the first and21foremost victim of that crime  which  unfortunately  is myown country  Rwanda. With respect to this tragedy  it ispainful for us to have to emphasize the conduct of theUnited Nations  its failure  on the day it decided towithdraw the 2 500 Blue Helmets who were in Rwandawhen the genocide and massacres began  thus abandoninga whole defenceless population and delivering it into thehands of the killers.This was clearly a case of failure to assist a people indanger  a population in peril. A million human lives werelost in these tragic  planned events  as if it had beendecided to erase from the map of the world at a singlestroke a whole country with a population of that size.It is important to remind the Assembly that this wasnot at all a civil war in Rwanda. Rather  it involved militiasof the former single party and their supporters  militaryofficials of the former Rwandan armed forces and formerpoliticians  who were engaged in a manhunt againstinnocent  defenceless people — a manhunt against all theTutsis in the country and all the moderate Hutus  as well astheir parents  other relatives  friends and everyone elseclose to them.In this manhunt the victims were stripped of their rightto life. They were forced to pay their own killers for theright to die from a bullet in the head rather than be killedwith a machete or forced to dig their own graves  intowhich they would be thrown alive. The price of a bullet inthe head or in the heart ranged from 5 000 Rwandan francsto 30 000 Rwandan francs in the countryside  and from50 000 Rwandan francs to 1 million Rwandan francs ormore in the cities.When the armed forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Frontand the democratic forces of change had achieved amilitary and political victory against these Nazis of Africa the United Nations  at the request of the Government ofNational Unity — formed by the groups I havementioned — created the International Tribunal for Rwandaand entrusted it with the trial of those guilty of themassacres and genocide in the country.Perhaps this is the appropriate time for the UnitedNations to restore respect for it by a people still sufferingthe abandonment to which it fell victim in April 1994. Thatpeople looks to the United Nations  which did not protectit from genocide and massacre  to prove itself capable thistime of trying and sentencing those whom it could not orwould not stop from killing.The United Nations cannot afford the luxury of yetanother failure in Rwanda. President Arap Moi of Kenyahas announced that he will not cooperate with theInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. That couldbe a precedent if we are not careful. The President ofKenya as well as the United Nations should take care tomeasure the degree of poison that the President of Kenyais calmly distilling in the subregion of the Great Lakes byannouncing publicly that if the investigators of theInternational Tribunal for Rwanda dare to set foot inKenya seeking persons who committed the genocide inRwanda they would be imprisoned by the Government ofKenya. We fear that this could be the beginning of thefailure of the United Nations and the InternationalCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in bringing to justice thecommanders  the planners and those who carried out thegenocide and massacres last year in Rwanda. Thus  weawait a decision from the Security Council on what itintends to do with respect to the refusal by Kenya tocooperate with the pursuit of persons who havecommitted genocide who are taking shelter in Kenya  andothers who may follow them on the basis of theassurances offered by the President of Kenya in defianceof Security Council resolution 978 (1995) in this respect.The Government of National Unity of the Republicof Rwanda  wishing to promote peace and security inRwanda and the subregion  decided when it took office on19 July 1994 to make the repatriation of refugees itshighest priority. We must recall here that the recentRwandan refugees are not the first ones. They date from1959 and the bloody events of 1961  1963  1965  1967 1972  1973 and 1990. The number of refugees hassteadily increased and has now reached the figure of morethan 1 million. The international community remainedsilent about the repeated refusal by the former Presidentof Rwanda to allow these people to return home; heproclaimed that the country was overcrowded and was toosmall  that there was no room for anyone else  and thatthe more than 1 million Rwandan refugees would have toremain forever in exile where they had found refuge formore than 30 years.For the new Government of National Unity ofRwanda — unlike the Governments that preceded it —the repatriation of refugees is part of the process ofrehabilitating the human capital that is so much needed byour Government  which has decided to make humanbeings the focus of its concerns  for it is the people of acountry who are the most important source of its wealth and its greatest asset. It is the population that produces and it must therefore be taught and re-taught the positive22values of tolerance and respect for life and justice — in thiscase  respect for security  health  and social and socio-professional well-being.Rwanda  a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil has always shouldered its responsibilities in thepromotion of peace and security in the world — in Bosnia Somalia  Liberia  Angola  Chechnya and everywhere thatarmed conflicts have broken out.Faithful to those principles the Rwandan Governmentsupports any initiative likely to create room for peaceanywhere in the world  especially in our subregion. Thuswe were present at the Conference in Brazzaville  Congo;the Conference in Nairobi  Kenya  in January 1995; and theBujumbura Conference in February 1995. The RwandanGovernment requests that the conclusions of the Nairobiand Bujumbura Conferences be implemented in order toensure the rapid repatriation of Rwandan refugees beforeconsidering any additional conferences are held. We find itdifficult to see what the purpose or goal of such additionalconferences would be.As I had occasion to say at the beginning of mystatement  to make a speech at this prestigious rostrum ofthe United Nations is for any nation an opportunity toexpress its views and the way it envisages the future of itspeople and the world in the light of the experience of thepast. That is especially the case on this fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations  which is a time to take stock notonly for the Organization itself but also for the nations thatare its Members.Rwanda  for as long as it has existed as a country andnation  has been living in a state of constant imbalance thathas inflicted on it a whole series of frustrations: theimbalances of the monarchic period  when all Tutsis wereforcibly assimilated into the ruling clan; the imbalances ofa badly managed colonial era  which engendered its innatefrustrations; and the imbalances of the post-independenceperiod  which also created its own frustrations  conflicts andpower struggles in the neocolonial world. All theseimbalances and the resulting frustrations led Rwandadirectly into the large-scale massacres and genocide thattook place from April to July 1994.At present  under the leadership since 19 July 1994 ofthe Government of National Unity which emerged frompolitical formations that had fought against the Fascistideology of the former single party and its supporters Rwanda has left the orbit of constant imbalance  the sourceof the majority of the ills of which it had been the victimup to that time. Today Rwanda is in what I would call atime of restored balance  in which all progressive peoplein Rwanda have decided to work together hand in hand going beyond any ethnic and regional divisions for thesake of the survival of the Rwandan people and nation asa whole. This time of restored balance is a preciousmoment in the history of Rwanda  in our history  and wewish to assure the Assembly of this. The Rwandan peopleand Government call upon the United Nations and theentire international community present here to continue tolend their moral  political  material and financial supportto the Rwandan Republic and people during the fragileand delicate period of this restored balance. For a countrythat has so long lived in a virtually permanent state ofimbalance  this moment of restored balance is a great andprecious moment. It is like a child which has just beenborn and which one must look after very carefully lest itslip out of one’s grasp. Help us  then  to preserve thisprecious moment of restored equilibrium  for the sake ofthe future of the Rwandan nation and all the people ofRwanda.In this respect  we urge journalists and politicalanalysts throughout the world to support the effortstowards unity and national reconciliation of the Rwandanpeople  which have regained their identity. We ask thosejournalists and political analysts to abandon the simplisticterms and ideas of the past  to which they have had thehabit of resorting whenever they have spoken aboutAfrica and the peoples of Africa  of Rwanda in particular.We beg them to leave the pre-established corridors  not toremain prisoners of these often simplistic terms and ideasof the past  and not to view everything in Rwanda interms of ethnic dichotomies. Complexity  pure andsimple  exists in Rwanda. We must understand it in orderto better understand a people which has today regained itsidentity and its balance and is united in favour of true lasting national reconciliation  one that is not sensationalor superficial  which  rather  seeks to take deep roots.The Rwandan Government is determined to spare noeffort to establish all the necessary conditions for theresumption of economic activities  the deep-going nationalreconciliation we mentioned a moment ago and thedemocratization process. In addition to determination  itneeds human  material and financial resources to carry outits immense programme of national reconciliation reconstruction and rehabilitation. This is why theGovernment and the people of Rwanda needunderstanding and assistance from the African communityand the international community — so that a Rwandannation can be built on an unshakable foundation and the23Rwandan people can enjoy a genuine nationalreconciliation.My country  Rwanda  is concerned about numerousproblems  both political and socio-economic  of the GreatLakes subregion. In this connection  the idea of holding aregional conference on peace and stability in the GreatLakes region has recently been put forward. However  aswe have made clear on other occasions  no one has so farbeen able to explain what would be original about such aconference  especially with regard to how its substancewould differ from that of the conferences on the samesubject held in Nairobi in January 1995 and in Bujumburain February of the same year.Rwanda considers that for the sake of credibility andefficiency  all the measures deemed appropriate in Nairobiand Bujumbura should first be put to the test  and thenecessary conclusions drawn  before envisaging otherstrategies.In political and security matters  the unrest andinsecurity caused by the rearmament of militias and theformer Rwandan armed forces constitute a threat to peacein the subregion. In this connection  the RwandaGovernment welcomes the establishment of an internationalcommission assigned to investigate the illegal arms trafficintended to destabilize Rwanda and its neighbouringcountries.In the economic area  the Rwandan Governmentbelongs to subregional and regional groupings whose aimis to integrate the States of the African Great Lakes region.My Government is determined to direct its efforts towardsregional economic unity so that the States of the subregioncan enjoy peaceful understanding and fruitful cooperation.Regarding Africa  my Government welcomes thereconciliation efforts of the brotherly people of Angola. Mydelegation hopes that  for the well-being of its peoples  thatcountry will achieve a lasting peace. The Rwandandelegation welcomes the fact that the parties concernedrecently reached an accord on several important questionsand adopted an accelerated time-table for theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol with a view toputting a definitive stop to the war and achieving nationalreconciliation in Angola.We also welcome the political success recorded by thepeople of Mozambique for reconciliation and democracy. Inthe same spirit  we urge our Somali brothers to resumedialogue in order to rebuild their nation for the benefit ofthe country’s population  which has suffered so much. MyGovernment welcomes the dialogue initiated betweenbrothers in Liberia  who yesterday were enemies  with aview to bringing definitive peace to Liberia. In thisconnection  the official installation of the Council of Stateon 1 September 1995 makes it possible to hope that thepeace process has begun anew. We urge the internationalcommunity to do its part in helping that war-torn country.In the Middle East  the peace process initiated withthe Israeli-Palestinian accord of 28 September 1995 isencouraging. We also support the peace process underway in Bosnia and Herzegovina.In conclusion  my delegation hopes that on enteringthe twenty-first century the United Nations will be welladapted to the challenges of tomorrow’s world. Rwanda for its part  assures the Organization that it will do all itcan to establish peace within its borders and preservepeace throughout the world. That is our mission."
"140",6088,"SDN",50,1995,"Allow me at the outset to express to the President mywarmest congratulations on his election to guide thefiftieth session of the General Assembly. We areconfident that his wealth of experience will make itpossible for this session to achieve its noble goals. I9should like to pledge the full support and cooperation ofSudan to that end.Allow me also to express my great appreciation to hispredecessor  the President of the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire  for hisimmensely valuable contribution to the work of the UnitedNations. I would also like to commend the Secretary-General for his continuous endeavours in fulfilling hisfunctions.This session of the General Assembly acquires aspecial importance because half a century in the lifetime ofthe Organization calls upon us to pause for contemplationand self-criticism. We should do that because we lookforward to the United Nations becoming the body thatguarantees peaceful coexistence amongst States  the lightthat guides States in important issues and the effectiveinstrument for consolidating international cooperation.The philosophy upon which the United Nations wasestablished was one that aimed at reflecting the progresshumanity had achieved towards the state of civilization.However  actual experience has fallen short of thataspiration. In our view  this falling short has been due tocertain practices by means of which some have tried to usethe Organization as a tool to impose their hegemony andinfluence  so that their own outlook and values may becomethe sole  compulsory statute of the international community regardless of any diversity of cultures  beliefs  or heritage.It behoves us to agree  however  that our world is made upof a fabric of diversity  and that such diversity  at no timein history  has been a source of conflict but  rather  a sourceof rich and valuable contributions to the gains made bymankind. Instead of undermining that diversity or using itas a pretext for strife and conflict  it would have been wiserto make it a basis for constructive dialogue and theconsolidation of tolerance and justice in the world.The United Nations has led humanity towards newhorizons in the half century that has elapsed since itsestablishment. This necessitates a reconsideration of itssystem and mechanisms  given the vast expansion in itsmembership  its new responsibilities and the emergence ofnew international economic and political blocs and systemsthat were not in existence when the United Nations wasfounded. Top priority in such an endeavour should beaccorded to the need to reform the Security Council  inview of the role expected from it in maintaininginternational peace and security.The considerations we have mentioned arecompelling reasons for expanding Security Councilmembership in order to ensure equitable representation ofthe developing countries. It is also necessary to reformthe procedures of the Council  to ensure transparency andclarity in its work  to reform its decision-makingmechanism and to develop equitable criteria that wouldguide its policies and safeguard it against the pitfall ofdouble-standard and the effects of the ambitions ofhegemony and domination of any of its members.The reform of the United Nations should alsoinclude reform of the Bretton Woods institutions  whichhave come to be used as tools for the implementation ofstrategies that are designed to entrench hegemony overthe developing countries. Therefore  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions are required to return to their mandate  whichstipulate their role in the promotion of a balanceddevelopment and support for the monetary and financialpolicies of all countries without exception ordiscrimination. We also concur in the call for a review ofthose institutions in the light of the economic andfinancial factors which have come to prevail in today’sworld as a result of the emergence of new groups andcountries whose economic weight enables them to exertconsiderable influence on international trade and on theflow of financial resources and capital.Today’s world also faces a number of economic andsocial crises as a result of the fractious economic relationsbetween North and South  the inequitable terms of tradeand the ever-expanding gap between rich and poorcountries. Those crises are exacerbated by the dominanceof consumerism and the undermining of the moral valuesthat uphold the dignity of man and preserve the socialfabric. Those are moral values which inspired all culturesand civilizations. Accordingly  the objectives of balanceddevelopment should be formulated on a basis of respectfor those values and principles in order for theseobjectives to be conducive to resolving the crises andmaintaining balance in social  political  cultural  andeconomic relations in the world community.In this regard  we should mention the debt problemthat has become a major concern for developingcountries  especially the African. The indebtedness of theAfrican countries had doubled in the past 10 years to arecord $270 billion  with a debt-servicing tag thatconsumes about 35 per cent of the gross national productof those countries. As expected  the heavy debt burdenand debt-servicing tag have had serious consequences10which impede development efforts and obstruct economicstructural reforms.On the other hand  the industrial countries have takenno responsible initiative to address this problem. Instead they called for a case-by-case approach on a bilateral basis.This reinforces the impression that the purpose is theimposition of a political agenda. The result has beenparalysis of the economies of African States  collapse oftheir infrastructures  and  consequently the eruption ofinternal and regional conflicts all over the continent  whichhave impeded Africa’s efforts to achieve growth andinternal stability. Therefore  the linking of peace-keeping humanitarian assistance and long-term sustainabledevelopment is a principle that we welcome and support.Sudan has been following with deep concern thesituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  where the Bosnianpeople have continued to be victims of “ethnic cleansing”and extermination. While we reiterate our support for thepeople and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina  wecall upon the international community to continue its effortsto put an end to the genocide that targets this people andwe commend the efforts deployed by all those countriesthat support or are engaged in the search for a just  lastingand comprehensive settlement to this problem.The situation in the Gulf is of special importance to usnot only because it affects our peace and stability  but alsobecause of the deeply rooted historical and cultural ties andrelationships which strongly bind my country to that region.We look forward to the return of peace amongst ourbrothers in the Gulf. In this respect  we have welcomedIraq’s official recognition of the sovereignty and territorialboundaries of the State of Kuwait in accordance with therelevant Security Council resolutions and Iraq’s undertakingto cooperate in resolving the outstanding problems betweenthe two States  on the one hand  and between Iraq and theSecurity Council  on the other. We call on all parties toabide by these measures in order to guarantee Kuwait’slegitimate right to existence and sovereignty and the rightto security and stability to its people and leadership. By thesame token  we call for the lifting of the embargo imposedon Iraq  which no longer has any legal justification as thegrounds it was built on no longer obtain. The embargo hasnow become a political ploy aimed at starving the Iraqipeople  humiliating it and fragmenting its territory.In the same context  Sudan has been following  withgreat dismay and disapprobation  the continuation of theunjust sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya while the Jamahiriya has spared no effort in trying to dealwith the dispute over the Lockerbie crisis by everyacceptable legal means. It is our opinion that the initiativeby the League of Arab States  to which the Libyan ArabJamahiriya subscribes  is a practical basis for addressingthe situation in a manner that would lead to the lifting ofthe sanctions.As for the Palestinian question  it is our belief thatpeace should be based on the criteria of justice and fullrespect for all the rights of the Palestinian and Arabpeoples of the region. Consequently  the return of all theSyrian Golan Heights to Syria  and Israel’s full andunconditional withdrawal from southern Lebanon Al-Quds and all the other occupied Arab territories  areessential requirements for the achievement of any stablelasting settlement.We are advocates of peace  stability and good-neighbourliness. Our abiding conviction has been that theHorn of Africa is a region that has suffered most  withoutany objective justification from internal civil strife andinstability. We concur with the view that the peoples ofthe subregion should focus on the need to achievesecurity and stability. Indeed  this is an objective that wehave worked for through many a practical initiative thatwe put forward as members of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the International Authorityon Drought and Development (IGADD). Notwithstandingthe high hopes we had in that direction  the results havefallen short of the very minimum of our aspirations because some have been seduced by grand strategieswhose aim has been the destabilization of the region. It isregrettable that some seem to find it difficult indeed toabide by the behests of international legality or even torespect the norms of international law. It is equallyregrettable that such quarters find it difficult to abide bythe principles of good-neighbourliness and peacefulcoexistence and turn  instead  to subversion and terrorismagainst my country publicly embrace and give haven toelements of armed opposition.My country supports the initiatives aimed atpromoting and strengthening regional organizations andmechanisms for conflict prevention and settlement  andurges that such mechanisms should adhere to theobjectives they were introduced to achieve and abide bythe rules that govern their activities. It is our opinion thatthe functions of such mechanisms should be  above allelse  preventive and that they should discharge suchfunctions impartially. They should intervene in conflictsonly when it is necessary to do so  with the consent ofthe parties concerned  and their activities should be11limited to peaceful handling. They should also preservetheir regional nature  so that they do not become extensionsof other parallel mechanisms or tentacles of strategies thataim at international hegemony.As regards our immediate neighbours  allow me toreciprocate  and to extend similar greetings to the brotherlypeople of Egypt  and to express our conviction that only thetruth will prevail and that the situation in Egypt will returnto its normal course  away from all policies of repression domination and terrorism. There is no doubt that relationsbetween Sudan and Egypt  inevitably  will return to normalaway from the policy of imposition of fait accompli  awayfrom the policies of occupation of territory by force andovert support for organized armed terrorism and away fromthe legitimization of rebellion and sedition.It is our conviction that the ties of brotherhood andsolidarity that  historically  have linked our two peoples will remain as strong and as enduring as the Nile that flowsfrom Sudan to Egypt. Sudan has very clearly supported theintegrity of Egypt within its borders. This has been theposition of principle adopted by Sudan towards Egypt  notin words but in deeds that are recorded in the eternal annalsof history as when the sons of Sudan gave their lives indefence of Egypt.As we are renewing the commitment to and desire forpeace and coexistence  we call for the resolving bynegotiation of all boundary disputes and all problemsrelating to sovereignty over territories that arise betweenStates. Failing this  there would be no alternative but toseek arbitration by neutral parties.The word “Islam” is derived from the Arabic word“salam” which means “peace”. Islam is a religion based onthe principles of peace  equality and justice. I do notbelieve that Islam needs anyone to defend its record: it ishistory that bears witness to the greatness of thecivilizations it gave rise to while the present attests to itscontribution to the moral and social progress of men.God honoured man by making him with His own handand by ordaining that this fact should for ever be afundamental reason for honouring man and for upholdinghis rights. Thus the concept of human rights  which wasrecently blazoned by some as if it were something that theyhave just recently discovered  has been part of Islam’steachings for centuries upon centuries. Islam made it partof its charter which guides the believers long before thatconcept found its way into modern charters.It is indeed regrettable that such a religion shouldbecome the target of a malicious onslaught that aims notonly at distorting its image  but also at trying to questionits origins and roots. It is all the more disturbing thatcertain major Powers and societies have found it fitting toparticipate in this onslaught  without paying heed  itwould seem  to the devastating confrontation between theWest and Islam the onslaught is trying to provoke. Weparticularly urge the United Nations not to allow itself tobe dragged into such a campaign.We were pleased by the constructive approachadopted by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in his addressto this Assembly and by his call for coexistence amongstdifferent cultures so that they might complement eachother in building a healthy human society.In that connection  we also applaud the statement bythe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany before thisAssembly and by his rejection of any linking of Islamwith terrorism. We hope that other Western leaders willfollow suit and ensure that policies on the ground shouldreflect such a posture. Moreover  the need to avoidattempts at misrepresenting Islam and provokingconfrontation with it requires that such positive positionsshould not be confined to leaders and Governments butshould extend also and become reflected in their societies their mass media and their legal  security andadministrative systems.In conformity with our values and beliefs  whichrespect women  the State has promoted the position ofwomen in Sudan  has granted them their full rights andhas enabled them to reach the highest levels in theconstitutional  legislative  and executive branches ofGovernment. In today’s Sudan  women constitute50 per cent of the Government’s working force. Thepercentage of females in the universities and institutionsof higher education is more than 60 per cent. Sudan wasa pioneer among the countries of the region in the area ofempowering woman. Women have been appointed notonly to govern provinces  but also to hold leading postsin a number of the ministries of central Government andin the provinces.Our option in Sudan has been that economic andsocial development should be founded on our spiritualvalues  our historical background and our social traditions.Self-reliance has been the major underpinning of thisendeavour to achieve development. Although our optingfor this path has been under conditions of an inauspicious12world climate  yet we have managed to provide food clothing and various basic services for our citizens.The participation of the Sudanese citizen in thecountry’s public affairs underscores the approach we haveopted for  namely the prevalence of the spirit ofconsultation — shura — so that our citizens may be ableto participate actively in the decision-making organs withinthe federal system. In this context  Sudan has witnessedpublic elections for various legislative bodies in more than20 of its 26 provinces. Upon completion of elections in allprovinces  elections for the members of the NationalAssembly will be held  and eventually  the election of aPresident of the Republic will take place.At the moment  Sudan hosts about one millionrefugees  and despite its meagre resources  its Governmentprovides them with material assistance. It is unfortunate thatthe international community has discontinued its assistanceto those refugees  thus leaving the country to bear the bruntof this essentially international responsibility. We call uponthe international community to increase its financialassistance to the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to meet the essentialneeds of refugee projects and programmes in Sudan. Failureby the international community to do so will be quite unfairto Sudan  as it would mean that the country is expected tocontinue to host such a number of refugees while theinternational community fails to discharge its responsibilitytowards them.We come to this session of the General Assemblymotivated by good faith  and determination to play fully ourrole in cooperation with the international family of theUnited Nations. In so doing  we are inspired by ourcommitment to the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter and by our desire to put our capabilities atthe service of the common good of mankind and to workfor the realization of our aspirations after a new worldorder that would be characterized by liberty  equality andjustice. We hope that the principles set forth in thisstatement would point the way towards the attainment ofthe noble goals which the United Nations was created toachieve."
"141",6133,"SEN",50,1995,"My country  Senegal  is very pleased to express to Mr.Diogo Freitas do Amaral its warm congratulations on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfiftieth session. His election reflects how much theinternational community values the role his country —Portugal — has played in analysing and managing themajor questions that mark the evolution of the world. Italso values his personal qualities as a diplomat and astatesman  as well as his experience in the field of humanrelations  the fundamental basis of peace among nations.I should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Freitas doAmaral’s predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  Foreign Ministerof Côte d’Ivoire  who conducted the work for the year ofthe forty-ninth session with effectiveness and remarkableopen-mindedness  thus earning the pride of all Africa.Finally  I should like here  once again  to emphasizemy country’s support for the Secretary-General  Mr.6Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His initiatives  his repeated actionsand his determination to accomplish his noble mission inthe service of peace  security and development  despite aparticularly unstable international situation  have earned thegratitude of the world. History will owe him a debt ofthanks.Today  the United Nations has travelled through halfa century. For 50 years the peoples of the Earth  followingthe Second World War  having wisely learned the lessonsof the mistakes and set-backs of the history of humanconflicts  have been engaged in an effort to create a newenvironment  an atmosphere of mutual understanding andof cooperation in solidarity  a framework within whichmankind can finally realize that communal spirit  generosityand mutual respect are the best possible guarantees ofpeace  well-being  health and the environment  as well asthe blossoming of society.For 50 years  pursuant to the principles set forth in theUnited Nations Charter by the founders of our sharedOrganization  we have  stage by stage  laid the foundationsfor an international system that can provide collectivesecurity for all countries and  at the same time  create thebest possible conditions for life in greater freedom.If we consider the action that the Organization hasundertaken since its creation — in particular  if we analysethe management of the many conflicts that arose here andthere during the period of the cold war — we can see without any shadow of doubt  that it has indeed proved tobe an irreplaceable tool for the promotion and maintenanceof peace.Indeed  beyond the simple maintenance ofinternational peace and security  the Organizationremarkably distinguished itself in the struggle fordecolonization  but  above all  in the establishment of aprogressive system of specialized agencies  all of whichprovide highly valued assistance in the social  economic humanitarian and cultural fields.But  despite these recorded achievements  we have toadmit that there is still a long road to travel  that a numberof important challenges still have to be met  and new andbold initiatives taken  if we are to realize fully the idealscontained in the San Francisco Charter.Patient preparation is being made for a historic reformof the structures of the Organization itself and  specifically the Security Council. In this connection  Senegalunreservedly supports an increase in the numbers ofpermanent and non-permanent members of the Councilwith a view to strengthening the conditions andmachinery available for the maintenance of peace.It must indeed be accepted that the end ofideological confrontation has brought the world neitherthe peace nor the development that was so earnestlyanticipated by the founding fathers of the Charter.From Afghanistan to Angola  from Bosnia andHerzegovina to Somalia  from Liberia to the republicsthat emerged from the former Soviet Union  manyconflicts continue to this day to resist our attempts tosolve them. True  for some conflicts  such as those inAngola or the Middle East  significant progress hasrecently been achieved. And I wish to take thisopportunity to welcome the new important step that hasjust been taken in the search for a settlement to theMiddle East conflict with the signing  on 28 September inWashington  of the Taba Agreement.In the case of other conflicts  such as that in Bosniaand Herzegovina  a glimmer of hope is now showing overthe horizon thanks to the concerted action of the WesternContact Group and the Contact Group of the Organizationof the Islamic Conference  as well as the European Union the United States of America  the Russian Federation andother Governments of good will. This is also anopportunity for me to congratulate the Organization of theIslamic Conference and its member States for all theirefforts and initiatives. They have made a considerablecontribution to the results we have solemnly welcomedtoday.In this regard  it is clear that the heroic struggle ofthe Bosnian people  underpinned by its leaders’ acuteawareness of their responsibilities  has made a powerfulcontribution to the new situation which the internationalcommunity wishes to see strengthened and eventuallyresult in a definitive peace for the former Yugoslavia.The proliferation of conflicts resulting from thedisappearance of blocs has had the positive effect oflaying the foundation for a consensus on the machinery criteria  conditions and means to be used to ensure organize and safeguard peace throughout the world. Thisconsensus implies that we must have greater recourse topreventive diplomacy as an innovative concept to ensurethat our system of collective security functions properly.This consensus also implies that the mandates of peace-keeping operations should henceforth be better defined inthe light of the circumstances and objectives sought. The7necessary means should therefore be collected andmobilized.The importance which my country  Senegal  attachesto this question is commensurate with its tirelessdetermination to work towards an effective security systemthat works because it is fully adapted to current realities. Itis above all in this spirit that Senegal is a regularparticipant in the work of the Special Committee to reviewthe whole question of peace-keeping operations in all theiraspects.Moreover  Senegal’s position is in accord with theclear awareness in Africa of changes occurring throughoutthe world and which led our continent in 1992  at thesummit meeting of the Organization of African Unity inDakar  to conceive and establish a mechanism for theprevention  management and settlement of conflicts. ThisAfrican initiative  which contributes to the maintenance ofpeace and security throughout the world  should thereforebe supported by the international community in order toreduce the practical ramifications of the lack of fundswhich  as everyone knows  is so sorely afflicting Africa and enable it to achieve its legitimate ambitions throughfulfilment of the aims of this machinery. With such support our continent  Africa  would be able to devote itself furtherto settling the conflicts in Rwanda  Burundi  Liberia  SierraLeone and Somalia.Speaking of regional conflicts  in regard to theproblem of Jammu and Kashmir — involving twoneighbouring and fraternal countries  India and Pakistan with which Senegal has friendly relations — my delegationwould urge a definitive settlement that would allow thesetwo great Asian nations to devote their efforts toestablishing an atmosphere of peace conducive to integrateddevelopment and mutual benefit. The Organization of theIslamic Conference  in conjunction with these twocountries  is giving careful thought to this matter.It is universally recognized today that there can be nodevelopment without peace and stability. It is thus in thelack of development  poverty  marginalization and exclusionthat we must seek the underlying causes of insecurity. Wemust therefore devise together a new system of collectivelife that will give everyone new reasons for hope on thebasis of the spirit of solidarity and desire for peace inwhich the system is founded.Such action should begin with a new awareness that even if the expression “globalization of the economy” isnow in vogue  the phenomenon goes far beyond the trend.Indeed  it involves  coevally  economics  finance andinformation. It is also and particularly relevant to themajor problems of humanity’s future  be it the question ofprotecting the environment  fighting threats against ourcollective health  drug trafficking or fighting organizedcrime. It has become obvious today that the solutions tothese problems cannot but be global.In the light of these new realities of today’s world it is clear that only a new conception of collectivesolidarity will allow us to avoid or at least mitigate themany serious consequences of poverty and exclusion thatare so damaging to everyone. We must therefore make acollective commitment to defining a new social covenantfor the future of mankind. The struggle against poverty inthe countries of the southern hemisphere thereforeassumes particular importance in this context.Given the current globalization and liberalization inthe economy of nations  the new World TradeOrganization (WTO) — opened in Geneva a few monthsago after having been christened at the historic Marrakeshmeeting — should prove to be a new framework andcradle for a world open to fairer  more balanced and morehuman economic and trade relations between the countriesof the North and South  in the spirit of the legitimateclaims of the peoples of the third world. Here  I wishsolemnly to reaffirm that the WTO carries with it thehopes of the world for a new era of profitable  balancedand sustainable trade for all.From this perspective  the World TradeOrganization  to the establishment of which the Africancountries contributed  should help those countries toparticipate more actively in the new internationaleconomic system.Moreover  the globalization and liberalization of theeconomy should also encourage the developing countriesto intensify South-South cooperation as an essentialcomponent of both the strategy for development and themeans to ensure the integration of their economies in thenew context and within the new aspirations of theinternational community for development in peace particularly of the countries of the South. The same istrue of the need to boost commodity prices and to ensureequitable access to markets — to all markets — to allowour countries to develop genuine and effective tradepolicies. My country  Senegal  wishes unreservedly tostake its claim to this dynamic process.8On the occasion of this fiftieth anniversary of thecreation of the United Nations  from this rostrum I wish tomake a solemn and heartfelt appeal on behalf of thedevelopment of Africa. This appeal reflects a major concernof African leaders and peoples. The United Nations  as weknow  has devoted much fruitful attention to this matter  aswitnessed by the convening in Geneva last July  within theframework of the session of the Economic and SocialCouncil  of a high-level debate on African development.Today  it is a truism to stress the dangers of Africa’smarginalization. It is a danger  a real one  painful andserious. Although it is real  the danger is none the lessunacceptable. It is therefore absolutely essential  for allthose for whom solidarity and international cooperationcontinue to hold meaning  that it be averted.I welcome the fact that the Secretary-General of theOrganization that shelters us today is one of those whobelieves that there is no historical inevitability which Africacannot overcome. Has not Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghalidecisively proved this by deciding to launch a specialinitiative for Africa  with the clear aim of breathing freshlife into international cooperation?Through me  Senegal reiterates its total support forthis initiative  which is particularly fortunate since itdovetails with all the priorities Africa has set for itself —namely  food security  water control  social and humandevelopment  democracy  mobilization of resources and finally the struggle against poverty.It should also be recalled that the Head of theSenegalese State  His Excellency President Abdou Diouf has been tirelessly devoting himself for a long time now toseeking global solutions to the problems of Africa particularly the excruciating question of debt which isdelaying the development of African countries.Thus  during his first term of office as Chairman ofthe Organization of African Unity  he was the initiation ofthe convening in 1986  for the first time in the annals of theUnited Nations  of a special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to Africa’s critical economic situation.Similarly  Senegal welcomed the conclusion in Parisin 1994 of the international Convention to CombatDesertification in those Countries Experiencing SeriousDrought and/or Desertification  particularly in Africa  andwould like to stress here that this Convention must be putinto effect very soon and that the allocation of theconsiderable resource that would be needed to uproot thisscourge from the African continent should be accelerated.This is the task which for years now has been the specialconcern of the Interstate Committee for Drought Controlin the Sahara.We cannot speak about development withoutaddressing the question of respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms  which havetoday become a universally recognized requirement.Everyone is aware of how wedded Senegal is to thisrequirement of our modern times that  in view of thechanges which have affected the world since the end ofthe 1980s  all African countries  integrate this policy intotheir development policy as an unavoidable dimension ofprogress.To conclude  may I emphasize once again that thenew international context and the multi-dimensionalnature of the problems that must be solved requireconcerted action by all of us: integrated action  solidarityamong all partners — Governments  agencies and bodies public or private — that mould the life and the evolutionof the human international community.Solidarity is the cement and also the guarantee ofthis common approach  which is inspired by what isneeded for mankind to survive. Solidarity is first andforemost a profound conviction that we all belong to oneand the same world  whether it be developed orunderdeveloped. Solidarity also entails a duty to face upto our common problems and our common challenges whether we come from the North or from the South.Solidarity is  finally  a collective will to build the futureon the basis of a partnership from which none areexcluded. Solidarity is also a common commitmentvoluntarily to promote the collective progress of allmankind. It is in the name of all the nations that are sogreatly devoted to the mission of man on earth that wemust nurture solidarity  cooperation  friendship andbrotherhood.In this spirit and at this juncture in the history of ourplanet when hope has been rekindled by the celebrationof the fiftieth anniversary of an organization — theUnited Nations — without which the world would not bewhat it is today  we solemnly express our ardent hopethat this 1995 session  the fiftieth in the history of theUnited Nations  will be the dawn of a new era in whichwe shall witness the realization of all our ideals of peace justice and progress  to the greatest benefit of futuregenerations  to which it is our duty to hand over a worldof peace  a world of security and a world of development."
"142",6180,"SGP",50,1995,"Allow me first tocongratulate His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral and Portugal  on his election to lead the GeneralAssembly through this important fiftieth session. I shouldalso like to record Singapore’s appreciation to hisdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency Mr. AmaraEssy of Côte d’Ivoire. I also take this opportunity tothank our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his continuing dedication to the purposes of theUnited Nations.In recent years the United Nations has had much todo with peace-keeping and human rights. They areimportant matters  but the United Nations is not just aboutpeace-keeping or human rights. International economiccooperation is one of the important purposes of theUnited Nations as defined by our Charter. Poverty breedsconflict  but abject poverty makes a mockery of all civilliberties.Our Secretary-General’s Agenda for Developmentshould give cause for all of us to reflect on the UnitedNations role in the world economy. Of the five decadesof the existence of the United Nations  four have beendedicated to development. Vast sums have beenexpended  but with what result?Specialized agencies like the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF)  the World HealthOrganization (WHO)  the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) and the United Nations Development21Programme (UNDP) do not hit the headlines  but are themost successful institutions in the United Nations system.They make quiet  unglamorous  but no-less-valuablecontributions to human dignity and international order thando the Blue Helmets or the High Commissioner for HumanRights.Unfortunately  however  there is a limit to what thespecialized agencies can do to help uplift the individualnational economies. The latest United Nations WorldEconomic and Social Survey announces the good news thatthe global economy has reached the cruising speed of 3 percent growth. But for many countries this news is somewhatabstract and irrelevant to their day-to-day concerns.That same report speaks delicately of distinctionsbetween robust  vulnerable and weak developing economies.This polite language only masks the continuing reality ofdegradation  poverty  misery  disease and death.Ten years ago the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (UNCTAD) officially classified 36Member States as least developed. Five years ago thisnumber had risen to 42  and as of August this year therewere 48 least developed countries. All forecasts project aneven more skewed distribution of global income. Themarginalization of more than a quarter of the membershipof the United Nations in the world economy must surely berecognized as a serious problem. Those Members cannot beshunted aside indefinitely without provoking a majorbreakdown of international order.Yet today key development institutions are underattack. Indeed  the very role of the United Nations in theglobal economy risks marginalization.Why is this so? First  lack of a consensus on a post-cold-war strategic rationale for development is oneimportant factor. Secondly  the endemic tension betweenthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions  acontest for power and control  is another factor. Thirdly  thefailure of Member States  especially major contributors  topay their dues in full and on time has created severebudgetary pressures on the United Nations to cut backdevelopment programmes.These  however  are only partial explanations. The keyfactor is the failure of the United Nations to respond to thecentral economic phenomenon of our time: the globalizationof the international economy and the emergence of whathas been termed a borderless world.For better or for worse  sovereign nation-States willbe around for a long time to come. Governments are andwill continue to be key players in the world economy. Buta model of sovereign States  interacting only at themargins of their existence  no longer adequately describesthe contemporary world economy. Modern technology andcommunications have led to money  trade and investmentsflashing across borders in ways that Governments cannotcontrol. This is redefining the very notions of resources wealth and value.Therefore  we have to cope with a globalizedinternational economy in which national actions are nolonger adequate or effective  but in which  at the sametime  Governments and States still cannot be disregarded.Europe  the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region haveresponded in different ways  such as with the EuropeanUnion (EU)  the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) and  in a looser form  the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation (APEC). Africa is also looking atits own regional economic groupings. These experimentsrepresent some of the most significant developments incontemporary international relations. They may define apost-cold-war structure for international order in the nextcentury.The United Nations  like its individual Members  isstruggling to comprehend and catch up with theimplications of a globalized international economy. Butthe United Nations has been more sluggish to respondthan many of its Members.When we speak of regionalization in the UnitedNations  we are referring primarily to the regionalcommissions  which  however  are entirely divorced fromthe important regional economic groupings. This is asymptom of a wider problem.At a time when most significant developments in theworld economy are taking place outside the UnitedNations  one can legitimately ask what the role of theUnited Nations is in the new world economy. There is adanger that it will play no role at all unless it urgentlytakes stock of its current approach to economic issues.Saving the United Nations from being relegated toirrelevance requires an attitudinal shift that cuts acrossboth North and South. Member States from both theNorth and the South must accept a new discipline. Wemust forsake ideology for pragmatism and posturing forpracticality in order to concentrate on a more focused andcompact economic agenda. This will give the United22Nations the tools it needs to cope with the new kind ofglobal economy that is emerging.The United Nations must emphasize its strengths  notits weaknesses. It is not the best forum to negotiatespecialized and technical matters. Neither is the UnitedNations an executive body for matters of trade or finance;that role properly belongs to the Bretton Woods institutionsand the World Trade Organization. The strengths of theUnited Nations are political  which is a plus because thenew world economy demands political as well as technicalresponses.The new globalized economy has sharply focuseddevelopment issues that policy makers and theoreticianshave grappled with for decades. The strictly economicdebate over appropriate development strategies is over.Opting out is clearly not an option. It will only acceleratethe pace of marginalization. However  it has becomeequally clear that the magic of the market is not enough.Only the United Nations can meet the two resultingpolitical challenges. They are  first  coping with the politicalconsequences of rapid but uneven economic growth and secondly  helping the least developed to build theinstitutions that will allow them to plug into the globalizedeconomy. Let me elaborate.First  the process of rapid growth in some countrieshas caused political tensions between the successfuldeveloping countries and the mature Western economies.The latter have continued to grow  but more slowly andwithout significant increases in employment orimprovements in real living standards.Job creation and job protection will certainly be highon the agendas of political leaders throughout theindustrialized world for at least the next decade. There hasbeen a concerted and sometimes very vocal effort to linkeconomic issues to workers’ rights  human rights  socialconditions and environmental standards. Developingcountries view this as bad faith  feeling that theindustrialized countries are using any pretext to hobble andhandicap the developing world.The critical issue is not really the rights and wrongs ofthe case. It is managing shifts in relative positions ofpower. A way has to be found to contain the inevitablestrains and stresses between the old rich and the newlyaffluent economies. Continuing tensions are debilitating andwill slow growth for everyone.The goal is to shape an international order that willboth optimize conditions for growth and facilitate therescue of the least developed countries. There will belittle attention paid to their needs if there is constantjostling and tension between the successful developingcountries and the mature economies.There is therefore a need for overarchingframeworks that can help manage relations between thesuccessful developing countries and the matureeconomies. There is a need to impose a global coherenceand discipline on the emerging international system builtaround regional economic groupings. This is not afunction that can be performed by the Bretton Woodsinstitutions or even the World Trade Organization. Afterall  the first reaction of Europe and the United States tothe conclusion of the Uruguay Round was more assertiveunilateralism.To play a role in forging such frameworks  theUnited Nations must find the political will to reachgenuine consensus — not just on paper — on a realisticglobal economic agenda. But this will require self-discipline.When one reads the action plans and agendas ofmany United Nations economic bodies  it is sometimes adepressing exercise in political archaeology. Layer uponlayer of issues  some dating back to the 1960s and the1970s  are added with every passing session of theGeneral Assembly and conference. Their relevance tocontemporary problems is dubious.What is very puzzling is that  in reality  mostMember States have in actual national practice long sincediscarded the attitudes and policies which are stillfaithfully placed on the United Nations agenda andsolemnly debated and discussed in an archaic annualritual. United Nations economic bodies must thereforeeschew the temptation to pretend to micro-manageinternational economic affairs by delving into the nitty-gritty of issues they sometimes imperfectly comprehend.But I do not advocate a completely laissez-faireapproach. A globalized economy urgently demandsmanagement precisely because it is rapidly movingbeyond the control of even the most powerful. But itrequires different management techniques. The day of thehegemonic manager of the international economic systemis passing. In the new world economy  international ordercan be assured only by the development of rule-basedmultilateral regimes that define broad parameters for23economic forces that are not susceptible to micro-management. So the United Nations is the only universalinternational Organization with a Charter that gives it amandate to range across the spectrum of issues that requireattention. If the United Nations can find the political willand self-discipline  it will be potentially well placed  in ourview  to develop a genuine consensus on an agenda forsuch regimes.Rule-based multilateral regimes are not just in theinterest of small and weak States. The predictability andstability they confer benefits all of us. It will beincreasingly uncomfortable and difficult for even thestrongest to assert themselves unilaterally in a globalizedeconomy where business  finance  trade and industry cannotalways be neatly categorized along national lines. A blowaimed at an opponent’s chin may end up bruising one’sown shoulder. If the United Nations can develop consensuson an agenda  its relationship with the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the World Trade Organization will naturallyfall into place. It will clearly be their responsibility to fleshout and implement the global regimes on an agenda agreedto by the United Nations. But these institutions are correctto resist if  as is now all too often the case  the agenda isimpractical and delves too deeply into matters of detail.Secondly  the new globalized international economyhas challenged the belief that developing countries couldgrow simply by relaxing controls and privatizing. This is anecessary but insufficient condition. In all of the mostsuccessful developing countries  good  strong and stablegovernment has always played a key role. The WorldBank’s 1993 report entitled “The East Asian Miracle”reveals that the miracle was not so much a miracle after all.The secret was getting the macroeconomic fundamentalsright. But that has been known for decades. Yet there hasbeen no growth in much of the world. The difference waspublic policy. Developing countries that try to follow theEast Asian model often fail  not because they do not knowwhat the correct economic policies are  but because theylack the political underpinnings to make such policies stick.It is the government that will determine whether a countrycan plug into the fast moving global economy  or whetherit will be bypassed.Therefore  an urgent and delicate problem is how theUnited Nations can help the least developed to buildgovernment and political institutions that will enable themto plug into the globalized economy for development without intruding too brashly into their domestic affairs.Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter is still the basiccornerstone of the United Nations. A multilateral approachto this sensitive question may be more acceptable thancrude bilateralism.But to deal realistically with this issue  the UnitedNations must set aside what has become a largelytheological debate about the relationship betweendemocracy  development and human rights — a phrasewhich has become part of the accepted language ofdevelopment debates. But it is harmful and misleading ifit implies an inevitable or simple linear causality. Ofcourse  these concepts may well be linked in some way.But let us be clear that what we are really talking aboutis the relationship between democracy and human rights on the one hand  and development  on the other. In otherwords  the causality is not linear  simple or inevitable.There is no question that repression is wrong andunhealthy and will stifle growth. There is also ampleempirical evidence to prove beyond any doubt thateconomic growth requires political stability and goodgovernment. The terms “democracy” and “goodgovernment” are often used as if they were synonyms. Ofcourse they overlap to a degree  but they are not the samething.Singapore’s experience is that good governmentmust be erected on three interrelated pillars: politicalaccountability  a long-term orientation  and social justice.For long-term stability  Governments must govern withthe support of the governed. Governments that do notdeliver will not last. But this fact and the need forperiodic free and fair elections do not prescribe anyparticular model of political system or ideology. So theclash and clamour of contending interests  streetdemonstrations and a rambunctious and abusive press maymake for more exciting television for some Westernaudiences. It may even work for some countries. Butmore often than not it contradicts the second pillar ofgood government  which is long-term orientation. Thatrequires the ability to resist populist and sectionalpressures and  on occasion  administer bitter medicine toovercome economic challenges. Singapore’s experiencehas convinced us that the first duty of government is togovern  and also govern fairly. At times  this will requirea firm hand.The third element of good government is socialjustice. There should be equal opportunities for all groups.If the Government is fair to all ethnic  religious and socialgroups  it will not be beholden to any special interest.This is important in any society. It has been one of thereasons for Singapore’s political stability and socialcohesion. But Singapore does not hold itself up as a24model  although we are happy  and prepared  to share ourexperience with anyone who may be interested. No one canprescribe any particular model of political development forany country. Indeed  when this is attempted dogmatically with only a superficial understanding of the complexities ofspecific situations  it leads to disaster. Our basic assumptionis a fundamentally pragmatic and pluralist one — that thereare no models that can be applied everywhere.So growth and stability are linked by a complex andsubtle dynamic: an unrelenting search for an equilibriumbetween the rights of the individual  the claims of thecommunity to which every individual must belong  and theno less urgent need for Governments to govern effectivelyand fairly. No balance between individual liberty andgrowth can be valid for all countries are for all time. Everysociety must find its own appropriate equilibrium in thecontext of its own historical and cultural experiences if thecountry is to progress.Singapore straddles the developed and the developingworlds. Our population generally enjoys a comfortablestandard of living  and our economy has a relativelysophisticated service and industrial sector  performingglobal roles. But Singapore also has structuralvulnerabilities; it has resource limitations that prevent usfrom being fully developed as yet. Therefore  it is with aspecial perspective that we in Singapore observe theongoing debates in and about the United Nations economicinstitutions. Sometimes we wonder: whose interests arereally served by a prolonged debate  increasingly divorcedfrom global economic reality? Is it the interest of those whowant to preserve these institutions  or of those who wouldprefer to relegate them to some historical dead end? I donot have the answer to that question  but I raise it as onethat merits urgent attention. I do not think there is muchtime left."

Not only did the Battle ofGuadalcanal in the Second World War inflict damage onour natural environment  leaving behind untold numbersof dangerous armaments  but it caused adverse effects onhuman and economic development as well. We numberless than 400 000 people of diverse ethnic origins  speaksome 87 distinct languages in various dialects  and livetogether on hundreds of islands spread over 1600 squarekilometres of ocean. We live in a part of the world ofexquisite beauty with a delicate marine and forest ecologythat is critical to our well-being and survival.From the perspective of my country  peace anddevelopment are inextricably linked. The Agenda forDevelopment and the Agenda for Peace make this as clearas the brilliant and pollution-free waters of our sun-drenched lagoons. In his latest report on the work of theOrganization  the Secretary-General observed thatdevelopment:“the foremost and most far-reaching task of our time... must be seen in its many dimensions — in thecontexts of peace  the economy  environmentalprotection  social justice and democracy”. (A/50/1 para. 182)Each is critical for development  but without peace theother dimensions shrink like characters in stories forchildren.We applaud the Secretary-General’s efforts toimplement the Agenda for Peace. The development of aframework for coordinating the planning andimplementation of complex field operations is welcome.In its efforts to broker peace  the United Nations haswrestled with seemingly intractable problems. SolomonIslands  one of the least developed countries  living inpeace  gladly contributes its financial share to peace-keeping and supports initiatives to protect United Nationspersonnel and to aid civilian populations.8Yet  ethnic strife and armed conflict rage in manyplaces with suffering and devastation beyondcomprehension. The violation of human rights continues.Poverty saps the creativity and vitality of thousands ofmillions. Vast numbers of children  especially femalechildren  do not have their basic needs met and many donot survive infancy or early childhood. Solomon Islands which reaffirms its commitment to the Convention on theRights of the Child  applauds the work of the UnitedNations Children’s Fund. Minimal education  illiteracy labouring in unspeakable conditions  prostitution and life onthe streets are the conditions of many children. The massmedia with an educational purpose have a powerful role inchanging all of this as Solomon Islanders living incommunities separated by the sea have learned. Moreover many of the world’s women continue to face seriouseconomic and social discrimination as the 1995 HumanDevelopment Report to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme demonstrates. The education of women inSolomon Islands is critical to them  their children  theirfamilies and the nation. Without it  sustainable developmentand the levelling of population growth are unattainablegoals.Solomon Islands applauds the steps taken by theUnited States of America and the Russian Federation toreduce their nuclear arsenals in accordance with Start I  onthe reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. Welook forward to agreement on and implementation of theTreaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of StrategicOffensive Arms (Start II).Solomon Islands and its sister States in the Pacificregion fearfully watch the ominous nuclear-weapons testsof France and the People’s Republic of China. Weespecially deplore the fact that France is conducting themin the South Pacific with its fragile marine ecologyessential to the lives of island peoples. Recent reports in theFrench media indicate that the potential danger of thesetests is far greater than we have been led to believe. Thethreats to people  animals and plants — even the geneticfoundations of life — are terribly real. Do we needadditional evidence of this after Hiroshima and Nagasaki?Why are more nuclear tests really required? How valid isthe concept of nuclear deterrence now? If  as France claims nuclear-weapons explosions on Mururoa Atoll andFangataufa Atoll in French Polynesia are so safe  why notset them off in the soil of the mother country? Its presencein Polynesia and New Caledonia makes France ourneighbour in the Pacific where a post-cold-war redefinitionof the region is well under way. Do good neighboursendanger the environment that sustains them? Are we notgambling away the future of humankind at the nuclear-weapons dice table? To the nuclear-threshold States  thesetests send the wrong signal. The Pacific is certainly thewrong place; now  today  is the wrong time; and forinternational cooperation  this is the wrong policy.Global warming  as the intergovernmental climate-change experts are now confirming  continues. Theconsequences for the small island States are most serious including the potential impact of sea-level rise. Theythreaten our agricultural and fish production  therebyendangering our economy and undermining our ability todevelop. Clearly  this global problem requires a globalsolution  but the industrial countries must take the lead ifjoint solutions are to be successfully implemented.Solomon Islands is contributing to the quest forinternational peace and security in a number of ways.Towards disarmament  we have ratified the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  and wetook an active part in the NPT Review and ExtensionConference  joining in the consensus to extend the NPTindefinitely. We ratified the Treaty of Rarotongaestablishing the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone.Establishing nuclear-free zones is an important initiativetowards creating a non-proliferation regime in cooperationwith other States. Solomon Islands  along with others made two submissions to the International Court ofJustice on the legality of the use or threat of use ofnuclear weapons  a matter now before the Court.Solomon Islands is participating in the process forthe completion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty bySeptember 1996. We believe that a comprehensive test-ban treaty is the fulcrum upon which nuclear disarmamentwill be raised from dream to reality. Ultimately disarmament is a question of courage and overcomingfear. It begins within  and its achievement must comefrom within as well — inside them and us  inside you andme.As for environmental issues  Solomon Islands is aState party to the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change and fully supports the Berlin mandate which includes the Alliance of Small Island Statesprotocol. With so much of our present and futureeconomy based on our forests and marine life  weembrace the Convention on Biological Diversity  whichSolomon Islands acceded to this year  the BarbadosProgramme of Action  the Nouméa Convention  and theInternational Coral Reef Initiative. We support a globalprogramme of action to protect the marine environment9from land-based activities. Concerned about the shipmentand importation of hazardous and radioactive wastes in theSouth Pacific region  Solomon Islands endorses the WaiganiConvention recently adopted at the twenty-sixth SouthPacific Forum  held in Papua New Guinea  and calls for therehabilitation of former nuclear-weapon test sites andassistance to the peoples who were forced from thoseplaces.We live in a world of disturbing  often cruel  contrasts.These  sustainable development has to address. In his reporton the work of the Organization  the Secretary-Generalstates that“development at its core must be about improvementof human well-being  the removal of poverty  hunger disease and ignorance  ensuring productiveemployment and the satisfaction of priority needs ofall people in a way that can be sustained over futuregenerations; ... the emerging consensus on the priorityand dimensions of development should find expressionin a new framework for international cooperation”.(A/50/1  para. 182)Solomon Islands views this emerging consensus as thebeginning of a new diplomacy that puts people at the heartof development. The new diplomacy should workvigorously to implement the programmes of action craftedat the World Summit for Children  the Earth Summit  theWorld Conference on Human Rights  the InternationalConference on Population and Development  the WorldSummit for Social Development  the Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and the Fourth World Conference on Women. AfterHabitat II  in Istanbul next year  we do not require morelarge conferences  for the time being at least. Rather  weneed international will and partnership  politicalcommitment  and thoughtful  decisive action to ensure thatthese programmes of action are implemented.As the Declaration of Barbados affirms “Small island developing nations are particularlyvulnerable to natural as well as environmentaldisasters and have a limited capacity to respond to andrecover from such disasters.” (A/CONF.167/9  annexI  part one  section III  para. 1)Limited in size and with vulnerable economies  they mustdepend on a narrow resource base and upon internationaltrade  without the means to influence its terms. SolomonIslands and the other small island developing States requireinternational partnership and cooperation to achieve andmaintain sustainable development.The new diplomacy based on people-centreddevelopment has at its heart a spiritual dimension whichembraces the ideals of democracy  tolerance  peacefulcoexistence  justice and the rights of persons and peoples.It cares for the environment and rejects greed andintolerance. This new diplomacy will be a reflection of anagenda for democracy and tolerance  which SolomonIslands believes should be formulated to complete thetriad of agendas. Such an agenda ought to be a basis forreforming the United Nations in general and the SecurityCouncil in particular. For Security Council reform towork  it must put people at the centre instead of adominating nation  group of nations or region.Committed to democracy and tolerance  SolomonIslands calls for renewed consideration of the exceptionalsituation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in theinternational context  on the basis of the principle ofuniversality and in accordance with the established modelof parallel representation of divided countries at theUnited Nations. The Republic of China’s standing as thefifteenth largest trading nation in the world  with thetwentieth highest gross national product and the largestforeign-exchange holdings  its continuing assistance tomany developing countries and its efforts to strengtheninternational economic cooperation are obvious andcannot be ignored by the world’s highest forum. Inaddition  the Republic of China’s contribution to worldpeace and its unfailing support of United Nationsactivities are undeniable evidence of its qualifications toreceive proper consideration for having a seat at theUnited Nations. Solomon Islands therefore calls for arenewed focus on the issue of readmitting the Republic ofChina as a Member of the United Nations.Solomon Islands believes in a United Nations thatcalls for tolerance and works to practise it  a UnitedNations that promotes the values of diversity  tolerance pluralism  peace  justice  solidarity and responsibilitytowards others and unknown future generations. Here differences in race  religion  language and politicaldoctrine are not obstacles  but challenges tounderstanding  compassion  insight and patience.The only hope for humanity is world peace  to beachieved by a change in attitude from one of “mine andmy world” to one of “we and our world”.10"
"144",6259,"SLE",50,1995,"Permit me  first of all to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on hiselection to the presidency of the current session of theGeneral Assembly. Indeed  as we commemorate 50 yearsof the existence of our Organization  his unanimouselection to preside over this Assembly is a fitting tributeto his country and an eloquent testimony to his personalexperience and skills as a seasoned diplomat. I thereforewant to assure him of my delegation’s fullest cooperationas he directs and guides our deliberations on this historicoccasion  and to wish him every success in thatendeavour.To his immediate predecessor  and our esteemedBrother  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy ofCôte d’Ivoire  I convey my delegation’s gratitude andappreciation for the exemplary manner in which heconducted the affairs of the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly.I would also like to thank our eminent Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his boldinitiatives and his firm guidance of the work of theOrganization.The world has come a long way from 26 June 1945 when 50 States appended their signatures to the Charterdocument  creating this enduring body. In spite of theundoubted advancement of science and technology  andindeed the enormous strides made by the Organizationduring the past 50 years  the world continues  alas  to begripped by the same age-old problems of poverty disarmament  maintenance of peace and security development and many more.Certainly  on the economic front there is no cause forcomfort or complacency. Most developing countries especially the least developed  continue to be strangled bynegative economic trends  stagnating resource flows seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings  risingunemployment and  above all  the phenomenal increase inthe number of people living in absolute poverty  occasionedlargely by wars  famine  drought and the heavy burden offoreign debts.The debt burden  in particular  continues to beexcessive and harmful to the sustainable development ofdeveloping countries  especially the least developed amongthem. In this connection  the initiative of the BritishChancellor of the Exchequer earlier this year to put in placemeasures to help reduce the stock of multilateral debt of themost indebted developing nations is a step in the rightdirection. Nevertheless  we continue to hold the view thatunless the debt issue is seriously addressed by theinternational community  no meaningful progress for thenext 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable futureby the developing countries  especially the least developedamong them.We believe that a permanent and definitivecomprehensive solution to the debt problem must be foundwithout further delay. That is why we commend the currentChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement  His ExcellencyPresident Soeharto of Indonesia  for his initiative inconvening in August last year a Ministerial Meeting ofNon-Aligned Countries on the subject of debt anddevelopment with the theme “Sharing of Experiences”  atwhich a number of general principles for debt reductionwere adopted  marking significant progress in the search fora lasting solution to this nagging problem.We continue to appeal to the international community particularly to the international financial institutions  to givethose modest recommendations serious consideration in theformulation of policies and actions on the debt issue.The persistence of these problems has underminedpolitical stability and threatened regional and internationalpeace and security. Determined as we in the developingcountries have been to improve the lot of our people and toredress the economic plight facing our various countries  westill labour under excruciating circumstances. It is nowabundantly clear that the developing countries cannot go italone. We need the involvement of other  dependable partners  particularly among the developed countries andthe major international financial institutions. Additionalresources at multilateral and bilateral levels are essentialfrom these partners to achieve rapid improvement in thelives of the millions of our affected people.As for Sierra Leone  since April 1992  when theNational Provisional Ruling Council took over the reinsof government  we have set for ourselves the task ofimplementing anti-poverty programmes and socio-economic reforms  including deregulation of prices exchange control and interest rates  and the reduction offiscal deficit.Despite the limited scope of the success attained sofar  we are determined not to relent in our efforts to caterfor the special needs of the most vulnerable groups insociety.Calling upon the international community to payspecial attention to the problems of developing countriesby providing them with financial and technical supportshould not be considered as an appeal simply for charitybut rather an investment in the future development andwell-being of mankind. Indeed  we realize that the key tosustainable development in any State is in the hands of itscitizenry. Developing countries are now very much awareof this and are taking responsibility for working towardsimproving the lot of the peoples of their respectivecountries.Indeed  during the 50 years of its existence  theUnited Nations has also been studying ways and means ofimproving the economies of the developing countries ofthe world. None the less  as our export prices have beenon the decline  our economic plans have remainedunfulfilled and the rate of growth of our gross domesticproduct  which was never fast  is in great danger ofslowing down to a complete standstill. The technicalassistance schemes which have been formulated to studythe problem are numerous. My delegation firmly believesthat the time has now come for positive action that wouldlead to the eradication of the largely known causes ofeconomic stagnation  particularly in Africa. We call for aspeedy implementation of the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s aswell as for the consolidation of efforts towards thediversification of the African economies.In a world of growing interdependence  theliberalization of trade  the globalization of the economyand increasing regional integration  sustainable2development and the eradication of poverty cannot beensured in the absence of peace and stability. “An Agendafor Peace” and “An Agenda for Development” not onlyshow that peace and development are inseparable andindivisible but rather that they contain the essentialingredients of a new vision of our one world. Nodevelopment is possible anywhere  save in an environmentthat is peaceful  stable and secure. This holds true fornational development  as it does for regional andinternational cooperation. That is why we in Sierra Leonehave always believed that peace at home is incompleteunless our neighbours enjoy peace too. Today  more thanever before  we should all be aware that we are ourbrother’s keeper and that we can no longer afford to beindifferent to developments in any part of the globe.Three years ago  my Head of State  Captain ValentineE. M. Strasser  acquainted this body with the devastationvisited on Sierra Leone initially as a spillover from the civilwar in Liberia. He explained to this Assembly the pain andthe agony that our people have had to endure as a result ofthat conflict and its ramifications for regional peace andstability.Regrettably  I am again constrained to inform you thatthe conflict has persisted and that the lives of manyinnocent Sierra Leoneans continue to be lost. In spite of myGovernment’s repeated overtures for peace andreconciliation there is as yet no let-up in the fighting on theground and the rebel attacks against innocent andunsuspecting civilians in provincial cities and several townsand villages in the country continue unabated.Consequently  we are witnessing today the internaldisplacement of hundreds of thousands of our people andthousands more have had to seek refugee status inneighbouring countries  not to mention the devastationcaused to the national economy.What all this means is that the Liberian situation isinextricably linked with the situation in Sierra Leone. It istherefore our ardent hope that with the budding peace inLiberia  Sierra Leoneans can realistically expect a lull in thefighting on their own soil to enable them embark oneconomic reconstruction and rehabilitation. We would  inthis regard  like to express our profound thanks andappreciation to the West African leaders who have madethe success achieved in Liberia possible. The leadership ofNigeria  Ghana and the countries contributing to theMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) deservespecial commendation. So do the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  organizations whichin their own diverse ways  have contributed to thepeaceful developments in Liberia.We therefore call upon this Organization and allpeace-loving people the world over to support the newgovernment in Liberia. At the same time  we wouldfervently appeal to the Liberian people to rise to theoccasion  for in the final analysis  it must be Liberiansthemselves who should find a lasting solution to theirproblems. We wish the New Liberian Council of Stateand the people of Liberia success in their search fordurable peace in their country  for we believe that suchsuccess will have a positive impact on Sierra Leone.The need to strengthen the peace momentum inLiberia is particularly important because during thedisarmament process there are going to be thousands ofhardened former combatants  some of them probably stillarmed  who might be tempted to relocate the theatre ofwar unless they are effectively disarmed  brought undercontrol and suitably reintegrated into Liberian society.Closely linked to the search for peace in SierraLeone is the implementation of the programme ofdemocratization announced by my Head of State  HisExcellency Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser  three yearsago for the return of Sierra Leone to multiparty civilianrule. I am happy to report that this programme is still oncourse  despite the unavoidable delays resulting from therebel war. The ban on political parties has now beenlifted and indeed the registration of political partiescompleted. A National Consultative Conference convenedby the Interim National Electoral Commission was heldin mid-August to seek national consensus on howelections could be conducted in a war situation and todiscuss some other related issues. At that Conference  itwas agreed that both presidential and parliamentaryelections will be held not later than in February 1996. TheRevolutionary United Front  the rebel faction  was invitedto participate in that political process  but unfortunately their response  as has consistently been the case  wasnegative. Yet  in spite of this  we continue to persist inpursuing peace and continue to state clearly that the peaceoption is still on the table. Be that as it may  I should alsostate that as a responsible Government  we cannot give upthe armed struggle  if only out of the sense of legitimateobligation to protect the lives and properties of innocentSierra Leoneans  who have borne a large measure of thebrunt of our senseless rebel war.At this juncture  my delegation would like to expressits appreciation to this Organization  to the OAU and to3the Commonwealth for responding positively to our requestfor help by way of exploratory fact-finding missions toSierra Leone. In the case of the United Nations  theSecretary-General subsequently sent a resident SpecialEnvoy in the person of Ambassador Berhanu Dinka  whois still in the country offering assistance. It is anencouraging sign that the international community  throughthe United Nations  the OAU and the Commonwealth  isjust as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling CouncilGovernment to see an early end to our destructive war sothat our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live inan environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage intheir ordinary daily pursuits. At the same time  whileappealing to the international community to help us withlogistical  financial and related support in theimplementation of our political programme  we will alsorequire similar assistance  at the appropriate time  inrebuilding and rehabilitating our devastated economy. Inthis connection  we would like to express our deep andsincere appreciation to all friendly Governments particularly Nigeria  Guinea and Ghana for their assistancein our trying moments.The world-wide problem of refugees and displacedpersons continues to be our concern  particularly as weourselves have become victims of this scourge. More thanhalf a million of our citizens have become displaced inSierra Leone  and hundreds of thousands more are refugeesin neighbouring countries. The yearning of all these peopleis for an opportunity to finally return to their homes  settledown and rebuild their lives. We urge the internationalcommunity to urgently help us bring our people back home.The use of narcotic drugs has for some time now beena source of concern  mainly to developing countries because of the inherent danger it poses to society especially the young. Today  no country can claim to beinsulated from this scourge  as it is now a globalphenomenon. The abuse of drugs and drug-relatedsubstances is gaining in prominence  not only in SierraLeone  but in the whole West African subregion  and thereis no doubt that with the prevalence of rebel wars it willcontinue to plague us long after these wars are over thereby threatening social peace and stability in thecountries concerned.The Government of Sierra Leone is determined to takeall necessary measures against drug abuse and illicittrafficking domestically  as well as through subregional andinternational cooperation. To this end  my Government hasratified the 1961  1971 and 1988 Conventions dealing withillicit drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking  and has set upboth inter-ministerial and technical committees comprisingall relevant sectoral departments to advise theGovernment on effective measures to contain drug abuseand other related ills.No one can deny that the threat of global nucleardestruction posed by the cold war has receded. However it is becoming increasingly clear to us that where onetype of peril has been combated others are swiftly arisingto take its place. Today  the breakdown of bipolar controlhas lifted restrictions on long- simmering civic  ethnic andterritorial disputes. Violence has brought the veryexistence of some States into question and  with it  grossviolations of human rights  including instances ofgenocide exceeded only  perhaps  by those of the SecondWorld War. Conflicts are becoming more numerous andmore complex  and are scattered all over the globe  evenas there are glimmers of hope.In Africa  for example  we welcome the recentdevelopments whereby both parties in the Angolanconflict are moving towards allowing the will of theAngolan people finally to prevail over the barrel of thegun. My delegation also notes with satisfaction theagreement by UNITA to join with the MPLA in agovernment of national unity. In like manner  theacceptance by the Mozambican opposition leader Comrade Afonso Dhlakama  and his men of the outcomeof the electoral process should be a source of relief to allAfricans and peace-loving people everywhere. It is ourfervent hope that the Mozambicans will emulate theexample of their neighbours in Zimbabwe  South Africaand Namibia — societies which have shown that  with theright political attitude and good will  it is quite possibleto replace strife with reconciliation and hatred withaccommodation.In the Middle East  we view the developments thatstarted a few years ago with the mutual recognition of thePLO and Israel  followed later by the signing of theWashington Declaration between Jordan and Israel  whichended the state of war between them  as extremelyimportant positive steps towards the full realization ofpeace in that region. In like manner  we welcome the just-concluded Interim Agreement on Jericho and the WestBank  signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington.In the same vein  we commend Norway  the UnitedStates  Egypt and all those others that in one way or theother have played  and are continuing to play  a role inmoving this historic conflict towards a peacefulresolution.4On the other aspect of the Middle Eastern equation we urge Israel  Syria and Lebanon to join fully in thehistoric peace process and display a spirit ofaccommodation  in the interest of all the people of theMiddle East and mankind as a whole.With regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq we call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Kuwait  in accordance with the termsof the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.However  we call upon the international community  inapplying sanctions against Iraq  not to lose sight of thesuffering being experienced by the innocent civilians of thatcountry.My delegation welcomes the decision to extendindefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  a decision which my country co-sponsored. It was indeed a decision of momentousimportance  which heralded what has been described as amajor success of the United Nations in the field ofdisarmament. However  we are disappointed that indicationssince the extension are that final agreement on animmediate and comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty seemsuncertain. If humanity is to maintain any lasting hope forthe future  we must act now with courage and decisivenessto achieve a nuclear-free world. In this regard  we callunequivocally for the cessation of nuclear tests of any kindin all environments  and call upon the Conference onDisarmament to work towards the speedy conclusion of acomprehensive test-ban treaty within the shortest possibletime.International peace can hardly be maintained in aworld in which some men are free while others are underthe yoke of colonialism. Being fully aware of that problemand imbued with the idealism that brought this Organizationinto being  Member States solemnly resolved to remove anyvestiges of colonialism from the world. This line ofthinking achieved full stature at the United Nations in 1960 when the landmark resolution 1514 (XV)  incorporating theDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to ColonialCountries and Peoples  was adopted.Today  as the world celebrates the fiftieth anniversaryof our Organization  its considerable success in the field ofdecolonization is universally acclaimed. We remember thehistory of the struggle against colonialism and pay tributeto all those who were part of that struggle. We remainmindful of the sacrifices that made it possible for hundredsof millions of people to achieve self-determination andindependence. We commend the work of the SpecialCommittee of 24 for its effective contribution to theapplication of the Declaration on the Granting ofIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Mycountry has had the honour of serving that Committee —it is  in fact  currently chairing it — and we are proud tohave been able to make some contribution to its work andto bringing freedom to a good portion of the human race.In that regard  while we welcome with profoundpleasure the State of Palau to this world Organization asthe 185th Member  it is my delegation’s view that thetask of decolonization remains unfinished. Furtherconcerted and determined action is still required on thepart of all involved to win freedom for people who arestill unable to exercise their right to self-determination —mostly peoples of small island States  located mainly inthe Pacific and Caribbean regions. These territories areconfronted with unique problems that require new andinnovative solutions geared towards the implementation ofthe International Decade for the Eradication ofColonialism by the Year 2000  launched by the GeneralAssembly in 1988.We believe that the situation of these Territoriesshould not be seen as an impediment to the application ofthe principle of self-determination. The wishes of thepeople of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are whatcount most. We appeal for the strengthened and continuedsupport of the administering Powers  whose cooperationwith the Special Committee is essential for the progressof the Territories towards self-determination. We count onthe support of the specialized agencies and theinternational community as a whole to continue to assistthe Non-Self-Governing Territories in enhancing theirstandard of living and promoting their self-sufficiency.We also truly believe that our combined and unrelentingefforts will ensure the fulfilment of the promise offreedom  lasting peace  sustained growth and sustainabledevelopment for all the people of our planet inaccordance with the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations.My delegation welcomes the successful outcome ofthe Conference on the Environment and Development in1992  the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 the International Conference on Population andDevelopment in 1994  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment convened in Copenhagen in 1995 and therecently concluded United Nations Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing. Referring to theBeijing Conference  we note with satisfaction that thehistory of the United Nations for the past 50 years has5also been one of steady progress for women  from a drivefor their civil and political rights to their recognition asequal partners in the broader societal context.We appeal for the urgent implementation of therecommendations  conclusions and decisions adopted inthese various international Conferences. We believe that intheir realization partly lies the possibility of lasting peaceand security  economic progress and social emancipation forall humankind.We note with satisfaction the positive role played byour Organization in facilitating international agreement onthorny issues  whose resolution would certainly have beenmore difficult  if not impossible  in other forums. In thisconnection  my delegation welcomes the new Agreementssigned at Marrakesh in April last year  establishing theWorld Trade Organization. However  we stress the need fora continuous assessment of its likely impact on developingcountries  especially the least developed among them. Wefear that countries which are net importers of food  such asSierra Leone  might face the prospect of higher food importbills arising from the liberalization of trade in theagricultural sector. Other areas in the Agreements whichopen up competition between developed and developingcountries also need to be constantly reviewed to ensure thatthe latter do not suffer unduly.Since the end of the cold war  it has becomeincreasingly clear that the United Nations is finding itdifficult to deal with the challenges of the post-cold-warera. As we enter the next millennium  we believe it shouldbe a strong  revitalized  effective and purposeful UnitedNations  able to play its full role as envisaged in itsCharter.With democracy taking root among nations  logic andcommon sense dictate that decisions of the United Nationsshould also carry the necessary imprint of the collectivewill of its Members. Indeed  the Security Council  which ischarged with the primary responsibility for the maintenanceof international peace and security  should be perceived aslegitimate in its decision-making process. My delegationtakes the view that a more efficient  transparent anddemocratic Security Council  embracing the views of awider sector of the international community  could stand itin good stead to deal with the challenges of the nextmillennium — challenges which touch humanity generally rather than individual States which often lack the capacityand the ability to handle them successfully. Such challengesinclude the problem of drugs  devastating diseases likeacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)  moneylaundering  poverty and many more yet unknown. Wesincerely hope that the final outcome of the work of theOpen-ended Working Group on institutional reforms willadequately address these concerns and offer appropriatelybold suggestions and solutions.The relevance of the United Nations after 50 yearsas an instrument for the peaceful existence and orderlydevelopment of every nation no longer requiresjustification. We commend the Secretary-General and theSecretariat for initiating a restructuring process which willultimately ensure the enhanced viability and efficiency ofour Organization. We also pay tribute to all theirpredecessors whose own efforts contributed to thesurvival of the Organization. Member States owe it toposterity to adopt a firm commitment to the provisions ofthe Charter and not to undermine the credibility of ourcommon Organization. We renew our call for all MemberStates to be resolute and uncompromising in the quest forglobal peace  security and social and economic justice aswe move into the twenty-first century. Let me  inconclusion  reaffirm my country’s commitment to theUnited Nations Charter and dedication to the principleswhich undergird our Organization."
"145",6306,"SLV",50,1995,"At the outset  in addressing this distinguished Assembly  Ishould like to express to you  Mr. President  our sincerecongratulations on your election to conduct the proceedingsof this fiftieth session of the General Assembly. We areassured that with your qualities as a statesman and yourdiplomatic skills  we shall achieve very constructive resultsfor the well-being of the international community especially at this most important time when we arecommemorating the fiftieth year of the existence of theUnited Nations.We should also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  the Minister of Foreign Affairs ofCôte d’Ivoire  for the excellent work that he carried outas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession.It is both a timely moment and a pleasure tohighlight the extraordinary and indefatigable performanceof the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  atthe helm of the United Nations. He has demonstratedoutstanding leadership  dynamism and innovative skill inimproving and strengthening the Organization’s capacityfor action in fulfilment of the provisions of the Charterand of efforts to find solutions for the diverse andcomplex situations which have faced the Organization.We would like to reaffirm our special gratitude tothe Secretary-General for his ongoing support in theprocess of consolidating and strengthening democracy inEl Salvador.The current session of the General Assembly isparticularly important in the historical development of theUnited Nations  not only because we are celebrating thefiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptionalinstitution of universal scope  which was established toanalyse  debate and seek solutions to problems ofcommon concern to mankind  but also because currentcircumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding thefuture of our Organization.Indeed  we have at this time a unique opportunity toreaffirm our commitment and our political will tostrengthen the role of the Organization  to enhance itseffectiveness in achieving the ideals on which it wasfounded  to bring to fruition the aspirations of our peoples and to preserve the right of future generations to live inpeace  progress and freedom.Undeniably  this is a year for reflection  one whichwill enable us to assess carefully a half-century ofdevelopment and experience acquired in addressing globalissues through joint efforts and collective measures on amultilateral basis  taking into account not only theachievements but also the set-backs  with a view to furtherperfecting this human endeavour.The work of the United Nations  as a part of theinternational system established in the wake of the SecondWorld War  reflected the antagonistic nature of internationalrelations during the cold-war period  which generatedtension and insecurity for nations  unleashing an unbridledarms race and the threat of a nuclear conflict between thesuper-Powers. This was no doubt a key factor in shaping and limiting  the work of the Organization.As we make our assessment  we must acknowledgethat since 1945  despite the existence of the cold war  theUnited Nations has achieved much  inter alia  in thefollowing spheres: fulfilling its mission to establish andmaintain international peace and security  containing localconflicts in various regions from spreading and at the sametime creating a safety valve for East-West tensions  whichprevented a political and ideological conflict fromdegenerating into a widespread confrontation or into nuclearwarfare.Another achievement  in accordance with the Charter was the decolonization process by which many Asian andAfrican countries  and some on the American continent gained independence and joined the community of nations thus enriching the Organization by their experience andcontributions.In this regard  the United Nations has also helped tofoster international cooperation. To this end  an institutionalinfrastructure was developed to promote economic andsocial development for our peoples through theestablishment of a new international economic order  onethat would generate more favourable conditions andopportunities for the developing countries to make progress thus setting in motion a process of evening out the majorimbalances between North and South.While these efforts contributed to improving socialconditions in the poorest countries and in countries thathad recently gained independence  certain perceptions andattitudes led to a development crisis in the 1980s curtailing the activities of the United Nations system inthe least developed countries.Turning to the realm of human rights  considerableprogress was made  beginning with the signing of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December1948 and the adoption of a host of internationalinstruments  declarations  plans of action and institutionalmachinery for the promotion and monitoring ofinternational commitments on the part of States. Theseinclude the promotion of the development of women  therights of children  the handicapped  minority groups indigenous peoples and migrant workers  and  inparticular  a commitment to the struggle to eliminateracial discrimination in South Africa  which culminated in1994 with the establishment of a democratic andmultiracial system in that country.In the field of international law  outstanding progresswas made in the drawing up and codification ofinternational standards  in particular those conducive tofriendly relations among peoples and to the peacefulresolution of conflicts.The thoroughgoing changes in the world order thatled to the end of the cold war are giving rise to theexpectation of more favourable conditions for thepromotion of peace  cooperation and internationalsecurity. None the less  reality has shown that theseaspirations have not been met and that  on the contrary changes in the international system created conditions thathave unleashed forces that had long been held in check giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries  not only as aresult of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause ofserious ethnic  religious  social and cultural differenceswhich have jeopardized peace and international security.In this context  we are convinced that at the presenttime finding solutions to age-old and new challenges isbeyond the capacity of any one State or group of States.This has generated new requirements in the globalpolitical area  requiring to resort more and morefrequently to combined efforts and action. The verydynamics and requirements of this process have in turnincreased the tasks and responsibilities that fall to theUnited Nations.2For this reason we must provide unwavering supportto the efforts of the United Nations to fulfil its role  notonly in the political sphere but also in the economic andsocial areas  particularly through innovations and newperceptions in peace-keeping and the promotion ofdevelopment.Regarding efforts at global peace-keeping  it isimportant to note the new dimension of these peace-keepingoperations  whose action transcends the military aspects moving into multidisciplinary activities that includepolitical  economic  social and humanitarian endeavours.As regards development  we welcome the fact thatmore attention has been paid to economic  social andenvironmental issues  with an understanding that theirsolution requires coming to grips with  and attempting tofind solutions to  the causes of tensions  instability andconflicts with greater political will. As such tensions can gobeyond the very borders of nation States  we must lend oursupport to an integrated approach  for only in this way canwe consolidate peace  security and democracy  bothnationally and internationally.Proof of the will to improve the well-being of nationsand assist in their progress can be seen in the major summitconferences that have been held  as well as in theformulation of the Secretary-General’s developmentprogramme. These efforts serve as examples of a newglobal vision to achieve a consensus on policies andstrategies to promote sustainable human development. Nonethe less  we cannot but be concerned at the statements madeby the donor community regarding the drying up of fundsfor development. This is certainly against the generalexpectation of support for the development of our peoples.Today  the United Nations has different  and morecomplex  responsibilities than those it had in a bipolarworld. Although the purposes and principles that inspiredthe United Nations at its inception still remain valid  nonethe less political situations and the complexity andmagnitude of the challenges we face require clear andinnovative responses.In the face of these challenges we must be bothdetermined and prudent  resolved to be advocates ofchange  learning from positive experiences and willing toreplace those outmoded practices that impede the smoothfunctioning of the Organization.We believe that the modernization of the UnitedNations should be carried out through a comprehensiveprocess of an integrated nature which would reflect aconsensus deriving from the common interests and sharedresponsibilities of the international community.In this respect  we believe that there should be amore dynamic  better-coordinated relationship between theGeneral Assembly  the Security Council and theEconomic and Social Council  one which requires  as theSecretary-General himself stated  “the determination andthe full commitment of all Member States”. Theindustrialized countries bear a special responsibility in thistask  given that with their capabilities and resources theycan provide the Organization with a broad and assuredfinancial base which will make it possible to enhance itseffectiveness in every sphere.In this connection  we urge the Heads of State andGovernment of the seven industrialized Powers to put intopractice the statement of intention they made at thetwenty-first Economic Summit  held in Halifax  Canada in June 1995. We call on those countries  along withothers  to implement a new strategy for internationalcooperation in order to rise to the challenges of thetwenty-first century.The reform of the Security Council falls within theprocess of change in the Organization. We support theidea that the Council should adjust to the newinternational structure  not only regarding the number ofits members but also regarding its methods andprocedures of decision-making.The Government of El Salvador supports an increasein the membership of the Security Council on a rationalbasis which will make its more truly representative and as a result  afford greater opportunities for participationby all Member States  without in any way underminingthe efficient implementation of the tasks assigned to thisimportant body by the Charter.Furthermore  we support all those nations whichaspire with legitimate right to becoming Members of theUnited Nations and invoke the principle of universalityenshrined in the Charter of the Organization  withouttaking into consideration ideological aspects or theinterests of States which carry greater political weight inthe concert of nations. In this respect we share the viewsexpressed by you  Mr. President  when in your openingaddress to this session of the General Assembly you saidthat3“all States that are not yet Members should seek to beadmitted in the near future” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings 1st meeting  p.22)I should now like to refer to some specific issues thatare of particular importance in the international politicalarena.With respect to nuclear disarmament we support fullcompliance with the commitments contained in the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  whichwas extended indefinitely last May. We are convinced thatthis constitutes a major step towards the strengthening ofthe control system for nuclear non-proliferation and thetotal elimination of nuclear weapons.We are fully convinced that preventive diplomacy inits various manifestations is the appropriate instrument fordeterrence and the limitation of potential conflicts. In thisrespect we concur with the statement by the Secretary-General in his latest report presented to the GeneralAssembly that“it is ... better to prevent conflicts ... than to undertakemajor politico-military efforts to resolve conflicts oncethey have broken out”. (A/50/l  para. 585)We support his efforts to enable the United Nations to carryout a constructive and timely role so as to avoid or mitigatethe destructive effects of crises.I should now like to express a regional point of viewand note with satisfaction that Central America has movedfrom an era of confrontation to one of cooperation. We arenow embarking on a stage of constructive achievementswhich has enabled us to move forward in our quest toconsolidate a region of peace  freedom  democracy anddevelopment. This new stage results from our havingassumed our historical responsibility with determination given the legitimate aspirations of our peoples  whoclamored for peace and the democratization of our societies.With the assistance and solidarity of the United Nations andthe international community we are achieving theseobjectives  which will be completed when the process underway in Guatemala concludes with a firm and lasting peaceagreement  which has the decisive support of ourGovernments.Now that we have made significant headway in thepolitical sphere we are focusing our efforts on the socialsphere as an indispensable ingredient  in the conviction thatpeace  democracy and development are essentialcomponents for the flourishing of our society.Given this undeniable reality  the Central AmericanPresidents have been meeting together to exchange ideasand experiences so that jointly  with a sense of solidarityand coordination  we can rise to meet the ever-more-complex challenges that face us as a result of the processof political  economic  social and environmentalglobalization which characterizes the new world order. Anexample of this was the signing of the Treaty on CentralAmerican social integration  which took place at thepresidential summit held at the beginning of this year inthe city of San Salvador.Moreover  we are pleased to inform the Assemblythat in the past 12 months we have held meetings at thehighest level in Guacimo  Costa Rica; in Masaya Nicaragua; in Tegucigalpa  Honduras; and in SanSalvador  the capital of my own country  during which weadopted critical decisions for the future of our peoples.We defined our priorities in a new regional agenda whichwas given concrete expression by the signing of thealliance for sustainable development. This embodies botha strategy and a coordination of interests andresponsibilities with legal harmonization and emphasis oninvestment in the social sphere  as we recognize thathuman beings are the pivotal point and the principalsubject of development.The breadth and magnitude of the objectives spelledout in the new strategy for development exceed thecapacities and resources of our countries  and we believethat the international community can contributegenerously towards bringing these strategies to fruition.In this context we ascribe particular importance tothe strengthening of the newly revamped CentralAmerican Integration System (SICA) which has assumedas one of its main responsibilities the promotion andimplementation of the new Central American agenda.May we urge the Assembly to extend the observer statuswe have applied for to this new organization  SICA.We can affirm that Central America has now entereda new era in its history characterized by ongoingcooperation among our countries  as reflected in ourefforts to create the conditions which will overcome theobstacles which have done such damage to the cause ofintegration  so that we can move forward steadfastlytowards the unification of Central America.4In this connection we are particularly pleased at therecent progress made during the binational Honduras/ElSalvador Commission meeting with a view to complyingwith the border demarcation arrangements guaranteeing therights of the inhabitants of the border zones on both sidessimultaneously.In the specific case of my own country we can give acategorical assurance that in the three years since thesigning of the peace agreements  El Salvador has movedforward in a constructive way. The commitment of theGovernment is firm and unswerving in its determination toharness the requisite strength to build a new country  amodern  democratic El Salvador  in which all the sectors ofSalvadorian society will participate without discrimination.After more than a year at the helm I am pleased tostate that my Government is fulfilling the promisescontained in the inaugural address which I delivered to theSalvadorian people on 1 June 1994. We have been dulyfollowing up the peace agreements conceived by the entirenation as a commitment and as an essential prerequisite formoving forward without any possibility of backsliding aswe build a peaceful society.During the period of transition from war to peace andnational reconstruction we have devoted ourselves toconsolidating the pacification process in the conviction thatthat is a task that must be shared in a responsible manneramong the entire population. That task involves not onlyfinding a solution to the immediate problems created by 12years of armed confrontation  but in addition  providing acomprehensive response to domestic problems  for onlythus can we guarantee that the process will be irreversibleand capable of meeting future challenges in a society ofstability and peace.Concerning pending commitments under the PeaceAgreements  we acknowledge realistically and in aconstructive spirit that there have been problems  and hencedelays  in complying with some of those provisions as aresult of the highly complex nature of the process. Thosedifficulties have been overcome through dialogue andconsensus among the sectors responsible forimplementation. This has enabled us  with the assistance ofthe United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador  toalter the established time-tables and to agree on a workprogramme for the definitive completion of thosecommitments.We can affirm that we are complying in a responsiblemanner with the implementation of the Agreements  but iffor logistical reasons some components were still to bepending on 31 October next  given that our determinationto comply with those commitments remains steadfast wewould request the Secretary-General to extend the residualUnited Nations Mission in El Salvador.Our responsibility as a Government goes beyondcompliance with the Peace Agreements  for we mustprovide a comprehensive response to our nationalproblems. Hence  with an awareness that lack ofopportunity in our society leads to frustration and despair creating tensions and conflicts that jeopardize the peaceprocess  we have made additional efforts to implement anambitious economic plan to develop our society  taking asour goals the betterment of human welfare  the systematicalleviation of poverty  and priority attention to health andeducation  in addition to promoting productiveemployment and generally meeting the basic needs of thepopulation  especially its most vulnerable sectors thathave traditionally been denied the fruits of economic andsocial progress.We are pleased to report that our Government hasassigned the highest priority to the maintenance ofmacroeconomic stability through the implementation of aconsistent and coherent set of monetary  exchange-rateand fiscal policies. This has enabled us to achieve specificeconomic targets  namely  the maintenance of a stableexchange rate  the reining in of inflation  the eliminationof our fiscal deficit and the reduction of publicexpenditure  which has been redirected to socialinvestment and basic infrastructure.Our Government is fully convinced that if we are toenjoy sustained medium- and long-term growth it must bebased on an efficient and competitive productive sector both domestically and internationally  and to that end wehave adopted the requisite economic policy measures.Among these I would mention in particular theprogramme to reduce tariffs on the import of capitalgoods  inputs and raw materials; support for furtherdevelopment of the Central American Common Market;the creation of instruments to facilitate and provideguarantees to foreign investors; decisive support forprogrammes to enhance the competitiveness of thedomestic production base; the promotion of small andmicro enterprises; the development of intensive job-training programmes; and the implementation of ournational environment strategy as a component ofsustainable development in El Salvador.5To achieve those objectives the entire population ofmy country is striving to overcome resentment andantagonisms between different social sectors and therebyhelping to foster the conditions for national stability with aview to consolidating peace  strengthening democracy andsecuring economic and social progress.The successful example of El Salvador clearlydemonstrates that a Member State of the Organization acting in good faith  with transparency and political will can overcome situations of severe conflict  principallythrough the efforts of its own population but also with thetimely assistance of the international community.Today  following this exceptional effort to achievepeace — an effort that is  indeed  still under way — ElSalvador is a country that has learned major historicallesson. Foremost among them is the knowledge that withinour national community we share a common destiny andthat within the international community all majorundertakings are shared. Learning from those truths  thechallenge facing us all is to build a more human world forthe benefit of present and future generations."
"146",6331,"SMR",50,1995,"Allowme to begin my address with a personal consideration.Before arriving in New York to participate in this fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  I thought over and overabout the possible tangible outcome of this debate. Inparticular  I tried to determine the present power andstrength of Member States — and especially of the smallones like my own — in terms of taking decisive actionsaimed at preventing  monitoring and managing critical andconflict situations  and  in general  all those circumstanceswhich run counter to the requirements and objectives ofthe United Nations.There is no need for too many words to describe allthe evils besetting our international community andreflecting the disturbing and serious changes in itsattitudes  and  above all  in its mentality. I believe  in fact that the present situation in the former Yugoslavia alonesummarizes and reflects in detail all of these factors.First of all  there is the war  which  because of itslong duration  seems to have been generally accepted asan inevitable condition — a war that is still going ondespite all the efforts to find a peaceful  negotiated andpolitical solution; a war that has seen few truces — andthose that have existed have not been respected; a warinvolving many sophisticated weapons  in spite of allsolemn bans on them; and a war that is the consequenceof speculation and the result of the search for profit at allcosts.The United Nations must have the strength to takea stand against war. It is also evident that resolutions condemnations  embargoes and the dispatching of peace-keeping forces — which sometimes prove useless becoming innocent victims — are no longer sufficient.22Why should we not admit  then  that the United Nations especially in the former Yugoslavia  has revealed itsweakness and its inability to stop a massacre?There must be another solution. Let us reflect on moreeffective approaches and adapt the tools at our disposal toa world that seems to be increasingly pervaded byarrogance  presumption and evil.Although the United Nations has to its credit importantachievements and positive results that deserve generalacknowledgment and appreciation  the fiftieth anniversaryof its foundation is not merely a commemorative event andcannot be regarded as such. This anniversary must alsoprovide an opportunity to assess  review and  wherenecessary  make adjustments.Some structural changes in important United Nationsbodies have been discussed for a number of years. A debateis under way on the reform of the Security Council  as isanother — with less interest and vitality — on thepossibilities for the smallest States fully to enjoy  withoutlimitations  the rights and opportunities granted to them bythe Charter.These are all important issues in which my country isdeeply interested. Yet should we not give conflictmanagement and resolution the highest priority? I amreferring not only to international conflicts  but also tocertain domestic situations  because of the serious violationsand the unanimously condemned tragic consequences theyentail. They should be considered matters of globalconcern.In this context  I must mention one of the most seriousaspects of the present situation in the former Yugoslavia namely human-rights violations. Those rights  enshrined inthe documents of the United Nations  of the Council ofEurope  of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe and in other declarations  are all manifestly beinginfringed. Offences against human dignity are by far thegravest of all violations. They are based on a non-recognition of the human individual and of the freedom topractise a religion  to belong to a minority  to be differentfrom the majority or even from the minority.I believe that the greatest challenge confrontinghumankind  as we approach the year 2000  is the practiceof tolerance. War  hunger  the need to find gainfulemployment  the natural aspiration of individuals toimprove their living standards  and class conflicts remain.The quest for supremacy by ethnic groups and minorities which often results in practices of mass destruction  is nodifferent from the old  repudiated theory of racialsuperiority  so painfully experienced by Europe during thelast world war. We must remember also the total absenceof protection for children and the lack of respect forwomen and their bodies  victims as they are of violenceperpetrated on unbelievable racial grounds. These factorshave made migrations an almost natural component of ourinternational society.The United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees has warned us of the onset of a new andwidespread phenomenon — already seen in some Africancountries — which will be the logical consequence of thewar in the former Yugoslavia. In its appeal  the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) refers to the new category of internallydisplaced persons  who have been forced to leave theirhouses  deprived of the little property they had and ofemployment opportunities. At the same time  estimatesshow a constantly increasing flow of refugees  who haveleft their countries of origin in search of a place to liveand of opportunities  however modest  that would enablethem to start a new life.Thus  future generations will inevitably live in adifferent society from our own. Their neighbours orcolleagues might be of a different colour or race  practisea different religion  perform traditional rites unknown tous  have different habits and approach problems  and lifein general  in a completely different way. To ensure a justand peaceful coexistence  future generations will have tolearn how to adapt to this new reality  to understand andaccept the principle that people are all equal and free tobe different.Solidarity must stem from this conviction and betranslated into consistent behaviour. Solidarity should notbe expressed merely through acts of charity or donationsof superfluous things  with care taken not to lose one’sprivileged economic position. There must be acommitment on the part of all States to make solidarityamong them a way of life. Hunger  natural disasters andman-made environmental destruction  wars  famines  theendemic poverty of some regions and peoples — whichis caused  or aggravated  by bad management on the partof those governing them — are no longer occasionalevents requiring an outburst of generosity. Today  thesefactors have become ever-present in the world and call fora concerted and lasting commitment.23Rich countries should make the necessarycontributions to helping poor countries eradicate deeplyrooted causes of distress by formulating a common  global responsible and transparent policy. Due precaution must betaken not to overburden programmes agreed upon withadministrative infrastructures which could be detrimental tofinancial resources and delay prompt intervention becauseof bureaucratic hurdles.San Marino believes that many other issues deserveattentive consideration and utmost priority.San Marino believes that it is high time to rethink thetool of the embargo  its effectiveness and  above all  itsconsequences. In the absence of armed conflicts  theinternational isolation of a State represents a valid politicaland moral instrument with which to exert pressure on thatState as well as a strong incentive for it to change especially if it has an anti-democratic regime and does notrecognize or respect the rights of its citizens or the rightsset forth by international law in its conduct towards othernations.However  when an embargo is imposed on a countryfor long periods  it also affects its social and commercialsectors. In this case  the main victim is not the regime butthe population  which is already suffering from that systemand probably has neither the strength nor the means tochange or overthrow it. This is unacceptable.When the imposition of an embargo results in themisery of a population and in the deterioration of acountry’s basic structures  including its health-care system then that embargo must be reconsidered and adjusted tomeet human-rights requirements.Capital punishment is another issue that is extremelyimportant to my country and that has been repeatedlydebated in the General Assembly. It is not difficult tounderstand that certain countries — principally those witha large territory and population — require strong deterrentsin order to maintain order and protect their citizens’ lives property and tranquillity. It is also generally recognized thatsome crimes  atrocities and grave offences need to beseverely punished. Nevertheless  the death penalty is toograve a reaction and too great an offence to be accepted bythose countries that believe in the right to life  in thepossibility of true repentance and  above all  in thepossibility of an error on the part of the individualpronouncing the verdict.The Republic of San Marino cannot disguise its deepanxiety with regard to the problem of armaments andtheir increase and  in particular  nuclear weapons. Wehope for global  controlled and irreversible disarmament.Recourse to the rule of law  to the peaceful settlement ofdisputes  to mediation and to international forums is theindispensable foundation of a really advanced andcivilized society. Unfortunately  the threat and use offorce are still considered by many as the only instrumentsto be used in the survival of a State.Furthermore  the production and stockpiling ofnuclear weapons  as well as nuclear tests  have become apervasive feature of the contemporary world  posing aserious threat to the security of States  to the safeguardingof the environment and to the existence of manyindividuals. The concept of nuclear power as a deterrentis an elegant expression concealing its real danger. It is ashield dissimulating the desire for supremacy on the partof some States. In short  this is one of the old theories onwhich anti-democratic and anti-liberal regimes are based.It is our duty to save future generations from the threat ofnuclear weapons. San Marino hopes that the opinion ofthe International Court of Justice requested by the GeneralAssembly may promote the attainment of that objective."
"147",6447,"SUR",50,1995,"We were deeply shockedwhen we heard about the earthquake that took place lastnight in the Republic of Indonesia. On behalf of theGovernment and people of Suriname I offer our deepestsympathy to the victims and their families on this sadoccasion.On behalf of the Government and people of theRepublic of Suriname  may I first warmly congratulateyou  Sir  on your unanimous and well-deserved electionto the presidency of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. We have no doubt thatunder your distinguished leadership and with yourexperience this session will achieve its aims. As youpreside over our deliberations at this crucial juncture inhistory  you can be assured of our wholehearted cooperationas you fulfil your task.Permit me also to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  for the veryable and competent manner in which he presided over theforty-ninth session.May I also take this opportunity to express our deepappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the exemplary manner in which he is fulfillinghis tasks during these challenging times. He deserves ouradmiration and gratitude for the important role he plays inguiding this unique world Organization.I am especially pleased and honoured to greet Palau asa new Member of the United Nations family. Suriname islooking forward to close cooperation with this friendlynation in our common efforts to attain the noble goals ofthe United Nations Charter.Before I continue  I should like to express the feelingsof sincere sympathy of the Government and people of theRepublic of Suriname for the Governments and peoples ofAntigua and Barbuda  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Dominica Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and other territories inthe Caribbean for the great destruction sadly caused byHurricanes Luis and Marilyn.We are living in an era in which the ending of thecold war has removed the risk of a nuclear nightmare andhas given us hope that a new atmosphere of cooperationbetween States will emerge. If we could show the necessarypolitical will  this new atmosphere should provide us  nowand in the coming decades  with a unique opportunity tofocus our attention on the solution of many problems problems which pose serious threats to international peaceand security and which hamper efforts to achieve sustainedeconomic growth and sustainable development.In some instances the international community hasmade good use of these changing circumstances and hasfound common approaches to problems affecting us all.Experience during the last few years  however  has revealedthat our world is still characterized by unfairness andinjustice  and that the gap between the developed countriesand the majority of developing countries is widening. As aresult the number of countries in crisis or in near crisis isincreasing. Consequently  political instability  an increase inextreme poverty  social exclusion and social disintegrationare on the rise in many developing countries  causingdespair and endangering peace and security bothnationally and internationally.The developing world has on many occasionsunderlined the need to pay particular attention to theelimination of the ever-widening gap between thecountries of the North and those of the South and to theestablishment of a new equitable and just internationaleconomic order.During several specifically focused internationalconferences organized by the United Nations  an appealhas been made to the developed countries to fulfil theirobligations to meet official development assistance targetsand to help to create an international economic andpolitical climate conducive to sustained economic growthin developing countries.Unfortunately  the response to our appeal has notfully met our expectations. It will therefore remain ourpriority to continue with concerted efforts to convince ourdeveloped partners that honouring their commitments andcreating favourable economic conditions are also in theirown interest  because there will be no durable peace andstability in the world as long as the majority of theworld’s population cannot fulfil its basic needs.Another disturbing event on the present internationalscene is the eruption and spread of many serious violentconflicts and the increasing danger to international peaceand security which these conflicts harbour. Such is thecase as we witness the prolonged violent action in formerYugoslavia. These conflicts are the cause of terribletragedy  as is evidenced by the extermination of tens ofthousands of people  the casualties suffered by the civilianpopulation  the destruction of the economic and socialinfrastructure  the displacement of people from theirhomes  and the lack of shelter  food and medicalfacilities. Finding a solution to these conflicts which willserve the common interests of all parties involved willremain a major challenge for the United Nations.A few days ago the warring parties in the formerYugoslavia signed an agreement which we hope willsignal the beginning of the end of the tragic war beingwaged in that area. We appeal in the strongest terms toall parties involved to take advantage of this momentumand engage in meaningful negotiations in order to reacha peaceful settlement which will silence the guns now andfor all time.2In Mozambique  Angola and  recently  Palestine wehave found proof that seemingly sworn enemies can resolvetheir differences through peaceful means. The Governmentof Suriname is therefore very pleased with the recentlyconcluded accord between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and commends both fortheir efforts to restore peace in the Middle East. We knowthat the healing process will be slow and that there aremany obstacles to overcome  but we are sure that peacewill finally prevail over violence  chaos and misery.The accelerated globalization of the world economy dynamized by a technological revolution during the courseof the last decade  has led to important changes inproduction structures and world trade. These changes affectthe terms of trade of many developing countries.Other developments  such as the successful conclusionof the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations andthe emergence of mega-trading blocs and free trade zones have led to changes in the political and economic thinkingin our region in the search for new ways of adapting tothese shifting circumstances. The recent formation of theAssociation of Caribbean States and the decision by thecountries of the Western hemisphere to create a continentalfree-trade zone by the year 2005 can be seen as proof of avery strong commitment to regional cooperation by ourrespective Governments.To further our commitment to regional cooperation the Government of Suriname took two steps of historicsignificance: Suriname became the fourteenth member Stateof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in July and wasa co-founder of the Association of Caribbean States.Suriname is ready to make its contribution in these regionalbodies in order to attain economic prosperity for its peopleand to preserve and strengthen its democratic traditions andvalues.Just a few years ago  at the Rio Conference  we  theMember countries of the United Nations  established as aprimary concern the need to ensure a rational balancebetween realizing legitimate national goals and safeguardingthe well-being of future generations through the protectionof the world’s natural resources. Furthermore  we promotedthe awareness that development must be sustainable andthat sustainability requires due attention to bothenvironmental and economic and social factors. The needto achieve economic development on terms compatible withthe conservation of the environment is a priority objectivefor my country.Suriname is blessed with an impressive  rich tropicalrain forest covering approximately 80 per cent of its totalterritory. This makes our forest one of the main naturalresources for fostering development and guaranteeingwelfare and prosperity for our people. Hence  theexploitation and alternative uses of the forest have alwaysbeen among our primary economic activities.My Government promotes sustainable managementof the forest  which allows for its economic utilization but at the same time our primary concern is to ensure arational balance between our legitimate socio-economicgoals and the protection of the health and well-being offuture generations. Within our limited technologicalcapabilities  we are trying to fulfil our obligations topreserve the biological wealth of the forest.Our responsibility and commitment in this area arereflected in my Government’s policy of stringentprotection for approximately 1 million hectares of forest.This is accomplished through the creation of 13 naturereserves and one national park and through additionalplans to add half a million hectares of forest to the naturereserves in the short term. Hence  in the near future  10per cent of all Surinamese territory will be protected.Another important step taken by the Government inthe sphere of sustainable use of the forest  guaranteeingthe preservation of biodiversity  is evidenced by theNational Assembly’s ratification in July 1995  of theUnited Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.Furthermore  the results of the recently concludednegotiations with potential investors will be submitted toour National Assembly for approval. In accordance withthe agreements reached  our forest will be exploited onlyaccording to the so-called Celos management system  asdeveloped in Suriname and accepted internationally as thebest form of forest management.I should not fail to share with the Assembly ourconcerns over the problem of illicit traffic in drugs especially since we  unfortunately  as a transit country have attracted much of this unlawful and damaging tradeas a consequence of our service economy  the presentfinancial and economic crisis and our geographicalsituation.Illicit traffic in drugs poses special security problemsfor countries like ours  with hundreds of miles ofunguarded shorelines and inadequate resources to matchthe super-modern equipment to which drug traffickershave access. Because of its operational methods  which3have no regard for frontiers  this form of modernaggression has become one of the most serious types ofinternational crime. It must be combated in all its variousphases and manifestations.Recent drug enforcement operations in our region haveshown that firm action in the struggle against drugtrafficking at the national level can be successful and thatwith concerted action it is possible to break up the mainnetworks of drug traffickers. Indeed  this success stands outas a ray of optimism and hope  overcoming the temptationto yield to discouragement and pessimism in this area.Unfortunately  it is not enough for one country or afew countries to be victorious because drug trafficking is aninternational crime which threatens mankind in every cornerof the world. It is capable of offsetting the efforts ofGovernments to eradicate this scourge. Moreover  it islinked to activities such as arms trafficking and terrorism while its repercussions are no longer merely social andeconomic but pose serious threats to political and socialstability. However  to eradicate this multifaceted scourgeonce and for all  we need — now more than ever —enhanced regional and international cooperation that iseffective and constructive and that complements the effortsof individual countries.My country will persist in the struggle against illicitdrug trafficking because this struggle represents a moralcommitment  not only to the Surinamese people but to allpeople  especially to the children and young people affected by this scourge.The experience gained by the Government ofSuriname in the field of development cooperation revealsthe supportive role of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  the United Nations Population Fund the United Nations Children’s Fund  the United NationsDevelopment Fund for Women and other agencies in thedevelopment efforts of Suriname.Recently  our per capita income and the adjustment ofthe indicative planning figure for 1995 and 1996 wererevised by UNDP. That revision offered us substantiveadditional support for the implementation of activitiesplanned within the framework of the national developmentstrategy  in particular effective activities related to thestructural adjustment programme  the public sector reformprogramme and the regional integration programme.On behalf of the Government and people of Suriname we would like to express our gratitude to theSecretary-General and his staff for their efforts topromote greater involvement of the United Nations infostering development in Suriname. We are lookingforward to the continuation and enhancement of closercooperation with the operational arms of the UnitedNations system.Suriname is aware of the need to make the UnitedNations an effective instrument for the internationalcommunity in the quest for sustainable development anddurable international peace and security.To this end  thefinances of this world body should be streamlined but above all  the restructuring efforts should reflect today’sinternational economic and political realities. In thisregard  Suriname favours the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil as regards both permanent and non-permanentmembers. The increase in the number of permanentmembers should not however involve developed countriesonly. Hence we support expansion through the inclusionof permanent members selected also from developingcountries which are able to contribute to the maintenanceof international peace and security and which havealready expressed their desire to become permanentmembers of the Security Council.Suriname became the 144th Member of the UnitedNations family in November 1975. This year we willcelebrate the twentieth anniversary of our independenceand also the twentieth anniversary of our membership ofthis world body. Twenty years of experience as anindependent nation and as a Member of the UnitedNations have revealed to us that the principles enshrinedin the Charter still remain the cornerstone in relationsbetween States.My country has therefore on various occasionspledged its commitment to the observance of theseprinciples. In the past  even before we gainedindependence  citizens from Suriname were called uponto defend these principles — in some cases  regrettably with their lives. Today  on behalf of the Government andpeople of Suriname  on the eve of the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations  I would like to acknowledge thevaluable contribution that these brave men and womenhave made to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.At present  Suriname is part of the efforts by theinternational community  through the United Nations  torestore order and democracy and to foster prosperity inHaiti.4When called upon to do so  Suriname will alwayscontribute  through the United Nations  to the endeavoursof the international community to make our world a betterplace in which to live."
"148",6471,"SVK",50,1995,"Mr. President  it isundoubtedly a great honour to be the President of theUnited Nations General Assembly session in this veryimportant year. Please accept my sincere congratulations onyour election and my very best wishes for a successfulcourse of its fiftieth session.I should also like to thank your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  for his significant contributionto the positive results achieved at last year’s session.By the end of 1995  the Slovak Republic will haveconcluded the third year of its sovereign existence.Although my country is relatively new in the internationalcommunity  it has during the past three years confirmedthat its activities in the international scene are based onrespect for international law and for the principles ofdemocratic coexistence between nations.The basic coordinate of Slovakia’s foreign policy is itsintegration into the geopolitical and economic sphere withwhich we not only have numerous historical ties  butalso — and  I think  more importantly — with which weshare the same hierarchy of modern civilized values.Along with other Central European countries Slovakia has made significant progress in thetransformation of its political and economic system  aswell as in the process of democratization. We feelpolitical and economical closeness to the West  and weare aware of the unique historical opportunity to join theprosperous union of democratic European countries.Slovakia as a standard democratic State is an integralpart of the Central European space  which is undoubtedlyimportant for political and military stability in Europe.We want to contribute to building that stability bymaintaining good-neighbourly relations backed by a set oflegally sound treaties  as well as by mutually beneficialcooperation. We proceed from the fact that suchcooperation is a basic precondition for the stability andprosperity of all the countries in our region.Good relations with the States of the G-7  of theCommonwealth of Independent States and all democraticcountries  are also of great importance to us. We wish tomake full use of the opportunity for cooperation with thedynamically developing Asia-Pacific region  with theLatin American countries  and with Near and Middle Eastcountries as well.The Slovak Republic participates in maintaininginternational peace and security within the framework ofUnited Nations activities. Our priority at this stage is fullmembership in the Conference on Disarmament (CD). Inthis respect I cannot omit to note that our membership inthe Conference on Disarmament following that of theformer Czecho-Slovak federation  which had been workingin that organ since the very beginning  remains the onlyunresolved issue. In all other organs  the seat occupied bythe former Czecho-Slovakia was assigned to either theCzech Republic or to Slovakia by elections or byappointments based on the respective rules  with bothsuccessor States having agreed not to compete with eachother in order to obtain seats in organs of the UnitedNations system which had been vacated by the dissolutionof the federation. In accordance with this agreement andwith the support of the Eastern European regional group Slovakia submitted its candidature for the seat vacated bythe former Czecho-Slovak federation  to which Slovakia isone of the successor States  in the Conference onDisarmament. In other words  we have had and we stillhave a serious interest in filling the gap which has arisen inthe membership of that Conference. We consider itunjustifiable to link the issue of filling the vacancy in themembership of the Conference with the broader issue of theexpansion of its membership  which has been underdiscussion for many years. We expect that States membersof the Conference will understand this situation and willsupport Slovakia and its legitimate effort to pursue theprevious activities of Czecho-Slovak diplomacy in theConference on Disarmament.The results of the Fifth Review Conference of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)represent an important impulse for the further activities ofthe Conference on Disarmament. The extension of theTreaty for an indefinite period is the most important resultof the Review Conference. We consider it a preconditionfor the further development of international cooperation inthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy  as well as for thecomplete elimination of nuclear weapons. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has played a positive role in themodern history of mankind. Being the only Treaty with aglobal character  it has managed to reduce the risk offurther expansion of the group of nuclear-weapon States.Slovakia places special emphasis on the preparation ofthe comprehensive test-ban treaty (CTBT) in 1996  andsupports the immediate commencement of negotiationsaimed at elaborating the text of the fissile materials cut-offtreaty. This would lead to further progress in building up anew security architecture  and it would become animportant milestone on the road to an era when nuclearweapons will be considered unnecessary.Slovakia  as one of the signatory States  attachesgreat importance to the chemical weapons Convention(CWC)  which has outlawed a whole category of weaponsof mass destruction. It is my pleasure to inform theAssembly that the Slovak Parliament approved thisConvention three weeks ago  and we will soon submit theratification instruments to the Secretary-General.In connection with the forthcoming ReviewConference of the States Parties to the Convention onProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of CertainConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to BeExcessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects(CCW)  my country is ready to support the successfulcourse of work and the adoption of the text of ProtocolIV  which would enable the effective implementation ofthe Convention. Slovakia was among the very firstcountries to place an embargo on the export of anti-personnel land-mines. We also highly appreciate theresults of the International Meeting on United NationsMine Clearance Programmes held under the auspices ofthe Secretary-General. This forum stressed the need for amore active approach to the reduction of negative impactscaused by the use of these inhumane weapons  whichespecially afflict the civil population  including innocentchildren.The conflict on the territory of the formerYugoslavia has thoroughly tested the entire internationalcommunity  but especially the United NationsOrganization itself. The level at which we pass this testwill affect relations in the international political scene forthe next few decades. Slovakia considers peace talks to bethe only way leading to a stable and just solution.Military actions have turned out to be counter-productiveand to have only a temporary character. They cannotovercome the animosity between the warring sides. Oureffort is aimed at finding generally acceptable solutionsagreed upon by all parties at the negotiating table. Theirequal status can be considered to be one of the crucialprerequisites in approaching this crisis. Therefore  wesupport the plan of the Contact Group and see it as asound starting-point for direct negotiations between theparties to the conflict.In order to achieve stability in the Mediterraneanregion  a just and lasting solution of the problem ofCyprus should be found. In this context  my countrysupports the efforts of the international community andhighly esteems in particular the contribution which theSecretary-General made in stressing the territorialintegrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. We think it is2necessary that negotiations continue between the twocommunities in order to reunite the island. This process  ifit is to be concluded successfully  has to take intoconsideration the individual and specific differences existingwithin the population. Slovakia is ready to continueproviding its good services aimed at facilitating meetingsbetween political representatives of the two communities.Since there are so many conflicts in all parts of theworld  my country welcomes any progress that wouldstrengthen international security and peace. Just to mentiona few examples  visible progress has been made in theMiddle East peace process focused on the final settlementof the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict. The agreementssigned between the State of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization have proved the correct andappropriate nature of the peace talks and of the efforts ofthe two parties and of the international community. Theseefforts are based on the conviction that the two parties cancoexist peacefully.United Nations peace-keeping operations have becomeone of the most discussed issues. Slovakia considers peace-keeping operations to be an important instrument withwhich the international community can maintain peace andsecurity in the world. On the other hand  we realize that thecurrent situation is not ideal. Therefore  we support theprocess of restructuring peace-keeping operations  whichwould increase their effectiveness and allow them to reactquickly. This would require the mandate of peace-keepingmissions to be clear  unambiguous and realistic — that is implementable. In this context  we welcome the Supplementto the Agenda for Peace as an effort to strengthen theelement of conflict prevention. We have been following thediscussions on these issues with great attention and weshare the view that  at this stage  peace-keeping  rather thanpeace-enforcement  is the realistic solution reflecting boththe complexity of most conflicts and what the internationalcommunity can sustain.Slovakia’s position has been reflected in the types ofunits and services provided for peace-keeping operations.At the current time we have 600 engineers in the formerYugoslavia and five military observers in the UnitedNations Angola Verification Mission. The Slovak EngineerBattalion was awarded an honorary diploma by the ForceCommander of the United Nations Protection Force inNovember 1994 in recognition of its professional skills andthe quality of the work done.In order to achieve the goals set forth by the UnitedNations  it is necessary that they be realized in a democraticenvironment  especially with regard to the protection ofhuman rights. The Slovak Republic has succeeded to allthe relevant international obligations of the formerCzecho-Slovak federation. In the field of human rights this means that Slovakia is a party to all of theinternational human rights conventions. This activeapproach has also resulted in a variety of documentsapproved in domestic legislation and in foreign policy.I should like to mention just a few examples especially the incorporation of international human rightsprotection standards into the Constitution of the SlovakRepublic; the further harmonization of other legal normsto those standards; the establishment of the SlovakNational Centre for Human Rights  and the GovernmentalCommittee for the implementation of the ActionProgramme against Racism  Anti-Semitism  Xenophobia and Intolerance; active participation in the preparation ofinternational documents concerning the protection ofpersons belonging to ethnic minorities; the ratification ofthe Framework Convention of the Council of Europe onthe Protection of Minorities; and  last but not least  thereflection of this document  together with the UnitedNations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belongingto National or Ethnic  Religious and Linguistic Minoritiesin the Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations andFriendly Cooperation signed this year with Hungary.Slovakia is very sensitive to all kinds of disrespectfor and gross violation of values which are the keystoneof human dignity  and my country therefore highlyappreciates United Nations activities in regard to theprotection of human rights. We are prepared to contributeto the strengthening of international cooperation in orderto achieve higher respect for human rights and basicfreedoms for all  regardless of their race  gender  languageor religion.Speaking of human rights  we cannot overlook therights of women. The Fourth World Conference onWomen  which has just concluded  has raised a numberof questions which will have to be resolved by our jointefforts. We welcome the successful outcome of this eventand we were honoured  as a member of the Commissionon the Status of Women  to take active part in thepreparation of its final document  the Platform for Action.There are a number of social issues related to thestatus of women. One of them is the role of the family insociety. The International Centre for Family Studies hasbeen active in Slovakia since the end of 1993 and it hasrepeatedly proved its viability by actively participating at3various international events. This Centre was theco-organizer of the United Nations Interregional Meeting ofNational Coordinators — Focal Point for the Year of theFamily  held in Bratislava from 4 to 7 February 1995.These facts have led our Government to seek opportunitiesfor closer cooperation between the Centre and the UnitedNations. Slovakia has therefore submitted a proposal foraffiliating the Centre with the United Nations. We wouldhighly appreciate our proposal being given positiveconsideration.Slovakia appreciates the efforts of the United Nationswith a view to the restructuring and revitalization of itsactivities in the economic  social and other related fields  aswell as all reforms connected with them. We consider theseefforts to be a contribution to improving the efficiency ofthe work of the United Nations and a positive reaction toall major changes taking place all over the world.We fully support the basic approach and goals of thetwo fundamental documents approved by the UnitedNations in the area of international economic cooperationin the 1990s: the Declaration on International EconomicCooperation  in particular the Revitalization of EconomicGrowth and Development of the Developing Countries  andthe International Development Strategy for the FourthUnited Nations Development Decade.One of the main priorities anchored in thesedocuments is the development of human resources withinthe overall development framework. These documents arebased on global consensus. Their aim is to improve thesocial and economic situation of the poor and leastdeveloped parts of our planet and thus to eliminate one ofthe main sources of conflicts — the huge differencesbetween the wealthy and poor countries. All these goals arein the best interest of the Slovak Republic  too.During the last decade  the number of countriesmeeting the criteria for being “least developed” hassignificantly increased. Together with other global problemssuch as environmental protection and sustainabledevelopment  which cannot be resolved by a single countryor several countries  this is a challenge for all mankind  andfor the most developed countries in particular. However  wemust stress also the primary responsibility of the countriesconcerned for their further development.Nowadays  Slovakia itself  as well as other Central andEast European countries  must face a variety of complicatedeconomic problems related to the process of transition froma centrally planned economy to a market economy. Thisprocess has never before been carried out to such anextent. We are deeply interested in continued access tovaluable information within United Nations projectsrelated to know-how  human resources development andmanagement training. This would certainly help us incarrying out our economic reform.Despite the complicated economic situation  mycountry has a strong will to participate actively in UnitedNations programmes in areas in which we could be ofassistance  namely in areas concerning human resourcesin developing countries. For example  we seeopportunities for broader participation by Slovak expertsin development programmes.Slovakia supports all activities of the United Nationsin the field of assistance to developing countries. Wewelcome the increasing efforts of these countries not tobe in the position of passive recipients only  and we valuetheir endeavour to take over the management of theireconomic and technical development. At the same time we highly appreciate the United Nations role inimplementing its projects  to reflect the needs of thereceiving countries fully  while respecting specificfeatures of their economies and their priorities andmaking use of the domestic human  technical andtechnological potential.Nowadays  when the United Nations is goingthrough a complicated period of its existence  it isparticularly important to determine the direction of itsactivities  with  as a starting-point  the processes going onin international relations. Interconnection between globaland national interests is the defining factor in coping withthe problems which all mankind is facing at the moment.If the United Nations is really to understand the verynature of these processes  it will be necessary to start itsown reform. We support such reform and thereforesupport all steps that would strengthen the United Nationssystem and thereby enable it to perform its tasks moreeffectively. This reform will require  inter alia  therestructuring of most of the Organization’s main bodies.As for Security Council reform  we support expanding theCouncil by the addition of new members that are able toassume global responsibilities and have sufficientpotential to support United Nations activities financially.The credibility and efficiency of the Security Councilhave to be stressed as the main priorities.We are fully aware of the difficult financialsituation  which is a result of unpaid arrears by Member4States. Member States are very often unable to pay theirassessed contributions. Therefore  we support the reform ofthe scale of assessment based on the principle of thecapacity to pay  and we also expect the reform to increaseeffectiveness and transparency of spending.In connection with the United Nations budget  I wishto mention that Slovakia  in spite of the fact that it isundergoing a transformation of its economy and has to copewith various pressures on State finances  has alwaysfulfilled its obligation to pay its assessed contribution to theregular budget in full. As concerns its contribution to thebudget for peace-keeping operations  Slovakia is in thesame position as the Czech Republic. These two countrieshave not been classified into any of the groups for theapportionment of peace-keeping expenses even though theyhave been Members of the United Nations for more thantwo and a half years. We believe that this issue will beresolved at this year’s session of the General Assembly  andthat in so doing we shall take realistically into account therespective economic data. Having analysed the data andhaving compared it with data from other countries  we havereached the firm conviction that Slovakia should be placedamong the Member States of Group “C” for theapportionment of peace-keeping expenses. From thisrostrum I want to confirm that Slovakia is ready to shoulderits fair share of responsibility for this important activity ofthe United Nations.This year we commemorate five decades since the endof the horrors of the Second World War  since that momentwhen all nations put aside weapons with the intention ofliving in peace  and  for this reason  decided to establish anorganization which would serve as a platform forinternational cooperation. Looking back at those decades wemust logically come to the conclusion that the UnitedNations has played a crucial role in our history and that itsexistence is still justified.Although the ceremonies will culminate in meetingsnext month  we can already say that we did our best toensure the commemoration of this anniversary with honour.For the celebration of this anniversary  a special committeeestablished in Slovakia organized many education-orientedevents  a number of which are still taking place. The maingoal of all seminars  meetings  and television and radiobroadcasts has been to focus more attention on the activitiesof this undoubtedly most important internationalorganization  not only in the field of maintaininginternational peace and security but also  and especially  inthe field of the development of international cooperation inall areas of human activity.I wish the best for this session of the GeneralAssembly  and I wish it much spiritual strength inresolving the important issues which the United Nationsis facing now."
"149",6496,"SVN",50,1995,"It is a great pleasure to seeMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral presiding over the importantproceedings of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.We are confident that under his guidance this session willbe a great success.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations givesus a reason and an opportunity to reflect on the state ofthe United Nations and on the question of its ability toadjust to a changing world. This is especially necessaryin our times. We have witnessed in the short span of thelast few years a variety of changes which have affirmedthe global nature of all the basic issues facing mankind.An array of United Nations conferences and summitshas strengthened our common awareness of the globalnature of environmental and development issues including those related to social development. The world-wide tendency towards democracy and the freedom of theindividual has strengthened the world-wide cause ofhuman rights. The notion of our common security isbeing redefined and globalized. It now contains not onlymilitary and political  but also economic  social andenvironmental components.This session of the General Assembly began lessthan two weeks after the conclusion of the Fourth WorldConference on Women. That conference amplydemonstrated the depth and the global nature of thechanges that are at hand. The equality of women and therealization of the human rights of women are now amongthe priority issues on the international agenda.The United Nations has highlighted the sensitivity ofthe organized international community to the crucialissues facing the world and the Organization’s ability toprovide a framework for articulating the main objectivesand commitments. It has also demonstrated the ability toformulate principal policy objectives. On the other hand however  the United Nations has yet to prove its ability toorganize effective international cooperation for therealization of voluntary  agreed objectives andcommitments. This is a more difficult task  and much is leftto be desired in our fulfilment of it.Furthermore  it is in this context that the question ofreform of the United Nations system arises. Reforms areneeded to respond to profound changes in internationalrelations and should be much more far-reaching andcarefully focused than is currently the case. So  forexample  reforms in the economic and social domainsshould duly take into account the transformation of theworld economy and the ever growing importance of marketforces  private-initiative entrepreneurship and free trade. Inthese circumstances there is no place for the creation ofunnecessary supra-State structures. What is needed however  is carefully targeted operational cooperation fordevelopment and high-level dialogue capable of assistingMember States to formulate the most effective economicand social policies.The functional commissions of the Economic andSocial Council should become places where decisionmakers both from Governments and from non-governmentalsectors meet and devise specific strategies. New schemes ofcooperation among governmental and non-governmentalsectors are needed  not least to develop appropriate modelsfor financing the relevant priorities in the fields ofenvironment and social development.Careful thinking and responsible action are necessaryfor the strengthening of international peace and security.Each of the diverse priorities in this domain will requireserious efforts if satisfactory solutions are to be possible.However  there are also fears that the will to reach themhas not yet been mobilized.Another priority area of United Nations action for thestrengthening of international peace and security concernsthe necessary reform of the principal United Nations bodyin this field  the Security Council. An awareness of theneed to strengthen the representative character and theeffectiveness of the Security Council through expansion ofits membership is now generally shared. Slovenia is amongthose Members of the United Nations which support theidea of appropriate expansion of the number of bothpermanent and non-permanent seats on the SecurityCouncil. This is the majority view now. Furthermore  webelieve that in order to reflect adequately the political andeconomic realities of our time it is important that Germanyand Japan should become permanent members of theSecurity Council.In the framework of the proposed reform  we shouldask ourselves what the future role of the United Nationsought to be. After the fall of the Berlin Wall  after thedisappearance of the communist bloc  there is a newsituation in the world. The process is basically positive but in the first years after the big change there are stillmany questions to be answered. The world must find newstability  a new balance. The danger of regional conflictsand wars has increased. The international community didnot find adequate responses to specific situations  such asthose in Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.But we cannot simply say that internationalinstitutions  including the United Nations  were inefficientin dealing with these situations. The humanitarianendeavour and contribution were significant. Manyremarkable efforts were put into solutions — efforts byindividuals and by institutions. But it remains clear thatthe world must find answers to the new challenges.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a verygood example. It is an important case in itself  but it isalso a very important precedent to be considered in thefuture. The response of the world to the situation in theformer Yugoslavia was slow. Preventive diplomacy failedin this case  as in many other crises  as a result of thenormal behaviour of the majority of politicians  whousually give priority to domestic situations and problems.But in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina there isanother very important dimension of the problem: asolution or the absence of a solution will influence thefuture.How will the post-cold-war world develop? Willthere be efficient international coordination  mainly withinthe United Nations  to take care of such problems andcrises? Or shall we go back to the old division of theworld and of Europe: the division  in interest spheres among classic Powers — the traditional interest spheresof the most important countries?It is obvious that in the case of Bosnia andHerzegovina there was some mix of the two approaches.There was an international effort in the framework of theUnited Nations  and there were differences among somepower States with different opinions about the situation.Bosnia and Herzegovina is where the First World Warstarted  when the old European Powers tried to expandtheir interest zones. The former Yugoslavia was at the2crossroads of many interests and is where so many horrorsand killings took place during the Second World War. Andthere are some signs that the international community hasnot yet completely overcome such historical divisions andinfluences.On the other hand  we cannot say that this historicalapproach prevailed in tackling the situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina. There was also strong international action inthe name of the universal order and universal values  in thename of the protection of human rights  in the name of theprotection of the rights of all nations. It is very encouragingthat we recently witnessed really serious activity  a veryserious peace plan. Diplomatic activity combined with thenecessary military action has for the first time provided arealistic chance to stop the war and the killing in Bosniaand Herzegovina and to establish a durable peace and theprospect of stability in the region.If these activities succeed  they will be an extremelyimportant model for the future  for further development ofinternational coordination in the framework of the UnitedNations. If the international community is able to solvesuch an extremely difficult case as that of Bosnia andHerzegovina we shall all be encouraged to direct newenergy and efforts towards establishing global instrumentsand activities to prevent and to solve future crises. Theinternational community will strengthen its institutions insupport of universal values and rights.If it fails in this case the situation will be just theopposite. The road will be open to anarchy  chaos andregional wars  to the rule of the stronger  to the oldpractices of spheres of interest  and the world will not finda way out of the post-cold-war situation. Instability willincrease  and the chances of regional and global wars willbe greater.So we are at a very important moment in history andin the functioning of the United Nations. If the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations is celebrated with successin finally solving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia  thiswill be the best reward for everybody who  over the past 50years  has sacrificed his time  his energy or even his life forthe establishment of a world of freedom  stability andinternational cooperation.Of course  there are many problems to be solved inthe future. The United Nations will have to developefficient instruments of preventive diplomacy and means ofhandling crises if they occur anyway and of defining thecriteria as to when and how to intervene. As is very evidentfrom the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina  it is not alwayseasy to achieve a unanimous definition of “the bad guys”in the world order or to agree upon action against them.But there are human rights criteria  and there areuniversal values that were developed in the world overthe centuries  and especially during recent decades. Thesehave to be respected and implemented.Luckily  Slovenia was out of the Yugoslav crisis ata very early stage and established its independence fouryears ago. Now we have a very prosperous State withgood democratic performance and very good economicdevelopment. Slovenia is considered one of the bestcountries  if not the best country  in transition to themarket and democratic system. We are also prepared tomake our contribution to building the internationalinstitutions and the coordination that will lead to greaterstability in the world. We see our future as being ininternational institutions like the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and the European Union. We lookupon such bodies not only as economic or defenceinstitutions but also as institutions that should ensuregreater stability in the world  greater democracy and thedevelopment of universal principles of individual andcollective human rights.But we can see that the way is not easy. Even in ourown neighbourhood we face some remnants of the past.This is just one further reason for our insistence onrespect by everybody  and not just by the smaller and theweaker countries  for principle in international relations democracy and universal values. This is the onlyguarantee of international peace and stability. Clearly  ifwe start to correct the past and the present on the basis ofsome historical tendencies of domination  there will be noway of securing the future stability of the world. Thesolution lies only in overcoming such practices andattitudes and in establishing international cooperation peace and stability on the basis of respect for each otherand for universal human rights."
"150",6541,"SWE",50,1995,"First of all I shouldlike to welcome the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreementbeing signed today in Washington by Yasser Arafat andYitzhak Rabin. This show of reconciliation should be anexample to parties in various conflicts the world over.As the United Nations celebrates its fiftiethanniversary  it is time to look to the future. The world isdifferent. The end of the cold war  the spread ofdemocracy  economic globalization  and the explosivegrowth of communications have led to far-reachingchanges. Distances between people are shorter  nationalboundaries are more open and global interdependence isincreasingly apparent.Security is no longer primarily a military matter.Security also implies building confidence  justice andequal opportunities to achieve lasting and sustainablepeace  both within countries and through closercooperation between countries and peoples.Such cooperation is needed at the regional andglobal levels. Further enlargement of the European Unionwould be a step towards a pan-European community forpeace and security. We have a historic opportunity tocreate a united Europe  ultimately developing integrationand cooperation to a point where war becomesinconceivable anywhere on our continent. In my vision the European Union must be a genuine peace project opening itself towards the rest of Europe and the rest ofthe world.At the same time  major threats to human securityare global. They must be met by global action. Thus  wemust revitalize the United Nations system  and adapt theOrganization to the new reality. We need an effectiveinstrument for global cooperation — for peace andsecurity  for sustainable development  for justice and fora life in dignity for all.We are more convinced than ever that  with 50 yearsof experience  the United Nations is an indispensable tool8for achieving these goals. Fifty years of experience havestrengthened our support for the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations Charter.In pursuit of these goals  United Nations personnel allover the world are making major contributions. They meritour deep gratitude. We pay special tribute to those whohave lost their lives in the service of the world communityand we extend our sympathy to their families.Appalling pictures of human suffering in Somalia Rwanda and former Yugoslavia force their way into ourhomes. We see the United Nations humiliated. The apparentshortcomings of the world Organization have sown doubtsabout the feasibility of multilateral global cooperation. Butthe problems of the United Nations are in fact those of itsMember States. They result from a combination of growingneeds and expectations  on the one hand  and insufficientresources and a lack of political will  on the other.Sweden’s former Prime Minister  Olof Palme developed this theme in a speech he gave from this rostrum10 years ago at the special commemorative session to markthe fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:“Let us not make the United Nations thescapegoat for problems that reflect our ownshortcomings. It is not the United Nations that has notlived up to us; it is we who have not lived up to theideals of the United Nations. It is by improvingourselves and our policies that we can improve theUnited Nations.” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fortieth Session  Plenary Meetings  43rdmeeting  p. 64)Let us not curse the dark but instead shed light. Let usdraw lessons both from the more difficult United Nationsoperations of recent years  and the more successful ones —El Salvador  Namibia  Mozambique and Cambodia.We have learned that we must take action at an earlystage  before the catastrophe is a fact  before the genie ofviolence has escaped from the bottle. The United NationsCharter offers plenty of scope for preventive efforts. Actionmust be undertaken with the consent of the Statesconcerned and their sovereignty must be respected. Weappeal to Governments: in an internal conflict accept theassistance offered by the United Nations or by a regionalorganization.Prevention is seldom glamorous. It does not makeheadlines. Long-term  often tedious  work  with the focuson the fundamental causes of conflicts  must be backedup by deliberate political support.More resources must be earmarked for preventivemeasures. This is an investment that is needed if we areto avoid new tragedies. The Swedish Government iscurrently studying how to improve the United Nationscapacity for early-warning and preventive action.We have learned to focus on the security and needsof human beings. Our goal must always be humancoexistence  irrespective of cultural  religious or ethnicdifferences. We must never confine ourselves to drawingup maps that reflect the realities of power politics. Wemust never accept the evil of “ethnic cleansing”. If we do we will ultimately threaten ourselves and our future.We have also learned the importance of theprinciples of international law and respect for humanrights. Humanitarian law must be defended and reinforcedand war crimes investigated. For example  we must findout what happened to those who disappeared inSrebrenica and Zepa. By bringing war criminals to trialwe will enhance respect for humanitarian law.Perpetrators of cruelty  rape and torture must be made tounderstand that they cannot act out their perversions withimpunity. We support the international criminal Tribunalfor the former Yugoslavia  and the Rwanda tribunal.We have learned that a democratic culture providesgreater potential for prevention and conflict resolution.Continued democratization within individual countriesmust be encouraged  underpinning a democraticinternational community. Sweden is honoured to be thehost country of the International Institute for Democracyand Electoral Assistance (IDEA)  which supportsdemocratization processes throughout the world. The workof IDEA will be a valuable complement to the efforts ofthe United Nations and non-governmental organizationsin this area.We have learned that troops must be made availablefor rapid-reaction operations when non-military measureshave failed. As a conflict begins to escalate  every houris precious. The lack of well-trained and well-equippedpeace-keeping forces  ready to be deployed at shortnotice  may preclude successful action. Failure to achievethe proper execution of Security Council decisions due tolack of troops undermines respect for the United Nations.We welcome the efforts made — by Canada andDenmark for example — to improve the United Nations9stand-by capacity. Sweden will contribute an internationalforce to achieve this objective.We have also learned that the Security Councilmandates for United Nations peace operations must bemore precisely formulated. Clear messages to the partiesconcerned are necessary. Unclear mandates may lead toambiguous perceptions of the United Nations role in aconflict.We have learned the need to strengthen the UnitedNations ability to command and control peace operations.We welcome the reinforcements of the Secretariat that havetaken place. Confusion occurs when troop-contributingcountries intervene in the field through direct contacts withtheir own contingents. An effective forum for consultationswith troop contributors could add to more effectivemanagement of peace operations. Such a forum should beestablished under the Security Council  preferably inaccordance with Article 29 of the United Nations Charter.We have also learned that coordination of diplomatic humanitarian and military efforts must be improved. Thosewho are to do the work in the field — humanitarianorganizations and potential troop-contributing countries —should participate at an early stage in discussions on theimplementation of mandates for complex United Nationspeace operations. In this context  I would like to underlinethe importance of the United Nations Department ofHumanitarian Affairs.Further  we have learned the need to involvenon-governmental organizations in such humanitarianoperations. We have learned the value of comprehensiveUnited Nations efforts in which humanitarian assistance peacemaking  peace-keeping and long-term peace-buildingare carried out simultaneously  thus mutually reinforcingeach other.We have learned that monitoring respect for humanrights can build confidence  thus allaying fears andpreventing the use of force.We have learned the vital importance of regionalorganizations for peace and security  as foreseen in ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter. The Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is alreadyplaying a prominent role in conflict management in Europe.In other parts of the world — in Africa  Asia and theAmericas — regional and subregional organizations are ina position to fulfil similar tasks  if necessary with thesupport of the United Nations.Military operations should be based on decisionstaken by the United Nations  the OSCE or correspondingorganizations in other regions. Other regionalarrangements may have a role in organizing and executingsuch operations  but the bodies I have just mentionedshould assume overall political and strategicresponsibility.As we approach the twenty-first century  the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations offers an opportunity toestablish a solid basis for improved global cooperation.Sweden welcomes the reform process now under way inthe United Nations. To embrace multilateralism we mustall rise above short-sighted interests and focus on what isbest for global cooperation. We need political leadershipfrom Governments if we are to make progress.Adapting the United Nations to the demands of thenew era will involve hard work and difficult negotiations.We must not miss the opportunity provided by thisanniversary. We need speedy progress. A clear timetableand a comprehensive framework are required fornecessary change.The Commission on Global Governance  under thechairmanship of Sir Shridath Ramphal and the PrimeMinister of Sweden  Ingvar Carlsson  offers severalproposals for a stronger  more efficient and moredemocratic United Nations. The Commission’s report isa valuable contribution and a source of inspiration forUnited Nations reform.In order to be effective and more representative  theSecurity Council requires enlargement. We wouldwelcome Germany and Japan as permanent members. Atthe same time  the need for geographical balance must bemet. We want a more transparent Security Council. Wewant a composition and a decision-making process whichprevent the division of the world into spheres of interest.The reform of the Security Council should be reviewedafter 15 to 20 years with a view to maintaining itslegitimacy and to achieving optimum flexibility.We meet at a time when the financial situation ofthe United Nations is critical. Last Monday the NordicForeign Ministers  in a joint statement  highlighted thethreat to multilateralism caused by the present financialcrisis. Nowhere is the crisis in multilateralism seen moreclearly than in the unwillingness of some Member Statesto pay their assessed contributions to the United Nationsin full  without conditions and on time. It is unacceptablethat so far only one third of the Member States have paid10their regular-budget contributions for this year. Countriesconstantly demand more from the Organization  yet someof them are not willing to pay their membership fees. Theyapparently want others to foot the bill.Unilateral withholding of payment cannot be justified.Unilateral measures undermine multilateralism  particularlywhen taken by the single most important contributor. It ishumiliating to see the Secretary-General spend time andenergy begging for funds when the world community isdemanding that the United Nations concentrate fully on thetasks which it was designed for.The United Nations needs revised scales of assessmentto better reflect Member States’ ability to pay. Togetherwith the United Kingdom  my Government has presentedconcrete proposals to address this problem.In the longer term  the resource base of the UnitedNations must be strengthened. The possibility of additionalsources of funding needs also to be considered.Poverty and social misery are the greatest long-termthreats to international peace and security. Some of thepoorest countries have been caught in vicious circles ofdebt management. The United Nations must be given astronger and better-defined role in the economic and socialfields.A clearer division of work is called for in developmentassistance. Better coordination  more distinct priorities andmore effective management by the United Nationsdevelopment agencies are required. The governing boardsof these agencies must be in a better position to play theirleading role in the implementation of developmentassistance. Furthermore  we need improved forms offinancing  with a higher proportion of assistance levied andnegotiated in advance. More long-term planning ofassistance is required  and the flow of funds must becomemore predictable.Sweden continues to be one of the largest voluntarycontributors to United Nations economic and socialactivities. We expect other donor countries to assume theirresponsibilities to the same degree. As regards totaldevelopment assistance  it must be possible for most donorcountries to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per centof gross national product.The United Nations is contemporary with the atomicbomb. Today we no longer accept living under a nuclearthreat. The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was an importantstep in the right direction. We urge those few Stateswhich have not yet acceded to the NPT to do so withoutfurther delay  thus making it clear to the worldcommunity that they renounce the nuclear-weapon option.In May of this year the 180 States which haveacceded to the NPT confirmed that the ultimate goal is toabolish nuclear weapons. International bans on chemicaland biological weapons are already in place. It should bepossible  if there is political will  to achieve within 10 to15 years an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons  thusmaking this threat to human existence a brief interlude inour history.A comprehensive test-ban treaty must be achieved in1996  banning all nuclear tests for all time. In themeantime  we urge the nuclear-weapon States to refrainfrom all nuclear testing in order to ensure that faith in afuture free from fear of a nuclear holocaust can besustained.Every day  every hour  around the world anti-personnel mines indiscriminately maim innocentcivilians  many of them children. The ongoing Conferencein Vienna to review the 1980 weapons Convention shouldresult in a strongly and concretely reinforced regimeagainst anti-personnel mines. This is a fundamental  moraland humanitarian imperative  and it is one step on theroad to a total international ban on the use ofanti-personnel mines. Moreover  substantial resourcesneed to be invested in efficient mine clearance. Swedenis ready to contribute expertise and assist in thedevelopment of more advanced technology in this field.Furthermore  at the Vienna Conference  Sweden hasproposed an additional protocol on blinding weapons. Formore than a decade we have worked for explicitprohibition of blinding as a method of warfare. We nowhope that it will be universally accepted.Security is a broad concept in today’s world. Weknow that poverty  social injustice  environmentaldegradation  rapid population growth and massive refugeeflows create fear  disruption and conflicts.The major United Nations conferences onenvironment and development  human rights  population social issues  women and human settlement all involvedcrucial questions of survival. We welcome the outcome ofthese conferences  the most recent of which was theFourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing. We11need to address both the root causes and the consequencesof social injustice. Sustainable social and economicdevelopment can be achieved only with the fullparticipation of women.To Sweden  multilateral cooperation is the mostimportant instrument for mastering the crucial issues ofsurvival. For this reason  we will continue to be an activeMember of the United Nations. For this reason  we believewholeheartedly that multilateralism is not only a matter ofsolidarity  but  indeed  a question of enlightened self-interest.As an expression of our strong commitment to theUnited Nations and to international peace and security Sweden is a candidate for a seat on the Security Council in1997-98. Our candidacy is a matter of highest priority forthe Swedish Government and the Swedish people. It hasbeen launched with the full support of the other four Nordiccountries. As a member of the Council  we will make aconstructive contribution to its work. Our dedication will beconsistent with our record as a United Nations Member.Our support for United Nations ideals and activities isconcrete  substantial and unwavering."
"151",6579,"SWZ",50,1995,"I bring with me the warmestgreetings and good wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III Her Majesty the Indlovukazi  the Government and thepeople of the Kingdom of Swaziland  to all our friends andfellow Members of the United Nations.Swaziland extends its congratulations to Mr. Freitas doAmaral on his election to the presidency of this historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly  and commends hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  for hisleadership and direction as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session. The Kingdom ofSwaziland would also like to take this opportunity toexpress its deep appreciation to our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his relentlessefforts in directing the affairs of our vast Organization  andwhose skill and diplomacy have contributed so much to ourachievements over the past twelve months.Each year since 1945 the General Assembly hasprovided us with a chance to reflect on our achievements as well as on our failures over the preceding twelvemonths; the goals we have met and others which  for avariety reasons  have been missed. This process of self-assessment is an essential element of any organization;and for the United Nations there is a special significanceto our deliberations this year as we mark fifty years of itsexistence.Perhaps the most important development of the lastfive decades has been the emergence of a new worldorder  in both political and economic terms  brought aboutby the transformation of many parts of the world throughnew-found freedom and independence from both colonialdomination and oppressive ideologies.Hopes continue to be raised that this new worldorder would result in a strengthened commitment toachieve common development objectives on a truly globalbasis. Never before have the nations of the world beengiven this opportunity to work together  with collectiveresponsibility  towards achieving real global security —social  economic and political — for all our peoples.There have undoubtedly been many encouragingsigns that we are taking our responsibilities towards oneanother seriously  but we remain a long way behind inrealizing the ambitions of those ideals on which theUnited Nations was established.The foundations of our Organization were built on theruins of a world torn apart by war. ""Never again"" was thecry of all mankind  and our structures and principles werefocused on the equal development of all nations  and on theprevention of the occurrences of such destruction everagain.And yet  with all the commitment and promises  itseems that only very recently have we seen any progresstowards global peace in this century. Certainly  the end ofthe cold war did not bring the world-wide stabilityenvisaged by all of us at that time. Events such as the GulfWar  the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia and the genocidein Rwanda have shaken our belief that human beings couldever live peacefully  side by side  with one another.Recent developments have shown  however  that thereis a new mood abroad — one that is based on a spirit ofreconciliation and a desire for peace that gives us all reasonfor hope that real progress towards lasting global stabilitymay be possible after all. Swaziland recognizes the role ofthe United Nations in bringing about this new climate ofpromise  and our Organization deserves great credit in itscontinuing commitment to this noble aim.The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the rest of theresponsible world in welcoming the recent signing of theagreement with a view to the extension of autonomy to thePalestinian people in the West Bank. This latest agreementconfirms the commitment of the Israeli and Palestinianpeoples to a lasting settlement of the problem that has hunglike a dark cloud over the Middle East for so long. Wecongratulate all who have been involved in the processleading to the agreement  but most of all  we applaud thespirit of reconciliation of the leaders and both peoples andtheir commitment to peace. We appeal to all in the MiddleEast region to embrace the same spirit so that futuregenerations will never have to experience the instability anduncertainty of the past.There are encouraging signs  too  evident in recentdevelopments with regard to the situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina. Last month the world witnessed the first stepstowards the prospect of a settlement in the Balkans. TheKingdom of Swaziland prays that the momentum willcontinue until a solution may be found that is acceptable toall in that troubled area. Swaziland welcomes the recentinitiative leading to the signing of an agreement inWashington and agrees that the first priority  now  must beto ensure a lasting cease-fire and to create an atmospherein which the people who have suffered so much in recentyears may at last begin to bring some order into theirbroken lives.The past twelve months have seen major andwelcome progress in a number of troubled areas on ourown continent of Africa  while other regrettable situationshave surfaced to threaten the stability of the continent asa whole.Clearly  the commitment of all African countries tothe establishment by the Organization of African Unity ofa mechanism for the prevention  management andresolution of conflicts is central to Africa’s efforts inaccepting responsibility for its own problems. Swazilandstrongly supports this initiative and joins its brotherAfrican States in calling for the support of the UnitedNations in this important enterprise.Swaziland has been especially heartened by thedevelopments towards a lasting settlement in Angola engineered to a large degree by the efforts of our UnitedNations Special Envoy. The signing of the Lusaka peaceaccord has brought real hope that the two sides to theconflict are now committed to peace and that the Angolanpeople will now be given the chance to make a new startin a country that has the potential to play such a vital rolein the development of the subregion as a whole. TheKingdom of Swaziland stands ready to support and toencourage the development of Angola and its people.Swaziland commends the efforts made by theinternational community and the neighbouring countriesof Rwanda and Burundi in bringing about an atmosphereof relative calm to the two countries after a time of greatsuffering and hardship.Of particular note has been the role of thosecountries playing host to so many refugees from theconflicts in the area. Swaziland knows full well — andwith recent firsthand experience — the problemsassociated with such a task. It is an obligation to one’sfellow human beings to offer refuge in times of conflict but however willing a country may be to welcomerefugees from conflict and strife  the strain on the hostcountry’s resources may be too great for them to copewith alone  and outside help is absolutely critical. Therole of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees is essential in this regard  and we commend thework of that Office wherever it is needed.In the course of the 50 years of its operation  ourOrganization has learnt many valuable lessons  including2the realization that we must adapt to changingcircumstances and to the varying needs of all our Members.The challenges facing us have grown and spread into areason a scale perhaps not imagined by our founders —challenges such as international security and peace-keeping the promotion of justice and democracy  and the fightagainst economic and social inequalities among theMembers of our family of nations.And as the roles of the United Nations expand anddevelop  so should our capacity to undertake them. Reformand adaptability are the key imperatives for us as weapproach the new millennium  and in this spirit  wewelcome the new agendas for peace and developmentwhich have been initiated under the guidance of ourSecretary-General.These initiatives  which are at the heart of what we aretrying to achieve here  create particular obligations for allour Members and for the Organization itself: we all have aresponsibility to demonstrate real commitment towards theprinciples we all have accepted. Thus  our calls forextended United Nations peace-keeping must be supportedby full and timely contributions to the relevant budget byall countries  and by a commitment to global peace  whichhas clearly been lacking in many areas of the world.This commitment embraces the issue that has posedpossibly the greatest threat to global security in the secondhalf of this century: that of containing the spread of nuclearweapons and  ultimately  achieving a nuclear-weapon-freeworld.In this context  Swaziland enthusiastically supported earlier this year  the application to extend indefinitely theTreaty on nuclear non-proliferation  and we look forward toa successful conclusion to the negotiations on acomprehensive test-ban treaty.Swaziland is confident that the Secretariat of theUnited Nations  under the wise and able leadership of HisExcellency the Secretary-General  is all too aware of itsown responsibilities to adapt and reform elements of theOrganization’s structures  in line with the wishes of itsMembers and with regard to achieving efficiency adaptability and full representation of the global communityin order to meet its requirements.Certainly  we all must feel represented in the keydecision-making bodies of the Organization  and Swazilandtherefore supports the proposals aimed  in the first place  atmaking the Security Council a more credible body byintroducing wider representation among the permanentmembers.The principle of full representation within the UnitedNations is an extension of the founding principle ofuniversality — to ensure  as much as possible  that allpeoples of the world feel that they are represented in theone truly global Organization with the resources andinfluence to effect developments for the good of mankind.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to have astrong and happy partnership with a country whose peoplebelieve that they are denied the opportunity to make theircontribution to the rest of the world through the agenciesof our Organization  and who maintain that they areexcluded from the processes of internationaldecision-making  to which they have a right to contribute.The Republic of China and its 21 million people haveshown themselves to be committed to global peace anddevelopment  and ready to share with the rest of theworld their knowledge  expertise and resources.In the fiftieth year of the existence of UnitedNations  and as we celebrate the historic signing of ourCharter  it is surely fitting that we live up to ourfounders’ belief that the credibility of our Organization isdependent on the principle that all mankind is representedhere. The declaration by a people that it believes itself tobe denied representation is surely incentive enough for usto at least consider the case  whatever the outcome. TheRepublic of China  as one of the original signatories believes that its appeal deserves to be heard. Swazilandtherefore encourages the growing support for theestablishment of an ad hoc committee to look into theissue of the renewal of membership of the United Nationsfor the Republic of China.The Kingdom of Swaziland has welcomed the far-sighted Agenda for Development  including the Africa-specific development initiatives for the 1990s  whichcontain the Organization’s operational priorities in thearea of economic and social development  and aims toensure sustainable growth for our economies. As weapproach the mid-term review of the continent’sdevelopment plan  it is clear that we still lag far behindthe other regions of the world in terms of achieving ourdevelopment targets.Swaziland has been conscientious in attending therecent round of important United Nations summitconferences  which have focused on key social andeconomic development issues  including those on the3environment and development  on population anddevelopment  and this year’s social summit and Conferenceon Women. In each case  we have committed ourselves tothe plans of action and are doing our best to implement therecommendations.A side effect of these meetings was that once againthey highlighted our continent’s limitations. While thecountries of Africa recognize our responsibilities to ourown people  it is clear that our resources  technicalknowledge and all-round expertise do not yet allow us toprogress as fast as we would like. Undoubtedly  we willcontinue to require the support and understanding of thedeveloped world if we are ever to rid ourselves ofdependency on outside assistance  and  certainly  the UnitedNations has a major role to play in the process.The Kingdom of Swaziland has not been standing stillin its own efforts to promote economic measures aimed atimproving the living standards of its people. As is ourcustom  we have consulted directly with the entire nation togive the Swazi people themselves the opportunity todetermine priorities for their economic and socialdevelopment. The focus of our people’s concerns has beenon much of what has been discussed at the recent UnitedNations conferences  and there is a direct parallel betweenthe recommendations of the various Summits and those ofour own consultation process. The value of this nationalexercise  in a United Nations context  is that it confirmssupport for what the Organization is doing at the level ofthose who matter most.Included among the issues raised in our nationaleconomic exercise were concern over the continuingdrought and the realization that any plans we may have toimprove our economic performance will still depend to alarge extent on the inconsistencies of nature  unless we canoffset the effects of poor rainfall by large capital projectsto harness our water resources.An increase in cross-border illegal traffic in drugs andweapons continues to present a threat to our socio-economicstability  and as a sign of our commitment to overcome thisgrowing danger the Kingdom of Swaziland and theRepublic of South Africa recently signed a joint agreementto work together to combat cross-border crime. It is clear however  that what is needed is international support toovercome what is certainly an international menace.The Swazi nation has confirmed the importance ofincreasing environmental awareness amongst our people and the need to protect our natural heritage is recognized asa priority target. Land usage and agriculturaldiversification are important elements of this vital issueand we will need to acquire technical support to achieveimprovement.Another key element of the nation’s concerns iscentred on the role of women. Swazi women areidentified as the backbone of the economy and it has beenrecommended that steps be taken to bring the legal rightsof our women onto an equal basis with those of our men.Once more  the traditions and culture of ourKingdom have been reaffirmed as the main contributingcause of our stability and peace. Our national identity isimportant to us — it is  after all  what makes usunique — and Swaziland feels strongly that there shouldbe recognition of and respect for each country’sdistinctiveness in the way we each approach an issue andin the solutions we find to our own problems.As the world’s leaders gather here later this monthto reaffirm our collective commitment to our foundingCharter  let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signala new start for our Organization  a new beginning inwhich we will address the challenges to global securityand development with a fresh sense of equalresponsibility and duty and with new structures in placeto achieve our united goal of improving the world we livein for all our peoples. The Kingdom of Swazilandconfirms its own commitment to our founding Charterand declares its pride in the Organization in which thehopes of all mankind are placed. May God bless theseproceedings with the success they deserve."
"152",6654,"SYR",50,1995,"It is my pleasure at the outset to express mycongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral personally  and tohis friendly country  Portugal  upon his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. We are confident thathis experience  wisdom and statesmanship will contributeto the success of this session’s deliberations. May I assurehim of the cooperation of the Syrian delegation in achievingthe desired objectives. May I also extend the expressionof our thanks and appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Amara Essy  for his untiring efforts during hispresidency of the previous session.On this occasion  we should like to express ourappreciation to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations for his efforts to enhance the standing and role ofthe United Nations and to focus the internationalcommunity’s attention on the most outstanding issues ofour times.This session of the General Assembly has greatsignificance in the life of the United Nations  as itcoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding ofthis international Organization which remains notwithstanding any criticisms  an unequalled organizationin the history of international relations. It is the houseunder whose roof the representatives of all the world’sStates meet each year: friends and foes  adversaries andallies  on the basis of commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter  foremost amongwhich are: maintenance of international peace andsecurity; respect for the fundamental rights of men and ofStates  both small and large; affirmation of equality underthose rights; non-interference in the internal affairs ofStates  and standing up to aggression in accordance withthe principles of justice and international law.The problem facing the United Nations  in ourbelief  does not lie in the purposes and principles of theCharter  but rather in the decision-making mechanism inthe United Nations and in the selective manner ofimplementing those decisions. Furthermore  the gravefinancial crisis afflicting this international Organization isin fact but the reflection of a political crisis fundamentallycentred on the identity of the United Nations and its rolein the post-cold- war period. The question that arises inthis context is: does this international Organization trulyrepresent the aspirations of its Members’ peoples  asstated in the preamble of its Charter  namely  “We thepeoples of the United Nations”? Is it not surprising tohear even the State with the largest population and thelargest surface area complain  despite its permanentmembership in the Security Council  of interference in itsinternal affairs?Given such a situation  will it be feasible tointroduce meaningful democratic reforms of the UnitedNations structure that would be acceptable and agreeableto the Organization’s Member States  both large andsmall  rich and poor  of the North or of the South? Or is15it that the democracy of the majority by which nationaldecisions are taken is not valid for decision-making in theUnited Nations or in international relations?In any case  we do not live in an ideal world  even ifwe aspire after such a world. We are convinced that it isessential to promote constructive international dialogue andcooperation if we are to achieve the introduction of reformsthat  both in substance and in form  would realize theaspirations of Member States and address the issues andneeds of developing countries. Top of the list of thoseneeds is the alleviation of the developing countries’ debtburdens  encouraging investments in their economies opening markets to their products and lifting anyrestrictions on the transfer to them of sophisticated andnuclear technologies for peaceful purposes.Over and above all this  what the developing countriesneed is that their political  humanitarian and cultural issuesshould be dealt with by dialogue on a basis of mutualrespect and non-interference in their internal affairs. Thatindeed would be the most appropriate and correct means oflaying the foundations of an international cooperation witha human face  which would guarantee the interests of alland  thereby  lead to a more secure  stable and prosperousworld.The changes which the world has been witnessing inthe international area since the beginning of the 1990s  nomatter how tremendous their impact and their results couldbe  will never alter the fundamental principles and valuesthat humanity has struggled to attain and adhere to since thedawn of history. Right cannot be turned around overnightto become wrong  just exactly as equality cannot be turnedaround to become hegemony  racism cannot be made avirtue and the occupation of the land of others by forcecannot be legitimized.We live in a region which is the birthplace of the threerevealed religions and of human civilizations. Our roots inthe region go very deep. We read  hear and  indeed  feelhow Israel attempts to falsify the history and geography ofthis region as well as the achievements of its peoples. Wesee how it attempts to mislead public opinion into theconviction that its democracy and its laws shall determinethe fate of the occupied Arab territories  and not theprinciples of international law and the resolutions of theUnited Nations. Those resolutions consider as null and voidIsrael’s annexation of Al-Quds and the application of itslaws to the Golan  and require Israel to withdraw from allthe occupied Arab territories in order for a just andcomprehensive peace to be achieved in the region.The fact that Israel does not heed the resolutions ofthe United Nations  regardless of the negotiations thathave been going on for four years  is an act of defiancenot only vis-à-vis the Arabs  but also of the entireinternational community and  especially  of the SecurityCouncil and its relevant resolutions.The latest developments in the peace process haveshown that Israel’s rulers are not interested in seeking agenuine  just and comprehensive peace that would put anend to strife  occupation and colonial settlement andguarantee security and stability to all. Their main concernhas been to extract from those who negotiate with themsignatures on hundreds of pages and maps which shacklethe Palestinian people  after all the great sacrifices it hasmade  and thrust that people on an endless road of lossand agony  not on any road that would lead to liberationand independence.In our view  agreements of this type  which will leadto yet another endless series of negotiations andagreements  will never pass the test of the final solution simply because each and every one of them carries withinit the seeds of tension and conflict.Since the Oslo agreement  Syria has made it clear from this rostrum  that it neither supports nor seeks toobstruct such agreements. Today  while we reiterate thisposition  we must point out that if such agreements areused to cause harm to Syria’s national and pan-Arabinterests and rights  we shall be compelled to reconsiderthat position.The American initiative  on the basis of which theMadrid Conference was convened  asserted that its aimwas to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in theMiddle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land forpeace. Furthermore  among the guarantees given to Syriaby the United States of America was that the UnitedStates would not agree to the annexation by Israel of onesingle inch of the Golan territory occupied in 1967. It wason that basis that Syria opened the door of peace in theMadrid Conference. Syria will continue to hold fast tothese foundations  which in substance signify a continuingAmerican commitment to Syria’s fundamental rights andinterests. The force of this American commitment is notaltered by the deviation by some Arab parties from theMadrid formula  whose staunchest advocate ought to bethe United States  a sponsor of the Conference.16Contrary to Israel’s claims  the Madrid formula andthe American initiative did not call for secret negotiationsand did not provide for a specified level of negotiators. Hadit been otherwise  there would have been no needwhatsoever to hold the Madrid Conference. Syria and theArab States expect the United States  as a sponsor of thepeace process  to fulfil its commitments towards Syria andLebanon and to seek to eliminate the obstacles that Israelcontinues to put on the road to a just and comprehensivepeace in the region that would lead to Israel’s completewithdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 andalso from Southern Lebanon  in implementation of SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).Syria reaffirms its commitment to peace on the basisof the foundations which launched the peace process and onno other bases or other formulae  whose only aim would beto satisfy Israel’s arrogance and entrench its hegemony andnot to bring to the peoples of the region the security stability and dignity after which they aspire.Israel can fool some people some of the time  but itcannot fool all people all the time. The negotiationsbetween Syria and Israel over the past four years haveshown that Israel wishes to negotiate only for the purposeof equivocating and backpedalling from the requirements ofpeace or for the purpose of using the negotiations as ameans of imposing its conditions  which contradict theletter and spirit of the relevant Security Council resolutions.This is the real reason why the negotiations on the Syriantrack have faltered.In any case  a false peace will never find its way intoany Syrian home  regardless of the challenges and theobstacles created by Israel. All our Syrian citizens knowthat Arabs  Muslims and all peoples who put their faith injustice and peace stand steadfastly by Syria and its leaderin the battle for a just and comprehensive peace  a genuinepeace that the people can embrace with dignity.Armed conflicts and devastating wars continue to ragein various parts of the world. Those conflicts which inflictgreat human and material losses on the peoples of theStates they afflict have begun to cast lengthening darkshadows on regional and world peace and stability.The indescribable suffering of the people of Bosniaand Herzegovina makes it necessary for the internationalcommunity to intensify efforts to achieve a just settlementthat would guarantee the unity and territorial integrity of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and safeguard thesecurity and stability of the Balkan region.Syria reaffirms its attachment to safeguarding theunity of the territory and people of Iraq and its rejectionof any attempt at dividing Iraq or at interfering in itsinternal affairs. Syria believes that a speedyimplementation by the Iraqi Government of the remainingSecurity Council resolutions  side by side with resolvingthe issue of Kuwaiti prisoners  would facilitate workingfor lifting the embargo and mitigating the suffering of thebrotherly Iraqi people.Syria calls also for responding to the initiative of theLeague of Arab States regarding the Lockerbie crisis.This initiative would lead to a solution to the crisis andthereby put an end to the embargo imposed on brotherlyLibya.Syria hopes that a peaceful solution will be reachedto the three-island crisis between the United ArabEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran  through directdialogue  in the interests of cooperation and good-neighbourliness between the two countries. Settlement ofthe issue will guarantee the rights of both parties anduphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of theStates of the region.Syria calls on all the warring factions in Somalia toend the infighting and to overcome their differences in theinterests of national reconciliation  which is indispensablefor restoring security and stability to that country and forstimulating efforts to reconstruct the country and restoreits Arab and international role.My country  Syria  had the honour of participatingin the founding of this international Organization  whosefiftieth anniversary is now being celebrated. While thepages of history mention other organizations which didnot rise to the expectations of the world’s peoples  thesurvival of our organization for the past five decades istestimony to the loftiness of the purposes and principlesof its Charter. Despite the conflicts and challenges facedby today’s world  we look to the future with optimism.History does not march backwards and every stage ofdevelopment and change cannot but be better than the onebefore. Wars that have flared up in more than one part ofthe world cannot but recede gradually  then peter out andexist no more.This is our hope. Peace which is not achieved todaywill dawn tomorrow. This is what we shall try to achieve17looking forward to a better life of justice and humanenessin that it will be built on cooperation between our nationsin the political  economic and cultural fields  in the interestsof all mankind.Let us hope that the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations will be a bright beacon ofchange in the history of mankind."
"153",6699,"TCD",50,1995,"Halfa century ago the representatives of some 50 nations met inSan Francisco  in the United States  to create a new worldorder for the post-war period. The founding fathers soughtto define rules and conduct enabling the countries of thewhole world to live free and safe from the scourge of war.They gave the United Nations certain purposes that were asnoble as they were ambitious  such as  to mention only afew  the maintenance of international peace and security;the promotion of progress and international development;respect for human rights and the rights of peoples; andinternational cooperation.While we rightly rejoice at the results obtained insome of these areas  we must note that in others  concernpersists regarding the many internal conflicts and economicand social crises that confront some of our States.It was in an atmosphere of hope  but also uncertainty that His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral waselected to guide the work of this session which mustaddress the aspirations for peace and well-being of ourpeoples. My delegation is happy at his election and warmlycongratulates him  convinced that his intellectual qualitiesand diplomatic skills will ensure success in ourdeliberations. We assure the President of our fullcooperation.I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  ForeignMinister of Côte d’Ivoire  who skilfully guided theproceedings of our previous session.I should like to reiterate our deep gratitude to HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who since hiselection as the head of our Organization has resolutelysought to find solutions to our world’s many problems.Our Organization has succeeded in sparing humanitya third world war  but areas of concern remain. Beforeaddressing them  I should like to briefly describe thesituation in my country  and particularly the efforts thatmy Government has made to solve both political and associo-economic problems.At the last session the Chadian delegation describedto the Assembly the progress that we had made towardsthe democratization of political life. Today I can reportthat this has become a tangible reality. We have putmachinery and structures in place to enable the Chadianpeople freely and openly to choose their institutions andtheir leaders. I refer in particular to the IndependentNational Electoral Commission  responsible forsupervising and monitoring the preparation of electoralrolls and organizing the various elections; the SupremeCouncil for Communications  charged with guaranteeingequitable access to the media to political parties  civilsociety and individual citizens; and the ConstitutionalCourt  which is to settle electoral disputes  among otherthings. It is important to emphasize that all shades ofpolitical and social opinion are represented in thesebodies.The liberalization of political life can also be seen inthe existence of 53 recognized parties as well as a numberof civil associations and trade unions. Moreover  a draftconstitution agreed by all those involved in civil andpolitical life will soon be put to the vote in a referendum.I can state from this rostrum that the democratic processis under way and that Chad is merely awaiting the variousvotes to conclude it.The President of the Republic  General Idriss Déby stated at this year’s presentation of New Year’s greetingsfrom the Diplomatic Corps that he was determined to dohis utmost to ensure that the votes were transparent andtook place in the best possible conditions. Despite thissolemn commitment  some of those involved in politicallife  manipulated from abroad  are trying desperately tohoodwink national and international public opinion by16saying that the Government are responsible for delaying thevotes. We reiterate the commitment of the Head of Stateand invite all those who wish to do so  to come to Chadand observe the various election processes.I should like to extend our thanks to the UnitedNations  which has already given us technical assistance. Ialso take this opportunity to appeal to countries andinternational organizations to help us properly to organizethe elections.Because of the tumultuous history of my country peace and stability are constant concerns of myGovernment  which seeks only to make a reality of thelegitimate aspirations of the Chadian people to economicand social well-being.National reconciliation was rightly one of the mainrecommendations of the Sovereign National Conference  fortrust and harmony among the people of Chad must berebuilt. The establishment of a national reconciliationcommission and the proclamation of a general amnesty anda unilateral cease-fire throughout the country aredemonstrations of the avowed will of the Government toreunite Chadians. Some people in Chadian political lifeconsider that the final step in achieving this objective is toorganize a round table. The Government is in favour  aslong as the other participants are not limited to the armedopposition and as long as it does not threaten theachievements of the Sovereign National Conference  thedemocratic process  or the established timetable.Political freedom is truly beneficial only when it isbased on an economic situation from which all thepopulation gain. My country faces an economic andfinancial crisis due to external factors  aggravated bydesertification  an uncertain climate and the fact that it island-locked. My Government has taken a series of measuresto improve the financial situation  while strengthening itscontrol over debt servicing and trying to exert similarcontrol over the civil service and the army. These measureshave had satisfactory results and should be supported byour partners.While we are pleased that the cold war has ended there remain  as I said earlier  many matters causing greatconcern. The international community is confronting someproblems that negatively impact on the evolution of ourcountries and require collective thought.With regard to peace  since the last session the picturehas continued to be one of contrasts.In Angola  my Government is heartened by theprogress achieved since the Lusaka Accords  which haveopened up great prospects for the consolidation of peaceand the reconstruction of the country.Similarly  we welcome the signing in Washington on28 September of the agreement between the State ofIsrael and the Palestinian Authority. This is an importantmilestone on the path towards a just and lastingsettlement of the crisis  which has lasted far too long.My country also welcomed the agreements reachedby the Liberian factions on 19 August. With the settingup of the Council of State  we can hope that the six yearsof nightmare are now coming to an end for the people ofLiberia.Elsewhere  the situation is much less favourable.Burundi  Rwanda  Somalia and Sierra Leone are stillpowder kegs  experiencing loss of human life and massivedisplacements of populations.My country is also concerned about the situation inBosnia and Herzegovina  in the very heartland of Europe where the spiral of war seems to hold sway over the logicof peace. We encourage the patient and tireless efforts ofthe international community to settle this conflict  withrespect for the country’s sovereignty and territorialintegrity.We would make an urgent appeal to the variousprotagonists to demonstrate perspicacity and politicalcourage in order to put an end to these human tragedies.Foreseeable causes of conflict in most States arebehaviour and attitudes revealing a desire for hegemonythat threatens territorial integrity and harms good-neighbourly relations. We must appeal to leaders to showwisdom and refrain from such conduct; rather  theyshould work together in a spirit of solidarity and mutualassistance to implement joint development programmes.For its part  Chad fully supports the principle of thepeaceful settlement of all disputes. In this spirit  on thebasis of resolutions of the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity and the Organization of theIslamic Conference  we again appeal for the lifting of theembargo on the Libyan people  which has a negativeimpact on neighbouring countries.My country supports the efforts under way in ourOrganization in the field of peace-keeping operations 17particularly in the consolidation of peace in various parts ofthe world. Thus  it is making its modest contribution to theUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda.In the samespirit  Chad supports Argentina’s “White Helmets”initiative.Africa  for its part  took a decisive step byestablishing  in 1993  a mechanism for the prevention management and settlement of conflicts; it is alreadyoperational. We call for close cooperation between theUnited Nations and this mechanism under Chapter VIII ofthe Charter and for multifaceted support from the entireinternational community.As a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  my country welcomes its indefiniteextension. This is a major step  because  since theestablishment of the United Nations  the prevention of thedissemination of nuclear weapons has been one of themajor goals of Member States. Chad fully supports thenegotiations currently under way in the Conference onDisarmament for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.My country welcomed the Secretary-General’sconvening of an international meeting on mine clearancefrom 5 to 7 July 1995 at Geneva. We greatly appreciate thepositive reaction of the international community  which  byannouncing a contribution of more than $20 million demonstrated its determination to struggle against thisinvisible  pernicious and constant menace.Chad  a large part — about one third — of whoseterritory is infested with mines of all types  supports theSecretary-General’s statement that  by damaging localcommunities  by contributing to emptying vast territories oftheir population and by preventing the return of refugees mines are obstacles to economic and social development.Hence  we appeal to the international community to helpmy country rid itself of these death machines.The unbearable pictures of thousands of mutilatedmen  women and children throughout the world cry out tous. That is why my country stands ready to support anymeasure that would lead to the total prohibition of theproduction and sale of such weapons.Peace and development are the major objectives of ourOrganization. So far as economic and social developmentis concerned  in recent years many summits andconferences have been held with the goal of improving theliving standards of peoples. But the results have not met theexpectations. In fact  as the Human Development Report1995 states “More than three-fourths of the world’s people livein developing countries  but they enjoy only16 per cent of the world’s income.” (HumanDevelopment Report 1995  p. 14)Africa  where the majority of the least developedcountries are located  is in a most precarious situation.The continual decline in export income condemns Africato such an increase in the servicing of its debt that anydevelopment activity is futile.What can one say about structural adjustment andeconomic liberalization measures  which frequently havea negative impact on the most vulnerable segments of oursociety? Most of the initiatives to promote thedevelopment of Africa in the 1990s have not brought thehoped-for results.We venture to hope that the Agenda forDevelopment  as a prop for the Agenda for Peace  willfoster a genuine spirit of solidarity and partnership in theinternational community.We believe that  50 years after its creation  anddespite the outstanding results it has achieved in someareas  the United Nations must continue to change inorder to meet new and increasingly complex challenges.In this connection  we reiterate our support for theprocess of restructuring and revitalizing the UnitedNations in the economic  social and related areas. Weemphasize  however  that this necessary action must notlead to marginalization of the developing countries.Chad has already expressed its position on theexpansion of the Security Council  the organ with primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peaceand security. The principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation must be observed.In conclusion  I should like to express the hope thatour deliberations will be fully successful and that thetwenty-first century will witness the beginning of agenuine rebirth of our international Organization  so thatit can work decisively towards the greatness of mankind.The meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.18"
"154",6745,"TGO",50,1995,"Fifty years ago  learning the lessons of two world wars which in the space of one human generation had broughtunspeakable suffering to mankind  people of good will dedicated to peace and justice and determined to preservefuture generations from such horrors  founded the UnitedNations. To ensure peace  justice and equality; to promotecollective security and peaceful coexistence; to encourageeconomic and social progress for nations and peoplesthrough international cooperation; to develop and promoterespect for the rights of man and of peoples  in greaterfreedom and without discrimination: these  inter alia  werethe main objectives of the founders of the United Nations.What lofty goals! And now the time has come whenwe have an opportunity to review what our commonOrganization has achieved. This is a difficult but upliftingtask  and the big question is whether the objectives havebeen attained.Before going any further  however  Sir  on behalf ofthe President of the Togolese Republic  His ExcellencyGeneral Gnassingbé Eyadema  and the Government andpeople of Togo  and on my own behalf  I extend ourwarmest congratulations on your magnificent election tothe important post of President of the General Assemblyat its fiftieth session. The community of the UnitedNations  in unanimously choosing you to lead our workat this historic session  pays tribute to you and to yourqualities as an experienced diplomat and also pays a well-deserved tribute to your beautiful country  Portugal  withwhich Togo is proud of having excellent and fruitfulrelations of friendship and cooperation.We also congratulate the other members of theGeneral Committee. In our view  their experience andyour mastery of international affairs augur well for thesuccess of our work. We assure you of the fullcooperation of the Togolese delegation to that end.I should also like to extend the TogoleseGovernment’s greatest appreciation to your distinguishedpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister forForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire  who presided so adroitlyand competently over the work of the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly. This honour done to his countryand also to Africa is particularly encouraging. I shouldlike to say once again how sincerely we admire him.I am also pleased to extend our warmestcongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for histireless and unending efforts to ensure that the UnitedNations continues to flourish and to preserve peace andsecurity in the world.This session is an event in itself  coinciding as itdoes with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations. A half century haspassed  and the various events that have marked the lifeof the Organization have altered neither the purposes northe principles of its Charter  which must preserve all itsvitality and continue to be the legal and moral basis forpresent-day international relations.My delegation would like to pay a tribute to allthose whose imagination  creative spirit and intelligenceled to the drafting of the provisions of the 111 Articles ofthe Charter. Their knowledge and ability helped topreserve the world from a third world war  which  in thisage of increasingly devastating nuclear weapons  wouldhave been fatal to the entire world  including the ownersof the weapons.14In its daily search to ensure the wellbeing of peoples the Organization has adopted and implemented strategies torespond to world concerns. In this connection  the Agendafor Peace and the forthcoming Agenda for Developmentbear witness to the United Nations resolve to realize itsnoble ideals.My delegation believes that the fiftieth session shouldgive serious consideration to the ways to work out the newapproaches that are needed if the Organization is to goforward on solid and increasingly coherent bases in itssearch for viable and lasting solutions to problems of peace security and development that pose a daily challenge to theinternational community. What is important at this sessionis the lessons we can learn from United Nations activitiesover the past 50 years that will help us to deal with theenormous challenges the third millennium will bring us.The aspirations of peoples to participate even moreactively in the management of world affairs is evident inevery country. My country  like so many others on theAfrican continent  has been buffeted by the winds offreedom and democracy. After more than three turbulentyears fraught with misunderstandings among our nationalpolitical figures concerning the stakes involved indemocratization  Togo has now completed its transitionalperiod towards democracy and the multiparty system. Thissession affords me an opportunity to say that Togo hasregained its stability and its customary peace and quiet andthat our Government is now actively working to strengthenthe bases for a State of law.Eager to promote national unity  the Togoleseauthorities are continuing to take all possible steps toestablish a climate of peace  fraternity and concord. At theirinitiative  on 14 December 1994 the National Assemblyadopted a law of general amnesty for those responsible forthe acts of aggression of 25 March 1993 and 5 and 6January 1994.Today  peace and order have been restored  for thepeople of Togo have been able to surmount their opposingviews and achieve reconciliation. They have understood thatdemocratization is a long-term undertaking  one that mustbe based on the historical  social and cultural realities of acountry if it is to be effective and promote politicalstability  economic development and social justice.Today  the collective effort to restore our nationaleconomy is continuing without interruption and all thepeople of Togo are determined to give of their best in therebuilding of what they hold most dear  their homelandTogo  in order to restore its reputation and ensure itsactive participation in the concert of nations.Given the still fragile nature of our economy  and inorder to ensure the strengthening of democracy  politicalstability and social unity  Togo calls upon theinternational community to give its strong support to theefforts our Government is undertaking to achieve thecountry’s total recovery.As I said earlier  the founding of the United Nationswas a response to the yearning of the peoples of theworld to live in peace  which is a prerequisite forprogress. Today  however  there is still a long road totravel in the attainment of that peace  the principal goalof the United Nations  for the world is still experiencinghorrible upheavals and intolerance that daily threaten thehope of our peoples to live in a peaceful and secureworld.Indeed  uncertainty  anxiety and despair still hauntthousands of people  principally because of continuingfratricidal conflicts and poverty. Rivalry amongneighbours  fanaticism and ethnic tensions continueinexorably to stoke the fires of discord and create armedconflicts  with all their accompanying horrors.In Africa  the conflicts in Liberia  Sierra Leone andSomalia and the situations in Rwanda  Burundi andAngola continue to present challenges to the internationalcommunity and to call into question its ability effectivelyto ensure international peace and security.With regard to the conflict in Liberia  which is nowbeing resolved  my country welcomes the signing of anew Agreement on 19 August 1995 in Abuja under theaegis of the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  and the installation of the State Council andTransitional Government pursuant to that Agreement.Togo calls upon its brothers in Liberia to shouldertheir responsibilities to ensure the sincere and fullimplementation of that Agreement. We urge them to doall they can to guarantee the cease-fire  support the newtransition institutions and contribute in good faith todisarmament with a view to establishing an environmentfavourable to the organization of the general openelections called for in the Agreement.While the international community is witnessing anascent improvement of the situation in Liberia  the warwaged in neighbouring Sierra Leone by the Revolutionary15United Front (RUF) is continuing  with all itsaccompanying misery.My delegation would remind our brothers in SierraLeone that experience continues to prove the weapons donot provide lasting solutions to any problem  no matterwhat.Turning to Somalia  my delegation deeply regrets thatno appreciable progress has been made since the lastsession. Unfortunately  we are forced to state that despitethe relative calm there  Somalia has become a countrywhere national reconciliation and the establishment of aGovernment based on broad consensus are still hypotheticalowing to fluctuating allegiances among the clans. Thatsituation continues to contribute to the eruption of violenceand hinders the advent of peace to that country.My Government therefore urgently appeals once againto our brothers in Somalia to enter into a true and solidprocess of national reconciliation  the sole way to ensureviable peace and establish a Somali State that theinternational community would regard as representative.In Rwanda  the situation following last year’smassacres is still disturbing owing to the insecurity andintolerance that make peace and stability fragile  jeopardizethe return of refugees and threaten to embroil the entiresubregion. Given the climate there it is imperative for theRwandese Government to persevere on the courageous pathof national reconciliation so that the country may regain itsunity and the political stability essential to itsreconstruction.The international community must also commit itselfto lending real assistance to Rwanda’s efforts to establishbetter conditions that will encourage the repatriation ofrefugees to their country of origin.In the neighbouring country of Burundi the no-war no-peace situation is still a matter of concern to mycountry. Those involved in Burundi’s political life mustrenounce all acts of violence of any kind and demonstratewisdom and mutual acceptance in seeking solutions to theproblems facing them.In the same spirit  my delegation urgently appeals toall the children of Burundi to adhere fully to the Agreementof Government signed on 10 September 1994 and to doeverything they can to implement that Agreement in theinterests of peace and the people of Burundi. We believethat they must also try to accept the initiatives of theCentral Conflict Prevention  Handling Management andSettlement Mechanism of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  which is attempting to organize a round-table meeting of the parties involved in the Burundi crisis.Here too  the international community must continueto support Burundi so as to enable it to find peace assoon as possible and to continue its development.Turning to the situation in Angola  the TogoleseGovernment welcomes the resumption of the dialoguebetween President José Eduardo Dos Santos and theleader of UNITA  Mr. Jonas Savimbi. We noted withgreat satisfaction the positive evolution of the peaceprocess under way as a result of the Lusaka peaceagreement. We welcome the two meetings that took placethis year  and we see in them the firm resolve of ourAngolan brothers to overcome their differences and setabout the irreversible creation of an atmosphere ofunderstanding which alone can foster peace and nationalharmony.My delegation greatly appreciates the active role thatthe United Nations continues to play in the resolution ofthat conflict  and we would call on the Secretary-Generalto speed up the deployment of the forces to be madeavailable to the United Nations Angola VerificationMission (UNAVEM III).In Europe  despite diplomatic efforts to find adefinitive settlement of the conflict in the formerYugoslavia  the situation there remains a source ofprofound concern to all peace-loving countries.My Government notes with regret that  in spite ofmany measures taken by the United Nations  the state ofwar in that part of Europe persists  continuing to claimcountless victims and give rise to flows of refugees anddisplaced persons. Togo believes that the internationalcommunity must become more deeply involved in orderto stem  if not halt  the tide of massive destructionadvancing before our eyes.In the view of my delegation  it is time for the Serb Croat and Bosniac leaders to give up the idea of acquiringterritory by force and to seek a definitive solution to theconflict through negotiations  with a view to ensuring anirreversible  comprehensive and just solution that wouldguarantee sovereignty and territorial integrity to all theStates of the former Yugoslavia within internationallyrecognized borders.16The recent positive developments in the Middle East marked essentially by the adoption of a timetable for thesecond phase of the withdrawal of Israeli troops fromPalestinian cities and the transfer of new powers to thePalestinian Authority  give my delegation grounds forsatisfaction. We regard these recently concluded agreementsas a great achievement  a decisive step towards theestablishment of a Palestinian State.Togo congratulates the Israeli Government and thePalestinian Authority for the courage  commitment andinitiative they have shown in implementing the Declarationof Principles and the subsequent agreements despite themany dangers that beset the path to peace. We urge themto continue the quest for a settlement of the question ofPalestine through negotiations  the path they have chosen since true and lasting peace unquestionably involvesdialogue.We would appeal to the good will of the internationalcommunity to live up to its commitments by providing thePalestinian Authority with the necessary economic andsocial assistance for the development of Gaza and Jericho.With regard to the Golan  my delegation would urgeIsrael and Syria to demonstrate far-sightedness  good willand mutual understanding so as to arrive as quickly aspossible at an agreement that could bring a just and lastingpeace to the Middle East region.Turning to Asia  Togo welcomes the establishment atvarious levels of dialogue aimed at peaceful coexistence and trusts that this political will be maintained.These various hotbeds of tension  which jeopardize theexistence of mankind and which my delegation has justbriefly described  are a challenge to our collectiveconscience and  first and foremost  to the United Nations the only world structure that can ensure universal peace andsecurity.On the eve of the second half of its first century  itbehoves our Organization to mobilize to combat the evilsafflicting the world and that make it vulnerable. That taskmust be one of our highest priorities if we want to leave tofuture generations a healthy world based on respect forhuman dignity  love and justice.To attain this prime objective  which is to preventconflicts from erupting or from continuing indefinitely prevention must increasingly feature in the forefront of themeasures taken by our Organization in favour of peace  forit is always better to prevent war than to try to end it.This justifies the great importance we attach to preventivediplomacy.My delegation believes that the various peace-keeping operations being conducted in countries riven byconflict must be accompanied and supported by theparallel and systematic establishment of mechanisms fora peaceful settlement. The measures provided for inChapter VI of the Charter must be increasingly employedto this end. “An Agenda for Peace” can achieve its fullimport only if the United Nations  in its quest for peace resorts to diplomatic procedures as a means of settlingdisputes.The objectives of peace and security that we seekmust necessarily also involve curbing the proliferation ofweapons of all kinds.General and complete disarmament is and has formany years been one of the main objectives of the UnitedNations  whose attainment would bring peace  stabilityand well-being for all. The energy with which we pursuethis goal must be maintained and  indeed  increased  if thehopes of mankind to avoid a new holocaust are to befulfilled.To that end  my delegation believes that we mustcontinue to encourage a tangible reduction in the nuclearthreat  the elimination of special fissile materials and theconversion of nuclear installations for solely peacefulpurposes.All these overarching tasks require the unconditionalsupport of all States  and particularly nuclear-weaponStates  so that we can use the resources made availablethrough disarmament for development.Convinced of the need to free our continent fromnuclear weapons  the African countries have concludedtheir consideration of the text of the Pelindaba treaty thatwould establish Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.This instrument  prepared pursuant to the relevantDeclaration of the Heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  will soon besigned in Egypt. My country welcomes this developmentas opening the way for the denuclearization of Africa  andcontributing to the international trend towards non-proliferation. My delegation sees in the recent indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and in the negotiations nowunder way in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva 17the resolve of the international community to achievenuclear non-proliferation and to eliminate other types ofweapons of mass destruction.With regard to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons in particular  Togo believes that itsindefinite extension is not an end in itself. We have to doeverything possible to ensure that it responds to theaspirations of all the parties.In general terms  Togo proclaims its deep commitmentto the various measures advocated by the United Nationsfor the control of conventional weapons at the regional andsubregional levels. We continue to support all initiativesthat can facilitate disarmament and arms limitation  for allthese measures can help to maintain international peace andsecurity.Within the context of the items relating todisarmament  my delegation would recall the urgent needto strengthen the capacity of the United Nations RegionalCentres for Peace and Disarmament. Designed to promotepeace and disarmament in various regions  these Centresneed financing to function and to carry out theirprogrammes of activities in order to attain the goals forwhich they were established.This is particularly true of the Centre for Africa which has its headquarters in my country. I would thereforeappeal to the good will of all Member States to support thisCentre by providing it with the help and assistance it needsto carry out its activities and to contribute to themaintenance and strengthening of the peace and securitywhich Africa so sorely needs to ensure its economic andsocial development.The Charter which we adopted in 1945 states in itsPreamble that the peoples of the United Nations aredetermined to promote social progress and better standardsof life in larger freedom. Fifty years later  we must assessthe impact of action taken along the way to resolve theenormous problems of development.It is clear that serious efforts are made every day toeliminate poverty  hunger  malnutrition  disease andilliteracy. And yet  despite the considerable input of theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies  we must notethat many peoples  particularly in the developing countries still live in a state of great deprivation and are exposed toall manner of scourges. In other words  the situation inthose countries is tragic: more than half a billion humanbeings live in abject poverty; more than 180 millionchildren suffer serious malnutrition; and more than 1.5billion individuals have no access to primary health care.All this  as can be imagined  leads to the death of almost3 million children every year.This bitter truth is the result of the injustice andinequality that characterize international cooperationrelations. In the absence of real understanding andsolidarity on the part of Member States  the poorestcontinue to suffer and the well-off grow ever moreopulent. Distortions in economic relations between Northand South do not reflect the spirit of our Charter. Fordecades now  the developing countries have called for theestablishment of a new  more just and equitableinternational economic order  but their concerns are nottaken duly into account.In this regard  it would not be overstating mattersto recall that the continued drop in our commodity prices;the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade; the problemsrelating to access for products from developing countriesin general  and African countries in particular  to worldmarkets; and the foreign debt burden are all obstacles thatmust be removed if we are to accelerate and strengthenthe process of sustainable development.It is important therefore that our partners in theindustrialized countries should try harder to understandour problems in order that they may be better able tosupport our efforts. This multifaceted support must seekto ensure remunerative prices for our commodities and thenecessary technological support for processing thesecommodities so as to ensure access for our products tointernational markets. To that end  the internationalcommunity must provide special assistance to Africa inorder to build viable  lasting and competitive industrialstructures.In this connection  my country would invite all thoseinvolved in development  and particularly industrializedcountries anxious about the future of Africa  to give newimpetus to the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization and the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development  two major agencies within the UnitedNations system established to promote industrializationand the development of trade of the developing countriesas a whole and particularly in Africa.At a time when the globalization and liberalizationof the world economy are accelerating as a result ofrecent agreements made at the Uruguay Round  we shouldcreate new opportunities for cooperation to help African18countries become part of the world trading system andbenefit from the advantages it offers for growth. The basicway to do so is to help Africa  through the appropriatetransfer of technology  to progress like other regions and torespond to new conditions governing access to markets inorder to become a real actor in the World TradeOrganization.The prospects for Africa’s development are notpromising because the socio-economic situation is soprecarious and efforts made to date to step up progresshave proven vain. Indeed  Africa is being crippled underthe enormous weight of its debt. In 1994  the debt burdenreached $313 billion and today represents 231.3 per cent ofits export earnings  or an average of 71.6 per cent of itsgross domestic product. Moreover  the continuing drop inofficial development assistance to African States has putAfrica in a very critical economic situation.Far from accepting this situation as our fated lot andaware that we must rely on our own efforts  this year theAfrican countries adopted  in Egypt  the Cairo Programmeof Action  which aims at ensuring the immediaterelaunching of Africa’s economic and social developmentthrough political and economic reforms and a global andcoherent strategy. My country is ready to assume its shareof the responsibility in the implementation of thatProgramme.On the crucial issue of debt  Togo would once againappeal to the international community and to the creditorsin particular to consider cancelling the concessional debtrescheduled in the Paris Club. We would urge the adoptionof innovative measures to reduce the multilateral debt including the repurchase of that category of debt with theproceeds of the sale of part of the International MonetaryFund’s gold reserves. In short  this question must beaddressed on an equitable basis with a view to a lastingsolution.Furthermore  giving new impetus to development inAfrica must include the mobilization of financial resourcesboth through official development assistance and throughprivate investment. In this regard  my delegation wouldinvite our partners in the developed countries to renew andstrengthen their political commitment to support therecovery of the African economy  for economic andfinancial stability in Africa will most certainly be in theinterests of the world economy.Togo duly appreciates the efforts of the UnitedNations and the international community over the past 50years to promote economic and socio-culturaldevelopment. In particular  we hail the initiatives that ledto the adoption of the United Nations Programme ofAction for African Economic Recovery and Developmentand the New Agenda for the Development of Africa inthe 1990s  as well as the Paris Declaration andProgramme of Action for the Least-Developed Countriesfor the 1990s.It is none the less regrettable that the implementationof these instruments  which were able to take into accountthe concerns of Africa in various areas of development has yet to receive the support it deserves for the benefitof our continent and the least-developed countries inparticular. Thus the economic and social performancewhich they should have sparked has not lived up to theexpectations of the peoples of Africa.In view of the present state of development inAfrica  the international community must make asubstantial contribution towards attaining the objectivesset forth  not only of the New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s  but also of otherprogrammes of action. Africa needs to be given specificattention commensurate with its problems  first amongwhich is poverty. Indeed  according to data collected bythe United Nations Economic Commission for Africa  thenumber of the most needy rose from 105 million in 1985to 216 million in 1990 and may reach 304 million by theyear 2000.The collective security to which all peoples aspirealso depends on finding determined and credible solutionsto the question of poverty  to which a great portion of theworld is subject. Along the same lines  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions must do more to ensure that structuraladjustment programmes are politically  socially andhumanly feasible for those countries which mustimplement them. My delegation concurs with theproposals for reform of the international financial andmonetary system with a view to adapting them to theneeds of our day  to make it more equitable and to allowit to respond to the true aspirations of peoples.In its search for appropriate solutions to economicaland social problems  the United Nations was promptedthis year to organize the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen. My country welcomed theholding of that Summit  the first in the annals of ourOrganization to offer such a marvellous opportunity fordeep reflection at the highest level on the issues of humanand social development that are of major importance for19mankind. My delegation welcomes the 10-pointcommitments adopted at the Summit and hopes that inimplementing those commitments for the benefit of theentire world all our countries will show the fervour that ledthem to prepare and participate in the Summit.The Fourth World Conference on Women  held just afew days ago in Beijing  is another illustration of ourOrganization’s determination not to neglect any of theobjectives it has set for itself. The Togolese Government which values women’s active role in the developmentprocess and accords them rightful pride of place in humansociety  will spare no effort to implement therecommendations emanating from that Conference. We urgethe international community to shoulder its share ofresponsibility in the implementation of thoserecommendations so that women can fully play their role inbuilding a peaceful and prosperous world.With regard to the question of the environment  mydelegation welcomes the signing in Paris  in October 1994 of the international Convention on combating drought anddesertification  and we welcome most especially the entryinto force of the Convention on Biological Diversity andthe Convention on Climate Change. However  we do notbelieve that the signing and entry into force of thoseConventions are an end in themselves. In the light of theuniversal concern of a few years ago over the extensivedegradation of the environment and the enthusiasm arousedby the Rio Conference  our countries must take thenecessary measures to attain the objectives set forth inthose various international legal instruments.This coming 24 October the United Nations will becommemorating its fiftieth anniversary. It has at times beendifficult to put into effect the purposes and principles of theSan Francisco Charter  and the results achieved have notalways lived fully up to our expectations. But with thebeginning of this new phase  one could hope that — on thebasis of lessons learned by evaluating the activities of thepast half-century and on the basis of Member States’capacity to adapt to the ever-shifting realities of theinternational context — our Organization will truly live upto its new ambitions.As it is about to enter the second half of its first 100years  the United Nations must preserve its universality andconsolidate its vitality  through prudent reform andappropriate strengthening of its entire system and itsprincipal organs  including the Security Council  so thatjustice and equality may triumph.The enormous tasks awaiting our Organization onthe eve of the third millennium require that MemberStates have greater political will so that the objective ofthe restructuring and democratization process now underway can be attained to the satisfaction of all  and so thatMember States can participate together  on the basis ofsovereign equality  in managing the affairs of the world.The same political will is needed in order fordevelopment assistance to regain priority status  so thatthe men  women and children of the countries of theSouth will enjoy the support that is essential for them toprosper.In doing all this  an inestimable contribution will bemade to the promotion of human rights and the right todevelopment  which is another way of averting threats todomestic  regional and global peace and security.As for my country  it renews its commitment to thenoble ideals of the United Nations  and  as always  it willdo its utmost to help build a world of peace and justicefor all."
"155",6790,"THA",50,1995,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Thailand  I should like to extendmy warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Freitasdo Amaral  upon his election to the presidency of thishistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly. I amconfident that under his leadership the work andachievements of this session will be as momentous as theoccasion we are celebrating.I should also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  Foreign Ministerof Côte d’Ivoire  President of the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly. My delegation truly appreciates hisleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavyresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year. Underhis guidance  the forty-ninth session not only set the stagefor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations but alsohelped to reinforce its foundation and crystallized its agendafor the years to come.As this is the first time that I have had the honour toaddress the General Assembly on behalf of my Governmentand the people of Thailand in my capacity as ForeignMinister  I should like to reiterate my Government’s fulland unflinching support for the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations and its all-encompassing work andendeavours. As a representative of a democratically electedGovernment  I am particularly pleased to note the increasedrole and involvement of the United Nations in promotingthe principles and practices of democracy. Thailandbelieves that  as a global organization  the United Nationshas an important role to play in advancing the concept ofdemocracy and enhancing its principles in world affairs as well as in the functions of the United Nations itself. Itis with this conviction  therefore  that I should like topledge Thailand’s fullest support for United Nationsundertakings in this field.During the past few years  much has been said onthe need to strengthen and revitalize the United Nationsfor the next 50 years  to prepare it for the challenges ofthe new century which will soon dawn upon us. Throughthe years  a number of useful proposals andrecommendations on ways to improve the structure working methods  efficiency and agenda of the UnitedNations have been made by numerous experts practitioners and enthusiasts  from both within and outsidethe United Nations system. Yet much remains to be doneif the United Nations is to be  in the words of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a“mission-driven and result-oriented” Organization.In this regard  Thailand believes that a number ofcrucial ingredients are necessary to effectuate a successfulreform of the United Nations system. Most important  thereform must be comprehensive and universal. The reformprocess should take place in all agencies within theUnited Nations system  encompassing all aspects of thework and activities of the United Nations. A special effortshould be made to coordinate all reform initiatives particularly in three main organs of the United Nations namely the General Assembly  the Security Council andthe Economic and Social Council. For this reason Thailand fully supports the General Assembly’s decisionearlier this month to establish a high-level open-endedworking group on the strengthening of the United Nationssystem in order to review and make observations onreform proposals attained from various sources.In line with this initiative  I should like to go a stepfurther and propose that  in addition to the high-levelopen-ended Working Group  a focal point could bedesignated to coordinate all reform initiatives in allUnited Nations bodies. However  such a focal point neednot supersede or subsume existing reform mechanisms such as the High-Level Open-ended Working Group onthe Financial Situation of the Organization  the ad hocopen-ended Working Group on an Agenda forDevelopment  and the Open-Ended Working Group on thereform of the Security Council. All these bodies should12coexist and coordinate with one another  and complementeach other’s work.Having been a United Nations Member since 1946 Thailand shares the aspirations of all its fellow Members tosee a more consolidated  cohesive and efficient UnitedNations system — one which would be able to fulfil thenoble purposes and principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations; to deal urgently and effectively with threats tointernational peace and security; to respond effectively tothe world’s economic  social and humanitarian needs; andto promote the goals of human security and sustainabledevelopment. Furthermore  Thailand is convinced that onemust also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-firstcentury is more equitable  representative  democratic transparent and accountable  allowing for the widestpossible participation in all its decision-making andactivities and serving the interests of all mankind.When speaking of these qualities  one is inclined toponder the work on the reform of the Security Council. Asthe main organ entrusted with the primary responsibility ofmaintaining international peace and security  the SecurityCouncil must be restructured in such a way that it will beable to perform its duties effectively  while also ensuring itslegitimacy and accountability. To achieve this goal  thereformed working methods and composition of the SecurityCouncil should allow for the widest participation byMember States  particularly those that are developingcountries  while at the same time giving due recognition toStates whose present world positions reflect the currentglobal shift in power and influence.However  to simply reform the Security Councilthrough its composition and working methods alone is notenough. If the Security Council is to be truly efficient andeffective  we also need to rethink the way in which weview the role of the Security Council. We need to be morerealistic in our expectations about what the Security Councilshould do and should be able to accomplish in a conflictsituation. In other words  it is about time we consideredlimiting the scope and depth of the peace-keeping activitiesof the United Nations to a level where its involvementwould be practical  meaningful and cost-effective.For this reason  my delegation welcomes the pointraised by His Excellency Professor Dr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral  President of the General Assembly at its fiftiethsession  on the need to re-examine the United Nationsgeneral policy on peace-keeping. My delegation alsowelcomes the efforts being made in the Fifth Committee toreform the process of approving peace-keeping budgets andappropriations  which would help improve themanagement of the United Nations financial resources.My delegation is convinced that it would make goodmanagerial sense for us to try to curtail the dramaticincrease in the expenses of United Nations peace-keepingand related operations  which  in 1995  have grown toover $3 billion and are currently contributing to theUnited Nations financial difficulty.It is one thing to discuss United Nations efforts inmaintaining international peace and security in financialand managerial terms and another to view them from thehuman perspective. The tribal  ethnic and religiousconflicts that are the source of the ongoing hostilities inplaces such as Bosnia and Herzegovina  Somalia Lebanon and Cyprus existed long before the end of thecold war  many of them even long before the UnitedNations came into existence. There is not much theUnited Nations can do as long as the peoples involvedhave no desire to coexist in peace. That is why Thailandfully supports the United Nations continuing work on theAgenda for Peace  initiated by the United NationsSecretary-General in 1992. In particular  Thailand believesthat the concepts of preventive diplomacy andconfidence-building  as espoused by the initiative  coulddo much to promote peace and understanding in allregions of the world.Along this line  Thailand and the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have  since 1971 initiated the concept of a Zone of Peace  Freedom andNeutrality in South-East Asia (ZOPFAN)  the Treaty ofAmity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia in 1976  and most notably  the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in1994  involving 18 States from the Asia-Pacific regionand the European Union. It is most gratifying that  aftertwo years of existence  the ARF has increasingly provedto be a useful instrument of peace and understanding andhas made significant contributions to efforts towardspreventive diplomacy and confidence-building in theAsia-Pacific region.During the past year  a number of importantdevelopments have taken place within the realm of theglobal economy. The establishment of the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  although still in its initial stage augurs well for the eventual realization of a transparent balanced and effective world trading regime. Continuedefforts should be made to integrate major tradingeconomies  as well as those in transition  into the WTOframework in order to more fully to globalize the normsand practices of free and fair trade.13Similarly  the conclusion of the Uruguay Roundagreements provided hope for a more equitable and openglobal trading system. It is essential that these agreementsbe implemented in full as soon as possible. It is essentialalso that States parties refrain from using unilateral andarbitrary measures  which would be contrary to the spiritand provisions of the agreements and obstruct the free flowof trade between States and regions. The sad reality is that in spite of the agreements  trading States  such as Thailand still suffer from unilateral and arbitrary measures in areassuch as agriculture  textiles and light-manufacture products.For this reason  Thailand believes that furtherdiscussions and negotiations on the acceleratedimplementation of the Uruguay Round commitments andrelated issues are still necessary. Efforts should also bemade to ensure that the outcome of these discussions andnegotiations would make it possible to strike a balancebetween the interests and concerns of developing countriesand that of their more developed counterparts. Thailandfurther believes that to this end  United Nations institutionssuch as the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) can play a major role inamalgamating  and giving expression to  the interests andconcerns of all involved  particularly those of thedeveloping  and least developed  members of the worldeconomy.Global trade agreements are not the only ones thatbring countries closer together. Another welcomedevelopment in the international economy is the closercooperation among regional and subregional economicgroupings. The linkages among these entities in variousparts of the world have  in effect  created a network ofinterdependence that has tremendous potential and wouldbenefit all concerned. However  continued care must beexercised to make certain that these groupings will not turninward and become mutually exclusive regional tradingblocs. Such a development would be detrimental to thespirit of multilateralism that has been fostered by this bodyfor the past 50 years and to the world’s trading system.While economic cooperation within a regional contextsuch as ASEAN has become commonplace  it is noteworthythat cooperative frameworks now span the divide of Northand South  East and West. Oceans are no longer aseparation. Efforts such as the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation (APEC) and the ASEAN-European Unionpromise to forge closer economic cooperation across theregions  regardless of geographical distance and boundaries.As these growing networks of cooperation extend theirreach across the globe and transoceanic trade multiplies geographical and economic distinctions becomeincreasingly irrelevant. The sharp dividing lines betweenthe rich and the poor  the Western and the Easternhemispheres  are indeed diminishing.Sustainable economic development must go hand inhand with sustainable human development. There can beno prosperity as long as people are denied their basicrights and the satisfaction of their needs. As a countrythat attaches high importance to the principles of socialequity  social welfare and human rights  Thailand fullysupports the United Nations efforts in areas such as thealleviation of poverty  education  health care and thecombating of drug abuse and trafficking. Drug trafficking in particular  has always received special attention fromThailand. Geographically located near the so-called“golden triangle”  Thailand has consistently supported  atboth the global and the regional level  international effortsaimed at the prevention  control and suppression ofnarcotic drugs. This support has been intensified in recentyears with the advent of the twentieth-century epidemicof Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).Thailand believes that like the drug problem  the disease with its devastating effects on mankind  is of globalconcern and should be dealt with jointly by theinternational community. In this context  my delegationwould like to voice its support for the United Nationsongoing work on initiatives relating to the Agenda forDevelopment  which would help us find more pragmaticapproaches to development and address theaforementioned economic  social and human securityissues in all their dimensions in a more effective andfruitful manner.In spite of the many achievements of the UnitedNations during the past 50 years  in the year 1995  westill find ourselves far away from what the authors of theUnited Nations Charter had hoped for and dreamed of in1945. Therefore  in this fiftieth anniversary year  it ismost appropriate that we  the peoples of the UnitedNations  rededicate ourselves to the realization of thehopes and dreams of the framers of the United NationsCharter  for our own sake and for the sake of ourchildren. Through the years  we have asked and takenmuch from the United Nations. We continue to do so withmuch greater intensity and in much greater multitude. Itis now time for us to reinvest in the United Nations. Wemust give back not only quantitatively but alsoqualitatively. Imperfect as it is  there is no substitute forthe United Nations.14The generation of the Second World War created theUnited Nations for us. They lit for us all a beacon of hope.It is now our responsibility to bequeath to our posterity abrighter beacon  a revitalized and strengthened UnitedNations which would withstand the test of time and help usovercome the challenges of the next century."
"156",6815,"TJK",50,1995,"First of all  let me express to His Excellency Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral my sincere congratulations on hiselection to the responsible post of President of the GeneralAssembly. There can be no doubt that his rich experience both in life and in diplomacy  will serve to enhance theproductive work of our anniversary session.Mr. Traoré (Mali)  Vice-President  took the Chair.Five decades ago  having achieved victory over theforces of evil in the Second World War  the internationalcommunity evinced the wisdom and political will to buildtogether the universal home of peace and common security:the United Nations. And perhaps the main result of the pastfew decades has been that  with the help of the UnitedNations  we managed to save the world from anotherworld war. All of us can be proud of that.Although the “big” war spared us  this in no waydiminished the increasing danger of small wars in theworld  which have caused intense suffering and misery.Economic and social development in the countries wherethese wars take place is set back for decades. Andalthough the civil war in Tajikistan is now behind us  itis still necessary to pursue the final settlement of the civilconflict.It was the dialogue initiated by the Government ofTajikistan  rather than violent confrontation  that began toyield tangible results. A significant role here was playedby international interaction and by joint efforts on theregional level.A perceptible acceleration in the process of dialogueresulted from the meetings between the President of theRepublic of Tajikistan  Mr. Imomali Rakhmonov  and theleadership of the armed opposition in Kabul and Tehran.This incontestably demonstrated our good will and oursincere aspiration for the early achievement of completestability and accord on Tajik soil.We are sincerely grateful to the leaders of theIslamic State of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic ofIran for their personal contribution in arranging themeetings between the President of Tajikistan Mr. Rakhmonov  and the leader of the opposition Mr. Nuri. The efforts of these and other countries actingas observers in the inter-Tajik negotiations tangiblysupplemented the mediating activity of the UnitedNations.We are grateful to the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  his SpecialEnvoy  Ambassador Píriz Ballón  and also the regionaland intergovernmental organizations that acted asobservers at the inter-Tajik negotiations for theirsubstantial contribution to the resolution of the conflict.The results of these multilateral efforts have alreadybecome apparent. Signed by the sides in the middle ofAugust this year  the Protocol on the fundamentalprinciples for establishing peace and national accord inTajikistan  which contains  inter alia  the decision toextend the term of cease-fire agreement until26 February 1996  has created a solid basis for theattainment of general agreement for peace and nationalaccord in Tajikistan.20The Government of Tajikistan is in favour of theearliest possible start to an ongoing round of negotiationswith the Opposition. We plan to begin this very soon. Theintention is that in the course of the forthcoming dialoguethe Government and its opponents will agree upon acomplete set of issues for a comprehensive peacesettlement. A prerequisite for that is that the Oppositionagree to act with the Government on a common legal basis.What is important is that  having signed the protocol towhich I have referred  the Opposition undertook to conductits political struggle exclusively by peaceful means and inaccordance with current legislation in the Republic ofTajikistan.We cannot ignore the fact that there are difficulties inthis process. Among the representatives of the hard-linewing of the Opposition there are forces whose attitudefavours terrorism and political and religious extremism. Toachieve their own narrow  selfish ends they are inclined tostick to the policy of keeping strong pressure on theGovernment. Their arsenal includes terrorist acts intimidation of people inside the country  constant violationof the Tajik-Afghan border  which is protected by borderguards of Russia  Kazakstan  Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan as well as by our own soldiers.The continuous interference from outside in theinter-Tajik conflict has had a negative impact on thesettlement process. Evidence of that is the continuingexplosive situation on the Tajik-Afghan border  which tendsto destabilize the situation in Tajikistan as well as in all ofCentral Asia.The unstable situation makes it possible for criminalelements to engage in the illegal supply of drugs and armson a large scale across the southern border of Tajikistan.The consequences of these criminal acts have a negativeimpact  not just in our country or in the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS)  but also far beyond the bordersof the CIS.In this connection  it is appropriate to recall that theleadership of Tajikistan and the States whose militarycontingents comprise the peace-keeping forces of the CIShave repeatedly requested that these forces be given thestatus of a United Nations operation. An important reasonfor that is the accumulated experience of close andconstructive collaboration between the United NationsMission of Observers in Tajikistan and the collective peace-keeping forces of the CIS  as well as the border-guardforces in Tajikistan. This collaboration is already one of themost important factors in stabilizing the situation.The completed process of constitutional reforms andthe concomitant peaceful transformation in State powerhave also contributed to the inter-Tajik settlement.Independent Tajikistan has now acquired a Constitution;the President of the country  who is its guarantor  cameto office as the result of popular elections; legislativepower is vested in a newly elected Parliament  the MajlisiOli; all branches of power at the centre  as well aslocally  have been strengthened and are workingeffectively; and the principle of the primacy of the lawhas made active headway in the country.It is not sufficient simply to note that all theseprocesses took place in the period between the forty-ninthsession and the fiftieth anniversary session of the GeneralAssembly: it is fair to note also that much was achievedwith the assistance of the United Nations institutions andspecialized agencies.While there may have been significant progress inthe political process  it has proved quite difficult toimprove the situation in the national economy in theperiod of transition without any support from outside despite the concrete steps that are being taken towardsmarket reforms. A national currency has been introduced prices have been liberalized  the process of acceleratedprivatization is under way  and so on.In other words  the conditions have been created forthe development of the economy in the transition period.At the same time  restoring those aspects of daily life thatwere destroyed by the civil war of 1992 has beenextremely difficult. Our health care  education and socialsecurity are in critical condition.The question of the return and settlement of refugeesand displaced persons and their social rehabilitationremains crucial. We are grateful for the efforts ofspecialized agencies of the United Nations and otherinternational organizations for their generosity to ourcountry in helping to resolve the refugee problem.As is known  Tajikistan does not have access to thesea. However  it possesses significant quantities of naturalresources  and it has substantial industrial potential. If ourcountry were to be approached by international financialorganizations this would significantly ease the situationand accelerate the process of reform in the economy.We call upon the States Members of the UnitedNations to cooperate in mutually beneficial partnership.Stabilization in the economy of Tajikistan will not only21serve to satisfy the socio-economic needs of our people; itwill become an important factor for further development ofdemocratic institutions in our country  strengthening themachinery for the defence of human rights and the processof national accord and the consolidation of society.As an equal member of the world community  theRepublic of Tajikistan  to the extent of its potential  willstrive to participate actively in international political life.Tajikistan actively supports the strengthening of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  towhich it is a party  as well as a comprehensive nuclear-testban.My country attaches great importance to thedevelopment of broad cooperation  not only with the UnitedNations but also with regional organizations. The Republicof Tajikistan is a striking example of successful practicalinteraction between two influential internationalorganizations — the United Nations and the Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — in theircommon interests. The ties between Tajikistan and theOSCE are developing in all major areas of thatorganization’s activity. We also attach great importance tothe activity of Tajikistan within the Organization of theIslamic Conference.Our country pays particular attention to the state ofaffairs in the Commonwealth of Independent States and tothe consistent development of that organization’s ties witheach of its members.The development of the situation in the central Asianregion is of vital importance to our Republic. TheGovernment of my country is a staunch advocate of theparity approach to the settlement of regional politicalproblems and of the closest possible economic integrationof the States in its region.Finally  I should like to say a few words about thesituation in a neighbouring country — Afghanistan  whichis one of the most dreadful casualties in the aftermath ofthe cold war. There appears to be no end to the internecineconflict in the territory of this long-suffering nation. Webelieve that the United Nations and the world communityhave sufficient political and moral weight to exert ameaningful influence on the parties to this fratricidalconflict with a view to ending the bloodshed as soon aspossible. This would undoubtedly be one of the mostsignificant contributions by the United Nations to theestablishment of universal peace and security.The 50-year history of the United Nations hasenriched us with the invaluable capacity to live in peacewith each other despite our differences. Applying thisexperience  we must give our peoples high hopes for lifein the third millennium. In this sense  we share very muchthe concept of the Secretary-General’s report “An Agendafor Development”. Consonant with this are the jointinitiatives of the CIS States at the fiftieth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly — initiatives in whichTajikistan has participated. The most relevant of these isthe convening of an international conference on refugeesand migrants in post-Soviet territory.The package of documented initiatives from the CISStates confirms our will to further integrate theCommonwealth into the international community  and toseek more active participation in the work of UnitedNations institutions and its specialized agencies. Our jointefforts do not mean that we wish to work in isolation.They simply testify to the fact that there is a great dealthat unites us  and there is much we share in commonwith respect to our development besides having manysimilar problems.The entire civilized world  with great concern andindeed with growing alarm about what will happen tofuture generations  has been observing increasingincidents of international terrorism  religious fanaticismand ultra-nationalism. The task of the world communityis to unite efforts to counteract the forces of evil. Thetragic events in Tokyo  Oklahoma and Budenovsk showthat the world must intensify the struggle in thosedirections  including foiling the attempts of terrorists toget access to weapons of mass destruction  whether theybe nuclear  chemical or any other kind.International terrorism  drug trafficking and the illicittraffic in weapons  the emergence of “hot spots” here andthere on the planet: these are all interconnectedphenomena. The pain and suffering of the people in these“hot spots” call for urgent and joint steps to be taken towage uncompromising war against these demons of theend of the twentieth century.As the situation now stands  either the principles ofhigh morality and humanity will prevail or the world willbe doomed to further suffering. We have no right to allowsociety to return to the epoch of barbarism.On the eve of the end of the Second World War thefounders of the United Nations dreamed about ruling outany global catastrophes in the future. The 50 years of our22Organization’s history provide convincing evidence of theconstant antagonism between the forces of reason and lightand those of injustice and hatred. Today we bow our headsin respect before the tens of millions of people whosacrificed their lives for the sake of peace and justice.Over the 50 years of its existence the United Nationshas essentially saved the world from new universalslaughter. Our common task is now to step into the twenty-first century having learned wisdom from the experience ofthe past  and having provided our children andgrandchildren with durable peace  the right to freedevelopment and spiritual progress."
"157",6838,"TKM",50,1995,"Please allow me to offer sincerecongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly.I would like to emphasize that this session of theGeneral Assembly  in the year of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations  will occupy a special place in thehistory of the Organization. In that context  on behalf ofTurkmenistan and President Niyazov  I wish to express oursincere appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts to build a new kind ofinternational relations for the Organization.The opportunity for our State to participate in theaffairs of the world community as an independent entityflowed  of course  from those events that the Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization describes as“the momentum in world affairs that appeared sodramatically at the outset of this decade.” (A/50/1 para. 4)Serenely  and immensely grateful for its good fortune Turkmenistan embarked on its independent course and without any political romanticism  began to carry out itsprogramme of building a nation-State and a system offoreign ties and seeking optimal ways for participating ininternational relations. This was a quest for Turkmenistan’splace in the United Nations system and a model ofstatehood reflecting its national mentality and the traditionsof the Turkmen people.Since that time  in our four years of independentexistence  we have travelled a great distance  and each stepwe have taken along the way has been both in the nationalinterest of Turkmenistan and in the interest of stabilizingthe region and strengthening international security  in theconstant conviction that these two are inseparable.After engaging in broad contacts within the system ofAsian States  we have once again become convinced of thecorrectness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning ofthis century that Asia  with its enormous human  naturaland intellectual resources  had every possibility ofbecoming the most prosperous region in the world.However  throughout the entire history of the Asiancontinent  instability and protracted regional conflicts haveoften  unfortunately  constituted the political background and this has significantly complicated the solution ofproblems of internal development.Turkmenistan has set as its main priority thepreservation of internal stability and social peace incarrying out radical reforms in building its State and itseconomy. This is vitally necessary in order for us to takeadvantage of our enormous resource potential. But thatimportant condition is not the only one: the other isstability around us so that we can freely and naturallydevelop our trade and economic relations with otherStates. This question is of special interest  in view of theworld’s share of hydrocarbon deposits and other mineraland biological resources that Turkmenistan possesses.Turkmenistan is at one of the world’s importantcrossroads of political and economic interests  in aregional dimension and beyond. Aware of this geopoliticalreality  Turkmenistan is prepared to participate in themost constructive way in establishing new relations in theregion and to promote efforts to establish there overallstability  security and effective and mutually advantageouscooperation on the basis of the principles of the UnitedNations.We believe that with the breakup of the SovietUnion and the Iron Curtain’s disappearance from itsborders with its southern neighbours  a new region hasemerged  a new community of States of Central Asia  theMiddle East  South-West Asia  the Caucasus and part ofthe Near East. This region is united by commondevelopment interests  the restoration of historical tradeand economic relations and cultural and humanitariantraditions.This was the logic that led to the idea of activeparticipation in the Economic Cooperation Organization(ECO). I would like to emphasize that the ECO’sconfiguration fully corresponds to our concept of a newregion’s emergence following the disintegration of theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics: the restoration of anatural gravitational attraction between these States thatfor decades were artificially divided by an ideologicalbarrier  which conditions for them the priority oftransportation  telecommunications and energy34programmes. Underlying these processes lies the principleof absolute economic feasibility  based on the mutualinterests of the member States of the ECO and the absenceof any political  territorial or other disputes between them.As for the internal tensions that persist in somecountries  we should stress that economic cooperation participation and joint projects will create fertile soil forconstructive solutions to these problems. Turkmenistanbelieves that this 10-country organization  emerging at suchan important time  will open up additional possibilities forthe newly independent States to the south of the formerUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics.Furthermore  the basis of our political and economicstrategy is the principle of reasonable pragmatism and thepreservation of positive experiences and ties from the past.We have a politically new type of State. Its independentstatus cannot be achieved by denying the realities of thepast and old ties that can still serve our higher intereststoday. In this respect  our relations with Russia and otherpartners in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)have remained a key component of Turkmenistan’s foreignpolicy.I would like to lay special emphasis on the fact thatthe obligations that neutral Turkmenistan has assumed havebeen set out in our Constitution and have been supported bythe people. These obligations not only take account ofnational interests but also objectively promote thedevelopment of cooperation in the region  and they haveenormous potential for stimulating the peacemakingprocesses in the area and for promoting the efforts of theworld community  primarily here at the United Nations  torid it of obsolete measures and adopt preventive measuresto defuse disputes and conflicts.I would like to set out some parameters ofTurkmenistan’s neutrality initiative in order to make surethat it is correctly understood by our partners in the UnitedNations and supported by them as well.The rapid pace of recent events determined thechanges in Asia’s geopolitical and geo-economic situation.The nature and direction of inter-State and regionalprocesses  an important component of some of thesechanges  has resulted in the formation of new  independentStates  each having chosen its own independent path ofdevelopment and having its own interests. One of the waysin which the uniqueness of each country has beenmanifested is in its political path  as is natural. For eachcountry that path is based on the people’s historical roots mentality and psychological make-up. Turkmenistan is noexception to this. Merging the prospects for its owndevelopment with the direction and nature of regional andcontinental processes and linking national interests withthe objective requirements of the day — from thistheoretical and practical basis we have arrived at the needto proclaim neutrality as a principle and instrument ofTurkmenistan’s foreign policy. We are pleased that ourneutrality initiative is finding more and more support attracting civil and political interest and receiving broadinternational recognition. We are grateful to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for providingTurkmenistan with assistance in this regard.In the context of asserting itself as a neutral State Turkmenistan requested admission to the Non-AlignedMovement as a full-fledged member. We hope that duringthe non-aligned summit in Cartagena  Colombia Turkmenistan’s membership will be confirmed. In thiscontext  I would like to state Turkmenistan’s convictionthat the idea of non-alignment is both a vital and a viableone. We do not share the view that it is archaic. Webelieve that we must not participate in the two conflictingglobal systems and that we need to turn to an idea ofnon-participation in the various rigid regional blocs multi-State formations capable of generating considerabledestructive force. Turkmenistan advocates non-alignment as well as non-participation in improper acts ofintervention in the internal affairs of States  non-participation in efforts for global or regional dominanceand non-participation in schemes to limit the role of theUnited Nations or weaken the universal and provenmachinery for implementing global policy. Such practicesserve selfish purposes.We are convinced that the use of military force tosolve existing conflicts has no future  but that negotiationsare effective. Although seeking peaceful means iscomplex  alternatives do not exist. At the same time  weunderstand that without active efforts  without good will it will hardly be possible to attain the desired result.Therefore  inter alia  while not intervening in the Tajikconflict  we are prepared to play a role in holding thenext round of inter-Tajik negotiations. We welcome andcommend the peacemaking efforts of the United Nationsand Russia  Iran  Pakistan and other countries in thisprocess.Naturally  we must be concerned at the situationunfolding in neighbouring Afghanistan. Supportingcontacts with the central Government in Kabul  as well aswith regional leaders  we believe that the Afghans must35be helped to demonstrate their ability to achieve peace andconsensus in their country  and that attempts to intervene inAfghanistan’s internal affairs not only are counter-productive  but may lead to highly undesirableconsequences. In that context  I would like to emphasizethat Turkmenistan gives priority to the United Nations  tothe Secretary-General’s efforts to find an acceptablemachinery for an Afghan settlement. Turkmenistan agreeswith the concern expressed from this rostrum at thecontinuing internal Afghan conflict. Turkmenistan has along border with this long-suffering State and is trulyinterested in finding a prompt settlement to the Afghanproblem. We are also interested in the success of thespecial representative of the United Nations  who in ourview requires serious support from the United Nations. Wecannot allow a situation whereby efforts to focus on solvingone conflict cause less attention to be paid to another resulting in negative consequences.Just as mankind has become aware that the nuclearthreat has a global dimension  we are also aware that todaywe need an adequate response to all regional and localdisputes and conflicts. I would like to emphasize thatAshkhabad is prepared to engage in constructivecooperation with the United Nations on these issues  and todemonstrate its commitment to the principles ofconstructive neutrality.All countries and peoples are now adapting in theirown ways to new conditions in the world  which dictate theneed to adopt a common philosophy of security  based onthe principle of security for one and security for all. Iwould like to emphasize that at this stage we are talkingabout a philosophy  of perceptions of the world  reflectingrealities in Asian countries  in particular. This philosophyexcludes the use of force  diktat  as a means of solvingpolitical disputes  and its main principles should includeequality  humanism  social and economic progress  andhealthy pragmatism.Here I should like to support what was said by mycolleague from Germany  Mr. Klaus Kinkel  whoemphasized that we must not allow hostile stereotypes tobecome instilled in people’s minds and that we cannotassociate in one sweep Islam with terrorism andfundamentalism. We welcome this assertion and express ourconviction that this attitude will become universal.As for Turkmenistan  we are fundamental advocates ofa secular State model  in which religion would play itsproper role. We believe that  as has been emphasized byPresident Niyasov  a poly-ethnic  multi-faith State modeland structure is more effective  more fruitful  than amono-ethnic and mono-religious State.I take this opportunity to emphasize the support thatTurkmenistan has received  through its participation in theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  in European matters  as one of the legalsuccessors of the former federated State. This has createdfor us  in a difficult transitional time of colossaltransformations  the possibility of benefiting from Asian-European development. In that context  the words of theMinister for Foreign Affairs of France  Mr. Hervé deCharette  were very important for us  when he spokeabout the States of Asia and Africa and about focusing onthe first meeting of Heads of State of Asia and Africa  setfor March 1996. We hope  within the context ofactivating work on the Euro-Asian bridge  that there willbe other major projects  with the participation ofTurkmenistan  on a direct window to Europe. Primarily we are talking about a north-south transit corridor to linkEurope and Asia  through the territory of Russia andTurkmenistan  facilitating the supply of Turkmen energyto European markets and so on.I should like to emphasize that we have witnessed asignificant  if not radical  increase in international interestin Caspian Sea matters  and the utilization of its abundantnatural resources. Our conceptual approach to this isbased on the idea that the Caspian Sea is a unique waterbasin and the common property of the five coastal States.In the making of plans for the development of itsresources account should be taken of those States’interests; their consent should be required and nounilateral decisions should be taken. Turkmenistan firmlyadvocates the prevention of any naval activities in theCaspian Sea  and favours freedom of navigation  on thebasis of a legal status to be developed by the littoralStates. We must create legal and economic conditions thatwill guarantee a normal regime for foreign investment andexclude any risks for investors  such as the emergence ofa situation of distrust between the States of the basin.At the coming anniversary session of the GeneralAssembly next month  President Niyasov will set forththe principles of the domestic and foreign policies ofTurkmenistan  focusing on problems being taken up bythe United Nations  an Organization reflecting the face ofmankind  which today faces a new millennium with itsunique challenges and times and circumstances. Wesincerely congratulate each other  and first and foremostcongratulate the Secretary-General  as we are absolutelyconvinced that the United Nations  in this year of its36fiftieth anniversary  will prove that it is essential to theworld as the highest international assembly  developing anagenda for global partnership in the twenty-first century."
"158",6906,"TTO",50,1995,"It is a greathonour for me to extend to you  Sir  warmestcongratulations  on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad andTobago  on your election as President of this session of theGeneral Assembly. The celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations and the urgent need torespond to a number of major questions facing theOrganization make this a singularly important year. We areconfident that with your vision and leadership you willguide this historic Assembly session to a successfulconclusion.My delegation would also like to express its deepappreciation to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  for the able manner inwhich he presided over the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly.We are also particularly pleased to welcome thesmall island State of Palau as the one hundred and eighty-fifth Member of the United Nations.Most States represented in this Hall were not presentat the historic signing of the United Nations Charter inSan Francisco 50 years ago  but on gaining independencethey applied for membership in this Organization as anessential part of their quest for a secure and stableinternational environment and improved standards ofliving. Trinidad and Tobago  a small democratic State which gained its independence in 1962  was no exception.Since 1962  when we became a Member of theUnited Nations  there have been profound changes ininternational relations and consequent increases in theresponsibilities of this Organization. The most dramatic ofthese changes was the end of the cold war  whichengendered a certain optimism that there would be ananticipated peace dividend which would provide impetusto international cooperation for development.Unfortunately this was not to be. The end of the cold wartriggered an almost unprecedented surge of ethnic andnationalist conflict  which proceeded to consume much ofthe attention and resources of the internationalcommunity.Our Organization has had to adapt quickly to meetthese challenges. There was a sudden and meteoric rise inthe volume and  indeed  the complexity of United Nationspeace-keeping activities. The Organization has had itsshare of successes and disappointments. However  despitethe failure to meet growing expectations  the UnitedNations can be justly proud of many of its achievementsin the field of peace-keeping  in the restoration ofdemocracy  and in its response to emergency situations.The successes in Central America  Cambodia  Namibia Mozambique and South Africa bear ample testimony tothe effective role the United Nations can play in theadvancement of peace  justice and security.In our region  the cooperation between the UnitedNations and the Organization of American States in the9restoration of the democratically elected President of Haitishows what can be accomplished once the necessarypolitical will exists in support of such actions. In thisregard  we welcome the recently held legislative and localelections in Haiti  which  in spite of difficulties  sawthousands of Haitians assemble peacefully and safely tocast their ballots. We are confident that these developmentswill serve to enhance Haiti’s efforts to consolidatedemocracy  and will assist in the process of nationalreconciliation. The international community must continueto assist the Government and people of Haiti in the post-emergency period and in their long-term efforts to achieveeconomic and social reconstruction.In the Middle East  Trinidad and Tobago welcomesthe interim agreement between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization on the expansion of Palestinianself-rule in the West Bank  which was signed inWashington  D.C. on 28 September 1995. It representsanother significant advance in the process towards lastingpeace in the region.As for the former Yugoslavia  we are encouraged bythe efforts on the part of all sides in the conflict to come tothe negotiating table  and we express the hope that thisdevelopment will significantly advance the process towardspeace and stability in that war-torn region.On the African continent  the spirit of reconciliationwhich has prevailed in some areas of conflict gives us hopethat some of the seemingly more intractable problems canalso be resolved. The international community must fulfilits responsibilities in assisting the process.Earlier this year the States parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons decided to extendthe Treaty indefinitely. The Conference also adopted anumber of principles and objectives  one of which calledfor the completion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-bantreaty no later than the third quarter of 1996. It was also theunderstanding of the international community that therewould be no further nuclear tests  pending the entry intoforce of that treaty. Trinidad and Tobago has joined otherparties to the Tlatelolco and Rarotonga Treaties in rejectingcurrent nuclear testing by some nuclear-weapon States  andappeals to those States to heed the mounting requests tocease nuclear testing.Related to our environmental concerns over nucleartesting is the equally critical issue of the marine transportof irradiated nuclear fuel  plutonium and high-levelradioactive wastes. These shipments continue to take placedespite the potentially catastrophic effects on small islanddeveloping States  whose fragile and vulnerableeconomies are overwhelmingly dependent on their marineand coastal resources  and who possess neither theresources nor the capability to deal with possibleaccidents of this nature. My delegation would thereforelike to reiterate the priority concern which we attach tothis issue  and to urge the shipment countries to respectthe wishes of the small island developing States and otheren route States  which have called for an end to theseshipments through their archipelagic and territorial watersas well as their exclusive economic zones.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations willbe a time for reflection and re-examination of theactivities of the Organization  not only as they relate toconflict situations but  equally  in the field ofdevelopment as a necessary precondition for peace and asthe best guarantee of long-term stability.At the national level  Trinidad and Tobago hasundertaken a programme of economic reform andrestructuring of the economy  which is almost complete.Our development focus has been on the pursuit of asound macroeconomic policy based on a number ofmeasures  which include a disciplined fiscal stance andthe consistent implementation of an orderly and broad-based divestment programme  the enactment of structuraland legislative reforms designed to provide anenvironment for the growth of a resilient andinternationally competitive private sector and oneconducive to greater foreign investment  the liberalizationof the trade and exchange-rate regimes aimed atenhancing our competitiveness and a comprehensiveprogramme of reform of the domestic financial system.Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of thepublic sector and the provision of basic infrastructure inorder to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable  high-quality services  the progressive restructuring of oureducational system so as to put in place a sustainablehuman-resource development programme which wouldrespond to the new challenges and needs of ourdevelopment  and the employment of social policiesaimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society. Inorder to succeed  however  these measures must becomplemented by a supportive regional and internationalenvironment.For small States  regional integration is animperative  and  increasingly  regional cooperationsystems are seen as providing the essential buildingblocks on which to construct hemispheric and wider10international cooperation. At the last Conference of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of Government held at Georgetown from 4 to 7 July  Trinidad and Tobagowas pleased to welcome Suriname as the fourteenthmember of the Caribbean Community.The successful inaugural summit meeting of theAssociation of Caribbean States  which was held at Port ofSpain from 17 to 18 August 1995  has also opened a newchapter in the history of cooperation among countries of thewider Caribbean. The adoption of the Declaration ofPrinciples and Plan of Action on Tourism  Trade andTransportation provides a practical blueprint to fosterdevelopment and enhance economic integration among allcountries of the Caribbean. In this context  Trinidad andTobago reiterates the importance we attach to the fullreintegration of Cuba in the Western Hemisphere.I have already alluded to the need to achieve greaterbalance in United Nations activities in the fields of peace-keeping and development. The need for such a balanceassumes even greater urgency when one recognizes that toan increasing extent the nature  scope and complexity ofdevelopment challenges today are beyond the limits andcontrol of the nation State.To the traditionally elusive development problems ofpersistent poverty  debilitating debt  declining levels ofofficial development assistance  unemployment demographic pressures and the worsening income gap andterms of trade between developed and developing countries one must add the new and additional challenges ofenvironmental degradation and globalization. Some of thesewill continue to require a national approach  but the greatmajority of them are beyond the limits of national actionand thus require a common commitment  a commonapproach  and a call to global neighbourhood action.The notion of shared responsibilities and therecognition of the need for mechanisms for collective actionare the raison d’être of the United Nations system. Acoordinated and integrated United Nations system that isfocused and adequately funded thus remains the best hopefor effectively dealing with these myriad and complexdevelopment challenges.I can think of no better way to refocus and recommitthe United Nations to the goals of development and globalsecurity for all than through the formulation andimplementation of a comprehensive action-oriented agendafor development. An agenda which continues to addresstraditional development problems while simultaneouslytackling the questions of protectionism  capital flows reform of the international economic decision-makingprocesses and management of the global economy mustbe the focus of our efforts.At the recent Fourth World Conference on Womenat Beijing  the international community recognized thecrucial role that women play in the development processand acknowledged that effective international cooperationfor development will remain an elusive goal unlesswomen can participate fully in the political  economic andsocial life of their respective societies. The BeijingConference  along with the other global conferences heldat Rio  Barbados  Cairo and Copenhagen  have served tobuttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainabledevelopment  which must be informed by environmental social  demographic  gender and human- resourceconsiderations. The agenda for development musttherefore seek to implement and fulfil  in an integratedmanner  the commitments arising out of theseConferences.Within the agenda for development particularconsideration must also be given to assisting developingcountries  especially those with small and vulnerableeconomies in advancing their economic transformationand in facilitating their greater participation in the worldeconomy.Trinidad and Tobago is committed to free trade andto placing its economy on a development path compatiblewith the demands of the new global order. However  asthe challenges of globalization have demonstrated national policies are not enough. To achieve sustainedeconomic growth and sustainable development we need asupportive and favourable international economicenvironment as well as a fair  open and non-discriminatory trading system  one which recognizes thatsmall and vulnerable economies like our own are at aparticular disadvantage because of our size and the lackof economies of scale. No effort must therefore be sparedto ensure that we are provided with the necessary marketaccess so critical to our trade-expansion and developmentobjectives. Indeed  to do anything less within the agendafor development would be a denial of the fact thatglobalization has now placed an even greaterresponsibility on the major developed countries to ensurethat their macroeconomic policies are favourable togrowth and development in the rest of the world.Trinidad and Tobago is also of the view that theagenda for development offers an opportunity to develop11the global partnership for sustainable development and topromote the implementation of the agreements reached atthe Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In this process the special situation and needs of small island developingStates and the recognition of their environmentalvulnerability must receive priority attention. Trinidad andTobago therefore wishes to reiterate the particularimportance we attach to the implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States.In the Caribbean  recent devastating hurricanes haveonce again dramatically demonstrated the fragility of theecosystems and the vulnerability of the economies of smallislands. We are grateful to those Member States which havejoined CARICOM countries in providing emergencyassistance  and we appeal to the international community tocontinue its support for reconstruction efforts in the affectedcountries.The General Assembly will be called upon at thissession to make several critical decisions relating to thefuture of the United Nations system. Trinidad and Tobagois of the view that the elements of the reform exercisecurrently before the Assembly constitute a good basis for amore effective United Nations.Indeed  Member States must use the momentumprovided by this fiftieth-anniversary session to reach anagreement to expand the Security Council so as to enhanceits legitimacy and effectiveness  to resolve the criticalfinancial situation of the United Nations  to complete anaction-oriented and comprehensive Agenda forDevelopment with adequate and predictable resources for itsimplementation  and to strike a reasonable balance betweenresources for peace-keeping and for development.Reform  however  cannot be an end in itself. It is buta means to an end  and it will only be meaningful if we areunited in the view that a strengthened and revitalizedUnited Nations is an imperative  given the inescapablereality of today’s global village; that the world of the futurewill need more  not fewer  effective internationalcollaborative mechanisms to confront common threats; andthat the United Nations remains the only availableinstrument for the necessary global effort required to tacklethese challenges.The critical financial situation of the United Nationsmust be a source of concern to all Member States. TheSecretary-General has described with increasing urgencyand frustration the difficulties he is facing in carrying outthe tasks entrusted to him because of a lack of thenecessary resources. The failure  in particular  of thelargest contributor to pay its legally assessed contributionshas placed the Organization on the brink of insolvency.There must therefore be a greater commitment on the partof all Member States to meet their obligations  as well asa greater manifestation of will to resolve the overallfinancial situation of the United Nations. Unless wedemonstrate this commitment  the paeans of praise withwhich we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary will have avery hollow ring.At this fiftieth anniversary of the Organization  let usrecall the opening words of the United Nations Charter:“We the peoples of the United Nations ... haveresolved to combine our efforts to accomplish theseaims.”In a spirit of global partnership  we must renew ourresolve  in accordance with the principles and purposes ofthe Charter  to ensure the realization of the objectives forwhich the Organization was established: peace  equality justice and development for all. Trinidad and Tobagopledges to work with others to confront the challengesthat face our Organization as we move towards thetwenty-first century."
"159",6953,"TUN",50,1995,"Allow me at the outset to extend to you Mr. President  our warmest and sincerest congratulationson your election to the presidency of the fiftieth sessionof the United Nations General Assembly. Through you  Ishould also like to pay tribute to the relations between mycountry and Portugal and to note our shared expectationsfor the Mediterranean region.I would be remiss were I to fail to extend mywarmest congratulations to your predecessor  Mr. AmaraEssy  President of the previous session of the Assembly for the new impetus he gave to the Organization throughthe different working groups over which he presided. Ishould also like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the wisdom anddetermination with which he is carrying out his noblemission.This session of the Assembly crowns a half centuryof the world Organization’s efforts to preserve worldpeace. Today  the Organization is called upon to pave theway to a new era  one that we hope will be marked bysolidarity in facing the tasks before us and theresponsibility we all bear.Since the end of the cold war the world has rid itselfof the heavy burden of the fear of another world war  awar that would have led to untold catastrophes andtragedies. This development  albeit new  already seems tobe part of the past given the speed of subsequentdevelopments.Even if East-West confrontation and the bipolarity ofpast decades have disappeared  new challenges haveemerged over the past few years. Hotbeds of tension andinstability have proliferated  in many regions of the world and have taken root in the soil of ethnic and politicalhostilities that often take the form of armed confrontationswithin the borders of any one State. Such hostilities areoften fuelled by extremes of hardship and by deterioratingeconomic and social conditions.Some negative phenomena  such as terrorism extremism and the illicit traffic in arms and drugs havealso grown in a manner that is cause for concern as theyundermine the stability of States.Inherent in these new challenges are factors ofdisintegration and collapse that throw a long shadow overinternational peace and security and impose new threatsthat the international community should hasten to contain6with decisive action which should not focus on theiroutward manifestations alone  but deal with their trueunderlying causes  namely economic underdevelopment andsocial backwardness.In fact  these new situations which now face the worldin the post-cold-war era make us realize that it isimpossible to ensure lasting international peace and securityby military means alone. Respect for law and internationallegality are prerequisites as are creation of conditions thatwould promote the economic and social development in aninterdependent world. These  we believe  are theunderpinnings upon which we should build a new worldorder.Due to the developments the international communityhas been witnessing over the past few years  the UnitedNations Organization has come to shoulder newresponsibilities towards international peace and security.These responsibilities are manifest in the unprecedentedincrease in the number of peace-keeping operations  as wellas in new activities such as the supervision of elections andthe rebuilding of State structures and the economicinfrastructures of States. In addition  many of theseactivities have to do with the settlement of disputes withincertain States.While the United Nations has to provide assistance tocountries that are ravaged by civil wars and internalconflicts  we  as members of the international community are all called upon to mobilize our efforts and to strengthenour solidarity within the context of the efforts aimed at themaintenance of peace and to identify and resolve theunderlying causes of such disputes. Proceeding from ourbelief in the fundamental principles set forth in theSecretary-General’s “Agenda for Peace”  particularly thoserelating to preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peacebuilding  Tunisia  during its presidency of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU)  called for stronger cooperationbetween the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity in the area of conflict prevention and the speedyresolution of disputes at minimum cost.Here we should remind of the role of the central organof the OAU’s mechanism for conflict prevention management and resolution  which has been given newimpetus by President Ben Ali and other African leaders inorder to make it an effective tool in the prevention andsettlement of disputes in Africa.In this context  Tunisia has hosted several meetings ofthis central body  which have resulted in the adoption ofmany important resolutions that have made it possible toaddress certain situations which  otherwise  would havecalled for intervention by the international community tokeep peace or to prevent the outbreak of new conflicts.We believe that such efforts by this central organ of theOAU warrant additional support. The results of suchefforts could be improved if the appropriate financial andlogistical means were made available to the organ and ifcoordination were ensured between the United Nationsand the OAU in this regard. We do hope that the recenttendency to give this matter some thought will lead to theidentification of the ways and means whereby action bythe international community in this direction will developfurther. On this occasion  I should like  on behalf ofPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  to pay tribute to theinternational community for its valuable support toTunisia during its presidency of the OAU  and to expressparticular appreciation to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  as well as toall those who have provided financial and logisticalassistance to peace-keeping operations in Africa and tothe States that have provided financial support to the fundcreated within the OAU mechanism for the settlement management and prevention of disputes.While some hotbeds of tension persist  some havebeen eliminated  and we do see a reduction in the dangerof major conflagrations in the light of the significantprogress made towards disarmament and the strengtheningof the underpinnings of international security through theefforts of the United Nations  as well as an improvementin the climate of trust and understanding that we now feelin international relations.In the area of weapons of mass destruction  Tunisiawelcomed the signing of the Convention on chemicalweapons. We believe it is a step that will lead to theelimination of an entire class of such weapons. This callsfor further substantive steps to rid the world gradually ofthe threat of nuclear weapons  particularly in the wake ofthe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).As for the Middle East  many important steps havebeen taken towards genuine dialogue between the partiesconcerned.Tunisia  which has been an active participant in thepeace process since it began in Madrid  welcomes theagreement achieved yesterday between the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel  and hopes that it willbe followed by other concrete steps towards ensuring the7achievement of the legitimate national rights of thePalestinian people.We must adopt the same approach in order to givenew impetus to the negotiations between Syria and Israel onthe one hand  and between Lebanon and Israel on the otherin order to ensure the withdrawal from the occupiedterritories in the Golan and in southern Lebanon and theachievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace inthe region.It goes without saying that the principles upon whichthe peace process was based  namely Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  as well as GeneralAssembly resolutions concerning the withdrawal from allArab and Palestinian lands  including Holy Al-Quds  mustbe fully implemented. Al-Quds remains  for the Palestinianand the whole Islamic nation  a cornerstone for thesettlement of the dispute.We believe that it is time for the Israeli Governmentto demonstrate realism and political courage by rising abovethe very narrow view of security and relations with theneighbouring Arab States in order to allow the peoples ofthe region to live in harmony in increasing security andstability.In the Arab Maghreb  Tunisia  which has alwaysbelieved in international legality  calls  in the light ofinitiatives taken by Libya  for a rapid resolution of theLockerbie affair in order to lift the embargo imposed onour Libyan brethren. The negative effects of that embargohave begun seriously to affect stability and development inall the countries of the region.As for Iraq  Tunisia  which is satisfied with theprogress that is being made in implementing United Nationsresolutions  calls for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq inorder to mitigate the suffering of the Iraqi people. At thesame time  Tunisia stresses the need to fully respect thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and all thecountries of the region. By the same token  we hope thatagreement on the basis of the norms of international lawand the behests of good-neighbourliness and respect for theterritorial integrity of other States  will be reached in thedispute between the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran on Abu Moussa and the Greater andLesser Tumb Islands.I should now like to address the crisis in Bosnia which  in our view  constitutes an aberration that embodiesa serious defiance to all humanity. This war puts us face toface with ideologies which  we thought  had becomethings of the past  but which have now resurfaced in theguise of “ethnic cleansing”. The international communityhas the right to make use of the means provided by theUnited Nations Charter to force those who flout allcivilized values and trample the most basic of humanrights to accept the independence of Bosnia andHerzegovina and to respect its territorial integrity.Tunisia  which has always participated in the UnitedNations efforts to maintain international peace andsecurity  is well-aware of the limitations of the narrowview that reduces the concept of security to the militarydimension alone. Proceeding from this  Tunisia hassupported from the outset the international community’sinitiative embodied in “An Agenda for Development”. Webelieve that “An Agenda for Development”  along with“An Agenda for Peace”  help to enrich our thinking in thefield of multilateral cooperation at a time when countriesof the world are becoming increasingly open to marketeconomics which  together with the consolidation ofinterdependence  have come to be the principal economiccharacteristics of world economy at the end of the 20thcentury.In view of the irreversible globalization of economicconcepts  the United Nations is called upon to play afundamental role in formulating and implementingdevelopment policies. Such an important role should workin favour of the international community’s efforts torestructure the United Nations and to increase itseffectiveness. Tunisia  which has taken part in theseefforts  believes that any restructuring process should helppromote the universal nature of the Organization andstrengthen its democratic posture  so that it may make abetter contribution in the area of development. We believethat the process of restructuring must go hand-in-handwith a wider cooperation between the United Nations andthe Bretton Woods institutions in order to improve theirinput in development.In this context  joint initiatives could be taken toensure a better division of labour between the UnitedNations and the Bretton Woods institutions with a viewto increasing their effectiveness in the economic andsocial fields and within the context of development ingeneral. More specifically  as far as cooperation betweenthe United Nations and other parties is concerned President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has been calling  since1989  from this very rostrum  for a developmentpartnership between industrialized and developingcountries. This initiative is a project for a new8international cooperation based on a dynamic view of thesecurity of all States. Through this proposal  Tunisia aimsat creating a new system based on economic  political social and democratic stability  because we believe that theyare the very pillars of security. This Tunisian initiative isbased on awareness of the organic link betweendevelopment  democracy and stability. This overall viewtakes into account the aspirations of individuals and peopleswho look forward to freedom and economic  social andcultural well-being.The Tunisian view of security and development isanchored in the belief that extreme importance must beattached to the cultural and humanitarian aspects ofinternational relations  particularly at the regional level.Proceeding from this belief  Tunisia has sought toconsolidate its cultural and political ties with all thecountries of the Arab Maghreb and of the Mediterranean.At the Maghreb level  in cooperation with the memberStates of the Arab Maghreb Union  Tunisia has worked tocreate an economic zone in the region. This has takenconcrete shape in the Tunisian declaration of 1994 relatingto the creation of a free zone as a first step in putting inplace a Maghreb development strategy.Tunisia’s involvement in international economic affairsand its attempts to develop its interests with the region onthe northern shores of the Mediterranean are among itsbasic foreign-policy tenets  enshrined in the partnershipagreement with the European Union. This agreement isbased on joint development and aims at creating a free zonethat will allow Tunisia further activity within the economiesof its European partners. It goes hand in hand with a policyof dialogue between the countries of the Mediterranean. Onthe 28th and 29th of July 1995  Tunisia hosted apreparatory meeting for the Mediterranean region to ensurethe success of the meeting scheduled for next November inBarcelona. The Preliminary results of the Mediterraneandialogue give cause for optimism as they reflect a commondesire to safeguard the Mediterranean region frominternational political convulsions and economic fluctuationswhile ensuring its harmonious development.The United Nations is called upon today to develop anew concept based on the need to achieve security development and democracy. These are the very principlesin which Tunisia believes and for which we strive domestically as well as internationally. In the field ofdevelopment  the Tunisian strategy is based on the humanelement within a comprehensive vision that embraces allsegments of society  and aims at building a balanced andunitary society.In this context  I wish to stress in particular theimportance that Tunisia attaches to the empowerment ofwomen  the protection of the family and to highlight thefact that many achievements have been made in thiscontext  particularly with regard to the adoption ofstructural  legal and administrative measures to promotethe role of women and the family  economically andsocially and to enhance the role of women in ourdevelopment efforts. At the same time  Tunisia hasacceded to many international conventions on the equalityof women and men  the latest of which has been theCopenhagen agreement which relate to the elimination ofall forms of discrimination against women. Based on itsrich experience in this context  Tunisia has played a veryactive role in the March 1995 World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen and in the recent FourthWorld Conference on Women in Beijing  whose positiveresults we commend.In this new era  Tunisia will continue to support theefforts of the United Nations both in the areas ofmaintenance of peace and of development. We shallcontinue to participate in defining the features of the newworld order and to call for upholding the law and thenorms of international legality. It behoves the States ofthe world to share a joint vision of the world oftomorrow  so that it may be characterized by moresolidarity and justice. We hope that the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will reaffirm thecommitment of the international community to anOrganization without which we can never hope to buildsuch a new world order."
"160",7000,"TUR",50,1995,"It gives me great pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his electionto the high office of President of the General Assembly.Under his able and wise guidance  this historic sessionshould become a milestone in the enhancement of thestature of this universal forum.I should like also to thank his predecessor  HisExcellency Amara Essy  for his valuable contribution to thework of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.Half a century ago  the world was witnessing  as weare today  the end of one era and the beginning of a newone. In days fraught with foreboding but also filled withhope  another generation established this Organization.There was ambition in their design and an idealism abouthow a better world could be achieved. After a war that hadbrought untold sorrow to humankind  51 nations joinedtogether for the common purpose of promoting peace development  equality  justice and human rights. Their aimwas to create a collective security system that would savefuture generations from the scourge of war  but for morethan four decades the notion of collective security remainedfrozen. It was only after the end of the cold war that newhopes emerged for its revival.We live in extraordinary times  times full of starkcontrasts. The end of bipolarity freed the internationalcommunity from political and ideological constraints.Today  a sense of global responsibility is growing. It isbeing widely recognized that only democracy  the rule oflaw and a market economy can guide us towards apromising future. Awareness of an era of a global societyis spreading — but so are xenophobic and ethnicnationalism  racism and intolerance. Wars of aggressionhave erupted in different parts of the globe. We havewitnessed the cruellest of crimes committed againsthumanity since the end of the Second World War. Globalproblems such as environmental degradation  poverty starvation  terrorism  organized crime  illicit drugs andtrafficking in arms require the concerted action of allnations. Today  we are well aware that the internationalcommunity must address a human community that isprofoundly transnational. There is a pressing need for astronger and more effective role for the United Nations.At its fiftieth anniversary  the United Nations can beproud of its work in fighting underdevelopment  socialscourges and illiteracy  illicit drugs and diseases;protecting the environment; eliminating all traces ofcolonialism and apartheid; combating racism; acceleratingthe disarmament process; supplying emergency relief tocountries and peoples struck by natural disasters andwars; and promoting democracy and universal respect forhuman rights.Successful as these activities have been  the mainresponsibility of the United Nations is obviously themaintenance of international peace and security — and itis in this area that set-backs have been more harmful tothe United Nations. Regrettably  ongoing conflicts andtragedies have overshadowed the United Nations successstory and have damaged its image and credibility. Wehave to face this reality and take stock of what we haveachieved and where we have failed.This is the most opportune time to engage in aself-criticism  to revisit the Charter of the United Nations to go back to its basic notions. This is also the mostopportune time to look ahead with realism and vision  toadapt the United Nations to the new world environmentand to make it the real centre of collective security andglobal solidarity.The United Nations experience shows that wesucceeded when we reached a global consensus and wefailed when we pursued our narrow individual interests.History will judge us by what we do today. We  thepeoples of the United Nations  must address thechallenges of our times with the vision of the founders ofthe United Nations. We must seize this historic32opportunity to forge workable and durable mechanisms foreffectively responding to the problems that confront us.Together  we have to make our Organization moresuccessful in order to make the world a better place for allhumankind to live in  so that children may not regrethaving been born into this world.When the problems we face transcend nationalboundaries  international cooperation is the only appropriateand effective response. Facilitating this cooperation is theraison d’être of this Organization.Although not exactly embodied in the Charter  thecreation of the concept of peace-keeping and the subsequentactivities aimed at its application have added to the effortstowards peace. However  peacemaking and peaceenforcement  the really essential tenets of the originalvision  have yet to be fulfilled. Let us not forget that thefounders of the United Nations intended an organizationthat would not hesitate to implement international law.To prepare our Organization for the next century priority attention should be focused on the SecurityCouncil  on the tools and mechanisms of collective securityand on the concepts of human security and sustainabledevelopment. The ongoing efforts for the restructuring ofthe United Nations in general should be considered andnegotiated within this framework and in a far-reachingmanner.The central issue before us is the enhancement of therepresentative character of the Security Council and thedemocratization of its methods of work. The wide-rangingdemands to render the Council more representative responsive  transparent and accountable should be met. Weare strongly in favour of a genuine and comprehensivereform. After two years of deliberations by the Open-endedWorking Group  many useful ideas and proposals are nowbefore us that necessitate further reflection.I should like to draw the attention of members to therevised version of our proposal for the enlargement of theSecurity Council. We believe that a Council with at least 25members would be more representative and thus be moreeffective. We also hold the view that the Council should beenlarged by the addition of 10 non-permanent members.Thus the existing ratio of permanent and non-permanentmembers could be reorganized so that the permanentmembers were one fifth of the Council instead of one third.These additional seats should rotate among a predeterminedlist of about 30 to 40 countries. Those countries could beselected within the geographical groups  according to a setof objective criteria  which could change over time.Therefore  the list would be flexible and would beupdated after a certain period of time  to adapt tochanges. Consequently  a new concept of constituenciesin the distribution of seats in the Council would beintroduced.In this respect  we believe that the extension of theconcept of separate constituencies for the distribution ofelective seats is also worth considering. Setting up newconstituencies for election could be one of the mostappropriate ways to rectify the shortcomings andinjustices of the present election system. This idea ofelectoral reform would enable us to find ways and meanswithin the geographical groups to ensure a fair  equitableand orderly working system of rotation for all thenon-permanent seats. I hope that our proposal  along withothers along similar lines  will receive carefulconsideration.In its Chapter VII  the Charter provides the SecurityCouncil with important mechanisms for the maintenanceof international peace and security. Cognizant of the twopertinent reports of the Secretary-General  namely  “AnAgenda for Peace” and “The Supplement to the Agendafor Peace”  I should like to express the views of myGovernment on these crucial issues.First and foremost  we need to put the concept ofpreventive diplomacy on the top of our agenda. Indeed the idea of preventive diplomacy is embodied in the letterand spirit of the Charter. It is the most cost-effective wayof conflict prevention. We also believe that theapplication of certain measures of preventive diplomacysuch as fact-finding missions  preventive deployment andearly-warning capabilities should be more timely.In recent years  United Nations peace-keepingactivities have vastly expanded. As an active participantin these activities  Turkey stands ready to further itsassistance to the United Nations. We have also decided toparticipate in the United Nations stand-by forces.Another idea of the founders which is extremelyrelevant today is reflected in Chapter VIII of the Charter.The challenges we are facing today exceed the means andresources of the United Nations. In this respect  theregional organizations have much to contribute to themaintenance of peace and security. The need for a newcollective security architecture of mutually reinforcinginstitutions has become more compelling. The cooperationbetween the United Nations and the regional organizations33should be viewed as complementary in nature. On the otherhand  given the unique characteristics of each situation andthe varied mandates  as well as structures of the regionalorganizations  we believe that an attempt to establish auniversal model for their relationship with the UnitedNations may be counter-productive.United Nations-imposed sanctions constitute aneffective measure for determined action against theviolators of international law. Nevertheless  there areserious shortcomings which need to be addressed. In thiscontext  we share the Secretary-General’s views that“Sanctions are a measure taken collectively by theUnited Nations to maintain or restore internationalpeace and security. The costs involved ... should beborne ... by all Member States and not exclusively bythe few who have the misfortune to be neighbours ormajor economic partners of the target country”(A/50/60  para. 73).In addition to this observation  the lack of efficientconsultation mechanisms  as well as secrecy in thedecision-making process of the Security Council for theimposition and review of sanctions  are also causingconcern to the general membership. We are convinced thattransparency in the activities of the Council with respect tosanctions will ensure wider support for theirimplementation.The aggression and genocide in Bosnia andHerzegovina continue to be a historical test-case for thecredibility of the United Nations and for the role it couldplay in shaping the future of the international system. Theprestige and moral authority of the United Nations arebeing challenged. For a long time  the open defiance ofinternational law and the blatant violations of SecurityCouncil resolutions remained unchecked. We evenwitnessed  with deep indignation and sorrow  the fall ofUnited Nations-designated safe areas last July. Theaggressor intensified its attacks on other safe areas. Thelong-awaited appropriate response to the aggressor cameonly after another marketplace massacre in Sarajevo. TheUnited Nations-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)joint operation  belated as it may be  has been a veryimportant step in the right direction. The involvement of therapid reaction force in the operation has also been totally inconformity with the mandate as set out in various SecurityCouncil resolutions.Turkey  also a Balkan country  is strongly in favour ofa negotiated settlement. However  peace should not havepriority over justice. We must never forget that no peace throughout history  has ever been a lasting one when itwas based on rewarding injustice. With these thoughts inmind  and setting out from the Agreed Basic Principles ofGeneva and New York  we should like to hope that a justand viable peace can be built on the basis of themulti-cultural  multi-ethnic  multi-religious character ofBosnia and Herzegovina. Hence  we firmly believe thatthe Bosniac-Croat Federation should set a model for thefuture of the Union of two entities. We attach the utmostimportance to the reference made in the agreed principlesto the preservation of the sovereignty  unity and territorialintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovinawithin its existing international borders. It is in line withthis reasoning that we welcome the steps taken on theroad towards peace. We should not lose sight of the factthat determined action and diplomacy backed by forcehave increased the chances of a real peace process.The conclusion of a negotiated settlement must befollowed by the establishment of a peace implementationforce. Turkey is ready to undertake responsibilities withinthis force. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosniaand Herzegovina will be the key for the viability of thesettlement. Turkey is also determined to take an activepart in this process.At this critical juncture  we firmly believe that theinternational community should remain vigilant until thefinal settlement is sealed.Turkey has always held the view that the stability ofMacedonia is an indispensable requisite for peace andstability in the Balkans. Moreover  we have consistentlymaintained that the economic sanctions imposed on thatcountry  coupled with the policy intended to isolate itfrom the international community  were completely unjustand unwarranted.Turkey therefore welcomes the interim accordconcluded between Macedonia and Greece on 13September 1995. We are encouraged by this development which promises to hold the key to the normalization ofrelations between these two neighbouring countries.It is not inconceivable that neighbouring countriesmay have bilateral problems. The same also holds true forTurkey and Greece. And we believe that it is only naturalthat these problems should be overcome through ameaningful  comprehensive and result-oriented dialogueand mutual goodwill. Such a dialogue will not only servethe best interests of both nations  but will also contribute34to a climate of peace  stability and prosperity in our region.We remain ready to address the whole range of issues thatstand between us in a constructive manner.As in the Balkans  legality and legitimacy have yet tobe restored throughout the Caucasus region. Despiteexisting differences and ongoing conflicts  we hope that thepeoples of this region will display the courage to lookahead. The countries of the region should understand thata just and viable peace has much to offer. Only then willshared prosperity be within reach and only then willdemocracy and the rule of law take root. That is our visionfor this region. But this vision can become a reality onlywhen those who continue to violate international law heedthe calls of the Security Council and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  as containedin relevant resolutions and decisions. Injustice andaggression cannot and should not be rewarded.Regrettably  the main obstacle to peace and stability inthe region continues to be the occupation of one fifth ofAzerbaijani territory by Armenian forces. As a result  morethan 1 million Azeris have been displaced. We reiterate ourcall for the immediate  unconditional and completewithdrawal of the occupying forces. We are determined tocontribute to the efforts within the OSCE Minsk Group fora peaceful settlement and for the reversal of theconsequences of aggression. In this regard  we look forwardto the creation of an OSCE multinational peace-keepingforce based on the decisions of the Budapest Summit  aforce to which we remain ready to contribute.Turkey also continues to follow developments inGeorgia very closely. We hope to see the establishment ofpeaceful conditions in this friendly and neighbourly countrywithout further delay. We are committed to the peaceprocess in that country. With this in mind  we are activelyparticipating in the work of the United Nations ObserverMission in Georgia (UNOMIG).The dramatic situation in Afghanistan  a country withwhich we have strong historical bonds  deeply worries us.The ongoing fratricidal conflict has added to the sufferingsof millions of innocent civilians. We are equally concernedwith the ominous possibility that this conflict may acquirea regional dimension. We regret that the earlier efforts ofAmbassador Mestiri have been rendered ineffective despitethe commitments of all the warring parties. We hope thatthe recently renewed efforts of Ambassador Mestiri  alongwith those of the Organization of the Islamic Conference(OIC)  will pave the way for a viable settlement based onthe unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.Turkey is located at the crossroads of continents andcultures. The post-cold-war geopolitics of Eurasia havegiven us a pivotal role in this region. Most of the newlyindependent States of the Balkans  the Caucasus andCentral Asia have historical  cultural  fraternal andlinguistic ties with Turkey. With a keen sense of historyand moral obligation  we have been striving to exert ourshare of the efforts needed for the harmonization ofcivilizations. To this end  as well as to contribute toefforts aimed at preventing the spread of ethnic conflictsand hegemonic tendencies  we have been active inendeavours to develop cooperative regional initiatives.The Black Sea Economic Cooperation and theenlargement of the Economic Cooperation Organizationare cases in point. In addition  since the beginning of1992 we have implemented an economic assistancepackage in over 50 countries on three continents.As regards the Cyprus issue  we regret that despitethe existence of sufficient material for a just and viablesolution  as well as for the implementation of the packageof confidence-building measures proposed by the UnitedNations  the negotiating process still appears to beblocked. President Denktas took initiatives to facilitatethis process  reaffirmed his commitment to a bicommunal bizonal federal solution and expressed his readiness toimplement the package of confidence-building measuresin the manner set out by the Secretary-General. He alsoproposed other good-will measures and invited the GreekCypriot leader to the negotiating table. Regrettably  theGreek Cypriot side did not respond to this constructiveapproach.The Greek Cypriot side continues to reject theimplementation of the confidence-building measures andto set preconditions for the resumption of the talks. It isincreasingly distancing itself from the negotiating processby shifting the focus to European Union membership witha view to altering the established parameters of a UnitedNations-sponsored overall settlement.Despite these discouraging developments  we stillbelieve that both sides in the island could find ways andmeans to reconcile their differences on the basis of theestablished parameters. To this end  we reiterate oursupport for the good offices mission of theSecretary-General and continue to encourage a freelynegotiated settlement.The momentum gained in the Middle East peaceprocess makes us optimistic that confrontation can bereplaced by cooperation. The Israeli-Palestinian and the35ensuing Israeli-Jordanian agreements are historic turningpoints for the installation of a new way of thinking in theregion. The road  however  is still full of stumbling blocks.As we all know  there have been violent attempts byextremists on all sides to undermine the peace process.Despite these attempts  it is vitally important that the partieskeep to their commitments and continue on their journey ofhope.Tomorrow  another historic agreement between Israeland Palestine will be signed in Washington. I hope toattend the signing ceremony. I wish to commend thearchitects of this interim agreement for their great courageand determination. We fully support this remarkableachievement.For over five years now  the international communityhas been expecting Iraq to comply fully with therequirements of all the relevant Security Councilresolutions. Meanwhile  as reported by the Chairman of theUnited Nations Special Commission  the recent revelationsof the Iraqi authorities on their operational capability toconduct biological warfare have created a credibilityproblem for Iraq within the Security Council. We hope thatIraq will take definite measures to restore internationalconfidence in its future cooperation with the Commissionwithin the framework of Security Council resolution 687(1991). Furthermore  the implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 986 (1995) would  in our view  be asource of relief  albeit limited  for the Iraqi people. Here  Iwould like to reiterate unreservedly the firm position whichwe have expressed from this rostrum on many occasions:We attach the utmost importance to the territorial integrityand unity of Iraq. This is vital for peace and stability in theMiddle East.I should also like to stress that  in no circumstances will Turkey allow terrorist activities emanating fromnorthern Iraq.Terrorism poses one of the greatest threats tohumanity in our age. It is also a threat to internationalpeace and security. Terrorism violates fundamental humanrights  particularly the right to life. It aims to destroy thefoundations of civil society. We must join our forces tofight back vigorously. This requires effective internationalcooperation. Accordingly  the United Nations has a centralrole to play in our common struggle against terrorism. TheGeneral Assembly resolutions on human rights andterrorism — resolutions 48/122 and 49/185 — and on theDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate InternationalTerrorism — resolution 49/60 — are significant milestoneswhich lay the groundwork for our cooperation. We mustalso introduce a plan of action for their successfulimplementation.Similarly  the United Nations should continue to playits role in preventing the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction which pose another major threat to humanity.In this vein  preserving the integrity of  and fullcompliance with  existing arms-control and disarmamentinstruments at regional and global levels are of primaryimportance.This year we are celebrating the United NationsYear for Tolerance. The promotion of a culture oftolerance is vital for consolidating democracy and forpreventing ethnic conflicts. There is also a growingawareness that development  peace and democracy areinterlinked. People-centred development aimed at ensuringuniversal security based on equality and sustainability isthe imperative of our times.In this connection I wish to emphasize the emergingglobal consensus in support of a common plan of actiontowards a better world resulting from the majorinternational conferences  which began in Rio de Janeiroin 1992  continued in Vienna  Cairo  Copenhagen  NewYork and Beijing. We know that we still have a long roadto travel in reconciling opinions and identifying commonsolutions. The implementation of the conclusions of theseconferences is and should be our priority.The last of these major United Nations conferences the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements(Habitat II)  will be held in June 1996 in Istanbul. Thefact that more than one billion people are inadequatelyhoused makes the subject of the Conference all the moresignificant. The City Summit in Istanbul will be a majorstage in the assessment of the dimensions of this problemand in searching for viable solutions. Participation at thehighest level would contribute greatly to the success ofthis important Conference.In conclusion  let me repeat my opening call to theinternational community: we must build on our past tofashion a new vision  a new commitment  a new plan ofaction for a better world. Our plan of action shouldembody our best values  our noblest dreams  our mostambitious aspirations. To do less is to surrender todespair. The people of the world should know thatgenocide is not inevitable. Aggression is not inescapable.Poverty is not unavoidable. But the responsibility falls onall of us. We cannot escape the challenge. We must36embrace it and not falter in creating a United Nations thatis more responsive to our hopes and expectations  a UnitedNations that will remain true to the vision of its founders."
"161",7062,"TZA",50,1995,"It is a great honourfor me to speak on behalf of my delegation  since myForeign Minister is currently campaigning in theimpending presidential and parliamentary elections.Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your electionas President of the historic fiftieth session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. You bring to this office awealth of experience and rich intellectual and diplomaticskill which assure us of a fruitful conclusion of the workbefore the session. And  above all  my delegationapplauds your sensitivity to development issues.A well-deserved tribute is also due to yourdistinguished predecessor  Mr. Amara Essy  the ForeignMinister of Côte d’Ivoire  who successfully presided overthe forty-ninth session.At this juncture  I would like to pay tribute toSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whoseindefatigable efforts in the search for peace anddevelopment are very well appreciated by myGovernment and the people of Tanzania. We also salutethe selfless efforts and commitment of the overwhelmingmajority of the Secretariat staff in the service of theinternational community.My delegation wishes to reiterate Tanzania’s firmconviction that the United Nations is all of us - itsMembers. It does not exist apart from us  nor should it beused by one Member or group of Members to thedetriment of the wishes and hopes of the internationalcommunity. It can do only what we  its Members  areprepared to do  acting together.This is not to say that our Organization is perfectand sacrosanct  and therefore beyond criticism. On thecontrary  much as we derive satisfaction from the fact thatthe United Nations has survived 50 difficult years  thereis plenty of scope to re-examine its role  especially now as we are on the threshold of the next millennium.Work in this direction has already started  and it hasbeen covered in the comprehensive report of theSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. The11report draws our attention to the work under way and whatneeds to be done about problems which threateninternational peace and security. It is up to nation Stateswhich are Members of the United Nations to reflect on  andassess the role of  the only universal organization at thedisposal of all humankind.Undoubtedly the United Nations has been doing thebest possible in the pursuit of the lofty ideals of theCharter — in particular  in regard to maintaininginternational peace; economic and social advancement forall peoples  and enhancing human rights. While loudlyfaulted on its peace-keeping role  the silent achievements ofthe United Nations agencies  including the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF)  the World Health Organization(WHO)  the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization (UNESCO)  the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (FAO)  the InternationalLabour Organization (ILO)  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP)  the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and theUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization(UNIDO)  need not be simply taken for granted.Even in terms of peace-keeping operations  we onlyneed to ask why it was possible to succeed in Namibia Cambodia  El Salvador  South Africa and Mozambique  andwhy prospects are now brightening in Angola  under UnitedNations leadership  while we have not quite succeeded inSomalia  Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina.As I speak  conflicts are raging unabated in the world especially in parts of Africa  the Balkans and the Caucasus.A lot of work is yet to be done in the area ofpeace-keeping. Every effort must be made to enhance thecapacity of the United Nations along the lines described inthe 1992 “An Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277) and itssupplement (A/50/60)  issued in January this year.The real problem with the United Nations rests withthe new post-cold-war era. The promises of peace haveeluded us and as a result we are still “in the woods”regarding the international community’s ability to managenon-military transnational issues  including development environmental degradation and inequalities within andbetween nations.One point of grave concern to my delegation is thatthe new world order — if there is order at all — has tendedto perpetuate the situation in which the wealthy andpowerful nation-States dominate and seek to exert undueinfluence on the United Nations. Consequently  UnitedNations reform is urgent and imperative. The thrust ofthis reform must be to maintain and enhance thedemocratic values of the Charter of the United Nationsand translate them into reality throughout the work of theOrganization. We must jealously guard the central role ofthe General Assembly  in which all Member States regardless of size or wealth  have an equal say. Carefulattention should be given to the functioning of theSecurity Council. We must ensure that the Council actswithin and in accordance with the Charter and that itsmembership reflects the realities of our times  taking intoaccount the tremendous expansion from 51 MemberStates in 1945 to 185 in 1995.In welcoming the report of the General Assembly’sOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council  my delegation restates the need to havedeveloping countries of Africa  Asia and Latin Americaand the Caribbean represented in the Council  in terms ofboth permanent and non-permanent seats. Secondly  notonly is transparency in the functioning of the Councilnecessary  but there must also be a regularized system ofreporting to  and consultation with  the General Assembly.Thirdly  the veto power has outlived its usefulness. Itshould be abolished  since it is a negation of democraticprinciples to empower any one member  or group ofmembers  to decide on the vital issues of peace andsecurity without due regard to the sensitivity and wishesof the majority.The reform process under way should focus also onrestoring the Economic and Social Council to its intendedhigh status as the organ for bringing all internationaleconomic and social affairs under the strategic control ofthe United Nations  and here I refer to Article 63 of theCharter. My delegation believes that the governance ofthe Bretton Woods institutions should be democratized along with their internal decision-making mechanisms.Let me conclude the question of reform by quotingthe very apt perception of the South Centre:“The opposition to a strong and dynamic UnitedNations is political and profoundly ideological  andis largely concentrated in a few States whoseestablishments prefer not to strengthen a forum inwhich their domestic and global policies can bechallenged or trimmed. But the United Nationsexists for all humankind  not just a handful ofMember States representing a small minority of the12world’s population ... . This is not a time for despairbut for determined efforts to rekindle the UnitedNations original inspirations and to inject a new senseof purposeful direction ... to help fulfil the aspirationsof many millions of people throughout the world.”The financing of the United Nations by Member Statesis also badly in need of reform. As we meet here  ourOrganization is on the brink of bankruptcy. As of earlyAugust  unpaid assessed contributions stood at $3.9 billion.My delegation is in agreement with the Secretary-Generalwhen he laments that“there is no use talking about reshaping theresponsibilities of the United Nations unless theresources are there to carry out those responsibilities”.It is urgent that action be taken to make good on latepayments of assessed contributions  for both the regularbudget and peace-keeping operations  without anypreconditions. Having said that  my delegation believes that on the one hand  the principle of financing the UnitedNations should be on the basis of relative capacity to pay and secondly  that other options should be explored thatwould lessen overdependence on the policy inclinations ofa few Members.I should like now to turn to conflicts closest to theheart of the Government and people of Tanzania: thesituations in neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi. It isheartening to note that the situation in Rwanda is graduallyreturning to normal following the end of genocide and thefratricidal war of July 1994. Tanzania  in the true spirit ofgood-neighbourliness  salutes the new government’s effortsto consolidate peace  rebuild State institutions and makenational reconciliation a reality on the basis of the ArushaPeace Agreement.Tanzania  besides facilitating political mediation forthe two neighbouring countries  has always readilywelcomed Rwandese and Burundi peoples fleeing atrocitiesin their homelands. The Government is anxious that thenow more than one million refugees concentrated in thewestern part of the country should be assisted to returnhome as soon as possible  but it should be sooner ratherthan later. It is a huge burden of immense proportions. MyGovernment is appreciative of the international assistancethat is directed to the refugees and to Tanzania. However the ideal solution is to facilitate their speedy return to theircountries of origin so that they may become part of thereconstruction and reconciliation efforts. To do otherwise isto postpone the problem and sow the seeds of futureconflicts and mistrust.Worse still  long-term damage to the environment isnow a reality. Urgent measures are required to prevent thearea of concentration from being stripped bare of trees.Pressure on the already overstretched infrastructure andsocial services remains overwhelming. This humanitariancatastrophe must not be allowed to go on indefinitely. MyGovernment believes that the reconstruction efforts beingput in place must have a component for the return ofrefugees.No effort should be spared to help the twoneighbouring countries create an environment conduciveto the return of their peoples. In this connection  we takenote of the Secretary- General’s efforts to convene aGreat Lakes region conference on security  stability anddevelopment  in line with the decisions of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and SecurityCouncil. But my Government is of the view thatcommensurate efforts should first be made to implementthe Nairobi and Bujumbura declarations on stability andthe situation in the refugee camps. We also urge theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees and other organizations on the ground to extendto the region the quick impact programmes that arecurrently being undertaken in Mozambique and Somalia.These programmes are aimed at meeting the reintegrationand rehabilitation needs of returnees on their arrivalhome.Mention should also be made of my Government’sreadiness to cooperate in establishing the seat of theInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda at Arusha innorthern Tanzania. The judges have since been appointed and the Registrar of the Tribunal is already in Tanzaniaas part of the preparatory team. It is my delegation’s viewthat an early start of the Tribunal’s proceedings should goa long way towards helping the healing process inRwanda.Concerning Burundi  we commend the work of thepeace mission of the Organization of African Unity andappeal to the leaders of all parties to rise above parochialinterests and work in the larger interest of their country Africa and the world.My delegation is especially encouraged by thepositive developments in Angola  which  as we heardfrom its Foreign Minister when he addressed the currentsession  is finally headed towards peaceful settlement13under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol and the BicesseAccords. We are also hopeful that the deployment of theUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEMIII) will be speeded up  to ensure that the peace processremains on course.Regarding Liberia  we are encouraged by the recentdevelopments by which the OAU and the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) inparticular have secured agreement among faction leadersaimed at a peaceful resolution of the long-simmering civilwar. The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia alsodeserves our appreciation for its contribution. Consequently it is our hope that the positive developments in Liberia willimpact on the restive situation in neighbouring SierraLeone.Regrettably  four years on  the internationalcommunity has yet to implement the United Nations peaceplan calling for a referendum in Western Sahara. Theparties concerned  Morocco and the Polisario Front  need tosummon their political will and  without undueprevarication  cooperate fully with the United Nations inspeeding up the process.Africa has received with anger reports of recentmercenary interference in the Comoros. The perpetration ofsuch a dastardly act must not be countenanced by theinternational community  in particular the United Nations.My delegation supports the OAU call for the speedy andunconditional restoration of the constitutional order in thatAfrican country and would also wish to recall the GeneralAssembly’s resolution on the sovereignty of the IslamicFederal Republic of the Comoros over the island ofMayotte.We welcome progress in the Middle East situation.The signing in Washington of the latest agreement betweenthe Government of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization represents an important step towards theimplementation of the Declaration of Principles. We hopeprogress will also be made on the other fronts inaccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973).As for the Balkans  my delegation supports UnitedNations peace-keeping and other international efforts aimedat finding a lasting solution to the conflict in the formerYugoslavia. We urge all parties to the conflict to invest ina political settlement and to resist the temptation of amilitary solution.The continuing threat of hunger and poverty toworld peace and security cannot be overemphasized.Their impact on the developing countries is made clear bythe stagnant or negative rates of economic growth anddeclining real per capita incomes in most of the South especially in the least developed countries  includingTanzania. As the Administrator of the United NationsDevelopment Programme said recently:“Poverty is growing faster than population.There are scores of countries where progress isgoing backwards rather than forwards. Richcountries are not going to be able to build a wallaround themselves and shut themselves off. Theseproblems don’t need passports.”Internal and external factors alike have contributedto the underdevelopment of the largest segment of theworld. The debt crisis  depressed prices of primarycommodities  protectionist measures  the inadequate flowof direct foreign investment and financial and technicalassistance  and deteriorating terms of trade are but a fewof the factors adversely affecting socio-economicperformance in most of these countries.It is with this frustrating situation in mind that weintend to continue participating in the work of the AdHoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on AnAgenda for Development. It must become a true vehiclefor ending poverty the world over. Other supportiveUnited Nations agencies  especially UNCTAD  which willbe holding its ninth conference in South Africa next year and UNIDO should be accorded their due importance bythe international community as true instruments ofdevelopment.During the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting onthe Mid-term Global Review of the Implementation of theProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s  there was some North-South meeting ofminds on what Governments ought to do individually andtogether to reverse the trend of underdevelopment. MyGovernment reaffirmed its commitment to continueimplementing socio-economic reforms consideredbeneficial to our people. Inevitable difficulties aside  thefocus is on sectors concerned with agriculture  industry finance  civil service  trade and privatization.At the same time  we are undertaking politicalreforms which are essential not only for good governance but also for the creation of the necessary environment foreconomic management and sustainable growth. This14exercise culminates in the multi-party national elections thatwill take place towards the end of this month. Theunderstanding and cooperation of our traditional donorcountries have been instrumental in supplementing our ownefforts. We also count on the international community’scommitment to implement fully existing programmes suchas the United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s and the conclusions of a series ofUnited Nations world conferences  including the FourthWorld Conference on Women  successfully concluded inBeijing  China  last month.In conclusion  let me refer to two other importantdevelopments since the forty-ninth session. First  regardingdisarmament  we hope that the controversial indefiniteextension last May of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons will lead to total nuclear disarmamentand the immediate cessation and complete elimination ofnuclear testing. Secondly  we urge the internationalcommunity to iron out differences over how to constitutethe membership of the International Seabed AuthorityCouncil  in order to formalize the work of this importantinstrument  the United Nations Convention on the Law ofthe Sea.Finally  my delegation is privileged to be a part of thishistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly  whosework should further reaffirm our commitment tomultilateralism. We look forward to celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations later this month  whenwe will be called upon to reflect together on how best toequip our Organization on the eve of the twenty-firstcentury. Nevertheless  it is important to bear constantly inmind the fact that  for developing countries and especiallythe least developed among them  it is not a time ofrejoicing. I can do no better than to quote the address ofmy President  Ali Hassan Mwinyi  to the General Assemblyat its forty-ninth session  in which he said:“A supportive international environment is crucialif we are to attain sustained economic growth indeveloping countries  especially in the least developedones. The United Nations must be able to play a muchgreater role in this matter because  unlike the BrettonWoods institutions  the United Nations is universal; itsprogrammes operate everywhere; and it does notignore countries.” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Forty-ninth session  Plenary Meetings 16th meeting  p. 5)"
"162",7105,"UGA",50,1995,"Allow me on behalf of theUgandan delegation to convey our warm greetings toMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on the occasion of hiselection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly. His election does great honour to hiscountry  Portugal  with which Uganda enjoys very cordialrelations. We are confident that Mr. Freitas do Amaral willguide the Assembly’s deliberations to a successfulconclusion.Allow me also to pay special tribute to His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  Foreign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire  for theskilful manner in which he presided over the work of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I salute the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts in theservice of our Organization.Fifty years ago  in the aftermath of the SecondWorld War  with its destructive nationalism  economicand social depression and the attendant social dislocation the United Nations was established. It was founded bymen and women who were determined to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war. They created theUnited Nations as the only universal internationalorganization that would exist to cope with globalproblems and ensure that the international communityenjoyed peace and prosperity. The United Nations Charterand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights providedthe bedrock for a new system of rights and obligations forthe promotion of international peace and security.The new order  organized on the basis of universalityand sovereign equality  was intended to encompass allnations  large and small  strong and weak  in order topromote the well-being of all peoples. The United Nationsthus emerged as a beacon of hope out of the ruins anddarkness of the Second World War. Today this visionremains as valid as it was 50 years ago. It is for thatreason that we reaffirm our confidence in theOrganization and its global mandate.In the five decades of the existence of the UnitedNations  the world has witnessed remarkable changes. Thecommunications revolution and the globalization of theworld economy have transformed the world into a globalvillage and have increased interdependence amongnations. The cold war  which dominated the post-War era ended  with the favourable dramatic transformation ofEast-West relations. Over 100 States which were colonialdependencies in 1945 achieved independence. We alsowitnessed the birth of a free  non-racial and democraticSouth Africa and the elimination of the obnoxious systemof apartheid.While the end of the cold war has reduced tensionbetween the major Powers and has facilitated the resolutionof a number of regional conflicts  we continue to witnessthe proliferation of intra-State conflicts. These are newchallenges which call for more innovative approaches andwhich underscore the continuing relevance of the UnitedNations.We believe that the United Nations should address ina concrete and decisive manner the issue of socio-economicdevelopment  without which peace and security cannot besustained. The United Nations and the internationalcommunity have to renew their resolve to eradicate povertyand deprivation. This spectre of poverty and deprivation isrampant in Africa and in the least developed countries. Weshould act collectively and decisively to change thissituation. The fiftieth anniversary celebrations are a fittingoccasion to make this solemn commitment.It is no coincidence that our region  Africa  which isthe least developed in the world  is also the most affectedby strife and conflict. In order to put an end to this we needto foster a comprehensive approach which addresses theroot causes of these conflicts and consolidates andguarantees durable peace and security. To this end  wemust  first of all  boost our capacity to anticipate andprevent conflicts before they occur  through preventivediplomacy. Secondly  we should be prepared to respondswiftly to emergency situations. And lastly  we mustconsolidate the peace by putting in place recovery andrehabilitation programmes in order to create the economicconditions for peace and stability.In addition to this  there should be increasedrecognition of the role of the affected regions in theformulation of appropriate responses. It is for this reasonthat we consider the establishment of the Organization ofAfrican Unity mechanism for conflict prevention management and resolution a timely and appropriateinitiative. The Organization of African Unity decision to putin place a Central Organ for that mechanism was an equallypositive development. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to render the requisite financial and technicalsupport to complement Africa’s efforts to make theseinstitutions work.We salute the return of peace to Cambodia  Haiti Mozambique and Angola  and we are encouraged by thepositive developments in Liberia  Bosnia and Herzegovinaand the Middle East. We commend the steps being takenby the Government in Rwanda to restore normalcy andnational reconciliation  and we call for expeditious andfull activation of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.We believe that it is possible to contain the situationin Burundi and avoid the replication of the genocide thatwas perpetrated in Rwanda last year. We continue to beconcerned about the situation in Somalia and call forreconciliation among the parties to the conflict there.As regards Western Sahara  we urge all parties toexercise the statesmanship necessary to prepare the wayfor a just and durable solution. In order to consolidate andgive hope to all these troubled parts of the world theinternational community must render all necessarysupport. We in Uganda will continue to contribute toconflict resolution  peacemaking and peace-keeping within our capabilities.The threat posed by the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction remains a matter of grave concern to thisOrganization. We welcome the conclusion of the Reviewand Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Thisshould strengthen the non-proliferation regime. If that isto be fully realized  it should be complemented by theentry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. It isdeplorable that  in spite of the indefinite extension of theNPT  some countries have continued to carry out nucleartests. This goes against the letter and the spirit of theunderstanding on the indefinite extension of thenon-proliferation Treaty.We note the progress made so far in the negotiationson a comprehensive test-ban Treaty  and we urge its earlyconclusion. We welcome various regional initiativesaimed at establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and wesupport the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zonein Africa as a contribution to global disarmament efforts.In both its domestic and its foreign policy  Ugandaaccords high priority to the observance of human rights.We have entrenched in the new Constitution a humanrights commission as an institutional framework for thedevelopment and observance of human rights. We wishto express our appreciation to all countries and institutionsthat have supported us in our efforts to develop andstrengthen human-rights monitoring and enforcementcapabilities.We have just completed the process of establishing aConstitution  aimed at consolidating the rule of law. Thenew Constitution was enacted on 22 September 1995 by ademocratically elected Constituent Assembly and is due tobe promulgated shortly. The Constitution paves the way tothe holding of general and presidential elections  which arescheduled for early next year. This will enhance theempowerment of the people to take charge of their owngovernance and their own destiny.The Government has made efforts to empower ourpeople  especially women  young people and othervulnerable groups. Within the framework of the bottom-upResistance Council system  the population has beenmobilized and provided with modest capital —entandikwa — as part of our national endeavour to createproductive and income-generating opportunities in order toimprove the earning capacity of the family and  thus improve the living conditions of the people.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  we should reaffirm our commitment to the primacyof the democratic principle at all levels  including that ofthe United Nations. It is in this context that Ugandasupports restructuring of the Security Council to make itmore transparent and democratic in its decision-making  andmore representative of the increased membership of theUnited Nations.In the same vein  we urge that the Bretton Woodsinstitutions take into account the problems  concerns andaspirations of developing countries in the formulation anddesign of policies and programmes in order to respond totheir social and economic needs.Many developing countries continue to be adverselyaffected by the uneven and inequitable trends in the globaleconomy. These trends have widened further the gapbetween the rich and the poor countries. The socio-economic situation in Africa is critical and continues todeteriorate. It is characterized by a weak physical andinstitutional infrastructure  underdeveloped humanresources  epidemics and disease  lack of adequate shelter poverty and deprivation. All these factors undermine peaceand stability  and this  in turn  hampers growth anddevelopment.We have undertaken bold economic and politicalreforms in Uganda with a view to creating anenvironment conducive to the consolidation of social andeconomic progress. These reforms have beencharacterized by the attainment of basic macro-economicstability and the enhancement of democracy and the ruleof law  and they have stimulated reasonable economicgrowth and social progress. In spite of these modestachievements our countries continue to depend heavily onthe export of primary commodities  which do not attractfair prices in international markets. There has also beena steady decline in the availability of both domestic andexternal resources for development. To compound thesituation  most of our countries are saddled with heavydebts  the servicing of which is no longer sustainable.All these and other factors have contributed to themarginalization of Africa and have made it difficult forthe continent to benefit from the positive impulses ofglobalization and the liberalization of world trade. Theseissues were reviewed at the high-level segment of theEconomic and Social Council  which addressed the themeof African development and implementation of the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa inthe 1990s  and in the ongoing discussion here at theUnited Nations about the mid-term review of the GlobalProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s.The two meetings agreed that the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990sand the global Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries for the 1990s remained largelyunimplemented. We should seize the opportunity providedby the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to decideon concrete actions that will give hope to the peoples ofAfrica and of the least developed countries.The stagnation and decline in official developmentassistance (ODA) are disturbing. We are equallyconcerned at the wavering commitment towards theeleventh replenishment of the international developmentassistance fund. We urge our development partners tofulfil the internationally agreed obligations with regard toofficial development assistance. This would be a fittingand tangible show of solidarity with Africa and  indeed the least developed countries.Our external indebtedness and debt-servicingobligations have reached unsustainable levels. Wetherefore call for an urgent once-and-for-all development-oriented initiative on all types of debts  which could3include the following: first  an enhancement of the Naplesterms and an improvement in its accessibility; and secondly  a significant initiative on multilateral debts including a softening of the financing terms of InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) loans to make it IDA-comparable.These initiatives could be achieved through the sale of IMFgold stocks and by creating an appropriate debt-relieffacility. We believe these actions will release much-neededresources  which are currently going into the debt-servicingof development activities  including the eradication ofpoverty.At the moment Africa accounts for a meagre2.4 per cent of world merchandise trade. In the context ofthe Uruguay Round agreements  it is estimated that thecontinent could lose up to $2.6 billion annually in thecourse of the initial years of the implementation of theagreement. By contrast  global trade will be boosted by$500 billion annually. The legitimate concerns of Africaand the least developed countries have been identified andspecific measures to address them have been recommendedby both the Ministerial Decision of Marrakesh and theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD). For Africa to benefit from the liberalization ofworld trade  these measures  including capacity-building compensation  enhanced-market-access provisions andfinancial assistance towards institutional and economictransformation  must be implemented fully and withoutdelay.To assist in the follow-up and implementation of theUruguay Round agreements  two institutions are significantand must be strengthened and supported — UNCTAD asthe institution with a specific focus on trade anddevelopment issues  especially as they relate to developingcountries; and the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization (UNIDO) because of its role in the promotionof industrialization.We note the ongoing discussions under the open-endedad hoc Working Group of the General Assembly on anAgenda for Development. It is our hope that this processwill generate specific measures and commitments to addressthe specific problems of developing countries. We alsohope that it will help to forge consensus on developmentwhich takes into account  and builds on  the commitmentsand programmes of action already agreed on in the seriesof United Nations conferences that have been held since1990.Uganda is concerned about the serious problem posedby the rapid growth and spread of water hyacinth on LakeVictoria and other lakes and rivers in the Nile valley.This has adversely affected the ecological balance of ourwaters and the livelihood of our populations  who dependon fishing as a means of survival. Besides  the hyacinthis threatening to choke the Owen Falls Dam — our onlymajor source of hydroelectric power. It has disrupted ourwater transportation system  which is very important fora land-locked country such as Uganda. We make anurgent appeal to the international community to extendsupport to enable us to address the problem of waterhyacinth.We consider South-South cooperation to be animportant aspect of development cooperation. The sharingand pooling of information  knowledge  markets andresources are some of the ways in which developingcountries can promote their growth and development. Tothis end we are active participants in all arrangements forcooperation in our subregion and support theestablishment of the African Economic Community. Webelieve that these arrangements and the institutionsestablished to promote them  such as the South Centre should be supported by the international community.The United Nations has over the years provided aforum for intensive dialogue on all issues. Through aseries of global conferences  it has helped to forgeinternational consensus on global problems — issues suchas the environment  population  the status of women human rights  development  and many more. Itsspecialized agencies have made an invaluable contributionin their respective spheres of activity and have providedhumanitarian and development assistance to many parts ofthe world. In recent years  despite drastic limitations onpersonnel and resources  the United Nations hasresponded to the dramatic rise in the demand for peace-keeping and other emergency operations throughout theworld. These are laudable accomplishments  which shouldstrengthen our resolve and our confidence in support ofthe Organization.As we stand in the twilight of the twentieth centuryand approach the dawn of the new millennium  we shoulduse the occasion provided by the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations to strengthen the Organization. Weshould demonstrate our dedication to the Organization andits component parts by providing it with the resourcesnecessary for the accomplishment of its immensemandate. Our challenge is to bequeath to succeedinggenerations a democratic  transparent and more effectiveUnited Nations.4"
"163",7152,"UKR",50,1995,"I should like first of all tocongratulate the President of the General Assembly Mr. Freitas do Amaral  on his election to that high position.To guide the proceedings of the most representative organof the United Nations in its jubilee year is a great privilegefor a politician and diplomat  as well as for the country thathe represents. We hope that his vision of the future of theOrganization  contained in his opening remarks  will findsupport among Member States.The delegation of Ukraine also expresses its gratitudeto Mr. Amara Essy for successfully guiding the GeneralAssembly at its last session. Many years of closecooperation have bonded me with Minister Essy  whom Ihighly respect for his diplomatic and human qualities.In the historical calendar there are dates that can neverbe forgotten. The year 1945 is one such memorable time.Recently  we all commemorated together the fiftiethanniversary of the end of the Second World War. Thecalendar of international life is for ever interwoven with thehalf-century history of the United Nations.In paying tribute to the founders of the UnitedNations  Ukraine among them  our delegation would liketo note the leading role of President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt — one of the initiators of the creation of theuniversal Organization and the author of its very name —the United Nations. We are confident that the UnitedNations can work out an appropriate way in which to payrespect to this outstanding person.During the past half century the United Nations  asno other international organization  has acquiredcredibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace as a mediator and active participant in the peacefulsettlement of conflicts  and as a champion of humanrights. The United Nations has played a decisive role inthe decolonization and self-determination of peoples. TheUnited Nations has proved its viability  havingexperienced the difficult decades of the cold war  whenthe walls and the rostrum of its Headquarters oftenwitnessed the struggle of two opposing blocs. Ukraine —whose institutions of statehood were developing alongwith the United Nations and were fully established afterthe proclamation of independence in 1991 — feels theconsiderable support of the United Nations as well.Witness the dramatic events of the past quarter ofthe twentieth century  the pinnacle of the philosophictriangle of “peace-development-democracy” is peace. Andthe most illustrative example of this is the tragic conflictin the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This conflict  byits very nature  is due to all possible reasons: militantseparatism  ethnic confrontation  religious intolerance. Themost dangerous thing is the fact that  in terms of its scale developments and tragic consequences  this conflict hasturned into a real threat to international peace andsecurity. I think that for all of us  Members of the UnitedNations  the painful fact is that we are compelled againand again to return to this issue  even during the jubileefiftieth session of the General Assembly.United Nations peace-keeping operations in thisregion have revealed both positive and negative aspects ofinternational efforts. The Yugoslav example demonstrates in general  that rethinking the role of the United Nationsand adapting the role to current realities are proceedingvery slowly. Sometimes it seems as if the Organization iscontinuing to live by the inertia of the old mentality which does not allow it to use its potential effectively andmakes it appeal to other organizations for help. Besides we consider that most of the problems the United Nationsis facing in the former Yugoslavia are rooted in the non-12observance of at least a number of the major establishedprinciples of peace-keeping.In particular  this may apply to the principle ofimpartiality. Thus  a review of the discussions in theSecurity Council and the activities of the Contact Groupdoes not  unfortunately  give a sufficient basis for talkingabout real political impartiality in the positions of some oftheir members in regard to all parties to the post-Yugoslavconflict. As a result  international public opinion bases itselfon a policy of dual standards and biased assessments anddecisions  and this does not enhance the credibility of ourOrganization.It is universally recognized that success in the finalsettlement of any conflict depends on the will of thebelligerents and their readiness to engage in a dialogue andinternational mediation. At the same time  the consent ofthe conflicting parties to facilitate United Nations peace-keeping efforts was not always given. The taking of peace-keepers hostage by parties to the conflict in the formerYugoslavia makes us think seriously of the need toestablish a comprehensive mechanism for the use of forceand to enhance the protection of United Nations peace-keeping personnel. In this connection  Ukraine  whichinitiated the elaboration of the Convention on the Safety ofUnited Nations and Associated Personnel  calls upon allcountries to expedite the ratification of this document.At the same time  in spite of all the unprecedenteddifficulties and some miscalculations in conducting UnitedNations peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia we find it necessary to keep United Nations forces there.Accordingly  we should continue to seek means to bringabout a peaceful settlement of the conflict. It seems thattoday everyone agrees that there is no alternative to apolitical settlement. We welcome efforts in that direction particularly the recent intensification of relevant activitiesby the United States. We also believe that Russia can playa greater and constructive role in a peaceful settlement. Forits part  Ukraine  as a major contributor to the UnitedNations Protection Force  is ready to continue itscooperation with the United Nations in this field. I wouldlike to confirm that Kiev is ready  if necessary  to host ameeting of the leaders of the parties to the conflict with theparticipation of all the countries and internationalorganizations concerned. The President of Ukraine  LeonidKuchma  has sent letters with appropriate proposals to theleaders of Serbia  Croatia  and Bosnia and Herzegovina.The process of settling the Yugoslav conflict could  inour opinion  be intensified by expanding the composition ofthe Contact Group and studying new approaches. As anexample to follow  we note the international meeting onBosnia held on 21 July in London  in which thedelegation of Ukraine also took part.While highly appreciating the considerable personalcontribution of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghalito the philosophy of peace-keeping  we consider that newapproaches in this field require further practicaldevelopment  in particular the principle of utilizing therapid reaction force  which has already been quite activelyinvolved in the former Yugoslavia.The question of implementing the idea ofestablishing a United Nations stand-by force  in whichUkraine is ready to participate  is still outstanding.We consider preventive diplomacy  which hasdemonstrated its potential in the former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  to be one of the priority trends inthe development of United Nations peace-keepingactivities. In this context we are again proposingconsideration of the establishment within the UnitedNations  and specifically within the Office of theSecretary-General  of a standing council of internationalmediators  whose membership would includeinternationally recognized and authoritative politicalfigures.Economic sanctions continue to be an importantinstrument in United Nations conflict-settlement activities.In this field  we believe it is necessary to elaborate acomprehensive and detailed mechanism for theimplementation of sanctions which would also take intoconsideration all their potential consequences  includingthe negative impact on third countries. In our opinion  ithas now been demonstrated that the embargo regimeagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia iscounterproductive and has not attained the main objectiveof promoting peaceful settlement of the conflict. Ukraineconsiders that  along with the process of further politicalsettlement  the Security Council should lift economicsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which  in real terms  has already demonstrated itswillingness to assist in the restoration of peace. At thesame time  we proceed from the premise that mutual andsimultaneous recognition of the States that emerged in theterritory of the former Yugoslavia should be an importantcondition for the lifting of sanctions.The principle that no single State or regionalorganization can be granted the right to be the main13guarantor of peace and security in one region or anothershould continue to be a cornerstone of United Nationsconflict-prevention and crisis-management activities.Among the international community’s undertakings inthe past year we could list many important achievementswhich have become our common gains. Today  inWashington  the ceremony for the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement is taking place  and we want tocongratulate sincerely both parties and all those whocontributed to this achievement.I would also like to dwell on one accomplishmentwhich has significance for our country. The Conference onthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) was undoubtedly the main event since the lastsession in the field of arms control and disarmament. It issymbolic that this Conference took place within these walls.Its decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty isreally a historic achievement. I do not think it would begoing too far to say that Ukraine’s accession to the NPT asa non-nuclear weapon State  and our ratification of theSTART-1 Treaty and its entry into force played asubstantive role in making this event a reality. Thus Ukraine made its tangible contribution to the globalcause — freeing mankind from the most dangerousweapons of mass destruction. The voluntary renunciation bythe third largest nuclear State of this monster of thetwentieth century is unprecedented.The NPT is undoubtedly a key treaty among all theexisting treaties on arms control and disarmament  since itprovides an opportunity to consistently coordinate policiesin the field of nuclear disarmament  allowing non-nuclearStates to conduct a dialogue as equals with nuclear States.At the same time  I would like to emphasize that inUkraine’s opinion  in spite of the record-breaking numberof NPT participants — 179 countries — we cannot regarda situation as stable when States that build their security onthe possession of nuclear weapons and States that havenever had or have renounced them exist alongside eachother.In this connection  Ukraine attaches great importanceto the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test-bantreaty. Unfortunately  the world community has notmanaged to mark the UN’s fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations by concluding this treaty  but we share thehopes that the relevant talks will be successfully completedno later than 1996. In this context the necessity for allcountries to observe the moratorium on nuclear tests is ofspecial importance. Recent nuclear tests have arousedjustifiable concern in the world. Such actions are notconducive to enhancing the favourable internationalclimate that emerged after the end of the cold war.The huge existing arsenals of conventional weaponsand the danger they constitute for mankind put theseweapons on a par with weapons of mass destruction andrequire the same close attention. As of today  Ukraine isfulfilling its obligations under the Treaty on ConventionalArmed Forces in Europe. To support the initiativeadvanced by the General Assembly  the Government ofUkraine has declared a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines.The course of the development of history has vividlydemonstrated the interconnection and interdependencebetween the safeguarding of peace and security andeconomic and social development. In spite of significantachievements in this field  the present-day picture of theworld is far from being ideal. Problems of unemployment underdevelopment  poverty  social disintegration andisolation require urgent solutions. These problems areespecially acute for economies in transition that arecarrying out fundamental reforms.Ukraine  which inherited a heavy burden of problemsfrom the former USSR  is undergoing a painful period ofradical political and economic transformation. Having laidthe basic foundations of a democratic political system andcivil society over the past four years  Ukraine has entereda new stage of development. Last October  the Presidentof Ukraine  Leonid Kuchma  proclaimed a new economicpolicy based on the implementation of fundamentaleconomic reform. Now  our main efforts are aimed at thefurther strengthening of democratic foundations  thecreation of a socially oriented market economy  and theimplementation of an open  predictable and consistentforeign policy. The reform of the State system of divisionof power is continuing. In contrast to most post-Sovietcountries  we managed  without violent confrontation  tofind a way out of the constitutional impasse. Theimportant stage is ahead  namely the final drafting and theadoption of a new Constitution of Ukraine. A diversifiedsystem of external economic relations is being graduallyestablished. The process of integrating the nationaleconomy into the world economic space is beingintensified.At the same time  the Ukrainian economy continuesto suffer from a crisis phenomenon. Having charted acourse toward market reform and its rapidimplementation  Ukraine must seek its own national14model of market transformation. Today the establishment ofan effective system of social protection is the Government’sprincipal and most topical task.The most important priority for President Kuchma andthe Government of Ukraine continues to be the preservationof civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony in the country. Inits four years of independence  Ukraine has managed tosettle confrontational situations by peaceful political means.Ukraine’s achievements in the field of securing the rightsof national minorities are especially evident against thebackground of the numerous conflicts that unfortunatelycontinue to be a reality in the territory of the former SovietUnion.Ukraine’s national legislation in this sphere has earnedit high international marks  specifically from suchauthoritative organizations as the Council of Europe  ofwhich Ukraine hopes to become a member this year. But at the same time  we have problems in this sphere particularly with regard to repatriating the deported CrimeanTatar people and representatives of other nationalities.The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rightsof national minorities and indigenous peoples and hasestablished a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea. Butfor Ukraine  which faces conditions of economic crisis anda complicated financial situation and lacks the necessaryinfrastructure  services and mechanisms  the task ofaccommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriatedpersons appears too complicated. Solving these problemsrequires a complex approach: the mobilization andconsolidation of efforts at the national  regional and broaderinternational levels.In its international activities  Ukraine proceeds fromthe premise that stable development is a guarantor oflasting peace.At present  when economic reforms in Ukraine aregaining momentum  we are especially interested in thewidening of the activities of the United Nations and of itsspecialized agencies in the social and economic fields aimed at establishing conditions for the integration of theUkrainian economy and other economies in transition intothe world economic space. The United Nations is animportant instrument for promoting this process  and weappreciate the fact that the Members of this Organizationshow a deep understanding of the problems of countries intransition  including Ukraine.We believe that creating internal preconditions forUkraine’s steady and gradual development has aninternational dimension as well. Ukraine’s geo-politicalsituation transforms its efforts to build an economicallyviable State into an important factor in promotingguaranteed peace  stability and security — including inthe field of ecology — on the European continent.It was this deep understanding of globalinterdependence that dictated  in particular  the politicaldecision of President Kuchma to decommission theChernobyl nuclear-power plant by the year 2000. Nextyear marks the tenth anniversary of the Chernobylcatastrophe  which not only left deep scars on the lives ofthe present generation of Ukrainians  Belarussians andRussians  but also has a global perspective. We proposeto declare 1996 the Year of the Commemoration ofChernobyl and to organize special activities under theauspices of the United Nations. On the eve of this tragicanniversary  I should like once again to emphasize thatnuclear-safety problems and the decommissioning ofmalfunctioning and outdated industrial nuclear facilitiesare critical  and not only for Ukraine. We are convincedthat the time has come for a practical solution to theentire series of issues related to the accident  especially inview of the long-term nature of its aftermath. The soonerwe invest money in the solution of this problem  thesooner we will be able to overcome it  with fewernegative consequences for humanity. We expect that theinternational community’s support of Ukraine’s effortswill be directed not only at the decommissioning of theChernobyl power plant but also at solving the wholecluster of associated economic  social and ecologicalproblems. In particular  we would welcome wideinternational participation in establishing an internationalscientific-technological centre in Chernobyl.At the same time  I should like to emphasize thatUkraine retains a sense of realism with regard to thecapacity of the United Nations to solve our nationalproblems. We do not aim to compete with the lessdeveloped countries for the limited resources of theUnited Nations development system. We are ready andwilling to cooperate with all interested partners  and werely on the purposeful activity of the internationalcommunity aimed at creating favourable conditions forexpanding the access of Ukrainian exports to the worldmarket. We expect that the World Trade Organization which Ukraine is ready to join  will play an importantrole in the expansion and diversification of internationaltrade and economic relations.15Recently the financial problems of the United Nationshave had an acute political resonance. There can be onlyone conclusion: the existing financial system is incapable ofguaranteeing the effective functioning of the Organizationin the current situation and requires substantial reform.We fully understand that the financial crisis of theUnited Nations has been provoked not only by political andeconomic circumstances but also by the imperfect systemof apportionment of expenses  which is based on outdatedprinciples. Ukraine will actively support the adoption ofprogressive changes to the methods of determining the scaleof assessments and the special scheme of expenses forfinancing United Nations peace-keeping operations  with theaim of reflecting the principle of capacity to pay.Ukraine’s full participation in United Nations activitiesis impeded by its excessive contribution and its existingdebt for financing United Nations peace-keeping operations.The State  which for the benefit of the world communityhas taken political decisions to voluntarily renounce nuclearweapons and decommission the Chernobyl power plant should be able to concentrate its resources primarily on theimplementation of those decisions. Ukraine  whoseeconomy is undergoing an extremely difficulttransformation and which is also suffering economic lossesin the billions as a result of its strict compliance with thesanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  canby no means continue to be held hostage to the settlementof the financial problems of the United Nations.The world is changing. The cold-war confrontationbetween blocs  as well as bloc discipline  has becomehistory. The interdependence of States at the regional andglobal levels is increasing. Given the nature of moderninternational problems  we should be ready to face thechallenges of the new era. We need a strong and effectiveUnited Nations. Its renovation should encompass both thestructure itself and the character of its activities  inaccordance with the requirements of the new epoch. In ouropinion  a number of measures should be taken todemocratize the Security Council’s activity  in particular toincrease the legitimacy of its decisions and the transparencyof its work.On the whole  Ukraine supports the activity of theOpen-ended Working Group on the reform of the SecurityCouncil and hopes that the interests of all regional groups including  I should like to emphasize  the Group of EasternEuropean States  will be taken into consideration during thereform process. Ukraine also supports the proposals relatedto the improvement of the activities of the Economic andSocial Council. It stands for a reduction of the staff andthe enhancement of the efficiency of the activities of theSecretariat  and for a reduction in the number of items onthe agenda of the General Assembly.In conclusion  I should like to paraphrase a point ofcommon wisdom: when you criticize the reflection in themirror  you are criticizing yourself. The United Nationsneeds renovation — so we need to renovate ourselves.This Organization will not become more effective andinstrumental unless its Members show enough eagernessfor practical efforts. I would not want this Assembly inthe twenty-first century to listen again to wishful thinkingthat is not backed by our political will and readiness towork hard."
"164",7199,"URY",50,1995,"In this changed world that came out of theSecond World War — more global and interdependent —Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the vital roleplayed by the United Nations in the preservation of peaceand in solving the main problems affecting the world  andit wishes to confirm the validity of the enlightenedprinciples of the Charter  as sound today as they were 50years ago.During this period of time  Uruguay has brought themessage of its people and its Government to thisAssembly and to the peoples and the Governments ofbrotherly countries throughout the world. The content ofthat message has never varied: our conviction thatinternational peace can be achieved only through strictobservance of international law and resort to peacefulmeans of resolving conflicts; our certainty that only ademocratic system and scrupulous respect for humanrights can ensure the full spiritual and material fulfilmentof the individual; and our unfailing trust in thisOrganization  to whose creation Uruguay contributed half5a century ago and to which we have given  and willcontinue to give  its broadest support.Through all these years Uruguay has consistently heldto those principles  contributing with its initiatives and itsvotes to consolidating peace and ensuring that law andjustice take precedence over all else. We were the first toaccept without any conditions whatsoever the mandatoryjurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. We are aparty to most instruments for the protection of humanrights. We have contributed to peace-keeping operationssince they first began  and Uruguay is the United NationsMember contributing the greatest number of contingentsrelative to its population and the size of its armed forces.New realities and new international circumstancesmark the post-cold-war world  and the United Nations hashad to adapt its functions to the new demands  respondingto external circumstances through an imaginativeapplication of the Charter  which has kept the Organizationalive and valid throughout its history and has saved it fromobsolescence.The international community today facesunprecedented situations. Ethnic and religiousfundamentalism  international terrorism and drug traffickingmay not be new phenomena  but they have taken on fearfuldimensions by virtue of their access to powerful sources offinancing and the use of weapons of mass destruction. Thismakes it necessary for the international community toorganize itself efficiently to combat them  even on thebattlefield of modern technology. In addition  these factorsare combined with new political phenomena  such as thedismembering of multinational States  which has unleashedage-old ethnic and religious rivalries. These facts  togetherwith the increase in the number of members of theOrganization  most of them developing countries  and thelead roles played by certain States and regions  justify areform of certain institutional aspects of the Organization.All Charter reform or constitutional developmentresulting from established practice should tend to increasethe effectiveness of the Organization  avoiding at all costsresorting to formulas which limit its response capacity orwhich enshrine new inequalities among its Members.On previous occasions  Uruguay has spoken in favourof an expansion of the Security Council  seeking greaterdemocratization in that organ  which is vital for themaintenance of balance and world peace. But the changesmade must ensure that while achieving greater transparencyand representativeness in that body  that do not have anegative impact on its functioning and efficiency.In any event  the need to carry out institutionalreforms should not lead us to blame the frustrations andfailures of the Organization on the fact that theinstruments for carrying out its tasks are not appropriate.Whenever the political will of States was used to resolveproblems  the Organization was able to achieve itsobjectives without there being any need to change itsstructure or operation. Our efforts at reform consequently  should not lead us away from ourimmediate duty  which is to face with our current means imperfect though they may be  the serious conflicts whichare affecting international peace.We cannot but refer in the first instance to thatwhich affects the countries that emerged from the formerYugoslavia. It has been hard for some of the parties tounderstand that while a negotiated solution is difficult  amilitary solution is impossible.In the meantime  the civilian population continues tosuffer through the years — a population which hasbecome a permanent target of military action and thevictim of brutal manifestations of racial intolerance.Behind this tragedy  and to a certain extent explaining it lies the sad realization that United Nations resolutions arenot being complied with by some of the parties. Webelieve that the Organization should step up its action making maximum use of the political and legalmechanisms available to it under the Charter  to prevailupon Governments and authorities  directly or indirectlyinvolved in the conflict  to respect and abide by decisionsadopted.There is no doubt that the road to peace may presentextraordinary difficulties but it is never blocked entirely as may be seen from the negotiations to put an end to thelong and exhausting crisis in the Middle East. We mustwarmly congratulate those who have decided to replaceweapons with constructive dialogue  and express ouradmiration for the intelligence with which thesenegotiations are being conducted  especially thepersistence and inspiration with which the parties attemptto overcome  not only the extreme complexity of theproblem  but also  above all  the violent opposition whichhas tried to sabotage the peace process  resorting to themost cowardly and inhumane of means. The results arestill far from satisfactory but they are also far from beingnegligible. The international community is also duty-bound to encourage these efforts. This General Assembly6can contribute to this by avoiding including in itsresolutions on this item language which may have beenappropriate in the past  but which may be irritating at atime when a genuine spirit of peace prevails among all theauthorities concerned.The instruments for the second phase of the interimagreement on Palestinian self-rule has been anotherlandmark in the peace process  which the parties in questionhave been promoting with great resolve. With the signingof this historic agreement in Washington  we can say thatwe are closer to lasting peace in that tormented region.There is a common thread which runs throughout theseconflict situations. It is an element which makes thosesituations possible and which worsens them  and that is theavailability and sophistication of weapons. The internationalcommunity will not be able to prevent breaches of thepeace or avoid their far-reaching implications in terms ofthe loss of human lives and destruction  unless concretemeasures are adopted with regard to regulation of themanufacture and traffic in weapons. It is our duty torevitalize the mechanisms which have been established tothis end  and to create new negotiating bodies  were that tobe necessary  to achieve concrete results.Many developing countries  including Uruguay  a fewmonths ago decided on the indefinite extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as away of consolidating the process of progressivedisarmament in this field. We did so in the conviction ofthe good faith of the nuclear Powers  which argued infavour of the extension. Unfortunately  after that underground nuclear tests have continued by some Powers which has led our countries to lose confidence in theinstruments we signed  and has left us with a feeling offrustration and perplexity.A few days ago in New York  concerned over theseriousness of the situation with regard to those tests  thecountries signatories of the Treaty of Tlateloco in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean and the countries signatories ofthe Treaty of Rarotonga in the South Pacific  whichestablished nuclear-weapon-free zones  condemned thissituation and reiterated the need to put an end to all typesof nuclear tests so as to create a favourable climate for theconclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty which is being negotiated at the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva.While the end of the cold war has reduced politicaltension and the risk of global confrontation  there are otherdevelopments today that are more insidious but no lessthreatening to the peace and well-being of nations  suchas drug-trafficking and terrorism  and a lethal combinationof the two. Uruguay  where fortunately we have not seenthe worst manifestations of this problem  has taken partand intends to continue to participate intensively in thecooperative efforts to prevent and punish such acts andrelated crimes  in order to remedy their adverse effectsand to attack their social consequences. We support theconvening of an international conference on narcoticdrugs to focus on a comprehensive approach to theproblem  including the consumption  the production andthe trafficking of drugs  related crimes and the social andeconomic aspects of the problem.We are also undertaking maximum efforts topromote concrete national actions to counteract and fightagainst this problem  which could threaten our peacefulexistence and the stability of our institutions.On another subject  for some time now the factorswhich adversely affect the economic growth ofdeveloping countries have been identified and decried.Their nature and causes and effect have been examined and formulas have been discussed and proposed to solvethose problems  or at least to reduce the intolerable gapswhich exist in today’s economic world. After so manyyears of discussion  the overall picture remainsunchanged  although mention could be made of someisolated cases where dynamic centres of developmenthave emerged. The situation of the less advanced sectorsof mankind  where poverty and resulting hunger prevail where there is illness and illiteracy  this continues to bean unacceptable idea.The process of globalization of the world economyand the economic opening that has been developing at theglobal level in recent years have helped us to modernizesome of our production structures. Nevertheless  theinstability of the world’s financial markets poses apermanent threat to our economies. The transfer of majorfinancial resources to and from our markets causes greatinstability in capital flows in the world  leading toconcern and uncertainty  and threatens the accumulatedefforts of our peoples to establish a more just  moreorderly and more stable economic system.Given this situation  we need to find newmechanisms to create a more stable international financialsystem and a way to predict potential financial crises thatdo not impose regulations that hinder the capital flowsneeded for growth and investment.7The Group of Seven has pointed to the need to updatethe way in which the Bretton Woods Institutions operate inthe financial sphere. Our countries are willing and entitledto participate in alternative strategies to reform theseinstitutions that are vital to a world economy as globalizedas it is today.The establishment of the World Trade Organizationmarked the end of the longest and most complexnegotiations of recent years and a new stage of internationaltrade. If this new stage is going to lead to a more equitabledistribution of international trade  all States  particularlythose with the largest share in trade  must abide by the newrules of the game. Uruguay hopes that these rules will berespected  that protectionist policies and subsidies willdisappear and that barriers impeding international tradeliberalization and growth  especially trade in agriculturalproducts  will be broken down  as agreed in Marrakesh atthe conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.We recognize that as the international situation standsour development will largely depend on our own efforts.We attach great importance to international cooperation fordevelopment  but are aware that our problems will notdisappear merely through external assistance. Today  themajor challenge before us is the need to increase know-howand to apply it to development. Today  the onlycomparative advantages are those derived from scientificand technological progress  and a country’s relativecompetitiveness will be directly linked to its ability togenerate  adapt and apply its know-how and to providepermanent training for the population.In this context  the countries of the Common Marketof the South  known as MERCOSUR  are aware thataccording to the new world scheme integration processesare a fundamental aspect of an ability to compete efficientlywith other economic blocs. We are promoting integration inthe context of a philosophy of open regionalism. We arenot trying to turn MERCOSUR into an ivory tower — quitethe contrary  because as we strengthen and expand it we aretrying to promote links with other countries of the regionand looking for common ground while respecting theparticular nature and modalities of each country.We are also trying to strengthen ties with other areasof the developing world  in particular with our fellowcountries of the South Atlantic region. In this context Uruguay reaffirms the importance of the Zone of Peace andCooperation of the South Atlantic that was solemnlydeclared pursuant to resolution 41/11 of 27 October 1986.In this framework  we fully share the aims of thisdeclaration and see the zone as an important instrumentfor promoting cooperation in scientific  political  technicaland cultural areas.We are convinced that security and development areinseparable and interrelated  and that any progress interms of meeting the objectives of the zone willstrengthen cooperation between the States of Africa andof the Southern Cone of America. This commitment is allthe more evident in the support given by the States of thezone for the peace processes in Angola and Liberia andthe Bicesse and Abuja agreements respectively.Unsolved global problems continue to weigh heavilyon our agendas. There is general solidarity with regard toenvironmental protection  because we have clearly seenwhat is at stake  namely our common destiny  and haverecognized that this is a task we must work at together.Unfortunately  this solidarity has still not been translatedinto concrete and effective action with a real ecologicalimpact. The physical deterioration of the planet continuesunabated.Showing its concern for environmental matters andits willingness to cooperate effectively and tangibly withthe joint efforts of the international community  theGovernment of Uruguay has offered to host the secondmeeting of the contracting parties of the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change  to be heldduring the second half of 1996.As a coastal country in the southern part of theplanet  Uruguay is particularly sensitive to certain formsof environmental degradation such as the depletion of theozone layer  climate change and the contamination andimproper exploitation of the resources of the SouthAtlantic.Uruguay views the results of the Conference onStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocksas highly auspicious. We hope that the draft conventionadopted will be approved in the near future and obtain theratifications needed to secure its entry into force  inparticular by the countries most heavily involved incatching the fish covered by the convention. In thiscontext  Uruguay expresses the hope that the 1982 UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea  to which ourcountry is a party  will be ratified as soon as possible bythe countries that have not yet done so. The generalapplication of the new law of the sea embodied in theConvention can only be of benefit to all States. The8system of protection and preservation of the marineenvironment and conservation and exploitation of itsresources are just two of the many benefits to be expectedfrom its universal application.In conclusion  Uruguay reiterates its opposition to theunilateral application by one State of economic or tradingmeasures against another State and therefore urges that anend be put to the economic  trade and financial blockade ofCuba.I wish to end by conveying the Government ofUruguay’s pleasure to the President at his election topreside over the work of the General Assembly in thefiftieth anniversary year. We congratulate him on hiseloquent address on the assumption of his post and sharethe views expressed therein. We are aware of theOrganization’s financial situation  but let us not make themistake of thinking that savings should be made by cuttingassistance and cooperation in the sphere of development taking development in the broadest sense of the word. Forevery dollar we take away from this field  we shall have tospend two on peace-keeping operations.If we wish to speak in economic terms  it is cheaperto prevent conflict than to have to resolve it later. Clearly the primary responsibility of the United Nations is toresolve conflicts  but it is much more important to preventand avoid them. Can a price be put on human life?I wish to reiterate that Uruguay  faithful to its peace-loving and democratic tradition  will continue to participatein the task of building a world free from violence  povertyand intolerance — the world envisioned 50 years ago bythe founders of this Organization."
"165",7246,"USA",50,1995,"It isa privilege to speak to the General Assembly today onbehalf of the United States.A half-century ago the General Assembly first methere in New York  across the river in a converted skatingrink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundingsour predecessors began to put in place an ambitiousframework that they hoped would keep the peace assuccessfully as they had prosecuted the war.In the years since  the United Nations has helpedbring peace  prosperity and hope to countless peoplearound the world. Technological change has broughtnations closer together than the founders of the United9Nations could possibly have foreseen. The United Nationsitself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had tomanage complex humanitarian emergencies  from civil warsto mass movements of refugees to health epidemics. Thisevolution has placed great strains on the Organization andhas revealed the necessity for far-reaching changes in howit is run.The Clinton Administration has vigorously made thecase to our Congress and our people for continuedAmerican leadership at the United Nations. The UnitedStates made a commitment to the United Nations Charter50 years ago  and we are determined to keep ourcommitment  including our financial obligations.We will always remember that for millions of peoplearound the world  the United Nations is far from a facelessinstitution. It is  as Harry Truman once said “a case of food  a box of school books; it is a doctorwho vaccinates children; it is an expert who showspeople how to raise more rice and more wheat.”To millions more around the world  it is the differencebetween peace and war.Economic and social development  as well as theprotection of human rights  remain central to the UnitedNations mission. But the United Nations must change tomeet new needs more effectively. When money is wastedin New York  Geneva or Vienna  when time is lost inbureaucratic inertia  the people who pay the price are thosemost vulnerable to famine  disease and violence.It is time to recognize that the United Nations mustdirect its limited resources to the world’s highest priorities focusing on the tasks that it performs the best. The UnitedNations bureaucracy should be smaller  with a clearorganizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility.Each programme must be held to a single simple standard:it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom security and well-being of real people in the real world.In the last year  under the leadership of Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali  the groundwork for substantialchange has been laid. The United Nations has an officewith the functions of an inspector general and a mandate tocrack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-GeneralJoe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign toimprove the United Nations management culture  and wefully support his good work. The United Nations Secretariathas moved in the right direction by submitting a budget thatbegins to restrain spending  and now this momentum forreform must accelerate.Let me propose a brief  concrete agenda for reform.First  we must end United Nations programmes thathave achieved their purpose  and we must consolidateprogrammes that overlap  especially in the economic andsocial agencies. The United Nations has more than adozen organizations responsible for development emergency response and statistical reporting. We shouldconsider establishing a single agency for each of thesefunctions. We should downsize the United Nationsregional economic commissions. We should ensure thatthe functions of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development do not duplicate those of the newWorld Trade Organization (WTO)  and we should adopta moratorium on big United Nations conferences once thepresent series is completed  concentrating instead onmeeting the commitments of those conferences that wehave already held.Secondly  we need to streamline the United NationsSecretariat to make it more efficient  accountable andtransparent. Each part of the United Nations systemshould be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general.The United Nations must not tolerate ethical or financialabuses  and its managers should be appointed andpromoted on the basis of merit.Thirdly  we should rigorously scrutinize proposalsfor new and extended peace-keeping missions  and weshould improve the United Nations ability to respondrapidly when new missions are approved. We must agreeon an equitable scale of peace-keeping assessments thatreflects fully today’s economic realities. And we shouldhave a unified budget for peace-keeping operations.Finally  we must maintain the effectiveness of theSecurity Council. Germany and Japan should becomepermanent members  and we should ensure that all theworld’s regions are fairly represented  without making theCouncil too large and unwieldy.We welcome the formation of the high-level groupon reform  initiated under the leadership of the outgoingPresident of the General Assembly  Mr. Essy. Our goalmust be that of a practical blueprint for United Nationsreform and to ensure that it is adopted before the GeneralAssembly finishes the work of its fiftieth session nextfall. The way forward is clear; we have already seen and10studied countless studies and reports. Now the time hascome to act on the best proposals.As the Assembly knows  in my country there havebeen serious efforts to curtail our support for the UnitedNations. The President and I  and our entire Administration believe it would be reckless to turn away from anOrganization that helps mobilize the support of othernations for goals that are consistent with American andglobal interests. But to sustain support for the UnitedNations among the American people and among the peopleof other nations  it is not enough that we defend theinstitution. The best argument against retreat is furtherreform. Tangible progress in that direction will help us winthe battle for United Nations support that we are waging inthe United States.The United Nations must emerge from the reformprocess better able to meet its fundamental goals  includingthe preservation of peace and security. From Korea to thePersian Gulf to Haiti  the United Nations has provided amandate to its Members as they carried out theirresponsibilities. The United Nations own Blue Helmetshave helped nations create the basic conditions of peace insome of the most difficult situations imaginable around theworld  even though they have not always achieved theirintended purpose.Recently  a young Haitian father was asked what thepeace-keeping forces had achieved in his country. Heanswered “We walk freely. We sleep quietly. There are nomen who come for us in the night.”In Haiti  as  for example  in Cambodia  Mozambique and ElSalvador  the United Nations has shown that peace-keeping despite its limitations  has been an enormously usefulinstrument.One region where United Nations forces and theinternational community have played a critical role is theMiddle East. Another historic milestone will be marked thisThursday  in Washington  when Israel and the Palestinianssign their agreement to implement phase two of theDeclaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to lifea goal first set many years ago in the Camp David accords:to protect Israel’s security and to give Palestiniansthroughout the West Bank control over their daily lives.The international community and the United Nations mustcontinue to support this process  both diplomatically andeconomically.There is no question that the United Nations hasnever undertaken a mission more difficult than the one inthe former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission areall too well known  but we all must recognize that it hasprovided relief for hundreds of thousands of people andhas saved literally thousands of lives. Today  diplomacybacked by force has given the United States and theinternational community an opportunity to move forwardon a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. TheUnited Nations and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) are working effectively together totry to bring peace to the region. On 8 September inGeneva  the parties to the conflict accepted thefundamental goal that the Security Council has oftenexpressed: the continuation of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina as a single State within its internationallyrecognized borders. I will be meeting with the ForeignMinisters of Bosnia  Croatia and Serbia later today  andat that time I will urge them — implore them — tomaintain the momentum towards peace and to establishconstitutional structures for Bosnia.The framers of the Charter of the United Nationscreated this institution to meet threats to peace andsecurity posed by aggression and armed conflict. Thosethreats are still  unfortunately  very much with us. Buttoday  the world also faces a new set of securitychallenges  including proliferation  terrorism  internationalcrime and narcotics  as well as the far-reachingconsequences of damage to the environment. These haveassumed a new and dangerous scope in a moreinterdependent world. As President Clinton said in SanFrancisco in June  the“new forces of integration carry within them theseeds of disintegration and destruction”.While  as I said earlier  new technologies havebrought us closer together  they also have made it easierfor terrorists  drug dealers and other internationalcriminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction  to setup cocaine cartels and to hide their ill-gotten gains. Thecollapse of communism has shattered dictatorships  to besure  but it has also left the political and legal institutionsof newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to thosewho seek to subvert them.Although these threats are sometimes sponsored byStates  they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us mustvigorously fight these enemies on our own  but we willnever be truly secure until we effectively fight themtogether. That is the new security challenge for the global11community  and it must be the new security mission for theUnited Nations.There is no single area in which the United Nationscan make a more significant contribution than in that ofnon-proliferation. Fifty years ago  the United States was theonly country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Todaymany countries have the technology that would enable themto turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb assmall as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170nations agreed  at a conference held here last May andeffectively chaired by Ambassador Dhanapala  to extend forall time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. That is an achievement we must rejoice in butalso build on.I should like to outline some steps in the field ofnon-proliferation. First  we should have a comprehensivetest-ban treaty ready for signature by the time we meet herenext September. As President Clinton announced lastmonth  the United States is committed to a true zero-yieldtest ban. We urge other nations to join us in thatcommitment.Secondly  we should immediately start negotiations ona fissile material cut-off treaty. Those who have been mostvocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognizethat it is essential to ban future production of fissilematerial for nuclear weapons.Thirdly  we should push forward with the historicreductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States andcountries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the UnitedStates Senate  as well as on the Russian Duma  to approvethe treaty on further reduction and limitation of strategicoffensive arms (START II) so that we can lock in deep cutsin our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition  PresidentsClinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure thesafety  transparency and irreversibility of nuclear-armsreductions.As part of this process  President Yeltsin will host anuclear safety and security summit in Moscow next spring.This summit should have a very ambitious agenda including a declaration of principles on nuclear safety. Welook to this summit to address the worldwide problems ofnuclear-waste management  including those of oceandumping. The summit should also promote a plan of actionto safeguard nuclear materials  a plan that should includenew measures to prevent criminals and terrorists fromacquiring nuclear materials for use in weapons.Finally  we should push for the earliest possibleentry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.President Clinton has urged the United States Senate toact promptly on its ratification  and to stop holding theSTART II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Conventionhostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed theeffects of poison gas too many times in this century — onEuropean battlefields during the First World War  inEthiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s  and againstIranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will makeevery nation safer  and we need it now.The United Nations is also playing an invaluablerole in focusing attention on pressing regionalproliferation problems. In Iraq  the United Nations SpecialCommission (UNSCOM) and its Chairman  Rolf Ekeus continue to uncover horrific details about SaddamHussein’s weapons of mass destruction.Under Saddam Hussein  Iraq developed a deadlybiological-weapons capacity hidden from view. It wasconducting research to turn some of the most toxicsubstances known to man into weapons of war. We knowthat Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism inbombs and missile warheads. In December 1990  hedeployed these weapons  with every intention of usingthem against the international coalition and innocentcivilians. He was dissuaded from doing so only by thesteadfast determination of the United States and theinternational community.In the light of what Ambassador Ekeus hasuncovered in Iraq  we can conclude only that for the lastfour and a half years  Saddam Hussein has lied about thefull scope of Iraq’s weapons programmes. There shouldbe no easing of the sanctions regime against Iraq until itsGovernment complies with all the demands of theSecurity Council and clearly demonstrates that it haschanged its ways.The United Nations should also promoteresponsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventionalweapons. At last year’s session of the General Assembly President Clinton proposed  and the Assembly approved the eventual elimination of anti-personnel mines. On myrecent trip to Cambodia  I saw the terrible damage thesehidden killers can do. This year  we will again call onother countries to join us in putting an end to the exportof land-mines.12Two years ago  President Clinton called on theinternational community to devise a true internationalsystem governing the transfer of conventional weapons andsensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that theRussian Federation has joined with the United States and 26other countries to agree on a common principle to controlthe build-up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope toactivate this global regime  which is called the New Forum by the end of this year.The proliferation of weapons worldwide has added adisturbing dimension to another threat we all face: thethreat of international terrorism. Indeed  this year’s saringas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happenwhen terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction.More nations are joining the fight against thoseindividuals and groups that attack civilians for politicalends. The United Nations has supported this effort inimportant ways. The Security Council recognized theimportance of countering State-sponsored terrorism byimposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of PanAm 103 and UTA 772.Terrorists must be treated as criminals and there mustbe no place where they can hide from the consequences oftheir acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the fullweight of sanctions that can be imposed by the internationalcommunity. Let us not deceive ourselves: every dollar thatgoes into the Government coffers of a State-sponsor ofterrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist’s bullets orbombs. Iran’s role as the foremost State-sponsor ofterrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of massdestruction even more alarming. We must stand together toprevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities.The United States has taken a leading role in meetingthe international terrorist threat. We have intensified oursanctions against Iran. Last January President Clinton issuedan Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions withterrorist groups and individuals that threaten the MiddleEast peace process. We are urging our Congress to tightenour immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on therun or put them behind bars.The United States strongly supports the counter-terrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at theHalifax Summit  and we expect the G-8 Ministerial Meetingon Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete-action planto implement these measures that were adopted at theHalifax Summit.Other kinds of international crime also threaten thesafety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. Andglobalization brings new and frightening dimensions tocrime. The threat of crime is a particular menace toyoung democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions preys on the most vulnerable in our societies andundermines free-market reform.Of course  every country must take its own measuresto combat these criminal threats. The Administration thatI represent is now completing a review of our approachto transnational crime  a review that will lead to astronger  more coordinated attack on this problem.To help other States deal with criminal threats  theUnited States and Hungary have created the InternationalLaw Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train policeofficers and law-enforcement officials from CentralEurope and the States of the former Soviet Union. We areproviding similar help bilaterally  and through the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme  to thosecountries whose laws are challenged by international drugcartels.A particularly insidious form of crime and corruptionis money-laundering. All nations should work together toimplement the recommendations of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) toattack this insidious money-laundering. The nations of thishemisphere should also advance the anti-money-laundering initiative introduced at last December’sSummit of the Americas. Together  we must work tosqueeze the dirty money out of the global financialsystem.Through the United Nations conventions on drugsand crime the international community has set strongstandards that we must now act to enforce. We call onMember States which have not already joined the 1988drug Convention to do so promptly  and we call on thosecountries which have approved the Convention to movequickly to implement its important provisions.We are also increasingly aware that damage to theenvironment and unsustainable population growth threatenthe security of our nations and the well-being of ourpeoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines infant mortality rates  refugee crises  and ozone depletion.In places like Rwanda and Somalia  for example  theycontribute to civil wars and emergencies that can beresolved only by extremely costly internationalintervention. We must carry out the commitments we13made last year at the Cairo Conference  as well as theimportant commitments made at the Rio Conference threeyears ago.Never have our problems around the world been morecomplex. It has never been more evident that theseproblems affect all nations  developed and developing alike.Only by working together can we effectively deal with thenew threats we all face that I have outlined here today.That is why in this fiftieth anniversary year we mustshape the United Nations agenda as if we were creating theinstitution anew. Just as the founders of the United Nationsdevised a new framework to deter aggression and armedconflict  the United Nations  in particular the SecurityCouncil  must now assign the same priority to combatingthe threat posed by proliferation  by terrorism  byinternational crime  by narcotics and by environmentalpollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the UnitedNations and elsewhere to turning our global consensusagainst these threats into concrete and effective action. Wemust renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake but for our own."
"166",7316,"VCT",50,1995,"I wish on behalf of my country  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his electionas President of the General Assembly. He assumes thepresidency on the historic occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations.Commendation is in order too for His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire  for the competence andsensitivity he displayed as he presided over the lastsession.Let us also take this opportunity to express to theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our profound gratitude for the efforts which he hasmade so far to achieve greater flexibility  and for theenhancement of the capability of this world body to meetthe new challenges posed by the seismic upheavals takingplace in the international arena.My delegation is supportive of United Nationsreform initiatives. We must redouble our efforts to ensurea more efficient United Nations system that will respondeffectively to security and humanitarian needs  promotehuman rights  and build the capacity for sustainabledevelopment. Central to our concerns is the importance ofensuring democracy in the United Nations. If thisOrganization’s moral authority is to be preserved in anincreasingly democratized world  it is inescapable that itsown processes must be made more democratic. It istherefore imperative  as we consider the enlargement ofthe Security Council  that the existing geographicimbalance be noted  and that the five regions of the worldbe adequately represented.My delegation calls for a more effective andefficient United Nations. We are cognizant of the urgentneed to address the deteriorating finances of this greatOrganization. Since the end of the cold war  funds fordevelopment in poorer countries have been drasticallyreduced  and peace-keeping demands now compete for thelimited funds available. In his recent report on the workof the Organization  the Secretary-General revealed thatMember States owed the Organization approximately$3.6 billion. Let us all work together to address this issueof arrears  which seriously impairs the effectiveness of theUnited Nations.The role of peace-keeping forces will have to beredefined. My delegation is concerned when lightly armedpeace-keepers or unarmed aid workers on a humanitarianmission are threatened  taken hostage  harmed  or evenkilled. To preserve the credibility of all United Nationspeace operations  personnel must be protected as they13carry out the duties that the international community hassent them to accomplish.The recently concluded Fourth World Conference onWomen  held in Beijing  has certainly served to raise thelevel of consciousness worldwide on the many problemsthat women still encounter in many countries of the UnitedNations. It is now evident that  even in those countrieswhere legislation has opened the road to equality andequity  traditional attitudes continue to impede this process.I am happy to report that in Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  women have been given the opportunity tolead. Over 40 per cent of the top administrative posts in ourcivil service are held by women. Women also have equalaccess to the political process and enjoy equal pay for equalwork. Moreover  my Government amended the constitutionto give women citizenship rights equal to those previouslyaccorded only to men.Adherence to the principles of the United NationsCharter and the right to self-determination of the world’speoples remain among the fundamental principles of theCharter. This is reflected in the growing membership of theOrganization.The Republic of China on Taiwan  which was once aMember of this body  still finds itself on the outside knocking persistently at the doors of our chambers. It is theview of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines which we also expressed at the last session  that the timehas come for serious consideration to be given to theeligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to becomea Member of the United Nations. Our position is based onthe principle of universality and in accordance with theestablished model of parallel representation of dividedcountries. We have recognized the several parts of theformer Yugoslavia  and this model should continue to guideour policy.My delegation believes that the Republic of China onTaiwan is fully equipped to play an expanded role in theworld economic arena. Its successful developmentexperience can indeed serve as a reference for developingcountries. Not only has the Republic of China on Taiwanachieved economic success but  in a few years  its politicalsystem has evolved from one characterized by authoritarianrule into one based on democratic principles. We cannotpreach about the universality of the United Nations whileat the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 21 millionpeople. It is more than time for the Republic of China onTaiwan to be given the opportunity to make a tangiblecontribution to the work of the United Nations.My delegation reiterates its strong commitment tothe peaceful settlement of disputes among States. TheGulf War is now behind us  but the internationalcommunity must continue to recognize the potential forconflict that still exists in that part of the world.In January 1995  the Secretary-General issued aSupplement to his “Agenda for Peace” of 1992  whichhighlighted new kinds of United Nations operations todeal with the outbreak of ethnic and religious wars withinnewly independent States. It is the fervent hope of mydelegation that a lasting peace will come to the troubledregions of the world  particularly to Bosnia andHerzegovina. One can recall when the despicable systemof apartheid was demolished in South Africa  just over ayear ago. It therefore behoves us to eradicate such evilthoughts as “ethnic cleansing” from the minds of men inother parts of the world.Let me take this opportunity to applaud the effortsof the Israeli Government and the leadership of thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to pursue peacetalks despite the efforts of terrorists to derail the process.My delegation fully supports a peaceful resolution of theconflict that has plagued that region of the world for somany years.The Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States was ofgreat importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.The vulnerability of small island States such as ours is ofgrave concern and we eagerly look forward to theimplementation of the Programme of Action agreed to inBarbados in 1994.Less than one month ago  the Caribbean region feltthe impact of several storms and hurricanes whichseverely ravaged our sister islands of Antigua andBarbuda  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Dominica  Saint Maarten Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the spirit ofCaribbean brotherhood  the entire rest of the region cameto the support of those affected. The Prime Minister  SirJames Mitchell  in his capacity as current Chairman of theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)  alongwith Prime Minister Compton of Saint Lucia and PrimeMinister Arthur of Barbados  immediately embarked ona tour of the islands which were severely hit.14A national effort was mobilized in my own country forrelief supplies. My delegation takes this opportunity to callfor further external assistance  which remains crucial. Onbehalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent andthe Grenadines  I wish to convey our profound sympathy tothe Governments and the peoples of the islands affected particularly to the families of those who lost their lives asa result of Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.We also wish to express our sympathy to theGovernment and the people of the United States ofAmerica  and more specifically the families of those wholost their lives in the senseless bombing of the FederalBuilding in Oklahoma earlier this year.Our small and fragile States are now being threatenedby another type of disaster — an economic disaster  withmounting pressures being exerted by very powerful forceswhich appear not to understand the importance of thebanana industry to our very survival. Saint Vincent and theGrenadines and the other banana producing countries of theWindward Islands are limited to a mere three per cent ofthe world market trade in the commodity. The powerfulmultinational companies which are seeking to reverse thespecial arrangements under the Lomé Convention alreadycontrol over 80 per cent of the world market.More profits for multinational companies must not beto the detriment of the small islands striving to maintaindemocracy. The destruction of the Caribbean bananaindustry will create economic and social havoc nationallyand regionally  and will undoubtedly have severerepercussions at the international level. We recognize themomentum for free trade  but see no reason why  as obtainswith issues related to other agricultural regions  of variouscountries  we cannot be given the time to adjust andrestructure our economies.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has already seen itsactive involvement and participation at the regional level inthe Caribbean as an indispensable dimension of its role asa member of the international community. We haveconsistently defined our objective to become members ofour various institutional bodies as a logical and naturalculmination of our international vocation. This definition isrooted in our country’s political  social and economicrealities  as they have been shaped by our historical andcultural heritage.As a member of the recently established Associationof Caribbean States (ACS)  we are indeed delighted to begiven a greater opportunity to strengthen relations with ourLatin American neighbours. Comprising some 200 millionethnically and culturally diverse peoples  the ACS willserve as a vehicle to promote the implementation ofpolicies and programmes designed to harness  utilize anddevelop the potential of the Caribbean Sea  promote andenhance economic space for trade and investmentopportunities  and establish and augment  as appropriate institutional structures and cooperative arrangementsresponsive to the various cultural identities within theregion.My Government totally condemns the illicitproduction  trafficking and consumption of drugs. Theseharbingers of violent crimes and corruption create aserious menace to the health and well-being of oureconomies and our people  threaten our democraticinstitutions  and endanger national and regional security.We are firmly convinced that only integratedregional and international efforts can effectively addressthe drug problem  and accordingly stress the need forincreased local  regional and international cooperation.Greater emphasis should be placed on programmes thatgenerate employment and income for persons attracted todrug production and trafficking as a means of livelihood.With the end of the cold war  the internationalcommunity  freed of the ideological and other constraintsof the East-West struggle  saw new opportunities torespond more effectively to longstanding problems thathad defied resolution because of super-Power rivalries.There was optimistic talk of the “peace-dividend”  and theSecurity Council acted with unprecedented consensus andmomentum on many issues.At the same time  the thawing of the cold wartriggered long-suppressed tensions and conflicts in manyparts of the world. Serious global economic and socialproblems  ranging from poverty  over-population  refugeesand migration  to unemployment  drug-trafficking andenvironmental decline  have affected many societies on anunprecedented scale.Despite the dramatically diminished threat of anuclear war  the world of the 1990s turns out to be a farmore unstable place than many had hoped. The reality ofglobal interdependence  while promising newopportunities for cooperation and exchange  reminds us alltoo often of our shared and persistent problems. We facemore tensions in more places: increasing degradation ofthe quality of human life and even more complex issues15of international laws and ethics  management and practicalcooperation.It is therefore clear that the United Nations system isin greater demand than ever before. As we commemoratethe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this greatOrganization  let us work in harmony and ensure that theUnited Nations is adequately prepared to face thechallenges of an even more complex world. We must neverforget that the United Nations is a reflection of the realworld. If an ugly image appears  one should not blame themirror."
"167",7363,"VEN",50,1995,"Everything that could be said has been saidduring this annual routine  in which each Head of State orGovernment  or Minister  stands before the United NationsGeneral Assembly. If all the speeches were to be publishedin a compendium  the same universal themes would berepeated a thousand times.The compendium would include the great  insolubleproblems that  to various degrees  afflict the peoples ofevery continent  as well as the solutions that have alreadybeen found  and the promised solutions implicit in theconstant efforts of this Organization  which  like any otherhuman endeavour  has lived through 50 years of triumphsand frustration.We must rejoice that  thanks to the Organization’svigilance and action  we have enjoyed — as neverbefore — half a century of peace  although we lament thefact that we must now deploy efforts against violence bornof intolerance  fanaticism and ethnic or religious strife thatfrustrate the achievement of the harmony for whichmankind yearns.Alongside the impressive achievements of the worldcommunity  these 50 years have also seen numerous localconflicts that have taken 23 million lives. Eighty seven percent of the weapons sold and used in the world come fromthe five countries that are permanent members of theSecurity Council. And  unbelievable as it might seem  atthis stage of our political evolution  two atomic Powersare causing anxiety with inexplicable nuclear tests forwhich we criticized other Powers.But who can deny that in the fields of health technology  environment  human rights  communications the exploitation of the resources of the seas and manyother fields  there is progress and hope  and at least awarning that awakens the universal conscience?Today’s statement by the Foreign Minister ofVenezuela will be no different. Political scenarios change as do ideologies  the most extraordinary crisis in historyerupts  but life’s dramas continue  with man bruised bychange  but for the first time wavering between hope andbewilderment. This situation results from the fact that wehave rushed from one era to another without thedemolition caused by war  although we have had theenthusiastic and confident contribution of students andworkers  who have devoted their free time to making it.We note hardly any curiosity about the era we areapproaching  an era as yet unnamed  though soon to beupon us it could be called anything: “post-capitalist” “post-socialist” or “post-industrial”; or it could simply bedescribed as a time of transition between two periods thatour generations share.There has been talk  of course  of the end of history with the end of ideological confrontation; that is preciselywhat makes history: incessant conflicts and passionateconfrontations  fears and hopes  freedom and deprivationof freedom  in any of the forms of oppression that havealways been applied.Man today has the vague feeling that he is in contactwith all other men through the miracle of the media  fibreoptics  and cybernetic systems  and yet  now that there aremore human beings with whom solidarity may be felt solidarity is more precarious and man’s loneliness is morepoignant.To create a different world based on a solid complex and long-lasting Organization that has beentaking shape since the end of the First World War  wehave begun to talk — since we want words to describewhat is going on — of globalization  of integration  of theabolition of the nation-State and its replacement by largeblocs  in order to produce through strength of numbersand unity a new dynamic different from military might.8Let us suppose  then  that the world of the future willhave to be shaped according to regions  or large integratedgroups or communities  regional or otherwise  that have acommon cultural origin and wish to be identified with theothers  because of the particular characteristics of theirculture  such as tradition  language  religion and even mixedblood.This is what strikes me  as I now appear for the firsttime before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf ofa country such as mine — a country with a modesteconomy  a small population  a territory that ismedium-sized but which  owing to its excellentgeographical situation  developed more than others; aculture of social freedom  of mixed races and of politicalindependence  achieved by means of an epic struggle  notonly for itself but for all of its American neighbours. Mineis a country that has never been at war with anyone  acountry whose desire to see its neighbours freed fromcolonialism gave impetus to  and is inspiring  the brand-newCaribbean community  for instance. It is a country that  aswe have proved time and again  will support and promoteany initiative aimed at pacification in the region  as we didtoday in the Group of Friends of Guatemala  for example and when we welcomed the latest agreement between Israeland the Palestinians.Venezuela  like other countries  has been shaken — inour case since 1989 — by a severe crisis. Not so mucheconomic or political as ethical in nature  this crisis hasweakened our institutions and undermined our financialsystem  the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of ourgross national product and has attracted thenot-always-understanding attention of international opinion.This is the crisis that our Government inherited.Aware that its characteristics are atypical in our region since its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic  oil-dependent model by an open culture based on work andself-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding ofother countries  our Government is proceeding to solve ournation’s problems  which  fortunately  are no match for ourdiverse and solid economic resources.Venezuela is a country that has simultaneously — asif by magic — produced great thinkers  the most credibleUtopians  the luckiest generals  the most visionaryeducators. My country  situated at the northern gate ofSouth America  freed itself and other countries by followingthe dreams of Francisco de Miranda  brought to fruition bySimón Bolivár and Antonio José de Sucre  by systematicthinking and by the actions of Andrés Bello and SimónRodríguez  among other well-known figures.Simón Bolívar was clear-sighted. In that nebulousperiod of history that was the year 1815  he set out  fromJamaica — in the most famous political document of thispart of the world — a dazzling prophecy of what theideal destiny of Hispanic America was to be. To this day no one can understand how he thought it up. He wrote:“It is a grandiose idea to try to make of the entirenew world a single nation  with only one link tobind and tie together all the parts to the whole.”Once independence was achieved  he foresaw that animperfect and erratic unity  such as that of the South could be thrown off balance by the organization of theformer 13 American colonies  whose integration healready anticipated. He also foresaw the power of thehard-working  driven race that would consolidate on theAmerican continent the formidable and admirable nationthat the United States has become  with its transcendentand unique feeling of liberty  since its founders leftbehind all prejudices and fears.Bolívar visualized uniting the American half thatwas discovered  populated and moulded in all its aspectsby Spain and Portugal  seeing it as one that mustnecessarily have its own way of life and of behaving. Hisvision was never based on rivalry  but rather  in keepingwith his views on the destiny of this shared hemisphere on the basis of emulation and friendship instead of strifeas its driving force.The colonizing Powers contributed  and based thishalf of America on  all they had brought with them. Theyestablished a religion  a society reminiscent of theoffspring of settlers  whose physical surroundings andindiscriminate crossbreeding gave rise to a feeling ofunfettered freedom and equality. This  in turn  engenderedirrevocably an equally free spirit of social democracy which Latin America has never since lacked  not evenduring the long periods when political democracy wasnon-existent.In 1826  Bolívar  the Liberator  convened theCongress of Panama to speak there  for the first time inhistory  not of sacred or profane alliances of war  but ofalliances for peace. The thoughts he presented gave riseto the idea of an organized international community  firstof all for the Americas  through the Pan-American Union which in turn gave rise to the present Organization of9American States (OAS)  then to the League of Nations andfinally to this Organization  which has given humanity together with peace  all the possibilities that peace offers.This is an exceptional community  the largest in theworld  since it extends from the southern border of theUnited States all the way south to Patagonia  uniting thegreatest number of peoples and republics with similarcharacteristics. Here  the various languages spoken in Spainfortunately became one  revitalizing the Castilian tongue and similarly  the Portuguese language  which in Brazil isa language as open and soft as America itself. In thenorthernmost point of America  the imprint of France inCanada  as well as the Hispanic minority in the UnitedStates  are living reminders of this community.In geographical terms  we are larger than other officialcommunities  since the United States’ surface area covers9 372 000 square kilometres and Europe’s covers10 404 000 square kilometres. But we cover 20 000 000square kilometres  and in these  the future of humanity ispulsing.In political and spiritual terms  we are history’s largestlaboratory  at once a mystery and a promise — an absolutewonder that the future is revealing day by day. The seed ofa new world  different from our expectations  is growingamong us.We are not the only five hundred million humanbeings to be allergic to the discrimination that will confrontus in the year 2000. But we are the only human group tohave been born and moulded without privileges  hesitationsor complexes  on an equal footing. Though this sense ofequality was repressed for three centuries by pragmaticmeasures that were respected but not implemented  and bythe extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one inimposing a single faith on this immense geographical area it was imbued with the spaciousness of the land  the rivers the forests  the gentle climate  the mountains and prairies whose influence produced a different type of humancharacter. And I would repeat that this deep feeling andsense of fundamental freedom was something that hadnever happened to any other group of people.Germán Arciniegas rightly said that“America was colonized by a man who was destinedto a life of servitude in Europe. He becameemancipated when he crossed from one shore to theother ... These wretches worked the continent withtheir bare hands  they were the poor  the landless  theilliterate of the popular Renaissance. Uneducated unenlightened  their common destiny was to jointogether to become nations and so achieve justice.”And justice was the most absolute independence influenced by American determinism.In his sociologist’s discourse  Bolívar said that weAmericans represent a small human race. We have nowbecome an important branch of the broader human race:the branch of possibilities and hope.Our region would not enter into conflict with anyother; not even with the one with which it shares thehemisphere  and which speaks a different language andhas different customs. It will not be another internationalagency  or form another bureaucracy  or take up moreroom than the enormous space of its present physical andhuman geography.In other words  we aspire to a beautiful Utopia  withno other pragmatism than the pride of being a Utopiawith ever more solidarity; part of the universe with sharedvalues  in search of the same destiny.If other continents fashion communities aroundreligious  racial or geopolitical banners  it is natural thatwe  Latin Americans  put forth ours with our ownimmense  protean sense of unity.There was a time  as we followed a different culturalpattern  when we had a more orderly society and enjoyedpolitical systems that brought us fame throughout theworld. Practically all Latin American countriesexperienced a sort of golden age of culture and politics marked by originality. We created literature. We forgedour own laws with our own institutions. We pioneered theLaw of the Sea; we produced the first system againstnuclear weapons  with the Treaty of Tlatelolco.A concerted Latin American community of nationswould tend to recuperate and exchange training andeducational systems capable of affirming our collectivepride and personality  as Europe has already done  despitethe diversity of its components  out of fear of the returnof thousands of years of violence. Morally  the LatinAmerican community would be equal to the commercialand economic commitments made through ALADI  theLatin American Integration Association  as well as theAndean Pact  the Central American Common Market andMERCOSUR  all designed to form a front of solidarity10and a crucial link in the economic integration of theuniverse.A conscious Latin American community of nationswould guarantee the sustainable development of the world’smost varied and richest ecological systems  and wouldconceive not only of the larger spaces  but also of theimportance of drinking water  of mining resources  and ofthe most varied and richest flora and fauna on the face ofthe earth.Of course  we bring before the United Nations themany concerns that we have expressed about the fate of ourOrganization which  in its 50 years of arbitrating peace  hascharted a new path for the peoples it represents. Theseconcerns have prompted talk of reforming the Charter  inorder for the Security Council  for instance  to take up andrepresent new geopolitical realities  and not only militarymight. This is the spirit in which my country  through thevoice of its President  Rafael Caldera  has realistically andfrankly proposed that Brazil be the permanentrepresentative of Latin America in an enlarged SecurityCouncil. We have also spoken of the justification ofagencies and powers  to make the cost of peace lessburdensome; of the urgent need to adapt the Economic andSocial Council to the necessities of our time  as well as theCouncil for Culture  Science and Technology  that is stillthe monopoly of industrialized centres. If a common marketfor technology were to be established  we would be trulykeeping pace with history.In America  although less than in Africa and Asia  wetoo are disturbed by the growing marginalization  the socialinjustice  the poverty bordering on famine  the insecurityexacerbated by the trade in illicit drugs and itsconsequences  which we witness. We produce terrible drugsin ever greater quantities to satisfy the voracity of theconsumer markets. But  at the same time  we fight thisscourge with the greatest tenacity and determination.Our community has had the virtue of becomingpractically a breeding ground for democracy  thanks to thesteadfastness of its leaders and thinkers  as well as of theoldest but least championed regional organization. We mustnow see to it that democracy is purged of its dishonesty and is cleansed. To this end  at the Hemispheric Summit inMiami  my Government proposed  with unanimous support to put a stop to the impunity of corruption.We consider that drug trafficking and politicalcorruption are linked together by money laundering  underthe cover of electoral contributions.If democracy is to acquire a new respectability  itwill be thanks to the common  concerted effort ofAmerica; an effort which this world Organization willalso be called upon to make in the near future. That isbecause political corruption  a manifestation of theuniversal mafia  is not exclusive to our region and mustbe fought at the global level  just like illicit drugtrafficking.Very shortly  a world congress against corruptionwill be held in China  doubtless inspired by our example.We hold out great expectations for that congress. Indeed we are keenly interested in anything that is sponsored andadvanced by this Organization.But I wanted to put before the Assembly thesomewhat romantic idea of a Latin American Utopia  thatit might inspire confidence in our neighbours in thishemisphere and hope in all other regions  whether on anorganized basis or not. This is the spirit in which the RioGroup has endorsed the oft-repeated proposal for a LatinAmerican Parliament.Since the first Great War there has been adislocation in Europe  which conveyed itself throughSpain and Portugal; its aesthetic sense of life andexistence through Italy; its modes of thought andphilosophy through France; its political models throughGreat Britain and its lasting technologies throughGermany. A regrettable dislocation occurred betweenEurope and Latin America  which is truly its mostkindred continent  where we live as distant cousins  andstill the most vibrant and promising offshoot of thislineage.If we underscore the need to encourage this idea ofour community  it is because it exists  in fact  although itis now beset with social problems that require combinedtreatment. It also has a legalist existence  since Statessuch as Brazil  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru  Uruguay andVenezuela have incorporated it into their politicalconstitutions.The greatest tragedy of Latin America is its socialcondition  because of the imbalances characteristic of anylarge society — irregularities in family patterns deficiencies in education  the destruction of homes due toa lack of ethics — even housing  which was never one ofour biggest problems  has become one  because it islinked to a sense of ethics at the family level. They areinseparably linked.11We could say  along with Arturo Uslar Pietri that caught as we are between the millstones that grind thepolitical universe  we have given more thought to buildingrepublics than to perfecting the nation that we are.In spite of all its faults  the United Nations — theOrganization we aspired to and wish to maintain — hascreated a civilization. It is responsible for over 300international treaties: for the consolidation of democracy;for the dedicated protection of refugees; for self-determination  freedom  independence  the dignity of life the arts  traditions; for coexistence — even if the phantomsof intolerance reappear; for trade free of protectionism; forchildren  women and our indigenous populations. And this beyond civilization  we can call the new culture of thehuman family.The Organization has grown and expanded since 1945 and the world with it. Its many offspring  scattered amongthe five continents and virtually all of them free  have ledto a membership quadruple the number of the foundingMembers  among them Venezuela  which was representedthen by its great Minister Caracciolo Parra Pérez. At thattime he voiced an idea that has even greater validity today:“The peoples of the world must know each othermorally and spiritually before they can manage todispel the distrust and ignorance which keep themapart. We must build up a kind of intellectualnetwork  above the network of the physicalcommunications system which exists between nations or parallel to it.” (Official Records of the UnitedNations Conference on International Organization  7thplenary meeting  p. 23)This Organization’s greatest achievement has been tooffer the world a span of half a century during which despite remaining fears  it could think of a new course forharmonizing all aspects of the life of societies with thenature that shelters those societies.I congratulate the Organization and the President ofthe General Assembly  Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral  in thehope that under his leadership the Organization will achieveall the success it deserves and needs. All races  allreligions  all the most varied shades of humankind bringtheir aspirations and their claims here. This is an spacioushome that has always endeavoured to live in the peace thatis and must be the normal condition of life. It has been saidthat if health is the peace of the body  peace is the healthof peoples. In that connection  the pre-Socratic philosopherwrote that in times of peace people awake to the crowingof roosters  while in times of war they waken to theclamour of arms; in peace the young bury the old  whilein war the old bury the young."
"168",7402,"VNM",50,1995,"Allow me at the outset  on behalf of thedelegation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  tocongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his electionas President of the General Assembly at this session  ahistoric session that coincides with the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. I am confident that under hisguidance  our session will be crowned with success.Let me take this opportunity also to convey ourappreciation for the dynamic and effective activitiesundertaken by his predecessor  His Excellency MinisterAmara Essy. We would like to express our appreciationalso for the perseverance shown by His Excellency Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali in serving the common cause of allnations for peace  national independence anddevelopment.This session of the General Assembly is a specialoccasion for us to look back at the changes in the worldand at the growth of the United Nations over the past 50years  since the end of the Second World War. Out ofthe tumultuous course of mankind’s history in those 50years  let us identify what has changed  what has not  andwhat cannot change. Only with such a clear vision willwe be able to chart our course into the twenty-firstcentury and to find the confidence to build a UnitedNations that can meet the expectations of all of us.While the first half of the twentieth century has leftin the mind of mankind the haunting memories of twodreadful world wars  in the second half of this century despite the fierce local wars that have taken place — suchas those in Indochina  Korea and Viet Nam — nationshave been spared the horrors of a global conflagration.Moreover  after several decades of an unbridled armsrace  the world has chosen the course of reason  strivingfor the long-term goal of general and completedisarmament  especially with regard to nuclear weaponsand other weapons of mass destruction.The recent indefinite extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons gave rise to muchhope. However  the nuclear testing undertaken rightafterwards caused disillusion in international publicopinion and has made it imperative for all nations — firstand foremost the nuclear-weapon States — to redoubletheir efforts in a fully responsible manner  so as to19complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course ofthe next year.While the threat of a new world war and a nuclearholocaust is receding  peace and security remain elusive formany regions and countries beset by racial  ethnic andreligious conflicts  and terrorist activities that take ondisquieting proportions. In the intractable case of Bosniaand Herzegovina  a peaceful solution should be pursued without the imposition of measures  from any quarterwhatsoever  that may complicate the situation further andcause more suffering to the multi-ethnic population ofBosnia.The past half-century can also be said to have been ashining chapter in the history of the struggle of peoples toregain their national independence  sovereignty and theright to be the masters of their own destinies  and to strivefor well-being  freedom and equality within theinternational community. The international community hasbeen following very closely the peace process in the MiddleEast and welcomes its recent progress. Only strong politicalwill and respect for the fundamental national rights of thePalestinian people and the legitimate interests of all theparties concerned can bring about lasting stability in thisregion of the world.In practice  however  the basic and universal principlesof sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to beignored or violated by reason of the unequal andundemocratic set-up of international relations and throughimpositions upon  and interference in  the internal affairs ofother countries  for different reasons and with a variety ofjustifications.At the end of this twentieth century  thanks tomankind’s achievements in science and technology and incommunication and production  and thanks also to the hardwork of all nations  our world as a whole has become moreprosperous and more alive  with the manifold increase inmaterial and non-material flows and exchanges  thusfacilitating better mutual understanding and closerrelationships among nations. However  our consciencecannot rest easy in view of a reality that we cannot ignore:the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abjectpoverty  and the challenges posed by the enormous gapbetween the annual per capita gross national product for theleast developed countries — less than $200 — and that ofadvanced industrialized countries  which is more than ahundred times higher. Furthermore  all nations  no matterwhere in the world  face global problems that threaten oureconomic achievements and the progress made inenhancing the quality of life.Nowadays  mankind has a clearer  more holisticawareness of development  peace and security. Weunderstand better the close correlation and interactionbetween economic development and social development between internal security and external security  andbetween economic  social and military security.Another reality of the world today  which is of far-reaching significance to each nation and individual  is theincreasing role of international law  which binds nationsand circumscribes and harmonizes the behaviour of Statesthrough multilateral instruments and institutions. Such arole is all the more crucial in the light of the tendency toblur the boundaries between national and internationaljurisdiction  as well as to extend the enforcement of onecountry’s laws beyond its borders. Recently  internationalopinion has been increasingly concerned about the factthat the implementation of United Nations sanctions isshifting towards punishment or retribution for privatepolitical motives  in contravention of the purposesoriginally assigned by the Charter. Nor can public opinionremain unconcerned by the fact that sanctions in realityaffect mainly the life and health of the innocent civilianpopulation  and therefore cannot accept the prolongationof sanctions regardless of their effectiveness andconsequences. In view of this  international opinioncannot but protest the imposition of unilateral sanctionsfor several decades  such as is the case of the embargoagainst Cuba. We express our sincere sympathy for thehardships experienced by the Cuban people and stronglyurge that the embargo against Cuba be lifted  and that therelevant resolutions of the General Assembly be promptlyand effectively implemented.In short  50 years after the Second World War  theworld offers us a scene of vivid contrasts betweencontinuity and change  between stagnation anddevelopment  between division and integration  especiallythe vast and profound integration that unfolds before usunder the impact of the trend towards interdependence regionalization and globalization. Moreover  the powerfulvitality and steadfast determination which drive peoplesto preserve their national traditions and cultural identitiesdemonstrate their will to safeguard from within theinevitable process of international integration somethingstable and lasting  which links the present of each nationto the roots of its traditions  and the need to affirm thesingularity of each society  each nation and each20community  and not only of each individual. The history ofthe past 50 years is a clear testimony thereof.Over the past half century  the United Nations hasweathered the tests and trials of the cold war and of theimmediate post-cold-war years to endure and grow. Itsindispensable role as a centre for harmonizing the actionsof nation States in a world characterized by rapid andcomplex changes and increasing interdependence has beenrecognized by all Members.As I have mentioned  the United Nations has recordedsome encouraging achievements for peace and development for equality and justice. However  given the speed andscope of changes taking place in the world  it must berecognized that the United Nations has failed to reform andadjust itself in keeping with the new situation and with thetrend of the times  and thus to address the needs of nations.We are of the view that the peace-keeping operations of theUnited Nations must strictly observe the principle of respectfor independence  sovereignty and non-interference in theinternal affairs of States  and should go hand in hand withthe persevering search for a peaceful solution. The UnitedNations ought to draw the lessons of the successes andfailures of its recent peace-keeping operations so as tobetter discharge the responsibility entrusted to it by thecommunity of its Member States. It is certain that in a fewweeks  during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations  our Heads of State and Governmentwill voice the hopes that the peoples of the world place inour Organization. For this reason  it is imperative that weturn the United Nations into an effective instrument to servethe common ideals and interests of mankind in the nextcentury. The challenge for the United Nations  as it tacklesthe burning issues of today’s world  is to continueupholding the progressive spirit enshrined in its Charter andadequately to implement  with all due attention  both the“Agenda for Peace” and the “Agenda for Development” overcoming the discrepancy between the desirable and thepossible so that the United Nations can be a truerepresentative — in the fullest sense of the term — of theexpectations and interests of its Members  in its structureand organization  its agenda  its mandate and its mode ofoperation. This requires that the General Assembly shouldplay an “essential role” as the Secretary-General remindedus at the opening of this session  namely that by virtue ofthe principle of “equal rights ... of nations large and small” it is the General Assembly that is endowed with thedemocratic legitimacy of our global Organization. Mr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) We agree with the overall thrust of the draftdeclaration on the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations and believe that it is particularly important toreaffirm the principles of respect for independence sovereignty and sovereign equality  territorial integrity andnon-interference in the jurisdiction and the internal affairsof nations  the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force or threat to use force. At the same time  thepositive role that the United Nations has played andshould continue to play in helping nations exercise theirright to self-determination and to development should notbe forgotten. The declaration should not fail to addresstwo topical issues. One is the need for a Security Councilthat is more effective  more representative and transparentin its workings  while the other is the need for adequateresources to enable the United Nations fully to carry outits mandate. Viet Nam recognizes a plain fact of everydaylife  which is that whoever contributes more shall beentitled to more rights. But conversely  whoever has morerights will have to show greater responsibility. Therefore the richest countries should set an example by meetingtheir financial obligations in full and on time  which is ofvital significance for our Organization at this juncture. Weparticularly agree with the stress placed by the draftdeclaration on poverty as the scourge visited upon billionsof people on our planet  as well as on the human personas the centre of the whole development process. Thoseare only some preliminary observations.In this incredibly changing world  the Asia-Pacificregion in general and South-East Asia in particular areentering a new era with profound changes and greatpromises for peaceful cooperation and dynamicdevelopment. Most striking is the common consciousnessand efforts of the whole region directed towards buildinga peaceful and stable environment conducive to thedevelopment of each country in the region and of theregion as a whole. As a country in the dynamic regionand a member of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN)  Viet Nam will make positivecontributions toward those common objectives.Viet Nam’s official membership in ASEAN sincelast July  the participation of Laos and Cambodia asobservers and Myanmar’s accession to the Bali Treatyhave opened up prospects for further strengtheningcooperation throughout the region and for expandingASEAN into an association of all 10 countries of theregion. These are the foundation and components of aSouth-East Asia of peace  stability and prosperity.Together with the other countries concerned  the ASEANcountries recently held the second ASEAN Regional21Forum  at which the participating countries agreed topromote cooperation on an equal footing among all parties by taking the appropriate measures  and in the short termby stepping up confidence-building measures in order toconsolidate peace and security in the region.Alongside that favourable overall trend  there arepotentially destabilizing factors in the region. The disputein the Eastern Sea and other recent developments remain asource of concern for countries both within and outside theregion. Regarding this issue  we would like to reaffirm onceagain our position  which is that the disputes in the EasternSea should be settled through peaceful negotiations inaccordance with the principles contained in the ManilaDeclaration adopted by ASEAN in 1992  as confirmed atthe recent ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brunei  and inconformity with international law  especially the 1982United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  whichentered into force at the end of 1994. Pending afundamental and lasting solution to these disputes  allparties concerned should maintain the status quo and refrainfrom any action that might further complicate the situation especially the use or threat of use of force.For Viet Nam  1995 has been a year of great historicsignificance. As we join the rest of the internationalcommunity in preparing for the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  our people are solemnly celebrating severalother major events  especially the fiftieth anniversary of theproclamation of our independence. During the past halfcentury  our people have endured tremendous humansacrifice and material loss in order to safeguard our nationalindependence. To rebuild and develop our homeland  wehave overcome innumerable tests and trials  as well as theextremely heavy consequences of long and fierce wars.Thanks to the determination of the whole nation united inmind and in action  our reform and renewal process  nowin its tenth year  has achieved major initial results  thusmaking it possible to move to a new stage of development:the industrialization and modernization of our country.Recent years have seen the continuous development ofour economy  with an average annual growth rate of 8.2per cent  an annual increase in exports of 20 per cent  anda 40 per cent annual increase in foreign investment. Thestandard of living is steadily improving. Economicdevelopment is increasingly linked with social and culturaldevelopment. Our objective is to build a strong andprosperous Viet Nam with an equitable and civilizedsociety. Alongside our economic reforms  we have carriedout political reforms to build a State governed by the ruleof law  and which is of the people  by the people and forthe people. On the basis of our 1992 Constitution  wehave promulgated a series of laws  codes and legaldecrees in order ever more completely to ensure the rightsand interests of all citizens  and at the same time to createa firm legal basis for governing the country. These all-round achievements constitute a firm guarantee of socialand political stability and lay the foundation needed forfuture sustainable development.Along with reform in all aspects of social life  VietNam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broadopenness  the thrust of which is to diversify andmultilateralize its external relations in order to create astable environment and external conditions conducive tothe task of building and defending the country  and toenhance Viet Nam’s position on the international scene.To implement this policy  Viet Nam has establisheddiplomatic relations with nearly 160 countries  includingall the world’s major Powers and leading economic andpolitical centres. Viet Nam’s accession to full membershipof ASEAN  the signing of an agreement of cooperationwith the European Union  and the normalization andestablishment of full diplomatic relations with the UnitedStates all took place in July this year. That was nocoincidence  but was the outcome of a whole process ofimplementing a foreign policy inspired by a new spirit  bywhich Viet Nam is willing to be the friend of all nationsin the international community  and to strive for peace national independence and development. This provideseloquent testimony to the correctness of our foreignpolicy and to its consonance with the trends of our times.As it broadens its relations with all countries  VietNam is also endeavouring consistently to improve andstrengthen relations with international organizations including the international financial and monetaryinstitutions  and is ready to participate in regional andglobal cooperation organizations. Following thenormalization of its relations with the InternationalMonetary Fund  the World Bank and the AsiaDevelopment Bank and its participation in the ASEANFree Trade Area  Viet Nam is now actively preparing tojoin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum andthe World Trade Organization at an appropriate time. VietNam continues to maintain close and effectivecooperation with the United Nations and with specializedagencies of the United Nations system.The achievements of its foreign policy provide anew impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process ofregional and global integration  and to participate more22effectively in global forums and institutions  with a view totackling the pressing problems facing all mankind  and tocontributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of theinternational community to achieve peace  nationalindependence  friendship  cooperation among States anddevelopment.Today and in the weeks to come  from every point onthe horizon  peoples of the world  regardless of language race or culture  are turning to this Hall  where therepresentatives of 185 countries are assembled at a historicmoment marking half a century of the United Nations withthe ardent hope and expectation that the Organization willtruly enter a new era  in which its own motto  “United fora better world” can become a reality. There is no promisemore dear to our hearts and no commitment more solemnthan our determination to prepare ourselves for the commonjourney into the twenty-first century  to realize the noblepurposes of the Charter of the United Nations for a betterworld and for a fairer and more reasonable world order thatwill meet the ardent hopes of the present generation andthat will build a sound foundation for succeedinggenerations."
"169",7467,"WSM",50,1995,"I have to confess to myusual excitement and pleasure at addressing the GeneralAssembly  exceptionally crowded and patient even at thislate hour.Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fiftieth session. Mr. Freito do Amaralrepresents a country with a long history of globalachievements. With his personal qualities and experience he is a very natural choice to guide the work of thisAssembly at such a critical moment.Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr.Amara Essy  for his dedicated and distinguishedstewardship during the last session of the GeneralAssembly.I want also to record the gratitude of myGovernment to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the measure and quality of theleadership that he continues to provide in the directionand work of the Organization.28Barely three weeks ago Hurricane Luis wroughtdevastation on several island countries in the Caribbean causing major setbacks to economic and sustainabledevelopment  as well as the loss of lives. As we ourselvesrecently experienced two similar disasters  our thoughts andsympathy are with the people of the Caribbean nationsdevastated by Hurricane Luis  and we pray for their speedyrecovery.The President of the General Assembly  in his openingremarks  reminded us of the scope of the membership andthe universal character of this Organization. Samoa is proudto note that a sister nation of the Pacific  the Republic ofPalau  is the newest Member of the United Nations  and Iam delighted to extend to Palau the warmest of welcomes.Two weeks ago the Republic of Palau was acclaimed tomembership — becoming the sixteenth member — of theSouth Pacific Forum. That too was a moment of great pridefor all of us.We come together at a special moment for thisOrganization and in the history of international cooperation.Undeniably  this is a session of exceptional importance. Weneed to take stock of where we  the United Nations  are andto set new goals and priorities for the future.Samoa believes that any stocktaking must be rooted inthe Charter  which proclaims the purposes and principles ofthe Organization. Regrettably  the Charter pledges that wehave made to succeeding generations remain largelyunfulfilled.It is right  and it is natural  therefore that at thisfiftieth session  we  the peoples of the United Nations should seek to renew our commitment to those pledges. Butfirst  it must be remembered that they are pledges that carrythe attendant duty — a most sacred duty — to make themrealities. It is a duty imposed upon us all and accepted uponmembership in our Organization. Far too often  this isforgotten  or seemingly ignored.This session will also be the natural occasion on whichto reaffirm our support for  and our faith in  the UnitedNations. I speak positively and unhesitatingly aboutreaffirmation because  quite frankly  what else is there totake the place of the United Nations?What we have is certainly not perfect. And given itsalmost universal make-up  the range of issues before it andthe increasing demands being made of the United Nations it would be surprising if this were the case. Indeed  inrecent years  all of us in this Assembly have been engagedin various activities aimed at making the United Nationsmore relevant  more efficient and more cost-effective andat preparing the Organization for the twenty-first century.We welcome in particular resolution 49/252  which wasrecently adopted  on strengthening of the United Nationssystem  and we look forward to taking part in thediscussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Groupestablished. If and when we have devised changes andimprovements in the United Nations system  I dare saythat in years to come it will be necessary to persist inmonitoring and putting into place further needed reformsto ensure the sustaining vigour of the Organization. Thatbeing the case  there is clearly room for criticism andfault-finding  from among ourselves as well as from thosewho look on. We do not however think the shortcomingsof the United Nations warrant uninformed cynicism andunfair blame  nor the charge of irrelevance that issometimes levelled at it.But clearly  the standing and the very role of theUnited Nations is at risk if the Members continue to denythe Organization the funds and resources it needs. TheSecretary-General has spoken of this matter time andagain  and once more in his report on the work of theOrganization (A/50/1). The Organization is in a mostcritical financial state  but it is also clear that the situationcan be substantially improved with the early payment ofarrears and by the full and timely payment of assessedcontributions. We can only urge the most immediateaction on the part of those who know they must act.Samoa is a small and least-developed country. Weare deeply committed to the United Nations  and we willcontinue to meet our financial and other responsibilities notwithstanding the budgetary problems we face. Weshare the view that the strongest measures must be takento achieve sound financial viability for this Organization.It would be essential for this purpose that there be a fair more equitable and realistic scale of assessments  onewhich would take full account of the principle of capacityto pay.This must also take into account the predicament ofsome countries  including my own  which are assessed atthe floor rate of the scale  at levels far beyond theircapacity to pay. We believe there is a just case forabolishing or reducing the current floor rate. This is amatter of importance to many small States and we wouldhope that the High-level Working Group on the FinancialSituation of the United Nations would continue to give itdue consideration.29There is a second aspect  which touches on theemphasis now being given to United Nations peace-keepingactivities. While Samoa recognizes the necessary andtraditional role of the United Nations in promoting globalpeace and security  it seems to us that ultimately no amountof force and no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peaceand security without attention to the root causes. Our ownview is that human misery brought about by poverty andthe denial of human and democratic rights are often the realand fundamental problems. Unless these are removed orminimized  there can never be the substratum that we needfor lasting world peace and security.Put simply  Samoa believes firmly that social andeconomic development must remain a major preoccupationof the United Nations  as pledged in the Charter.Development priorities spelt out in recent globalconferences for the sustained economic and socialadvancement of the developing countries should beeffectively implemented. They should not be ignored whilethe Organization’s attention and its focus  in terms ofhuman and financial resources  is diverted elsewhere largely on peace-keeping activities.For Samoa and other small island States disadvantagedby their size and geographical location  the Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development on Small IslandDeveloping States must remain a centrepiece of ourattention.We welcome steps taken by the various organs of theUnited Nations system to implement the Plan of Action.We appreciate  in particular  what is being done by theDepartment for Policy Co-ordination and SustainableDevelopment and the Unit set up to monitor theimplementation of the Programme of Action. These stepswill complement efforts undertaken by our regionalcountries in the South Pacific region to further advance thecommitments made in Rio  Barbados and elsewhere.Samoa’s commitment to the pursuit of global peaceand security is unwavering. We will continue to do whatwe can. Conflicts which continue to rage in many regionsof the world today cannot be ignored. They affect us all for they impact directly or indirectly on the ability of theUnited Nations and the international community to respondto the development needs of others.We welcome the latest initiatives with a view tobringing a peaceful end to the conflict in Bosnia. Asettlement acceptable to all parties must be reached.Another milestone in the Middle East peace processwas reached in Washington yesterday. With the rest ofthe world  we celebrate and commend the enduring effortsand commitments made by the Israeli and Palestinianleaders to lasting peace and security for all in that region.Our environment is of vital importance  and ofsingular concern to my Government. Our actions in theregion and at the international level are dictated by a deepcommitment to preserving it. Together with othercountries in our region  we have initiated and concludeda series of treaty regimes  including those designed toprotect the natural resources and environment of theSouth Pacific region and to establish the South Pacificnuclear-free zone to keep our region free ofenvironmental pollution by radioactive wastes and otherradioactive matter.We will continue to supplement these efforts as theneed arises. Indeed  leaders at the recent South PacificForum meeting in Papua New Guinea adopted the Treatyon the Control and Movement of Hazardous and ToxicWastes in the South Pacific. Samoa did not hesitate tosign it.Consistently over the years Samoa  together with ourregional partners  has called for a permanent end tonuclear testing  the dumping of chemical and toxic wastesand the transportation of these materials in our waters.From this account you will therefore understand ourdeep shock and distress when it was announced in Junethat France proposed to resume the testing of nuclearweapons in the Pacific. We sought  at the highest level as many others did  to persuade the Government ofFrance not to do so. We took action to register ourconcern and to protest and we sought to intervene in theproceedings brought by New Zealand against France inthe International Court of Justice. Together with otherForum countries we moved to make direct representationto the Government of France — all to no avail.The explosion of a nuclear device at Mururoa atollearly this month brings to close to 200 the number ofunderground nuclear tests France has carried out in thePacific since 1975. Of the whole United Nationsmembership  Samoa is the closest to the test site.The resumption of nuclear testing by France hasbeen made in the face of strong and persistent protestfrom countries of the region  and equally strong andoverwhelming condemnation from all parts of the world.30The current tests are being conducted in the absence of anyenvironmental impact assessments that we know of or havebeen advised of  and in the opinion of my Government indisregard of France’s existing regional treaty obligations.Like other members of the South Pacific Forum  Samoa isoutraged at the resumption of French nuclear testing in thePacific — and  as I say  in the vicinity of my country. Inthe strongest possible terms we condemn it. We do sobecause of the extreme danger it poses to our environmentand health  now and in the long term; and because the testsare completely contrary to the undertaking at the recentNon-Proliferation Treaty review Conference that nuclearStates exercise utmost restraint in nuclear testing pendingthe completion of negotiations on a comprehensive test-bantreaty that would ban nuclear tests for all time.We do welcome France’s commitment to acomprehensive test-ban treaty  but that should not be usedas an excuse for France to continue its nuclear testing inour region. For the sake of our environment and all wholive there  we call on France to stop.We call also  and once more  on the three nuclearPowers which have not yet signed and ratified the Protocolsto the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty to do so.It is also out of deep concern for our environment thatSamoa has taken every step possible to be engaged in thenegotiations and in the implementation of the internationalconventions relating to climate change  biodiversity  marinepollution and the conservation of straddling and highlymigratory fish stocks. Global warming and the threat ofsea-level rise are matters of the gravest concern to mycountry and our region. Recently  the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the warmingof the global atmosphere is unlikely to be entirely due tonatural causes. In other words  human activity is a definitecause that cannot be discounted.While this is not entirely unexpected  the latestindication from the IPCC bears out the inadequacy ofcurrent Convention commitments for Annex I parties  andunderlines the essential correctness  and the urgency  of theBerlin Mandate issued from the first Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change. For its part  Samoa will continue to worktogether with countries of the Alliance of Small IslandStates (AOSIS) towards the early acceptance of clearemission-reduction targets of the type advanced in the draftAOSIS Protocol.In respect of fish stocks  let me take the opportunityto pay tribute to all the countries that worked so hard toproduce the truly remarkable triumph in the form of thedraft Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisionsof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Searelating to the Conservation and Management ofStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.In particular  we express our gratitude to AmbassadorSatya Nandan of Fiji for his exceptional skill andchairmanship.This has been a landmark year on many counts; withthe fiftieth anniversary commemoration we will celebratenext month the crowning event.The Fourth World Conference on Women  inBeijing  is one such landmark. Samoa warmly applaudsthe unanimous adoption of the Platform for Action  andthe remarkable degree of international consultation andcooperation that was employed to produce it. What isneeded now is the highest degree of commitment andaction  in close consultation with women at all levels.There would be little point in having yet another finedocument without any prospect of implementation  andwithout the effort and the will to make concrete changesand improvements. And let it be remembered that suchchanges and improvements are not for women alone  butfor the full development of mankind.Without doubt  the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a major achievement for theworld community this year. We congratulate AmbassadorDhanapala of Sri Lanka on his remarkable role andleadership in ensuring the successful outcome of theReview Conference.The decisions we took then are essential tointernational peace and security  and the attainment of theultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclearweapons and a treaty on general and completedisarmament under strict and effective internationalcontrol. The successful conclusion of a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty by 1996 is a specific goal for theattainment of which all Member States of this bodyshould strive with the utmost effort.We pray that at the end of the presidency ofAmbassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  the worldcommunity will be able to celebrate the accomplishmentof that objective."
"170",7511,"YEM",50,1995,"Permit me at the outset warmly to congratulate Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session  whichcoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding ofthe United Nations. His election to the presidency of thisimportant session reflects special appreciation for hiswell-known diplomatic skills. It also reflects his country’srole in and contribution to the international community andto consolidating its security and stability in line with theprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.Nor can I fail today warmly to thank His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy for his judicious management of the workof the General Assembly during its last session  and for histireless role in restructuring the United Nations anddemocratizing its practices.Similarly  I should like to reaffirm my country’sappreciation of the role played by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and of his indefatigable invaluable work for international peace and security. Weparticularly commend the Secretary-General’s two reports the Agendas for Peace and for Development  whichconstitute central pillars of the new international relations.This session takes place half a century after thefounding of the United Nations. It therefore behoves us topause for reflection on how the Organization has developedover the past five decades  for identifying positive andnegative developments over that period and for workingtowards promoting the positive elements. We must steer theOrganization in new directions that would spare us thenegative elements which accompanied the progress of theOrganization in the past.Proceeding from this  the Republic of Yemen supportsthe efforts aimed at developing the Organization’smachineries and principal organs in order for it to be ableto rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Mycountry  therefore  welcomes the introduction of structuralreforms  especially with regard to expanding SecurityCouncil membership to reflect more accurately the newrealities and recent changes in international relations  whileobserving the principles of equitable representation andgeographical distribution and ensuring transparency in theCouncil’s work. My country is confident that these requiredreforms  when introduced  will contribute to the emergenceof new international relationships that would becharacterized by right  justice and equality.There is no doubt that the international conferencesthe World has witnessed since the end of the cold war onsocial  environmental and women’s issues  have beenimportant steps taken by the United Nations towardsshaping a new  integrated system with humandevelopment as its goal  in order to develop a new wayof life  ensure the future of the human race  establish thefoundations of equitable and sustainable development andwork towards eliminating the spectres of poverty ignorance and disease  dangers which continue to threatenhundreds of millions of the world’s inhabitants.In this context  my country wishes to express itssatisfaction with the work carried out by the Committeeon the Indian Ocean to make that region a zone of peace.We call upon States members of the Security Council maritime users of the Indian Ocean and littoral countriesto participate in the work of the Committee in view of thepositive contribution it is making towards strengtheningpeace  security  stability and cooperation in the region  inthe light of General Assembly resolutions 48/82 and49/82.There is no doubt that the world at the end of thetwentieth century is vastly different from what it was inthe past. Many fundamental concepts of peace development and security are changing  side by side withthe developments that are taking place in internationalrelations. In the light of these changes  everyone isbecoming increasingly aware that human developmentshould become the focus of the activities of the UnitedNations systems with a view to narrowing the gapbetween North and South  and to promoting economic andsocial integration on the basis of the common interests ofStates.If any achievement is to be made in this area  wewill need to rely upon international economic cooperationin facing up to such international problems as mitigatingpoverty and eradicating famine from developing countries especially the least developed among them. In thiscontext  my country calls upon the internationalcommunity to commit itself to implementing theProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s  in accordance with General Assemblyresolution 45/206 of 1990. My country also welcomes theestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the conclusion of the 1994 GATT agreements  whichaim at enhancing integration  promoting equitablecooperation in trade relations and reducing the intensityof unfair competition between different societies.14The tragic situation of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina has been the focus of the internationalcommunity’s attention. It has become clear thatinternational efforts in that region have not succeeded dueto the absence of a genuine desire to put paid to the horrificmassacring of defenceless civilians in the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs  in opendefiance of the international will. Therefore  my countryconsiders it imperative that the Security Council shouldhasten to lift the weapons embargo in order for the peopleof Bosnia and Herzegovina to be able to exercise the rightof self-defence enshrined in Article 51 of the UnitedNations Charter. It is not acceptable  in today’s world  thatwe should stand as spectators under whose eyes atyrannical minority is allowed to impose by force its willover the majority’s legitimate rights. While the Republic ofYemen welcomes the peace efforts that are being deployedwith a view to putting an end to the suffering of theMuslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina  it hopes for aconcerted international effort to find a just solution  whichwould guarantee the freedom  sovereignty and territorialintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina andensure the continued provision of humanitarian assistance.The Middle East has witnessed developments whichcould represent an historical turning-point in the lives of thepeoples of the region  and could thereby reduce theintensity of hotbeds of tension that threaten internationalsecurity and stability. Special mention should be made ofthe positive gains made on the Palestinian-Israeli track which resulted in the signing in Washington last year of theAgreement on the transitional period  and the recent TabaAgreement on the expansion of Palestinian autonomy. Mycountry looks forward to the day when the Palestinianpeople will enjoy their full rights and establish their Stateon their own territory  with Holy Al-Quds as its capital.Despite the tangible progress made on the Palestinian andJordanian tracks  we stress that just and lasting peace willremain contingent upon complete Israeli withdrawal fromall the occupied Arab territories  particularly the SyrianGolan and South Lebanon  in accordance with UnitedNations resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and in line with the principle of land for peace  on the basisof which the Madrid conference was held in October 1991.The civil war in Somalia and the tensions in the Hornof Africa which have exceeded the bounds of logic andreason  have caused serious trouble to the neighbouringcountries  and will cause endless social problems. Theperpetuation of the situation of disruption  confusion andinfighting in Somalia is a source of grave concern to us all.Given Yemen’s Arab  regional and humanitarianobligations  it has suffered and continues to suffer theconsequences of the war in Somalia. We have borne theburden of receiving and accommodating tens of thousandsof refugees  but our ability to continue to do so willdepend on whether or not the concerted efforts of theinternational community and the international and regionalorganizations will put an end to the suffering of theSomali people and stop the infighting between thewarring factions. A solution to this tragic situation mustbe found and what has been destroyed by the war must berebuilt  in order for the Somali people to resume a normalway of life.While my country affirms that Iraq should completeimplementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions  and cooperate fully with the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to clear up theproblem of missing persons and prisoners  it reiteratesthat Iraq’s unity  sovereignty and territorial integrityshould not be infringed and that there should not be anyinterference in its internal affairs under any pretext.Yemen also repeats its call for the lifting of the economicsanctions against Iraq  in order to mitigate the sufferingof the Iraqi people. This should be done without anydevious interpretations of the resolutions of internationallegality and without the imposition of any new conditionsrelating to the nature of the political system  as this is apurely Iraqi matter that should be decided only the Iraqipeople themselves. The Republic of Yemen wishes toexpress its satisfaction with the declaration made by Iraqto the Security Council  and made during theOrganization’s Envoy’s recent visits to Iraq  that Iraq isprepared to cooperate with the international inspectionteam.The Republic of Yemen urges the internationalcommunity and the Security Council to push for an endto the air blockade and other measures imposed againstLibya  in response to the resolutions and decisions of theregional Organization in relation to the dispute  and inresponse to the positive initiatives calling for dialogue andnegotiations.The Republic of Yemen also renews its appeal to itsbrethren in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the UnitedArab Emirates to reach a peaceful settlement to theproblem of the three islands — Greater Tunb  LesserTunb and Abu Moussa — in accordance with the Charterof the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  the15principle of good-neighbourliness and the precepts andprinciples of international law.The continued acquisition by the world of weapons ofmass destruction  endangers international security andstability and obstructs the search for solutions to theproblems of development. Disarmament and the channellingof a portion of military expenditure to development must beas fundamental steps towards the consolidation ofinternational security and stability.Peace and development are two concomitant essentialsfor the life of man and should lie at the heart of UnitedNations future activities at the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury.In this context  my country commends theachievements of the Review and Extension Conference ofthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons in April 1995. However  the success ofthe resolutions adopted by this Conference will depend onthe extent of commitment by all States to the contents ofthose resolutions  the affirmation of the universal dimensionof the treaty and its full  not its limited implementation onthe regional level  particularly in the Middle East. That willstrengthen the legal force of the Treaty  and create theappropriate climate for the functioning of the institutionsand mechanisms which will play a principal and importantrole in the process of its implementation.The Republic of Yemen  having achieved reunificationon 22 May 1990  and having firmly consolidated thefoundations of this unity through the triumph of our peopleover the separatist conspiracy on 7 July 1994  is nowengaged in strengthening its democratic approach ofpolitical pluralism  respect for human rights and freedom ofthe press. Yemen is also engaged in effecting economicreforms that would enable it to achieve the qualitativetransformations required by Yemeni Society in theeconomic life of the country  such as restructuring thenational economy. This will make Yemen a force for peaceand stability in the region  and enable it to contribute moreeffectively to the maintenance of international security andstability.As Yemen is one of the least developed countries  andin view of the damage done to its national economy by theseparatist attempt  we hope that the international communitywill increase its support and assistance  in order to enableus to rebuild our social and economic structures and ridourselves of the effects of the failed attempt.In the context of our foreign policy approach ofdialogue and the settlement of problems by peacefulmeans  my country has resolved its border question withthe fraternal Sultanate of Oman  and is in the process with the same degree of sincerity and seriousness  ofseeking a settlement to the border problem with thefraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  through the work ofjoint committees  on the basis of the principles containedin the Memorandum of Understanding signed in HolyMecca on 26 February 1995.The Republic of Yemen  as a member of theinternational community  has always performed and willcontinue to perform its humanitarian role in theframework of the United Nations. It will spare no effortin effectively participating with the internationalcommunity in working for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Let us then make thissession a new point of departure  towards the renewal ofthe concepts of inter-State relations  and towards makingour Organization a universal arbiter."
"171",7577,"ZAF",50,1995,"Mr. President  I wish toextend to you  on behalf of the South African delegation my sincere congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.Your election demonstrates the high regard in which theinternational community holds your country. I should alsolike to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  a brother from Africa and theForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire  who presided over theforty-ninth session with great wisdom. I should also like toexpress to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our continued confidence inhis guidance of the Organization.A half century ago representatives from 50 countriesmet at San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter the Declaration of Human Rights and the Statute of theInternational Court of Justice. For the United Nations tohave survived for a period of 50 years in an imperfectworld is indeed a milestone and a tribute to the visionarysteps taken half a century ago towards the creation of abetter world.South Africa’s involvement with the United Nationsgoes back to the very conception and birth of thisillustrious body. The then-Prime Minister of South Africa Field Marshal J. C. Smuts  helped to draft the Preambleto the Charter of the United Nations. In the Preamblemany lofty ideas were expressed  among which were thefollowing:“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  inthe dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand small”.How ironic that those in power in South Africa sincethen  and until last year  acted in a precisely contraryspirit. The United Nations contributed significantly inbringing about change in South Africa. Throughperseverance and commitment  the United Nationsassisted us in our struggle to achieve democracy. OurGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995reward is its reward. I should like again to express thegratitude of both the people and the Government of SouthAfrica for its foresight and courage.Just over a year ago  on 23 June 1994 to be precise I had the honour to address the Assembly on behalf of thepeople and the Government of the Republic of SouthAfrica. On that occasion  which marked South Africa’sresumption of its participation in the work of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations  we were filled with joyand pride at the peaceful transition of South Africa into aunited  non-racial  democratic and non-sexist society.In the intervening months I have travelled to manycountries  visited with many foreign ministers and met withseveral Heads of State or Government. We spoke of themiracle that is South Africa. We shared our thoughts andexperiences on the road to that miracle. In that context  wecontinue to encourage those who seek change for a betterlife to stand fast in their belief.As the representative of a Member of the UnitedNations  I should like to reassure you of our belief in andsupport for the purposes and principles of the Charter of theOrganization.The events in April 1994 in South Africa marked abreak with the past as well as a commitment to the future placing a heavy burden on us. As a young democracy  weare ready to meet the challenge. South Africa will meet thischallenge with a firm commitment to the promotion ofnational welfare  prosperity and security  with a firmcommitment to the strengthening of cooperation in thepursuit of the economic development and security of thesouthern African subregion  with an active commitment topeace  stability and good governance within the Africanregion and elsewhere  with a firm commitment to South-South cooperation and with a commitment to responsibleinternational citizenship.The Southern African Development Community(SADC) was conceived in the struggle for freedom insouthern Africa and born of the courage of its leaders insetting out to create a new reality.The liberation of South Africa and the end of southernAfrica’s destabilization brought great opportunities for thedevelopment of our subregion. We must now translate thosehopes into reality. In accordance with the Abuja Treaty  wemust transform the southern African region into one of thereliable building blocks on which Africa’s economicregeneration will be built.Our greatest need today is to eradicate the scourgeof poverty afflicting the great mass of our people. Onlythen can we fulfil the dream of Africa’s liberation in thehealth  happiness and well-being of its children.The mission of SADC reflects the reality thatsouthern Africa has long since passed the stage oflamenting the privations of the past. The challenge is tofind within ourselves the resources to overcome thislegacy  with the cooperation of the internationalcommunity. We need to adapt to the demands of a rapidlychanging world economy and to develop the skills neededto compete internationally.South Africa’s main objective is to play aconstructive role in bringing peace and stability to theregion. We are totally committed to the utilization ofpreventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peacemaking through the use of regional and multilateral mechanisms.In this context  South Africa participated with othersin the resolution of the conflict in Lesotho and providedlogistical support for the elections in Mozambique. Oursupport for United Nations resolutions and actionsregarding Angola and the Western Sahara should also beseen in that light.As an elected member of the Central Organ of theConflict Resolution Mechanism of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) from June 1994 to June 1995  weparticipated in several missions to Burundi. South Africawas part of a special four-member ministerial missionelected to assess the nature and the scope of the Burundiconflict with a view to encouraging and assisting theBurundians to resolve their differences and end thatconflict. We continue to participate in the Mechanism asan invited observer.In view of the desperate situation in the formerYugoslavia and in Rwanda  it has become imperative forStates to cooperate as far as possible with the respectivead hoc criminal tribunals that have been created for thoseterritories. In that regard  my country has made availablesome of its most talented jurists to assist.These situations have demonstrated anew the realneed for the establishment of a permanent internationalcriminal court. This issue has been revitalized in the pastfew years  and a window of opportunity now exists tofinally bring the court into existence. It is my sincerehope that significant progress will be made in that regardduring this session of the General Assembly.2General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  mankind is still faced with political instability dictatorship  corruption  civil war  millions of refugees andinternally displaced persons  persistent economic declineand continued impoverishment.In the past year  the international political climate hasexperienced a succession of changes which have broughtboth hope and a certain measure of despair to mankind.Hope has  however  remained a beckoning beacon bringingabout a sense of confidence in the future. We weresaddened by events in Somalia  but rejoiced at the transitionin Haiti and El Salvador. We despair at the tragedy that isBosnia  yet hope that the emerging signs of a solution willcome to fruition.In this spirit  allow me to congratulate the peoples ofIsrael and Palestine on having reached yet another landmarkin their journey towards a lasting settlement. We encourageand support the Middle East peace process.The issues of proliferation and disarmament  inparticular nuclear disarmament  are among the majorquestions that have been facing the international communityin recent times. At the historic 1995 Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  all those presentagreed to exercise the utmost restraint pending the entryinto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are of theview that the recent tests conducted by two nuclear-weaponStates are retrogressive steps in the internationalcommunity’s endeavour to ban nuclear testing. We believethat these tests will negatively affect the outcome of workon a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The South AfricanGovernment is strongly opposed to these and any furthernuclear tests being conducted  and calls upon those Statesto cease testing  so as to enhance international effortstowards non-proliferation and disarmament. We call uponthem to honour both the letter and the spirit of thePrinciples and Objectives which they agreed to and helpednegotiate at the NPT Review and Extension Conference.South Africa has dismantled its nuclear capability. SouthAfrica  for its part  has proven its commitment to nucleardisarmament. Now it is the turn of others to manifest asimilar commitment.South Africa notes with great satisfaction the progressachieved thus far towards the establishment of an Africannuclear-weapon-free zone. We have been actively involvedin trying to find solutions to the outstanding issues  and wetrust that these hurdles can be overcome and the draft treatyof Pelindaba can receive due consideration during thissession of the General Assembly. The draft treaty isimportant as it would expand the non-nuclear-weaponarea of the globe considerably and would be a further steptowards the final goal of complete nuclear disarmament.South Africa appeals to the nuclear-weapon States toensure that the draft treaty is concluded and the relevantprotocols signed.Since the 1986 declaration of the Zone of Peace andCooperation of the South Atlantic  significant progress hasbeen made in the political  economic  scientific  technicaland cultural spheres to further the objectives of the Zone.Only relatively few obstacles remain. We hope to advancethis endeavour when the next meeting of participatingnations takes place in Cape Town in March 1996.On 13 September 1995 South Africa became thethirty-seventh State party to the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.On the same day South Africa also acceded to theConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use ofCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemedto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have IndiscriminateEffects. The ratification of the chemical weaponsConvention again underlines the commitment of theGovernment of National Unity to the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. South Africa’s accession tothe Convention on certain conventional weaponsunderlines my Government’s commitment to theelimination of the suffering that is caused by the scourgeof war. South Africa has  for this reason  decided toextend its moratorium on the export of land-mines by theintroduction of a permanent ban on the export or sale oflong-lived anti-personnel land-mines. Furthermore  on30 August 1995 the Government of National Unityapproved the draft of a new conventional-arms-controlpolicy. A National Conventional Arms Control Committeehas been established and will function in accordance withpredetermined guiding principles and criteria to ensurethat arms trade and transfers conform to acceptedinternational practice.As previously mentioned  the principal role of theUnited Nations is to safeguard international peace andsecurity in order to implement universal respect forhuman rights and to create conditions necessary forsustainable development. Without peace  security andhuman rights  sustainable development will be difficult toachieve. Without development and respect for humanrights  international peace and security will continually bethreatened.3General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995As President Mandela stated in 1992 “Our common humanity transcends the oceansand all national boundaries. It binds us together incommon cause against tyranny  to act together indefence of our very humanity. Let it never be asked ofany one of us what we did when we knew thatanother was oppressed.”Mankind should learn to act against all tyranny in aunified manner through the United Nations. This should beour basic aim for the future.South Africa also wishes to call attention to theactivities of mercenaries  irrespective of their origin andobjectives. Their destabilizing activities cannot be tolerated.We call on the international community and the UnitedNations to be seized of this problem of mercenaries.The women of South Africa have lived  in varyingdegrees  under three forms of oppression  relating to race to class and to gender. One of the first steps towardsinitiating positive change in the lives of all South Africanwomen was the entrenchment of gender rights in our Billof Rights. It was with much pride that the South Africandelegation took their seats at the Fourth World Conferenceon Women  in Beijing. That was the first time South Africaparticipated in a conference on women which focused onthe eradication of poverty  and equal access to educationand to health services. South Africa is fully committed toimplementing the Platform for Action adopted at thatConference  which will serve as the impetus for a world ofequality  development and peace for all. In addition  ourParliament has most recently approved South Africa’sratification of the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women  without anyreservations.Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed theoverwhelming majority black population with a heavylegacy of poverty  social disintegration and politicalcleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities. Ittherefore became the priority task of the South AfricanGovernment of National Unity to devise a national strategyto address this catastrophic situation. A comprehensive andmulti-pronged developmental strategy known as theReconstruction and Development Programme is now beingimplemented. The implementation of this Programme reliesprimarily on the mobilization of domestic resources throughprioritization of budgetary resources  with a view toaddressing the huge material inequalities in such areas aseducation  health  housing  infrastructure development andland reform. It is a unique people-centred and people-driven Programme  which seeks to translate into economicbenefit the political miracle in our country. At the veryheart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of theinextricable interdependence between the need fortransparent  accountable and democratic governance ofour society and the imperative of dynamic economicgrowth and sustainable development.South Africa will host the ninth United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX)from 26 April to 11 May 1996. This is an event which allSouth Africans are looking forward to with greatexpectation. Indeed  it is my pleasure to announce thatour preparations are well advanced and on course.We attach great significance to UNCTAD IX for anumber of reasons. We believe that the rapid progress ofglobalization and liberalization of the world economy hasunderscored the relevance and importance of UNCTADas a United Nations institution with a strong developmentmandate and perspective. We also believe that thesuccessful completion of the Uruguay Round ofnegotiations and the resultant creation of the World TradeOrganization not only has stressed the validity andrelevance of UNCTAD  but has also reinforced the needto retain and strengthen UNCTAD’s mandate as a policy-oriented global intergovernmental forum on trade anddevelopment issues. It is a forum where a strongpartnership for development between the developed andthe developing countries can  and must  be forged. Whilethere may be a need to streamline certain UNCTADactivities  this should not lead to its demise. WithoutUNCTAD  our world  especially the developing world would be the poorer.I would like to take this opportunity to express myGovernment’s satisfaction with the intergovernmentalprocess at the United Nations to draw up a UnitedNations Agenda for Development. We believe that theUnited Nations is the appropriate forum for theelaboration of the Agenda for Development. The Agendafor Development could open great possibilities fordevelopment and for partnership between the developedand the developing countries. It is for this reason thatSouth Africa is taking great interest in the work of the AdHoc Open-ended Working Group of the GeneralAssembly on an Agenda for Development.My Government has been following with greatinterest the ongoing High-level IntergovernmentalMeeting on the Mid-term Global Review of the4General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995Implementation of the Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries. In this connection  I join others incalling on the international community to devise a globalstrategy to effectively address the debt question confrontingthe least developed countries  and to use innovativemeasures — whether it be official development aid  foreigndirect investment or multilateral financial assistance — toarrest the decline of resources destined for the leastdeveloped countries.I would also like to call upon the internationalcommunity to vigorously pursue measures required tosuccessfully implement the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. We are pleased inthat regard by the progress registered during the Economicand Social Council’s session in Geneva  especially the high-level segment  which was devoted to the aforementionedAgenda. Of course  the challenge before the internationalcommunity is to find adequate resources to translate thisAgenda into tangible results. It is our hope that this issuewill be treated with the required urgency  given that nextyear there will be a mid-term global review of the NewAgenda for the Development of Africa.Recognizing the importance of cooperation betweendeveloping States  South Africa has acceded to anagreement establishing the South Centre. The South Centrewill effectively operate as a policy research unit for theNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77  and will draftpolicy-oriented position papers on issues of criticalimportance to the South. It will  in addition to this basicfunction  generate ideas and proposals for consideration byGovernments of the South and other institutions.The United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment engendered a process of environmental actionand awareness centred on the relationship betweeneconomic development and the sustainable management ofthe environment. It is our duty to carry this process forwardin an integrated manner and reconfirm our commitment tothe implementation of international agreements which seekto manage and preserve the world’s environment.South Africa is very conscious that the capacity ofdeveloping countries to implement sustainableenvironmental strategies will have to be strengthened. Theresources pledged towards the attainment of goals set out inAgenda 21 will have to be made available if we are tosucceed in achieving the imperatives of development sustainable use of the environment  and democracy in theworld.In Africa  in particular  the ravages of drought andthe advances of desertification require urgent attention.The global community’s concern for the environmentshould be reflected in a common approach to themanifold environmental pressures threatening our globalheritage.The United Nations also has an important role toplay in assisting States threatened by natural or man-madedisasters. Preventive diplomacy can contribute towardseliminating man-made disasters. However  the results ofboth man-made disasters and natural disasters can beameliorated by effective international humanitarianassistance coordination through the United Nations. Thiswill naturally require more coherent programmed deliveryand coordination by the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the Foodand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO)  the World Health Organization (WHO)  theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the UnitedNations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) andother international institutions. The United Nations willhave to ensure that the necessary capacities andmechanisms are created. Recent international action especially the follow-up to the Tokyo Conference  hasdemonstrated that sufficient international will exists toperform this function.We welcome the adoption on 14 September 1995 ofGeneral Assembly resolution 49/252  on the strengtheningof the United Nations. I wish to assure the Assembly ofour intention to work constructively with the President inthis endeavour.The world in which we find ourselves today isgreatly changed from just 10 years ago. The cold war hasended  the scourge of apartheid has been removed fromour common society and peace has come to Mozambiqueand now Angola. We have also seen the membership ofour United Nations increase to 185  a substantial increasesince the time the Security Council’s membership was lastincreased. As a result of these  and other  factors theinternational community faces a window of opportunitywithin which the Security Council can be successfullyrestructured and reformed.Within the overall effort to reform the UnitedNations  South Africa believes that the structure andfunctioning of the Security Council should be reformed tomake it more representative  democratic and transparent.The product of these efforts must be a Security Councilthat is effective and legitimate  and that reflects the5General Assembly 22nd plenary meetingFiftieth session 13 October 1995realities of our modern world. This result can be achievedonly if reform and restructuring is dealt with as a package.One of the products of this reform process must result inAfrica having equitable representation on any enlargedSecurity Council.It would be appropriate for me to conclude byreferring to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.The people of South Africa will celebrate this fiftiethanniversary in concert with the rest of the world. OurNational Committee organizing the events in our countryhas adopted the following as its Declaration of Intent:“To create an awareness among the peoples of SouthAfrica of the role which the United nations can playin their daily lives  and to assist the United Nations inresponding to the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury.”President Mandela looks forward to joining his fellowworld leaders in a few weeks’ time to celebrate thevisionary step taken half a century ago towards the creationof a better world. Building on the successes and victoriesof the past  we now embrace the future. We can face thechallenges ahead  inspired by a vision of a new worldwhere peace and respect for human dignity are the standard."
"172",7620,"ZMB",50,1995,"On this important occasion allow me to extend to the President the congratulations ofthe people and the Government of Zambia upon his well-deserved election to preside over the work of the GeneralAssembly at its fiftieth session. We are confident that hisbroad experience and ability will afford us sure guidanceat this historic session of the General Assembly  whichmarks half a century of the United Nations.I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoingPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession  His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire who so successfully presided over the session with greatskill and expertise. He leaves the presidency with a recordof successes that has enhanced the Assembly’sdeliberative role.My delegation would also like to put on record itsappreciation for the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has continued to lead theOrganization with skill and tenacity under tryingcircumstances.As we observe and celebrate the fiftieth anniversaryof the founding of the United Nations  we should alsotake this opportunity to take stock of the Organization’spast performance  evaluating its achievements andfailures  and then proceed to map out our future direction.It cannot be disputed that the United Nations hasmade outstanding contributions to world peace andsecurity and the promotion of development throughout theworld.The United Nations has conducted successful peace-keeping operations in various parts of the world  includingCambodia  Mozambique  Haiti and  very recently  Angola.It is also as a result of United Nations engagementthat the world is now entering an era in which the idealsof human rights and democracy are gaining support inmany countries. The United Nations is on record ashaving provided electoral assistance to over 40 countries.5This has gone a long way in ensuring free and fairelections.The United Nations has been a strong source of relieffrom human suffering. Through the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees  the UnitedNations has provided food  shelter  medicine and educationfor millions of refugees the world over.Very recently  in 1990  through the efforts of ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and thepersonal dedication to children of the late James Grant  theWorld Summit for Children was convened here in NewYork  where the Convention on the Rights of the Child wasadopted. This Convention has become the first to receiveuniversal acceptance. This is a remarkable achievement initself.Against this background of achievements  theOrganization has had to deal with many formidableproblems  such as the super-Power rivalry of the cold-warera  which resulted in a long period of paralysis in terms ofthe Organization’s ability to take quick and effectivedecisions and in the increasing number of ethnic conflictsand tensions around the world  as evidenced by conflicts inBosnia and Herzegovina  Rwanda  Burundi  Somalia andGeorgia  among others.The continued unfavourable international economicsituation and environmental degradation are seriouschallenges that the United Nations has had to deal with.Zambia is convinced that the United Nations remainsthe only world body with the capacity to galvanize politicalwill to face these challenges as we approach the twenty-first century. As a country and Member State  we take thisopportunity to reaffirm and renew our commitment to theUnited Nations.It is quite clear that the United Nations will require arenewed vision for the next 50 years. The agenda to disarmthroughout the world is not complete. My delegationstrongly feels that as long as there is continued proliferationof weapons  there can never be any hope for lasting peaceand security in any corner of the world.My delegation  therefore  welcomes the successfulconclusion  early this year  of the Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the Treatywas extended indefinitely. My delegation wishes to expressour grave concern that  soon after the extension  some ofthe signatories to the NPT have resumed nuclear tests.This is not in the spirit of nuclear disarmament. We alsocongratulate those that have continued to observe theirmoratoriums and hope that they will not be swayed bythose that are embarking on nuclear testing.Zambia takes note of the ongoing negotiations inGeneva on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty(CTBT)  and urges a speedy and successful completion ofthat treaty. We also welcome the efforts to strengthen theBiological and Toxic Weapons Convention.However  in spite of all these positive developmentsin the area of disarmament  there are  of course  othercritical areas  such as complete and general disarmament nuclear technology  nuclear-weapon-free zones  mineclearance as well as peaceful uses of nuclear energy  thatremain unresolved. We therefore urge all concerned togive special attention to such issues  in the hope that thiswill enhance security guarantees.The issue of specific concern to southern Africa which has emerged from a long period of conflict  is landmine clearance. Many of our people continue to die fromuncleared land mines. Accordingly  we call upon theinternational community to increase its support for theregional efforts being carried out through the SouthernAfrican Development Community to de-mine the affectedareas in the southern Africa region. In this regard  wewish to express our appreciation to the European Union which continues to support our efforts in mine clearance.In the area of peace-keeping  Zambia realizes thatpursuing peace has not been an easy task for the UnitedNations and is not likely to be so in the foreseeablefuture. The Organization needs a clear vision of whatmust be done in each particular case. The Secretary-General’s Agenda for Peace  we believe  provides thatvision. It is an important agenda  which has alreadyassisted in many areas of our peace-keeping operations.We are aware that a quick and effective response intime of conflicts depends on a number of importantfactors  especially the political will by the Member Statesto meet resource requirements. In this respect  Zambiasupports the establishment of a rapid- reaction-capabilityforce  which we believe will enhance peace-keepingoperations and save lives.The protection  promotion and enjoyment of humanrights is an obligation Governments and peoples the worldover must uphold. The dignity of life cannot be enhanced6without full observance of human rights. Zambia thereforebelieves that the United Nations must continue to give highpriority to human rights issues.In this regard  Zambia is gratified that the FourthWorld Conference on Women  recently held in Beijing China  recognized that women’s rights are human rights and that Governments committed themselves to theimplementation of that human rights agenda.The Beijing conference and the other recent UnitedNations conferences — the World Conference on HumanRights  the International Conference on Population andDevelopment and the World Social Summit — will all needactive and integrated follow-up throughout the UnitedNations system. In this follow-up  the roles of the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council are crucialnot only for the efficient implementation of the programmesof action  but also for strengthening the Organization in thesocial and economic fields. Zambia recognizes the urgentneed to revitalize the Council’s functions  includingimproved and enhanced utilization of its various functionalcommittees. Harmonization of institutional arrangements inthe entire United Nations system will need to be undertakenas a matter of priority.In terms of the reform of the Security Council  Zambiabelieves it is necessary to expand the Security Council toenable it to become more representative. It is also our viewthat the Security Council needs to become democratic andtransparent.Zambia would like to see the United Nations givepriority to addressing developmental issues in the newmillennium. In this regard  I wish to state that Zambiaattaches great importance to the realization of the Agendafor Development. Development is a critical area of concernfor my own continent  Africa  where poverty unemployment and social exclusion affect virtually everycountry. As we approach the twenty-first century  theinternational community should give added emphasis to thefight against poverty. By fighting poverty  we can assurethe progress of individuals  which is essential to thesustained progress of all nations.Zambia is therefore gratified that the World Summitfor Social Development committed itself to accelerating theeconomic  social and human resources development ofAfrica and the least developed countries. The WorldSummit for Social Development  held in Copenhagen Denmark  in March this year  has  through its Declarationand Programme of Action  challenged Governments theworld over to create opportunities through employmentgeneration and social integration that should eradicatepoverty. My delegation hopes that Governments willimplement its Programme of Action.The poverty obtaining in many developing countriesis being exacerbated by the onerous debt burdens most ofthese countries have continued to carry since the early1980s. The Naples terms  with the potential to achieve a67 per cent debt reduction on either export credits or debtservice  is only the beginning in offering durable debtrelief to developing countries  especially with regard tothose with very high debt service ratios. The creditorcountries should move beyond modesty and offer termsthat can in the shortest possible time frame reduce debtservice ratios of the poorest developing countries to 21per cent of their export earnings. This is the levelrecognized by the United Nations as the basic minimumrequirement to ensure that the poorest developingcountries overcome their debt problems and re-establishcredit-worthiness. Coupled with the sustainedunderfunding of many structural adjustment programmes a modest approach on promoting debt reduction can onlyhave the ultimate result of undermining opportunities forgrowth  development and prosperity in developingcountries.As the World Trade Organization begins itsformative years  a new challenge from this institution isemerging in developing countries that will add to thechallenges of external debt burdens and poverty. This isthe challenge of registering early net losses from the newsystem of multilateral trade as preferences are removed food prices rise  subsidies decrease and commodityexports continue to face marginalization. This isespecially pronounced for Africa  which  as we all know has already recorded more than a decade of austerity.While we recognize the long-term opportunitiesdeveloping countries will gain from the World TradeOrganization  it still remains the duty of developedcountries to make good their pledges reaffirmed atMarrakesh to compensate net losers in the new system ofmultilateral trade  by quickly specifying the terms ofcompensation.Zambia realizes that establishing the foundations ofinternational competitiveness is the key to getting afoothold in the world economy. Our reform measures which started in 1991  are gaining momentum. Thechallenge now is to move away from concerns overstabilization and liberalization to the stimulation ofproduction  employment and labour productivity as the7basic foundations for poverty reduction. This is being doneat the same time as we are building on complementaritiesalready established in the regional integration mechanismsof the Southern African Development Community and theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  of whichZambia is a member. However  our domestic reform effortscan only be sustained by generous debt reduction thatimproves our cash-flow position to levels which regeneratebusiness confidence in Zambia. The debt overhang remainsthe single biggest barrier to recovery and development inZambia.In conclusion  I would like to state that Zambia willremain actively committed to achieving these priorities inthe framework of the United Nations. We believe in theUnited Nations and have every confidence that ourOrganization will lead us into a new era of full of hope andprosperity."
