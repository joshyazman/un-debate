"1",27,"AFG",52,1997,"﻿Let me impart at theoutset the sad news I received early today of the aerialbombardment by the Taliban of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif  the sixteenth consecutive bombardment in just twodays. These bombardments have taken as many as 150lives among the civilian population of the city  mostlywomen and children. I express outrage and condemnationat this cowardly act of terror  which typifies the Taliban’sgross violation of international humanitarian law and theirrelentless belligerence against every norm recognized bythe world today.I stand before the Assembly and the worldcommunity in the tradition of past Afghanrepresentatives — with the exception of those during theyears of occupation — representing an independent sovereign and non-aligned Afghanistan.One year ago  our Foreign Minister  the late AbdulRahim Ghafoorzai  stood on this podium to explain thedark and ominous movement known as the Taliban which — backed by foreign forces — had invadedAfghanistan. Tragically  Mr. Ghafoorzai died in the19service of his nation. So today it is my duty to stand beforethe Assembly to explain the struggle the Afghan peoplehave waged against these mercenaries.When the Taliban entered Kabul on 27 September1996 their first act was to storm the United Nationscomplex. The past 12 months have seen a seeminglyendless series of edicts issued by the Taliban in areas ofAfghanistan that they claim to control. Under those edicts they have in fact imprisoned every woman and terrorizedevery man.Their latest ignominious act has been to arrest EmmaBonino  the European Union Commissioner forHumanitarian Affairs  her aides and a group of visitinginternational journalists  including CNN’s ChristianeAmanpour. Outraged by the Taliban’s act  the GermanForeign Minister  Mr. Klaus Kinkel  said that he consideredit a slap in the face and an act of “cynical disregard for theentire European Union”. The group was eventually released but not before at least two of its members were beaten withthe butt of a Kalashnikov rifle. Ms. Bonino told Reutersthat the experience had given her a taste of what Afghansgo through every day under the Taliban.“This is an example of what people here gothrough every day: in a situation of random terror.”[Reuters News Wire  “EC commissioner released byTaleban ” 29 September 1997]An Afghan quoted in The New York Times of 24September 1997 stated “Most days I wake up thinking we’d all be better offdead than under these fanatics.”These are just a couple of facts to open a small windowonto the gloom and despair facing our people.As this terror continues in Afghanistan  we are heretoday to discuss the Afghan question  which is now aninternational issue.As the crisis in Afghanistan continues to unfold  wemust ask — and answer — important questions  questionsto be answered particularly by those who  under the guiseof neutrality  equate the aggressors with the victims ofaggression. Those questions are: Who is following the rulesof the civilized world? Whose actions warrant recognition?Who deserves to participate in civilized discussion at aglobal level?On the battlefield  we continue  of course  to defendourselves and our nation. In this imposed war  we aretaking what we consider to be the moral high ground ofnegotiation and dialogue.The Islamic State of Afghanistan — like manyothers in the world  including some prominent Pakistanipoliticians and commentators — still identifies Pakistaniintervention and interference in the internal affairs ofAfghanistan as the root cause of the prolonged conflictand the subsequent suffering of our people.Pakistan constantly alleges that the Taliban controltwo thirds of Afghanistan  including Kabul  where peaceprevails. Mr. William Maley  the renowned Australianexpert on Afghanistan  stated earlier in the year that theTaliban brought peace to Kabul in the same sense thatHitler brought peace to Warsaw.On 7 August 1997  Mr. Gohar Ayub Khan  theForeign Minister of Pakistan  said:“In Afghanistan ... the majority in the country isPakhtoons  who are 60 per cent. The other groups including Uzbeks  Tajiks  Hazaras and Ismailiscollectively  constitute about 40 per cent.”The Pakistani Foreign Minister is blatantly inventingfraudulent statistics to fuel the flames of ethnic hatred andconflict in Afghanistan and to justify Pakistani objectives.No valid statistics could claim that any ethnic group inAfghanistan — Pakhtoon  Tajik  Uzbek or other —constituted more than 37 per cent of the population. IfPakistan continues its irresponsible policy of perpetratingethnic hatred in Afghanistan  a consequential escalation of“ethnic cleansing” will threaten the national unity of ourcountry.Pakistan maintains that it has no favourites inAfghanistan. The reality is that the Pakistaniestablishment has designated one group of Afghans to bethe natural rulers over all the rest and conceivably to turnAfghanistan into a subservient protectorate State.The reality was best expressed by Fred Halliday  aninternational affairs specialist at the London School ofEconomics  who wrote last November:“The capture by Taliban guerrillas of theAfghan capital  Kabul  however short- or long-lived has come after two years of one of the mostobnoxious interventions by one State in the affairs of20another in many years. Reported in the West as anindigenous struggle  in fact Pakistan set up the Talibanas a semi-regular fighting force in 1994 ... providingthem with ... guns  money  fuel and technical support... Since its creation in 1947  Pakistan has harbouredthe goal of dominating its northern neighbour.” [TheNation  “Kabul’s Patriarchy with Guns”  11 November1996  p. 19]And  finally  the Pakistani Government  by proposingthe dubious “vacant-seat” formula for Afghanistan  strivesto expel from the United Nations a country that has been amember of this global body since before the birth ofPakistan.My delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  for having summarized the tragic situation inAfghanistan in his address to the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly on 22 September 1997.According to General Assembly resolution 51/195 B which was adopted unanimously on 17 December 1996  andfully supported by the Islamic State of Afghanistan  theAssembly is“Strongly committed to the sovereignty independence  territorial integrity and national unity ofAfghanistan”. [resolution 51/195 B  seventhpreambular paragraph]The General Assembly also stressed“the importance of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan”.[ibid.  sixteenth preambular paragraph]Unfortunately  since last year the supply of weapons andammunition from abroad has massively increased andconstitutes a very important programme of action by thepowerful Pakistani intelligence service  Inter-ServiceIntelligence (ISI).The situation has also worsened with regard to whatthe resolution called“actions undermining the security of State frontiers including the growing illicit traffic in arms andnarcotics by criminal elements and groups from[Taliban occupied] areas of Afghanistan and ... the useof [occupied] Afghan territory for the training andharbouring of terrorists”. [ibid.  eighteenth preambularparagraph]It is amazing that some of the countries that considerterrorism a threat to peace should nonetheless — whileclaiming impartiality — favour the rejectionist Taliban byequating them with the Government of the Islamic Stateof Afghanistan  which shares the mounting concerns ofthe General Assembly in this matter.With regard to the peace process  we share the viewthat“the main responsibility for finding a politicalsolution to the conflict lies with the Afghan parties”.[ibid.  paragraph 2]The Taliban  however  favoured  encouraged and assistedby the cross-border political and military support consider their only responsibility to be the waging of anaggressive war aimed at conquering the whole of Afghanterritory by crushing all resistance movements.The Taliban’s intransigence and disregard for UnitedNations General Assembly and Security Councilresolutions calling for a peaceful settlement of the Afghanproblem are a fact well known to the internationalcommunity. The report of the Secretary-General dated 16March 1997 indicates that:“The Taliban  judging both from their words andfrom their activities on the ground  appeardetermined to gain military and political control ofthe whole of Afghanistan and to establish theirvision of an Islamic State”. [A/51/838  paragraph 7]The Secretary-General’s report (A/51/929) of16 June 1997 equally illustrates Taliban’s choice of themilitary option and its intention to overrun the country byforce. This utterly bellicose position of the Taliban  whileprolonging the suffering of the Afghan people isaggravating the concerns of the countries in the region which views it as a serious threat to the region’s peaceand security. It is worth mentioning that the Taliban’saggressive attitude is encouraged by military intelligenceservices of neighbouring Pakistan  which still hopes toinstall a puppet regime in Kabul  subservient to itsexpansionist and hegemonic desires. The dull-mindedinterventionists should read the history of Afghanistanonce again and learn from the defeat of previousaggressors in this homeland of dauntless and courageouspeople.We are fully aware21“that a cessation of armed hostilities ... and politicalstability are indispensable if reconstruction measuresare to have a lasting effect”. (Resolution 51/195 A eighth preambular paragraph)The Taliban have expressed no interest in the urgentlyneeded reconstruction of the country. In fact  starvation byblockade is their favourite weapon against Afghans.We express our full“support for the continuing efforts of the UnitedNations Special Mission to Afghanistan” (Resolution51/195 B  thirteenth preambular paragraph)led by Mr. Norbert Holl  and the special assignment on30 July 1997 of Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi as SpecialEnvoy of the Secretary-General to assess the situation andthe role of the United Nations in Afghanistan.We reaffirm the full support of our Government forthe“activities of the United Nations Special Mission toAfghanistan  in facilitating ... in cooperation with[neighbouring and] interested States and internationalorganizations  the political process towards the goalsof national reconciliation and a lasting politicalsettlement with the participation of all parties to theconflict”. (ibid.  paragraph 5)Because of the shortage of time  I am omitting someparagraphs from my prepared text.The Taliban have refused to negotiate any politicalsettlement and have insisted on a unilateral militarysolution.The Islamic State of Afghanistan honours“its commitments regarding the safety and fullfreedom of movement of United Nations personnel  inparticular the personnel of the United Nations SpecialMission  as well as the security of their premises inAfghanistan.” (ibid.  paragraph 7)Recently  however  as a result of the disturbancesbrought about on 14 September 1997 by Talibaninfiltration  the premises belonging to international aidagencies and non-governmental organizations in the city ofMazar-i-Sharif were plundered. This city was previously ahaven of peace and security. The Islamic State ofAfghanistan remains committed to the safety of theUnited Nations personnel and the personnel of other aidagencies in Afghanistan.The Islamic State of Afghanistan  in the light of themounting needs of the Afghan people  appeals to alldonor agencies not to abandon Afghanistan  particularlyin the face of the upcoming harsh winter.Security Council document S/1997/588 of25 July 1997 explains the Islamic State of Afghanistan’sagreement to a Declaration of the United National andIslamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan  thefoundation for an enlarged body representing all ethnicgroups from all over Afghanistan. The Declarationaddresses an appeal in favour of the peace process to theTaliban and the Pakistani Government.We favour“An immediate and durable ceasefire among theAfghan parties  to be supervised by a commissioncomposed of representatives of all the warringparties  facilitated by the United Nations”. (ibid. paragraph 8)One of the most important elements in the GeneralAssembly and Security Council resolutions onAfghanistan is the call for“demilitarization of Kabul  with adequate safeguardsto ensure security and public order”. (ibid.)The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers this point tobe very important. It could constitute a credible precedentthat could be applied in the future in other parts of thecountry.The“establishment of a broad-based and fullyrepresentative authoritative council” (ibid.)as required by the General Assembly resolution  will befeasible if the appeal of the United Front inviting theTaliban to join the Front is heard. The Islamic State ofAfghanistan  in this regard  extends its full cooperation tothe United Nations. It is imperative to secure theagreement of the Taliban with the United Nations and toensure its full cooperation with such a broad-basedauthoritative council.22We are ready to cooperate for the creation of“a national security force to provide for securitythroughout the country and oversee the demobilizationof all the warring parties through the collection andsafeguarding of all heavy weapons in the country  andto stop the flow of arms and of equipment related toarms production to the parties”. (ibid.)We are grateful to the leaders and Governments of thecentral Asian republics of Uzbekistan  Kyrgyzstan andTurkmenistan for their respective proposed peace initiatives as well as to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Apart fromsupplementing each other  these initiatives may becoordinated so as to lead to the convening of usefulnegotiations with a specific agenda under the auspices ofthe United Nations. The proposals  however  thus far havenot been accepted by the Taliban.The General Assembly deplored“the civilian casualties inflicted by the indiscriminateuse of landmines.” (ibid.  paragraph 11)The Taliban have recently spread landmines in and aroundthe northern city of Kunduz. This is only one example ofTaliban mass use of landmines.The Islamic State of Afghanistan shares the GeneralAssembly’s deep concern over and denunciation of“the discrimination against women and girls and otherrecurring abuses of human rights in Afghanistan ...emphasizing the importance of democracy and of therealization of human rights in any future politicalprocess in Afghanistan”. (ibid.  ninth preambularparagraph)Mr. Lloyd Axworthy  the Minister of Foreign Affairs ofCanada  said in his statement of 25 September in thisAssembly:“Canadian women  appalled at the treatment of theirsisters in Afghanistan  have started a letter-writingcampaign. I will be delivering some 5 000 letterstoday to the Secretary-General  which call on him totake the lead in exposing the gross human rightsviolations of women in Afghanistan as unacceptable inthe eyes of the world’s citizens.” [See OfficialRecords of the General Assembly  Fifty-secondSession  Plenary Meetings  12th meeting]We draw the attention of the General Assembly tothe recent document (A/52/384) containing theDeclaration of Principles made by the United Islamic andNational Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan  adoptedon 20 September 1997 by the Islamic State ofAfghanistan. The Declaration  systematizing a politicalframework for the country  contains the followingprinciples: first  the principle of Islam; secondly  theprinciple of independence and international cooperation;thirdly  the principles of democracy and pluralism;fourthly  the principles of election and delegation ofauthority to local administration; and  fifthly  the principleof human rights.The General Assembly last year called on“all States strictly to refrain from any outsideinterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan including the involvement of foreign militarypersonnel”. (Resolution 51/195 B  paragraph 15)Regarding the involvement of Pakistani military personnelin Afghanistan  the Government of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan has transmitted amply documentedinformation to the United Nations.The book  entitled The Not-So-Hidden Hand —produced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of theIslamic State of Afghanistan — has been distributed tothe members of the Security Council  some otherinterested countries and the Secretariat of the UnitedNations. This book — I will not go through it; it is a bigbook — documents directly and proves the physicalpresence of Pakistani paramilitary and military personnelinside Afghanistan  fighting alongside the Taliban againstthe Islamic State of Afghanistan.The book includes  first  identification photos ofeach Pakistani captive  prisoner registration forms withdetailed descriptions  fingerprints and other datapertaining to each; secondly  identification cards takenfrom some prisoners that illustrate their membership inextremist Pakistani organizations responsible for terroristacts in South Asia  such as Anjuman-i-Sipah-e-SahabaPakistan; and thirdly  correspondence from most of theprisoners to their families in Pakistan  written mostly inUrdu — the official Pakistani language  which is notspoken in Afghanistan.I should like to remind the Assembly that on 3 July1997 Mr. Francis Okelo  the Deputy Head of the UnitedNations Special Mission to Afghanistan  together with a23United Nations military adviser  paid a visit to Maimanaprison in northern Afghanistan and verified the physicalpresence of Pakistani military prisoners in the prison. AndThe News of 6 September 1997 — printed in Islamabad —contains an article entitled “Pakistanis in Masood’s captivityplead for release”.The General Assembly called upon all Statesimmediately to end the supply of arms  ammunition military equipment  training or any other military supportto all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan. Furthermore document A/52/403  dated 29 September 1997  confirms therecent dispatch of some 600 additional military personneland that shipments of arms from Pakistan to Afghanistanhave significantly increased.The General Assembly has reiterated that thecontinuation of the conflict in Afghanistan provides a fertileground for terrorism and drug trafficking  which destabilizethe region and beyond. The United Nations InformationService reported on 11 September 1997 a rise in opium-poppy production in Afghanistan to 2 800 metric tons in1997  an estimated 25 per cent increase over 1996.Mr. Derek Fatchett  a Minister in Britain’s Foreign Office pointed out in The Guardian of 25 June 1997 that theTaliban war chest is financed by drug money. Furthermore 96.4 per cent of Afghanistan’s total opium productionoriginates in provinces currently under Taliban control according to the United Nations Information Service report.Afghanistan  as a State party to the Convention for theProtection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of23 November 1972  has recognized its primary duty toensure the identification  protection  conservation preservation and transmission to future generations of  interalia  the cultural heritage situated in the country. TheGeneral Assembly has called upon all Afghan parties totake appropriate steps to prohibit  prevent and  if necessary put a stop to any form of theft  pillage or misappropriationof and any acts of vandalism directed against  culturalproperty of the Afghan nation. The Taliban  however  on 17April 1997  out of fanaticism expressed its intention todemolish the two largest statues of Buddha in the world. Inspite of great concern by the Secretary-General andMr. Federico Mayor  Director of the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)  and many Buddhist leaders throughout theworld  the Taliban did not exhibit any change of attitude.Fortunately  its military push was repulsed and the colossalstatues remain intact.In this context  reference should be made to theancient artifacts plundered from the rich Kabul NationalMuseum. According to Pakistani press reports  theartifacts have been added to the personal collections ofthe former Pakistani Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto  andthe former Minister of the Interior  Nasirullah Babar. Onbehalf of the people of Afghanistan  I call upon thePakistanis to return these irreplaceable Afghan artifacts which are also part of the world’s cultural heritage. I urgeUNESCO to investigate the matter.I should like to announce that the delegation of theIslamic State of Afghanistan  together with some othercountries of the third world  will co-sponsor the draftresolution entitled “Towards a culture of peace ”submitted under agenda item 156. My delegation alsosupports the resolution of the Economic and SocialCouncil adopted in Geneva entitled “Proclamation of theYear 2000 as the International Year for the Culture ofPeace”.We want to establish the best fraternal relations withPakistan and other neighbouring countries. Afghanistan’spivotal location places it  as always  at the crossroads ofdifferent corners of Asia. Naturally  no regional economiccooperation — in the context of the transit of goods petroleum and natural gas — can succeed without apeaceful Afghanistan enjoying administrative unity.Afghanistan must cease to exist as a country ofconfrontation  discord and clashes. Rather  it must turninto a land of interrelation  association  joint action andcooperation. This is the genuine desire of all patrioticAfghans and of the true friends of Afghanistan.Fifty-two years ago  the United Nations was foundedon the paramount ideals of a safer world and onparameters of global peace and collective security. TheForeign Minister of Italy  His Excellency Mr. LambertoDini  said in his speech last week before the GeneralAssembly:“We no longer live in a world of purelynational interests. More and more  policy-making isinformed by global concerns such as human rights solidarity and social justice. At the threshold of thetwenty-first century  let us pledge to settle religiousand ethnic conflicts through dialogue  tolerance andcultural exchange  and to find collective answers tointernational terrorism  organized crime  drugtrafficking and the degradation of the environment.”Let me from this rostrum remind all of us here  as thegeneral debate draws to a close  that we must ask ourselvesabout the level of our commitment to the implementation ofthe ideals I have mentioned."
"2",66,"AGO",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of theRepublic of Angola  allow me first to congratulate thePresident  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  on his election topreside over the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly.Allow me also to congratulate the outgoingPresident  Ambassador Razali Ismail  on the excellentwork he performed.We should also like to express our appreciation tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dedicationand determination in turning the United Nations into amore effective instrument to meet the challenges of thetwenty-first century.The cold war  which was the main obstacle that fordecades prevented the United Nations from performing itsrole fully  a role defined by its founding Members in theCharter  is now a thing of the past. But our worldOrganization has not yet achieved the degree of efficiencythat the Member countries and their people would desire with the result that sometimes despair and a lack ofconfidence are felt  instead of trust in its efforts.The construction of the new democratic world orderto which we all aspire will demand that the principalforum for multilateral diplomacy  the United Nations  playa greater role. In this context  the complete restructuringand revitalization of its system and an end to the presentfinancial crisis  which is affecting its normal functioning are essential.The issue of the restructuring of the Security Councilshould therefore be given priority. The current structureof that body is obsolete  reflecting a reality that prevailedmore than 50 years ago. How is it conceivable that27regions such as the African continent  which makes up thelargest regional group at the United Nations  or LatinAmerica  are not represented among the permanentMembers of the Security Council? Therefore  it is high timethat the geographical composition of that body beoverhauled to allow for more balanced and more equitablerepresentation. In this regard  Angola endorses the Africanclaim for no fewer than two seats among the permanentmembers of the Security Council. The Council’s workingmethods should also be revised in order to ensure greatertransparency in its decision-making processes.Angola supports the declaration made by the Heads ofState of the Organization of African Unity  as well as thestatement made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of thenon-aligned countries on reform of the Security Council.The recent proposals made by the Secretary-Generalon reform will certainly boost the process of overhaulingthe United Nations. Angola welcomes the contents of thoseproposals  although we would have preferred to see furtherimprovements in some aspects. We are  however  optimisticas to the outcome.As the Assembly is aware  the Lusaka Protocol whichwas signed in 1994 between the Government and the armedopposition  UNITA  was intended to solve the post-electoralcrisis provoked by UNITA and at the same time to put thecountry back on the path towards peace  nationalreconciliation and democracy. However  approximatelythree years since the beginning of its implementation Angola is still far from achieving those goals due to thesystematic failures by UNITA to meet its obligations and toits repeated delaying tactics. This is a clear demonstrationof bad faith and lack of political will by its leadership. Itappears that the leader of this organization has notabandoned its strategy of taking power by force. He is stillresisting the transformation of UNITA into a true politicalparty and UNITA’s complete demilitarization  even thoughthe single national army  which includes in its ranksthousands of men provided by UNITA  has already beenformed.UNITA still maintains a private  heavily armed armymade up of around 35 000 men  4 000 of whom belong tothe UNITA leader’s personal guard. This constitutes aserious violation of the Lusaka Protocol and is the maincause of the current climate of tension and insecurity insome parts of Angola. The members of this army includetroops that UNITA hid from the United Nations during thequartering process  recently demobilized UNITA troopswho have been recruited again by force  and formersoldiers of the former Republic of Zaire.At the same time  UNITA is still continuing itsmilitary build-up through the reactivation of militarybases and acquisition of sophisticated weapons fromforeign countries  in clear contradiction of paragraph 19of Security Council resolution 864 (1993).On the other hand  UNITA is holding on to largeportions of national territory which were supposed to behanded over to government administration. This isimpeding exercise of the State’s sovereignty throughoutthe country and the free movement of people and goods.The control of some of these areas is aimed at exploringfor  and then smuggling and exploiting  their naturalresources to finance UNITA’s war machinery and satisfythe individual interests of its leadership.As a result of these actions  the perspectives createdwith the inauguration of the Government of NationalUnity and Reconciliation and the swearing-in of theParliament have been postponed.UNITA’s behaviour in the peace process isrepugnant as well as ambiguous. It insists on armedopposition despite the fact that it is part of the mainpower institutions and despite the fact that Angola has ademocratic  pluralist system in which all political partiescan freely carry out their activities.The international community has already expressed repeatedly and categorically  its condemnation of anddismay at UNITA’s actions. In 1993 the Security Councilapplied the first package of restrictive measures againstUNITA. More recently  the Security Council unanimouslyadopted resolution 1127 (1997)  which applies a newpackage of measures against UNITA as a result of its lackof cooperation in the implementation of the LusakaProtocol. The position taken by the Council above alldisplays the concern of the international community andits determination to prevent the UNITA leadershipstrategy from being implemented. Otherwise  peace andstability in Angola and the entire region of central andsouthern Africa would be at risk.The Government of Angola reiterates its firmsupport for resolution 1127 (1997)  because we feel thatit is a strong means of pressure aimed at dissuadingUNITA from its intention to return to war  encouragingit to speed up its demilitarization and transformation into28a political party  and put an end to its jurisdiction over partsof Angolan territory.Taking the above into account  the Angolan peoplelook forward to the Security Council’s demonstratingfirmness and determination in implementing resolution 1127(1997)  immediately putting into force sanctions againstUNITA unless that organization changes its behaviour andgives proof of good faith in complying with its outstandingobligations.The Government of Angola is optimistic about thesuccessful conclusion of the peace process and willcontinue to do its utmost to guarantee the fullimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol.Before turning to another subject  I would like toexpress the sincerest gratitude of the Government of Angolato the Special Representative of the Secretary-General forAngola  Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye  and to theGovernments of the troika of observers  Portugal  Russiaand the United States  for their untiring efforts to bringabout peace in Angola.Recent changes in the Democratic Republic of theCongo have contributed to alleviating the tensions in thecentral African region  opening new perspectives for itsStates and peoples in terms of stability and development.The present climate will allow stability to prevail inthe region and will allow for better coordination amongStates with a view to reinforcing the observance of theprinciple of good neighbourliness.The Angolan Government is very apprehensiveregarding the crisis in the Republic of the Congo  a countrywith which Angola shares a common border  closeconsanguinity and historic ties.The Republic of Angola favours a negotiated solutionto the crisis and supports the international mediation effortsheaded by Mr. Omar Bongo  President of the Republic ofGabon. Our Government also supports the deployment ofan international force as soon as a political settlementemerges from the negotiations.In Sierra Leone  we deplore the interruption of thedemocratic process and the overthrow of the legitimatelyelected institutions. The Government of Angola supports theefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and  inparticular  of neighbouring countries to restore thedemocratic institutions.We are also concerned with the situation in theRepublic of the Comoros  where tensions are threateningthe country’s independence and territorial integrity. Weencourage the international community to support theefforts of the OAU in the search for a peaceful solutionable to preserve the territorial integrity and independenceof that country.The situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate  anda solution acceptable to all the parties concerned has yetto be found. The Angolan Government approves of theefforts made by member countries of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)and  in particular  the most recent initiatives of Ethiopiain bringing the representatives of the Somali factionstogether at the negotiating table.Of particular concern to us is the ostracism displayedin the main international forums with regard to the Somalicrisis.In Western Sahara the recent opening of directnegotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and theFrente POLISARIO front is a positive sign. The AngolanGovernment has always been in favour of a negotiatedsolution to the conflict which takes into account theaspirations of the populations of the territory andencourages the parties to honour the agreements signed inHouston and to continue the ongoing dialogue in goodfaith. In this connection  we support the joint efforts ofthe OAU and the United Nations.We are concerned with the continuation of theIsraeli-Arab conflict  the primary cause of thedeteriorating situation in the Middle East. Recent eventshave delayed the peace process and have led to furtherdeterioration of the situation in the region. Angolareaffirms its support for the peace process in the MiddleEast. Its success depends upon the reinforcement ofmutual trust and the full implementation of the accordssigned between the parties concerned.We endorse the position expressed in the Declarationof the Heads of State or Government of the OAU and thestatement made in New Delhi at the ministerial meetingof the Non-Aligned Movement with regard to the questionof Palestine.My Government expresses its concern at the lack ofprogress in the initiatives to bring about a just solution tothe question of East Timor. The Government of Angola29deplores the refusal by one of the parties to acceptPresident Mandela’s initiative.The economic  commercial and financial embargoimposed on Cuba is a matter of concern to my Government particularly because of its negative impact on the economicand social situation of the Cuban people. We reiterate ourappeal to have the embargo lifted  which will contribute torelations between two peoples.(spoke in English)Finally  I should like to thank those who have givenme the opportunity to speak today. As the Assembly knows my speech was to be delivered on 26 September. However due to a sad event which has happened in my country  Ihave to leave tonight  and I was obliged to ask theAssembly to give me the opportunity to deliver my speechtoday.One of our colleagues  the former of Minister forForeign Affairs of Angola  passed away yesterday. It is myduty to return home to pay my respects to my dearcolleague. Many here know Foreign Minister ""Loy"".I wish the Assembly well  and may good work bedone here for peace  stability and international cooperation."
"3",113,"ALB",52,1997,"﻿Let me first join all thedistinguished personalities who have spoken before mefrom this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Udovenko on hiselection as President of the General Assembly for thecurrent session and wishing him all possible success in thislofty post. I would also like to convey my high appreciationto his predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  for the excellentleadership he provided during his tenure of the previousGeneral Assembly presidency.May I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate theSecretary General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his election to thehighest post of our global Organization. We are confidentthat his long experience as an international civil servantand his correct assessment and proper action inimplementing the United Nations reform are guarantees ofthe successful crowning of our efforts to have a strongerand more efficient Organization.Before I deal with the more general questionsconcerning our common work and efforts in theOrganization  I would like to dwell briefly on thedramatic events and developments that occurred in mycountry  in particular during the first half of the currentyear  which were also of concern to the United Nations.The Assembly is already aware of what happened inmy country  during which total chaos and anarchy reignedfor months. That was perhaps the biggest crisis in ourmodern history. Albania has a peculiar history of chronicisolation  of almost total estrangement from the rest of theworld  of great potential  human and natural wealth  whilebeing  at the same time  underdeveloped and poor. Ourdifficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies offormer rules and half a century of communism  of non-existent  non-functioning or malfunctioning democraticinstitutions  both during and after the collapse ofcommunism and its structures  as well as with ourmentality. They are linked to flaws and shortcomings indifferent fields  to clear tendencies to forsake freedom  topartisan intolerance  to lack of inter-party constructivecooperation  to mismanagement and corruption  toautocratic behaviour and decisions — not rare phenomenain our part of the world.It was the great complexity of these and otherdevelopments  coupled with the collapse of the get-rich-quick pyramid investment schemes  which led to broadpopular frustration  disillusionment and general unrest andbrought the whole country to the state of unprecedentedchaos and anarchy I mentioned a moment ago.In these circumstances  the international communityreacted promptly  displaying a remarkable sense ofresponsibility  unity and solidarity amongst its membersand with my people and country  one of the Members ofthis Organization. The involvement of the Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and theEuropean Union  the United Nations Security Council’sbenediction  and the well-balanced  all-out efforts andcontribution of important neighbours and friends helpedus to prevent further aggravation and to alleviate andgradually overcome the crisis.18We would like to take this opportunity to commend inthe warmest possible terms the very serious commitment ofthe OSCE; its Chairman-in-Office  Minister Petersen  andhis Personal Representative  former Austrian Chancellor Mr. Vranitzky; the United Nations and its Security Councilfor their prompt response to this emergency situationthrough their relevant decisions  resolutions and concreteactions. Let me also thank most warmly all the troop-contributing States — France  Greece  Turkey  Spain Romania  Denmark  Portugal  Austria  Belgium andSlovenia — which  under the excellent leadership andcommand of Italy  made the entire effort of theMultinational Protection Force a full success in theimplementation of its mandate. Last but not least  I wouldwish to express my deep appreciation and thanks to theEuropean Union and all the other international and regionalorganizations  the United States of America  as well as toother individual States  for the continuous support andassistance they have given and are giving my country. Mypeople are indebted to them and to all here.This highly appreciated assistance helped us start aprocess of reconciliation and gradual restoration of politicalstability in the country. It is also a reflection of historicallessons learned in today’s efforts to establish a peaceful democratic and united Europe  without walls and fully free in which the integration processes should be comprehensiveenough not to exclude any country  even the weakest  asPope John Paul II said. This is the only road to ensuringthat the universal principles which this global Organizationand others stand for are permanently upheld and defended.The successful holding of elections in Albania on 29June  which were considered by the internationalcommunity as adequate and acceptable  can and must be thefoundation for a stable democratic system. They showed thestrong desire of my people for a democratic future forAlbania. The coalition Government which emerged fromthese elections is fully determined to work with a newphilosophy based on cooperation and coexistence  onsharing and  at the same time  assuming responsibilities  bythe majority and the minority alike. The guiding yardstickwill be making maximum use of internal capacities as thebest way to ensure continuation of the spirit ofunderstanding  the process of reconciliation  constructivecooperation  economic recovery and the overall return ofnormalcy to the country in the shortest possible time. Thisis the spirit we have decided to be guided by  as personifiedbrilliantly by the Albanian famous worldwide  MotherTeresa.We do hope and will work to ensure that thisprocess will bring about the necessary transformation ofthe country into a reliable partner that truly sharescommon democratic values and qualifies for its gradualbut sure integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures it hasthe objective to achieve.Let me inform the Assembly that our main  urgentchallenge remains the restoration of public order andsecurity in the country. Therefore  we have devotedmaximum and special attention to it. Lack of public orderand security cannot coexist with the development of theeconomy and democratic values. Intensive work is alreadyunder way on the basis of short- and long-term plans.Special emphasis is being put on and we havestarted work towards the reorganization of the army  withthe objective of gradually having a smaller  more efficientand professional force under strict civilian control  inconformity with all standards of modern armies  capableof performing its functions properly and of being agenuine partner in partnership activities. Various problemspersist in the economic field  where we have witnessed aquasi-paralysis of life and the deterioration of all micro-and macroeconomic indices. In cooperation with and theassistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) andthe World Bank  we hope we will be able to dealsuccessfully with the main economic and social priorities.We have already started work in this direction  for boththe emergency situation and the mid-long-termperspective.Albania is determined to go ahead with thedemocratization processes in general — the rebuilding establishment and proper functioning of democraticinstitutions to ensure the true entrenchment of the rule oflaw in all its dimensions.All of these issues were discussed in Rome at thepreparatory meeting for the upcoming ministerial meetingto be held in that city and the donors conference set totake place in Brussels next month. We are prepared forthese meetings to begin the implementation of what wehave achieved and will agree upon  in close cooperationwith the relevant organizations.On behalf of my Government  I should like to paytribute to all of the international organizations andfinancial institutions  from the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies to the European and Euro-Atlanticbodies as well as individual countries  which have sincethe beginning of this process shown unstinting interest19and commitment in working in their respective areas ofresponsibility.The main objective of my Government’s foreignpolicy is directly to contribute to the enhancement of peace security and stability in our region and in Europe througha gradual integration into all relevant Euro-Atlanticstructures.Albania’s past  present and future are closely linked in a variety of ways  with those of our neighbours. Like allneighbours  we share not only common borders but also we hope  common interests and values and a commonfuture. This requires our full participation in the Europeanintegration processes  in a common Europe united by thesevalues and not characterized by friction and confrontation.Relations with neighbouring countries and peace andstability in the region are of paramount importance for us.We will continue to work constructively and openly tosolve all the pending problems that involve vital nationalinterests for Albania and represent a major concern for theinternational community. One such question is that ofKosovo. Inter-linked issues — good relations withneighbouring countries  peace and stability in the region and the situation in Kosovo and its just solution — shouldbe pursued in a complementary manner  with none of themopposing  undercutting or jeopardizing the others.I should like to say a few words about the situation inKosovo and how we see its future  because unless thisquestion is dealt with properly and settled accordingly  thisserious issue could continue to threaten peace and regionalstability. Kosovo has been on the agenda of theinternational community  and in particular of the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council  the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and theEuropean Union  for years now. Unfortunately  the situationthere remains the same  and we are not sure how long thestatus quo can be maintained. Police violence and brutality massive repression and gross violations of human  politicaland national rights — which we strongly condemn —continue unabated in Kosovo. The Federal Republic ofYugoslavia has given no real  concrete sign of changing itsattitude  despite three General Assembly resolutions  oneSecurity Council resolution and scores of OSCE decisionsand statements.We appeal to this global Organization  to Europeanorganizations and structures  to those who made a majorcontribution to ending the war in Bosnia through theDayton accords and to all those who have the power andthe political will to continue to exert the necessarypressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkansonto the path of negotiation  with proper internationalmediation  with a view to a just  peaceful and democraticsolution acceptable to all. Perhaps a mini Dayton-typeconference aimed at solving all the remaining problems ofthe former Yugoslavia  including and focusing on theKosovo issue  might do the job by Europeanizing ourregion  a process that would have to start with a full-scalereactivation of Balkan cooperation.The General Assembly will hopefully be able tosend another message to all those concerned  in particularthe people of Kosovo  that the international communitycontinues to be deeply concerned and seized of thematter  that it supports and encourages peacefulapproaches  and that it wants to see positive changes inthe right direction.My country fully supports all the efforts under wayto ensure the full and unequivocal implementation of allthe Dayton accords. It considers attempts to circumventor avoid certain Dayton provisions as dangerous  withimplications that could go beyond its scope. We maintainthat there is no alternative to the full implementation ofDayton.The Albanian Government is strongly committed topromoting and actively taking part in regionalcooperation  knowing that democratization  marketeconomy prosperity  good-neighbourly relations andconstructive cooperation are prerequisites for the secureenvironment and prosperity that our region deserves  aswell as for the realization of our country’s aspirations toa gradual but full European integration. Our vision for ourregion’s future is a Schengen-type approach. We believethat regional initiatives such as the Conference onEuropean Stability  Security and Cooperation in South-Eastern Europe  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation andinitiatives of the Commonwealth of Independent States inter alia  are worthy steps that are also contributing tothis end.Albania is highly appreciative of the efforts  theassistance and the contribution of the Organization withrespect to conflict resolution in various parts of the globe.We sincerely wish for peace to be established and reignin all those parts of the earth that are still being shakenby internal or other conflicts. We hope that the role andcontribution of the Organization  with its reformprogramme fully implemented  will be further enhancedin this direction. All Member States should do their20utmost to achieve this common objective. By so doing  thelead members will be able to provide better guidancethrough the United Nations  and all of us will work bettertogether.Albania is fully and unreservedly supportive of theMiddle East peace process and of the intensive and ongoingefforts to bring that process back on track. Mutualconfidence must somehow be restored  as it is the onlyalternative to ensuring continued progress in the peacenegotiations. We are confident that the unsparing andconcerted efforts under way will yield the awaited results.We participated in and followed with great interest thenineteenth special session of the General Assembly on theenvironment and consider it to have made an importantcontribution to resolving the environmental problemsaffecting the earth. Similarly  Albania considers the specialsession on the fight against drugs and related activities  dueto be held next year  as another very significantcontribution to promoting and further strengtheninginternational cooperation in this highly sensitive field.The open debate in the Security Council last May onhumanitarian crises and the protection of the civilianpopulation was another indication that there is greatconcern  preparedness and political will to deal with theseconflicts at an early stage  before they develop into realcrises  thus playing a major preventive role. We all lookforward to this. Prevention is the best medicine  because aproblem can become very costly to treat and be hard tocure.Albania has tried its best to make a modestcontribution to the activities of the United Nations including the significant fact that we are on the list ofcountries ready to contribute to United Nationspeacekeeping operations. Our objective in future is to playan even more active role in this direction  as well as inoperations of an international humanitarian character. Onesuch objective has already been included in our platformfor the reorganization and restructuring of the army.We intend to play a more active role in the activitiesof main bodies of the Organization  including the Economicand Social Council  the Commission on Human Rights  theUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme  theCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice andthe leading bodies of the International Atomic EnergyAgency  the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization and others. Individual concerns should betreated as  and should become  the concerns of all. Inaddressing individual concerns  participation andcontribution by all members of the community of States each within its capacity and making available all possibleresources  even if modest  will make the Organizationmore comprehensive and substantive  and its rolegenuinely more effective.The Organization has started a process aimed atachieving the overall reform of the Organization and itssystem in order to make the United Nations and its roletruly more effective and capable of coping with the newchallenges and dynamics of the ever-changing worldreality. To do so  all Members should live up to theirobligations. We also feel the need for greater efforts toenhance efficiency  which would lead to an enhanced rolefor the Organization. Reform should not take place forreform’s sake. We believe it should be our duty to defineour needs in order to have reforms that are not onlystructural. We must ensure that money is saved not as aone-shot exercise but as a long-lasting process with itsaccent on transfers for the economic development of thosewho are most in need. We support action in this direction.We have taken very serious note of the work of theSecretary-General for United Nations reform in general and of his proposals for the reform of the Secretariat. Weappreciate his proposals and believe they represent theright approach.The reform of the Security Council is one of themost sensitive issues and is part of the reform package. Ittook our Organization almost the half century of itsexistence to come to this point. No one can say for surewhen  if at all  the Security Council will be reformedagain in the future. Therefore  there might still be somework to be done in this direction  without necessarilymaking haste or getting caught up in endless discussions.With a clear objective  we will be able to show thematurity necessary to give the Council the right  balanced flexible  democratic representation capable of successfullydealing with the challenges and objective of the nextcentury: to live in peace and harmony; to live in andleave to our children a better world."
"4",136,"AND",52,1997,"﻿I should like firstto thank for his work the outgoing President  Ismail Razali.My Ambassador  the Andorran Vice-President for the fifty-first session of the General Assembly  was a firsthandwitness to both the diplomatic skill and dedication of hisMalaysian counterpart. On behalf of the Government ofAndorra and the Andorran people  I should like to paytribute to his work and to thank him publicly for the trusthe placed in my representative to the United Nations duringthis year — a year of great change and enormouschallenges for the Organization.Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your electionto the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.Andorra recognizes your reputation as a diplomat andyour extensive experience. I have no doubt  therefore  thatyour presidency will be a great success and will bringabout the consolidation of the reform of the UnitedNations  which we are beginning this year. Likewise  Iextend my congratulations to the members of the GeneralCommittee  who are beginning their term as Vice-Presidents.On 16 July  in this same Hall  I spoke afterSecretary-General Annan for some minutes in order toshow Andorra’s support for his call for reform. ThePrincipality of Andorra supports unconditionally theproposed reform of the United Nations  since we believethe Organization to be indispensable. As a small State weak in a world of stronger Powers  it is in line with ournational interest for us to desire that law and dialogueprevail over force and military strength. We also havemore liberty than many other States to dedicate ourselvesto the goals of peace and progress that were set  in autopian spirit  by our forefathers in San Francisco.For we are small and humble  and have no vastterritories across the seas  no uranium mines on the otherside of the world  no reserves of oil beneath our soil. Ourinterests go no farther than our own boundaries. After all we possess the record for peace in the world — some 700years. For all these reasons  Andorra and other smallcountries have the liberty to reflect on the future ofmankind and the well-being of peoples as we approachthe third millennium — without  I hope  any suggestion ofthe occult.Indeed  many people have been surprised to discoverthat we have for centuries democratically elected ourGovernment  and that we last used the death penalty over50 years ago. In short  Andorrans are capable of resolvingtheir problems without the use of force. And thanks to thislegacy  without any misplaced pride or privilege  we wishto promote those reforms that will enable the UnitedNations to be the best hope for our peoples.Immanuel Kant  in an essay dated 1784  stated:“If it is now asked whether we at present live in anenlightened age  the answer is: No  but we live in anage of enlightenment'.”At the end of the twentieth century  are we now livingin an enlightened age? The crises of development and themilitary conflicts that still afflict our planet make us believethe opposite. To reach our goal of an age of enlightenment we must count on the United Nations and its ideals  and wemust also count on the small countries  which will neverfail to defend it.The proposals for the reform of the United Nationspresented by the Secretary-General are conscientious  fair innovative and practical. I will not comment at length onthe new administrative structure proposed by Mr. KofiAnnan. To benefit from the assistance of a Deputy-Secretary-General appears to us a natural aspiration. All ofthose who serve a country at the highest level know howmuch time must be allotted to issues of protocol and tosmall meetings. It is necessary for the United Nations thatthe agenda of the Secretary-General be lightened so that hecan concentrate on larger problems. This innovation willprobably have the following consequences: the Secretary-General will be considered as the statesman and theDeputy-Secretary-General as the manager. This seems tome to be a good division of labour. What must be avoided however  is that the Deputy-Secretary-General become acounter-force to the Secretary-General. The Deputy-Secretary-General must always be a faithful representativeof the ideas of the Secretary-General in order to avoidadministrative tension at the United Nations.The reorganization of the management structure of theUnited Nations is a prerogative that we must recognize asbelonging to the Secretary-General. I therefore lend mysupport  on behalf of Andorra  to reinforcing the role of theExecutive Committees established in January of this year as well as to the creation of a forerunner to an executivecabinet  the Senior Management Group. I share theSecretary-General’s desire to see an evolution towardsgreater efficiency and productivity in the management ofthe United Nations.As many others have done  I take this opportunity tocongratulate Under-Secretary-General Joseph Connor forhaving brought a spirit of good management to ourOrganization. It seems that during this decade in whichbudgets have imposed the need for cutbacks  manyGovernments have learned that it was necessary toreorganize resources  establish the proper relationshipbetween work and goals and find the means to reorganizetheir bureaucracies and render them more efficient withregard to the work of their administrations. This wasoften inspired by the strategies used in private enterprise.I thank the Secretary-General for having had thecourage to begin this difficult task in the Organization.We in Andorra will try to find inspiration in theprinciples which will lead the Secretary-General in hisreforms in order to make our own administration inAndorra more efficient.Another point which I would like to emphasizeconcerns the decision of Secretary-General Annan to shiftthe work of the United Nations towards concreteobjectives within specific time-frames. This strategy ofworking towards objectives will probably save money forthe United Nations and serve as a model for the effortsneeded to achieve development. That is the strategy whichwe follow in Andorra in the area of administration  andwhich every day becomes more accepted by manycountries throughout the world.It is well understood that these structural andfunctional reforms will lead to significant savings in thebudget of the United Nations. However  it is of primaryimportance that Member States pay their debts to theOrganization as they agreed to do in acceding to theCharter of the United Nations. Let us be clear: the delayin making payments to the United Nations acts as such aheavy weight on any attempt at reform that it will benearly impossible to make progress if the conditions ofpayment are not met.I would like to emphasize that my country  Andorra pays its assessments to the budget of the Organizationdependably and on a per capita basis  as do many othercountries. If each citizen of my country contributes almost$2 annually to the regular budget of the Organization 2why can the people of other developed countries not do thesame  even when the per capita amount that is asked ofthem is significantly less than that of Andorra? Happily there are admirable and exemplary citizens who are able tomake up for the insufficiencies of their own countries.We are  after all  touching on an important topic: theconfidence that we have or do not have in the UnitedNations. Andorra has full confidence in the United Nations.Even though we believe that the creation of a revolvingfund of $1 billion is only a temporary remedy for afinancial situation that should never have existed  we areprepared to add an additional 10 per cent of our annualcontribution to this emergency fund if the other MemberStates are equally supportive and on the condition that thedebtors — whether they be large or small — pay theirdebts in the future.The Secretary-General asks us to consider thepromotion of sustainable development as a central priorityof the reform of the United Nations. On a planet that iscapable before the third millennium of producing machinesthat travel to the moon and to Mars  sophisticatedcomputers to help us  travel networks that link Ulan Batorwith Johannesburg or Andorra La Vella with Lima in thespace of a few hours — on this planet of limitlessadvances — the dawn of the year 2000 reveals theexistence of hundreds of millions of poor people and aworrisome decline in our environment. How can we gofrom speeches to acts  from bemoaning the problems of theworld to commitment  and undertake those actions whichwill bring an end to the present degradation?Only the United Nations  as a global Organization possesses the structure to realize those projects needed tobring about global development in the long term. Wetherefore applaud the Secretary-General’s initiative toreform those practices leading towards development.Andorra supports him in his goal of reducing duplicationand increasing the coordination of resources. In the nextdecade we must bring to the United Nations the mostbrilliant minds on the planet and put them to work in ashared spirit of rationalization in order to understand boththe causes of underdevelopment and the path to follow inorder eradicate it in the twenty-first century. Just as theWorld Health Organization eradicates diseases that afflictthe citizens of the world  so too must the United Nationsserve as a catalyst for the eradication of those evils thatafflict the world’s peoples.We share the Secretary-General’s particular concernfor the natural environment  which is the commondenominator of the world. If the Earth dies during thecoming centuries  it will take all of us with it  rich andpoor  peoples of the North and the South.In his inaugural speech last week the Presidentpointed to the nuclear disaster of Chernobyl as a disasterthat continues to haunt not only his own country  but allof us as well. We therefore approve of the Secretary-General’s plan to transform the Trusteeship Council intoa body for protecting the integrity of the globalenvironment and of shared areas such as the atmosphereand outer space.We also believe in the mission of peace that theSecretary-General has foreseen for the United Nations.For every conflict there is a “before”  a “middle”  and an“after”. Andorra has learned during its seven centuries ofpeace that it is better to take action during the “before”stage. The world calls such action preventive diplomacy.It is all too easy to dismiss the existence of smallcountries as improbable and irrelevant accidents broughtabout by historical providence. We do not appreciatesufficiently the troubles through which many of thoseStates — Andorra among them — have struggled atcertain historic moments and that might have resulted intheir disappearance from the face of the Earth. Not havingan army and not using force  we have learned bynecessity the importance of diplomacy. In the UnitedNations we must use such diplomacy by choice and bydesire.Why should we not consider  among otherpossibilities  the establishment of a reliable and discreetsystem of information to measure the political temperatureof points of tension throughout the world? Why do wenot empower the Security Council to examine in itsdebates these difficult questions before a conflict arisesand temperatures become inflamed beyond the burningpoint? Indeed  as we consider the reform of the SecurityCouncil  why do we not concentrate more on its deeperaction  with a view to giving it the means to accomplishpreventative diplomacy  as we consider its size andstructure?It is truly a matter of regret that the United Nationsis not the best instrument for armed intervention during aconflict  unless it is for humanitarian reasons. Perhaps thissituation will change if we succeed in establishing agreater force with a greater capacity for military reaction.The United Nations can help the healing after a conflict.If we give it the means  the United Nations may become3a humanitarian and preventive force of the highest order.Andorra  which does not have and does not wish to have anarmy  is in the process of considering the establishment ofa humanitarian force that will align itself with theseobjectives and with the words of international solidarityinscribed in our Constitution.There is no better way to prevent conflicts than toteach and advance human rights and democracy. Politicalscientists tell us that democracies do not make war witheach other. Common sense tells us that people who respectand revere the articles of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights will always find a peaceful way to negotiatetheir differences. For this reason  I have asked myAmbassador to the United Nations to devote  as he hasbefore  a large part of his efforts at Headquarters to theThird Committee of the General Assembly. I have alsoasked him to study carefully the ways in which the ThirdCommittee might strengthen its procedures in order that thespirit of reform which permeates the United Nations duringthis time might extend to all its forums of deliberation.Andorra believes in the United Nations and  at theglobal level  supports the desire of the Secretary-Generalfor reform. I have just explained our reasons for this  but because people and States believe in the United Nations  wemust better understand its functioning and itsweaknesses — which are similar to those of anyhumanitarian organization — and especially its goals and itsstrengths.Today  I would like to stress the need for a generaland ongoing effort to present the United Nations to theworld. We live in a world of images  as the events ofrecent weeks clearly demonstrate. During this time  twogreat humanitarian figures have died: one who selflesslydedicated her life to the poor  the other who dared toembrace the sick whom nobody dared to touch. These twowomen  Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Diana  Princess ofWales  both lived under the light of public interest and usedit to spread their humanitarian messages. In Great Britain the Princess of Wales Fund is becoming one of the largestin the world. And yet  it is difficult for us to gain publicsympathy and donations for the United Nations  although itis the first and most important instrument for worksbeneficial to all humanity.Why is this so? Perhaps because it has an imageproblem. In these closing years of the century  let us linkthe United Nations to the peoples to which its Charterrefers. Let us show these peoples that the diplomats of 1997are not a club of ladies and gentlemen with little work whowander through the halls of this building. It might be agood idea — in emulation of the United NationsChildren’s Fund  which has established a lively andeffective presence in Andorra through its NationalCommittee — for us to ask celebrities and leaders ofopinion to serve as spokespeople for the United Nationsin their countries and across the world. We have themessage  the mandate  and indeed the successes  but havebeen less successful in communicating them and allow thepublic to forget our actions. Let us consider together theappropriate public relations and communication strategiesfor the United Nations at this fifty-second session  asession of reform.Two months ago  during my participation in theGeneral Assembly when the Secretary-General announcedhis reform  I wanted to underline two points of specialimportance for the Andorran delegation. Today I shouldlike to reaffirm these two aspects. First  I emphasized theimportance of the small countries during this process ofreform. If the reform leads to a shift away from thefounding principles of the United Nations  ourOrganization will cease to be universal. I concede that without the bigger countries  reform is not possible  butwithout the support of small countries reform will only bepartial. Secondly  I called for the greater participation ofyouth in the process of reform and the workings of theUnited Nations. This is a priority for our delegation: Letus make the future with those who will inherit it.I conclude my speech today with a call of hope anda vote of faith: faith in the United Nations and itscapacity for transformation and improvement in its pursuitof peace and development; confidence in its Secretary-General  who has begun his mandate with firmness anddecision  as he should; and  finally  an unshakeable beliefin the irrepressibility of human progress. Through theUnited Nations  let us make the new millennium an ageof enlightenment."
"5",181,"ARE",52,1997,"﻿It gives me pleasure to extend to thePresident and to the members of the General Committee  onbehalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  ourcongratulations on his election to the presidency of thefifty-second session of the General Assembly. Hisexperience and diplomatic skills will undoubtedly contributeto the success of its work. I would also like to express ourappreciation to his predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail the Permanent Representative of Malaysia  who conductedthe work of the previous session with distinction.I take this opportunity also to congratulate HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan on his election as Secretary-General of the United Nations. We are confident that hisvast experience in international affairs and his competenceand expertise will strengthen the role of the Organization inachieving international peace and security. I am alsopleased to express  once again  our deep appreciation to theprevious Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  whose efforts had a positive and concreteimpact on the progress of the work of the worldOrganization.The present session is of special importance becauseof the major changes taking place on the world scene andthe attendant far-reaching developments and transitions inthe political  economic  social and environmental fields.Despite the state of openness that has characterizedinternational relations  the success achieved in resolvingsome conflicts and the emergence of indications of relativeimprovement in the growth of the world economy  we arestill facing new types of challenges. The most serious ofthese are reflected in racial  ideological  and ethnicconflicts and civil wars; the aggravation of povertysituations; human rights violations; violence; terrorism;and drugs. All of these have a negative effect on nationalsecurity  the sovereignty of States and economic andsocial development. These challenges require cooperationand coordination between States at the bilateral  regionaland international levels.The important role played by the United Nations andits specialized agencies in dealing with these newdevelopments as a whole is now the major incentive forconsolidating its permanence  supporting its objectivesand upholding its Charter. This means that  more thanever before  we must provide it with the political financial and moral support that will enable it to respondappropriately and promptly to emerging global needs.Having studied the report of the Secretary-Generalon the reform and renewal of the United Nations  thedelegation of the United Arab Emirates welcomes inprinciple its recommendations and proposals aimed atstrengthening and developing the work of theOrganization and adapting it to the realities of thepresent-day world. At the same time  however  we wishto stress the importance of having the reforms reflect theaspirations of the countries of the world  particularly thedeveloping countries  in achieving sustainabledevelopment and in promoting peace and security stability and growth.We also support the international efforts aimed atenlarging and restructuring the Security Council andimproving its rules of procedure with a view to ensuringequitable geographical representation and equality amongStates  achieving transparency and objectivity in theadoption of its resolutions and the follow-up to theirimplementation  and preventing double standards  whichhave proved to be too dangerous in many issues of peaceand security. In addition  we support all proposals callingfor the strengthening of cooperation and coordinationbetween the General Assembly  the Security Council andthe Economic and Social Council and for widening thecircle of dialogue and negotiations with regionalorganizations in order to achieve a broader  moreeffective and more comprehensive consensus for theappropriate approach to reform and renewal.Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts ofmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the pastfew years to contain the devastating effects of the21conflicts in the Arab Gulf region  which has greatimportance to regional and international strategies  and theircontinuing endeavour to support progress towards jointreconstruction and cooperation  the unstable political andsecurity conditions in the region remain a source of concernfor us. Such a situation therefore requires the establishmentof a balance based on a firm political will to support allregional arrangements aimed at eliminating the causes ofconflict and situations of occupation. It also requiresbuilding bridges for multilateral cooperation  at both thebilateral and the collective level  on the basis of theprinciples of peaceful coexistence  confidence-building non-interference in the internal affairs of others  mutualrespect for regional sovereignties and the resolution ofdisputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force  inaccordance with the rules of international law and theCharters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conferenceand the United Nations.The continued occupation since 1971 by the IslamicRepublic of Iran of three islands belonging to the UnitedArab Emirates — Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and AbuMusa — is a major issue to which we and the other Statesof the region attach great importance. That occupationconstitutes a source of constant tension  concern andinstability in the region  particularly as the IranianGovernment persists in changing the historic  legal anddemographic character of the islands by constructingmilitary and civilian installations and building bases onthem. Examples of such measures are the construction of abranch of Bayan An-Nour University and two airports onthe occupied islands of Abu Musa and Greater Tunb. Iranhas also resorted to repeated military exercises conductedin the territorial waters of the United Arab Emirates including those off the three islands  thus continuing toconsolidate its occupation of the islands  persisting in itsprovocative policy and imposing a fait accompli by force.All this is in complete disregard of the dangerousconsequences of this policy for the future and the territorialintegrity of the region and for the aspirations of its peoplesto peace  stability and the achievement of sustainabledevelopment.The United Arab Emirates expresses grave concernabout all such illegal actions and practices  which not onlyconstitute a flagrant violation of its territorial integrity andan infringement of its national rights  but are alsocontradictory to the peaceful inclinations of the States ofthe region and the world at large. We therefore renew ourcall to the Islamic Government of Iran to fulfil its legal andpolitical obligations and undo all its unilateral actions in thethree Emirates islands. This would prove that its intentionswere good and give credence to its stated policy especially given certain recent statements by some Iranianofficials calling for the resolution of existing disputesthrough peaceful means and expressing their desire toestablish stability and security in the region.The United Arab Emirates welcomed the newIranian Government and its declared orientation especially with regard to the promotion of good-neighbourly relations  the elimination of tensions and thepeaceful solution of disputes in the region. We hope thatthe Iranian Government will consider all our peacefulinitiatives in a spirit of objectivity and cooperation. Theseinitiatives have already been supported by sister  friendlyand other States  and call either for serious bilateralnegotiations  without preconditions  to be entered into  orfor the dispute to be submitted to the International Courtof Justice.Resorting to policies of violence and force stockpiling banned weapons and using terrorism to dealwith the concerns about the political and security balancein the region must not become an alternative to dialogueor to efforts to bolster the mechanisms for building peaceand achieving the economic and social development ofthe countries of the region. For this reason  we support allmeasures taken by the States of the region to protect theirsovereignty  security and territorial integrity.We stress the importance of full respect for thesovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Iraqand consider that the suffering of the Iraqi people shouldbe dealt with within the framework of implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995).We also urge the Iraqi Government to carry out infull all its legal obligations under the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  especially those dealing with therelease of all prisoners of war and detainees who arecitizens of Kuwait and other countries  and the restitutionof Kuwaiti property.The peace process in the Middle East is at a perilousjuncture as a result of Israeli Government policiesreneging on most of its obligations with regard to thepeace process and the principle of land for peace  whichare based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973). Such policies constitute a flagrant violationof humanitarian law  international legitimacy and theaccords concluded between the Palestinian Authority andthe Government of Israel  as do the ensuing seriousactions  including the expansion of illegal settler activities22in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since1967  particularly in Jerusalem; the expropriation ofPalestinian lands and the demolition of houses; resort toalleged security reasons in order to carry out measures ofcollective punishment; and the imposition of an economicblockade.The United Arab Emirates strongly condemns all suchirresponsible Israeli policies and actions  and reiterates theimportance of continuing the peace process as the onlyalternative for the stability and security of that region regardless of the obstacles and challenges it is facing. Itcalls upon the international community  especially theUnited Nations  and the sponsors of the peace process toshoulder their legal  political  historical and humanitarianresponsibilities.We welcome the efforts of the Secretary of State ofthe United States of America during her recent tour of theregion and hope that she will continue her endeavours toensure that the Palestinian-Israeli accords are implementedand that negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks areresumed on the basis of the principle of land for peace andthe inadmissibility of unilateral actions that would onlyprejudice the final phase of the negotiations. We alsocommend the tireless efforts of the countries of theEuropean Union to persuade the Israeli Government toreverse its policy and seriously abide by all of itscommitments in the context of the peace accords andinternational legality  in a manner that would enable thePalestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights to self-determination  repatriation and the establishment of theirindependent State on their national soil  with Jerusalem itscapital.In the same context  and given that the other Arabparties adhere to the peace process as a sine qua nonstrategic objective strategy  the Israeli Government mustmake a similarly serious commitment to end its occupationof  and repeated attacks against  the territory of Lebanon inimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)and to resume unconditional negotiations on the Syrian andLebanese tracks so as to ensure its full withdrawal from theSyrian Arab Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967  as well asfrom southern Lebanon and the west of the Bekaa valley.The requirements of security  stability and a just andlasting peace in the region are urgent not only for Israel but for all the countries of that region. Consequently  weemphasize the inalienable right of peoples to resistoccupation and aggression and condemn all forms ofterrorism  whether they are aimed against individuals orpractised by States  because terrorism has a direct impactin undermining regional and international stability andsecurity. We also regard the stockpiling of bannedweapons and the threat of their use against other States asanother dangerous manifestation of terrorism. Wetherefore urge the international community and therelevant international organizations to make effectiveefforts to render the region of the Middle East and theArab Gulf a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons  and to demand that Israelaccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) and comply with the international controland safeguards system of the International Atomic EnergyAgency.Efforts by the United Nations and the regionalorganizations to deal with national and regional tensionsand conflicts  as well as with the concomitant destructionof development infrastructure and human suffering insome developing countries  have not resulted in thecontainment of the causes or extent of such conflicts. Inthe European continent  for example  manifestations oftension and ethnic and racial bias still persist among somefactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of thecontinued pursuit by certain Bosnian Serbs of policies thatconflict with the peaceful solutions of the Dayton peaceaccords. There are also situations of tension  insecurityand conflict battering parts of the continents of Asia andAfrica  such as Afghanistan  Somalia  the Great Lakesregion and other areas. It is therefore imperative thatmore effective international and regional efforts be madein order to find peaceful and objective solutions to thoseconflicts. We also call upon the parties directly concernedto work and cooperate with efforts and endeavoursdesigned to contain such situations in order to achievepeace and stability at the national and regional levels.The first positive results achieved by globalization development and the growth of world trade have not metthe expectations of countries in advancing andstrengthening their development or environmental andsocial policies. This is particularly true in the developingand least developed regions that continue to suffer fromthe spread of poverty  unemployment and illiteracy  aswell as the burden of foreign debts  in addition tofluctuations in the rates of exchange and several otherproblems.The creation of an equitable and just economicenvironment built on a foundation of cooperation requiresjoint efforts by developing countries on the one hand  andby developing and developed countries on the other. We23must also take into consideration the special requirementsof the least developed countries  in particular by increasing rather than decreasing  official assistance to them and bylifting existing trade barriers and economic obstacles. Thiswould contribute to a sharing of common responsibilitiesand interests among them. We also support all efforts aimedat promoting and enhancing the role of regional andinternational development organizations  at the forefront ofwhich are the World Trade Organization  the World Bankand others  each within its own mandate  in theimplementation of a global strategy for comprehensivedevelopment.In seeking to enhance its participation in such regionaland international institutions  the United Arab Emirates thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State  HisHighness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan  has achieveda qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental economic  social  environmental and human fields in thepast two decades. It contributed  to a large degree  to theexpansion of the bases for investment commerce  industry and the liberalization of trade. Ittherefore continued to provide development assistance tothe developing and least developed countries  including for example  humanitarian assistance and concessionalloans provided by the Abu Dhabi Development Fund  theZayed Benevolent Society and other multipurposehumanitarian institutions. Within the framework of ourcommitment to enhancing the contribution of the privatesector in supporting the activities of the United Nations we are pleased to announce that we shall be hosting aconference on the role of the private sector in supportingthe United Nations  which is scheduled to be held in theEmirate of Dubai in mid-October. That will be in linewith our policy of continuing to hold a series ofmultifaceted regional and international conferences andexhibitions in the cultural  social  economic  political andenvironmental fields. All these are regarded ascomplementing the United Nations efforts in the variousareas of sustainable development.In conclusion  I should like to stress the need toadopt values of security  peace and freedom as theformula for attaining a deeper understanding and a morecomprehensive view of the issues of our common destiny.Let us  then  unite our efforts in building a world basedon respect for the rule of law and justice  a world wherepeace  tolerance  prosperity and progress reign supreme."
"6",228,"ARG",52,1997,"﻿In recent years we have  happily  drawn closerto the ideals enshrined in the preamble of our Charter.We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal ofpeace and security; strengthened and broadened theobservance of human rights; enhanced and developedinternational law and widened the scope of internationalpenal law  in particular; and laid the foundations forgreater responsibility by States in the advancement ofsocial progress.However  even as we draw closer to these goals  wesee rapid changes in our countries and in the world whichpresent a new and complex challenge for theOrganization. The challenge begins when we note that thebenefits of globalization fall short of being able toalleviate the situation of extreme deprivation from whichmore than a quarter of the world’s population suffers.Similarly  we see more clearly new threats to security anddevelopment  such as drug trafficking  terrorism corruption  and irresponsible assaults upon theenvironment.The process of reform undertaken by Secretary-General Kofi Annan must first and foremost identify whatis the essential role of the United Nations. We believethat it unquestionably continues to be the maintenance of14international peace and security. In order to achieve this wemust bring about a world where sustainable development ispossible and where the norm is the rule of law; respect forhuman rights  including respect for the rights of indigenouspeoples and minorities; and non-discrimination by reason ofrace  religion  gender or anything else.The United Nations  through the General Assembly must continue to be in the vanguard on all these issues playing the role which in the past enabled it to overcomethe scepticism of the times and successfully to combatcolonialism  champion nuclear non-proliferation  and  evenmore important  alert the world to the grave risks ofenvironmental pollution  marginalization  poverty and thatnew form of moral pollution: corruption.Although  on the whole  reform has aroused feelingsof hope  we must overcome the present climate ofscepticism and support the Secretary-General. In a worldwhich today is increasingly marked by globalization  theautonomy which formerly characterized State action hasbeen considerably limited. This obliges us to reassess theclassical concept of sovereignty  by which I mean flexibleand dynamic — not static — reassessment. Argentina hasparticipated with conviction in the process of reform andcommits itself to continue to work actively in itsimplementation.The question of the Middle East is going through adifficult phase. The peace process begun in Madrid in 1991must necessarily continue  with fulfilment of the Oslo andWashington Agreements.We fully support the determined efforts made somedays ago by the Secretary of State of the United States ofAmerica  Mrs. Madeleine Albright. We are certain that timewill show that those efforts were timely and well-directed.Our country likewise firmly supports the system-wideProgramme of Action for the economic recovery anddevelopment of Africa  as well as the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa launched by theSecretary-General in March 1996. We attach particularimportance to the mobilization of financial resources for theAfrican continent  and we note with satisfaction the firstsigns of renewed activity in some very important areas ofthat continent.With regard to international security  we welcome theadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which we hope shortly to ratify. Likewise  we extend ourunqualified support to the Ottawa process to ban anti-personnel landmines. Our commitment to this nobleinitiative was made manifest in 1994  when we offered toassume the task of removing the mines laid in theMalvinas Islands. We laid those mines ourselves and thusfelt a sense of responsibility. We hope that we shall soonbe able to achieve the agreement that will allow us tocomplete that task.A lasting peace requires United Nations contingentsendowed with the capacity to deploy rapidly andeffectively. Accordingly  Argentina  together with othercountries  is working to improve mechanisms ofdeployment. In this context  allow me also to recall that next year  Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversary ofits participation in peacekeeping operations. That is agreat many years.The magnitude of the adverse consequences forindividuals of current conflicts requires us to exert ourutmost efforts with regard to humanitarian assistance.Such assistance constitutes an indispensable element inpeace-building. Accordingly  the “White Helmets”initiative has made possible a growing mobilization ofhuman and financial resources  bringing about a healthyreassessment of humanitarian assistance criteria andprocedures.In order to consolidate a lasting peace  we must notallow impunity to prevail for crimes that offend theconscience of humankind. The creation by the SecurityCouncil of tribunals for the former Yugoslavia andRwanda is a recognition that justice and law areinseparable components of the system of collectivesecurity. Argentina firmly supports the creation of ageneral and permanent international criminal court. Wetrust that the Rome conference in 1998 will make possiblethe realization of this initiative.Let me also say that the Argentine Governmentfirmly intends to pursue its struggle against the abusiveconsumption of psychotropic substances and illicitnarcotics trafficking  as well as related offenses.In the subregional context  we are proud that theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) continuesto grow in both the commercial and political spheres which are interrelated  and to contribute to advancingintegration in the hemisphere. MERCOSUR is a clearcase of open regionalism. It has not resulted in thedistortion or diversion of trade but has  rather  generatedtrade both between the countries of the region and withcountries outside it. Argentina  jointly with its other15MERCOSUR partners  is active in the formation of theAmerican Free Trade Area (AFTA). MERCOSUR hasintroduced a proposal for negotiation of AFTA based on aphased approach.With regard to regional security  Argentina has beena leader in reducing residual tensions in the area. It hascontributed to the attainment of such cherished goals for thenations of South America as the resolution of borderproblems in a climate of confidence with our neighboursand by promoting common positions in support ofstrengthened democracy and political and economicstability. Accordingly  we have  through the Mechanism forConsultation and Concerted Political Action of the RioGroup  been promoting the Declaration on the Defence ofDemocracy  to which we attach great importance as onemore means to advance peace and security — goals thatcan be achieved only with representative democracy. Wealso welcome the inclusion of Bolivia and Chile as fullmembers of the Mercosur Mechanism for Consultation andConcerted Political Action.With our neighbours  friends and partners  we arepursuing a deepening of the dialogue on security anddefence. We are adjusting it to the new international andregional reality  convinced that security is enhanced throughintegration. Indeed  the basis of security in the SouthernCone is the friendship and cordiality of its countries. In thiscontext  military cooperation has increased  with positiveresults for transparency and mutual confidence-building. Asa result of these efforts  Latin America today can point withpride to the peace and harmony that prevails among itsStates.There remains  however  in the South Atlantic  animportant unresolved issue: the question of the MalvinasIslands. I reaffirm once again the legitimate rights of theRepublic of Argentina in that dispute and its appeal for apeaceful and lasting solution.In keeping with the repeated appeals of this GeneralAssembly and the Decolonization Committee  we believethat it is imperative to resume negotiations on all aspects ofthe question of the Malvinas Islands. No Member of theUnited Nations should evade the obligation to resolve adispute by peaceful means as laid down in the Charter ofthis Organization. We call for the parties to sit at thenegotiating table and discuss all the relevant issues.We have made too much progress with the UnitedKingdom to avoid addressing this issue. We have madevery important strides in building our bilateral relationshipwith the United Kingdom  which are reflected inheightened economic  commercial and cultural relationsbetween the two countries. We have recreated a climateof mutual trust in the South-West Atlantic  which enablesus today to cooperate in the conservation of livingresources and in the exploration and exploitation ofhydrocarbons. Undoubtedly  these activities would gainsubstantial impetus from the resumption of direct linksbetween the mainland and the islands  which have provento be most beneficial in the past. Nothing  however replaces human contact between individuals.I trust that the new British Government will heedour appeal and that of the international community topursue a dialogue without preconditions with a view tofinding a definitive solution to the sovereignty disputeover the Malvinas Islands. To the islanders  I once againreiterate our firm commitment to fully respect their wayof life  culture and institutions  as stated in our nationalConstitution.The Decolonization Committee  which hashistorically played a decisive role in this sphere  hasshown itself to be the appropriate forum to continueaddressing the situation of the Malvinas Islands and otherdependent territories. Accordingly  the six countries thatmake up the MERCOSUR Mechanism for Consultationand Concerted Political Action have reaffirmed theimportance of the work of the Committee of 24 on thedecolonization process  which has not yet been completed.We trust that the Committee will maintain itseffectiveness to the full.Another fundamental issue is the composition of theSecurity Council  which in 1945 was consonant with thereality prevailing at the end of the Second World War.That is no longer the case  however. On the eve of thetwenty-first century  we should not design a model thatonly adds new discriminations to those we have inherited.That would be a conceptual mistake. Argentina  whileunderstanding the position of each Member State on thismatter  is of the view that there is not yet a generalagreement concerning the increase in the number ofpermanent members. We all agree that the reform of theSecurity Council should make it a more democratic andrepresentative body. To reach that goal  each region willneed to arrive at a compromise without being pressuredor rushed.In the case of Latin America and the Caribbean  theSummit of Heads of State of the Rio Group has agreedthat the region itself will have to decide how to fill the16seats assigned to it. Argentina is of the view that an open-ended mechanism of rotation should be established that willenable the participation of all those States that have showntheir commitment to and respect for the Charter. Thiswould avoid discrimination against those States that  likeArgentina  bear greater financial responsibilities. In short the Argentine position is aimed solely at promoting theample participation of all States of the region  without anyexclusion whatsoever.I must say  however  that there is more to this matterthan the increase in the number of members. Methods ofwork and procedures also need to be updated. In thiscontext  I concur with the comments made by therepresentative of New Zealand.It is our firm conviction that reform of the UnitedNations must necessarily be built upon two fundamentalpillars. First  it must respond to the requirements andexpectations of the international community. Secondly  itmust reflect a general agreement among the Member States.It is only in this way that the Organization will retain itsrelevance in the twenty-first century."
"7",253,"ARM",52,1997,"﻿I begin bycongratulating Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession. I am confident that the skills and vast experiencehe has acquired throughout his distinguished diplomaticcareer will provide the guidance we need to guarantee thesuccessful outcome of the session.I must also recall the remarkable diligence of hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail  and hisvaluable contribution to the work of the fifty-first regularsession and the nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly.As the twentieth century comes to an end  it isevident that all countries in the world  advanced developing and transitional  will be substantially affectedby globalization. Further specialization  the widening ofmarkets through trade  a broader division of labour and amore efficient and more diversified allocation of financialresources should increase overall productivity and raise16living standards. However  no country will benefit from thistrend spontaneously or automatically. The major tasks thatGovernments face today are development and the pursuit ofsound policies and appropriate structural adjustments tomeet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunitiesof globalization.Economic reforms  which Armenia began immediatelyafter its declaration of independence  have changed all keysectors of the economy  particularly agriculture  enterprises prices and wages  the banking industry and the fiscal foreign trade and exchange systems. Concurrently  thecountry began the institution of secure property rights anda judiciary strong enough to protect them.After a devastating fall in real output from 1991through 1994  macroeconomic and structural reforms combined with privatization  have stabilized the country'seconomy while bringing down inflation  and allowedArmenia to achieve significant growth in 1996. Armenia'sgross domestic product  which dropped 25.3 per cent onaverage from 1991 to 1993  has turned around and hasaveraged 6.3 per cent annual growth since then. This isdespite a disastrous earthquake in 1988  the conflictbetween Nagorny Karabakh and Azerbaijan  which causedthe inflow of more than 300 000 refugees  and continuingproblems in obtaining stable energy and industrial suppliesbecause of a blockade imposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan.The drastic changes were coincident with the adoptionof a medium-term macroeconomic reform programmesupported by the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund. The major objectives for the 1997 periodare: to maintain a real annual growth rate in gross domesticproduct of about 6 per cent; to continue curbing theinflation rate for the whole year and keeping it under 10per cent; and to augment the level of gross foreignexchange reserves to the equivalent of 2.8 months ofimports.Also  the Government of Armenia will go on to takeseveral measures during the programme period aimed atcontinuing to refine the targeting of social safety-netbenefits to alleviate a sharp decrease in averageconsumption levels and improve income distribution.For Armenia and countries with economies intransition as a whole  the move towards world marketprices brought severely deteriorated terms of trade. Theintroduction of currency convertibility and a notableincrease in external borrowing began to cause frequentunsustainable external debt positions. The resources whichare urgently required to modernize the industrial structureto internationally competitive levels and to improve thegeneral infrastructure immensely exceed domestic savingcapacities. This situation underlines the necessity ofaddressing more thoroughly the needs of countries intransition by the international donor community  thoughthis should not cause a decrease in official developmentassistance flows to the developing world.In this context  Armenia welcomes the adoption ofthe Agenda for Development by the General Assemblyearlier this year as one of the major documents whichshould be among the guidelines for actions of the UnitedNations system and affiliated institutions to strengtheninternational cooperation for development. We alsosupport the appraisal of conditions in Africa  leastdeveloped countries  small island developing States andlandlocked developing countries as “Critical situations andspecial problems” within the Agenda for Development and we hope that the post-cold-war internationalcommunity will pay more attention to these issues ofprime concern.The interaction between the United Nations andother multilateral development institutions  including theBretton Woods institutions and the World TradeOrganization  should be intensified  involving the fieldlevel in particular. Joint efforts could be concentratedespecially on those areas where private investors needencouragement  and where without such generalinstitutional support they would hesitate to commit long-term capital. Proper intergovernmental follow-up andimplementation of the corresponding General Assemblyand Economic and Social Council resolutions anddecisions are capable of facilitating this process.Sustainable development and related environmentalissues are other areas of strategic importance where theUnited Nations must further strengthen its credibility. Weacknowledge the outcome of the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly for the purpose of anoverall review and appraisal of the implementation ofAgenda 21 as an important step to enhance theimplementation of the major international global andregional environmental agreements.Economic and democratic reforms arecomplementary and heavily interdependent. Political andeconomic freedom means more predictable  moretransparent  more constitutional  less discriminatory andless corruption-prone law-making and enforcement.17We recognize democracy and respect for human rights universal access to knowledge and information and a highlevel of public awareness as preconditions for sustainablesocial development. We welcome the Secretary-General'sefforts to strengthen the role of human rights within theUnited Nations system.Armenia considers self-determination to be aninalienable human right. In this respect  the NagornyKarabakh conflict continues to occupy the Government ofArmenia. Despite concentrated negotiations of the pastseveral years  the maintenance of a ceasefire for more thanthree years  and the intensified efforts of the internationalcommunity  the Nagorny Karabakh peace process continuesto suffer from a lack of serious progress. The Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) LisbonSummit of December 1996  which was expected to reflecton the peace process  to consolidate the ceasefire and toprovide impetus for a possible breakthrough this year  failedto serve its intended purpose. Instead  by attempting topredetermine the final status of Nagorny Karabakh  itunnecessarily stiffened Azerbaijan's position and minimizedthe possibility of a mutually acceptable compromisesolution. We believe that the final status of NagornyKarabakh should be negotiated between the parties directlyinvolved and not dictated by outside interested parties.Armenia appreciates the most recent efforts of theMinsk Group Co-Chairmen to reach a compromise solution which were also manifested in the Denver statement of thePresidents of the three co-chairing countries. Armenia hasprovided a detailed response to the proposal of the MinskGroup Co-Chairmen  insisting on securing commonlyrecognized freedoms for the Nagorny Karabakh population as well as guaranteeing their security so that their physicalexistence and control over their territory and destiny arenever threatened.Armenia believes that a resolution acceptable to allparties involved is key to establishing durable peace andstability in the region and to stimulating economic growthand prosperity in Armenia  Azerbaijan and NagornyKarabakh. My country remains committed to a negotiatedsettlement of the conflict and will continue to engageconstructively in the peace process. However  we urgeAzerbaijan to negotiate directly with the elected officials ofNagorny Karabakh  for we strongly believe that no finalsolution can be achieved without Karabakh's directparticipation in the deliberations on its own political status.The Republic of Armenia has been activelyparticipating in the fields of arms control and disarmament.We reaffirm our commitment to full implementation ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) objectives. To that end  Armenia welcomes theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) programmeon strengthening the effectiveness and improving theefficiency of the safeguards system. We have alreadyexpressed our readiness to conclude a supplementaryprotocol to the safeguards agreement with the IAEA.Last year the overwhelming majority of UnitedNations Member States signed the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We join the internationalcommunity in calling upon all States to sign and ratifythis Treaty to ensure its early entry into force.The Chemical Weapons Convention was anotherhistoric accomplishment in the field of globaldisarmament. As a founding member of the Organizationfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  Armenia willadvocate the full and effective implementation of theConvention.Armenia also supports the complementary efforts —through the Ottawa process — aimed at achieving acomplete ban on anti-personnel landmines. We realize theimportance of developing technological solutions to minedetection and clearance  and we fully support programmeson assistance to mine victims.The reform of the Security Council should becomeanother important component of the overall reform withinthe United Nations. Armenia supports the currentdiscussions on improving the representative character ofthe Security Council. We are in favour of expansion inboth categories  permanent and non-permanent. However while strengthening the capacity of the Council  such anincrease should also safeguard its decision-makingefficiency. We believe that five new seats should beallocated as permanent for the Security Council to betterreflect present political and economic realities. Thisarrangement should include improved representation forthe countries of Africa  Asia  and Latin America and theCaribbean. We also support the desire of Germany andJapan to acquire the status of permanent members of theSecurity Council.As regards the non-permanent seats  it is our viewthat the expansion should take into account the legitimateinterests of the Eastern European Group  whosemembership has more than doubled in recent years.18The Government of Armenia welcomes the proposalsby the Secretary-General for the reform of the UnitedNations. We fully support his commendable efforts to refinethe structure of this Organization and to streamline theoperations of its system  to make it more flexible andcapable of adequate  timely responses to the challenges oftoday's world. These proposals are a sound basis forimmediate actions  further negotiations and deliberations bythe General Assembly. There is a strong need to consolidatethe ongoing attempts of the United Nations system andMember States to alter and develop the Organization. Atthe same time  we should avoid reducing the evaluation ofthese reforms to a purely financial or managerial approach.Reform must enable the United Nations to attain moreeffectively the mandates and priorities enshrined in theCharter.In conclusion  let me assure the Assembly thatArmenia  keenly aware of the importance of an effectiveand active United Nations  is committed to contributing itsshare in the strengthening of this Organization."
"8",286,"ATG",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda  I wouldlike to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to presideover this fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Youare well known to many of the envoys to the UnitedNations  and we feel confident that under your guidance wewill have a productive session. I likewise wish to expressmy country’s recognition to the Permanent Representativeof Malaysia  for the manner in which he conducted thework of the fifty-first session. I also pay tribute to theSecretary-General  who is entrusted with the advancementof this Organization at such a critical time in its history.One cannot walk through the edifices of the UnitedNations without being asked to comment on the reformprocess and the value of the number of conferences that theOrganization has staged. The conferences of this decadehave certainly had an impact on our understanding ofcertain concepts  practices and generationally impartedbeliefs. Though we have taken many decisions implementation has proved to be difficult  and afundamental aspect of the reason or reasons for this is thatthe United Nations needs to be reformed  and Governmentsneed to zealously renew their commitments to its existenceand continued advancement.The Secretary-General’s report is most welcome  andthere are many points on which my country is in agreementand others on which we think continued discussion anddebate are needed. Peace  security and disarmament arevital to a safe and secure planet  and the countlessindividuals who live daily in constant fear — whetherbecause of terrorists  hatred between ethnic groups internecine warfare or religious persecution — gives usmuch concern.The Organization must have trained and equippedforces at all times  and the decision of a group of MemberStates to participate in the establishment of a standby high-readiness brigade is most encouraging. Additionally  thereis a need for the demobilization of paramilitary groups for demining and for an intensification of peacemaking peacekeeping and peace-building. Subsequently  theproblems associated with financing peace operations needto be addressed in a meaningful manner.Antigua and Barbuda strongly supports the conceptof results-based budgeting and endorses the proposal tohave the Secretary-General and the representatives ofMember States enter into a dialogue aimed at shifting theUnited Nations programme budget from a system of inputaccounting to one of results-based accountability.Likewise  my country welcomes the reforms already putin place in the Secretariat  through which field operationshave been considerably expanded  as a result ofcooperation between the Department of Political Affairs the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  theDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs and other relevantdepartments.We are anxiously looking forward to June of nextyear  when the diplomatic conference on the need toestablish an international criminal court will convene.This undertaking is long overdue  and Antigua andBarbuda has been working with neighbouring countries tothwart the dangers of increased international crime  whichis so active in this hemisphere. Of particular concern isthe need for greater coordination among nations if theblight of narcotics is to be meaningfully tackled. Strongand determined efforts within certain countries will beseriously undermined if there is not a united globalapproach to manifestations and practices which willdestroy not only the fabric of our societies but the livesof countless individuals.The most talked-about aspect of reform  however  isthe “Question of equitable representation on and increasein the membership of the Security Council and relatedmatters”. Numerous proposals on the question have beenadvanced  some adding more confusion to the existingdeliberations. As such  Antigua and Barbuda wishes toreiterate its declared position that any expansion shouldinclude developing countries  and that both the Group ofAfrican States and the Group of Latin American andCaribbean States should be represented.We would similarly like to see certain restrictionsplaced on the use of the veto. We understand that allefforts at restructuring and reform in the United Nations however  should be focused on economic growth anddevelopment. In addition  my country is calling for a7reversal in the diminishing role of the General Assembly.The accountability of the Security Council to the GeneralAssembly must be re-emphasized  and the GeneralAssembly should more actively assert its role in themaintenance of international peace and security  inaccordance with General Assembly resolution 377 (V) of 3November 1950  entitled “Uniting for peace”.The buzzword that we are constantly hearing is“globalization”. Those of us from small developingcountries would rather have the emphasis placed on povertyalleviation  but the present-day reality incorporates thebelief that the emphasized process of globalization andeconomic integration is unavoidable. There are newtechniques of production and new forms of organizationwhich have given flexibility to the location of industrialactivities and have reduced the share of wages inproduction costs. In many of our democratic societiesthroughout the world  where sacrifices have been made toreduce unemployment  Governments are faced with thedaunting and even frightening reality that labour isbecoming a dispensable commodity. The InternationalMonetary Fund  the World Bank and the World TradeOrganization all are promoting the emergence of a globalmarket. The small countries of the Caribbean are forced toadapt  and our businessmen must accept the reality that theconcept of protected markets is fast disappearing.The multilateral financial institutions which provideresources to developing countries at concessional ratescontinue to use the gross national product as a basis forjudging our economic wherewithal. Antigua and Barbuda isdeemed to be middle-income  but the reality of mycountry’s various vulnerabilities causes our people andthose of other Caribbean countries to bow to the flatteryand highlight the unjustness of this means of measurement.Our sister island of Montserrat has recently had aseries of severe volcanic eruptions which have caused theinhabitants much pain and anguish  and Antigua andBarbuda  along with other Caribbean Community countries has endeavoured to render assistance. As a result  thepopulation of Antigua and Barbuda has increased by some5 percent  which means that the resources of Governmentfor housing  health  education and all other services arestrained. Our citizens have  however  rendered muchsupport  and Antigua and Barbuda will do all in its powerto help alleviate the plight of our brothers and sisters fromthat lovely but now unsafe island. We strongly support therecommendation of the Committee of 24 that the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees and the UnitedNations Development Programme should move swiftly toassist in alleviating the plight of the sturdy butbeleaguered population of the Emerald Isle of theCaribbean.There are other dangerous volcanoes in theCaribbean  and one is presently forming undersea in thevicinity of Grenada. In 1974 Antigua and Barbudaexperienced an earthquake which measured 7.8 on theRichter scale and which caused considerable destruction.In 1995 Hurricane Luis unleashed its fury on our countryfor 48 hours and was declared to have been the worststorm of the century. Indeed  a single hurricane can setback our development some 10 years. Yet the grossnational product continues to be used to measure oureconomic performance  resulting in the absurd distortionof Antigua and Barbuda’s being deemed more developedthan Mexico or Brazil.We are pleased to read that at the 1995 CopenhagenWorld Summit for Social Development  the conclusionwas reached that an economic system has no intrinsicvalue. It has to be assessed in relation to the bettermentof the human condition. As such  a good economicsystem should of necessity provide opportunities forsufficient income to all members of the society; generateenough resources to enable public institutions to fulfiltheir responsibilities and promote the common good; andpermit  in addition to the government  participation bycitizens and other public and private actors in thedecision-making process. To this end  the Government ofAntigua and Barbuda is presently holding meetings invarious forums to discuss precisely the realities ofglobalization and the achievement of a single marketwithin the Caribbean Community.In June of this year a special session of the GeneralAssembly was held on the overall review and appraisal ofthe implementation of Agenda 21. Though there wasdisappointment at the outcome due to the inability ofcountries to coalesce around a common position orcommon commitments  there was the clear recognitionthat the threat to the global commons remains a profoundreality. There is continued overexploitation anddegradation of what has been bequeathed to mankind whether in regard to overfishing  overgrazing  excessivedestruction of forests  or air and water pollution. We havecollectively failed to capitalize on the promise andaccomplishments of the 1992 Rio Conference.Nine out of ten people in both the developed anddeveloping world have no idea what the term “sustainabledevelopment” means and how it affects them. Nine out of8ten also have little appreciation of why mutual recognitionand mutual action are necessary. People have not beenmade partners in the process of sustainable development and Governments should do more to make them so byeducation via the mass media  in the schools  in publicdebate and in public presentations.The industrialized countries must take the lead inchanging their patterns of production and consumption tosave the global environment and assist developing countriessuch as mine in our effort to meet our peoples’ basic needs to eradicate poverty and achieve economic growth. Duringthe special session in June  Caribbean newspapers reportedthat every Caribbean representative zeroed in on the“poverty issue”.To eradicate poverty and achieve economic growth isnot an easy task and has been further compounded by thefact that official development assistance  a crucial part ofthe Rio agreements  has fallen from 0.33 per cent in 1992to 0.27 per cent in 1995. This is well below the agreed andaccepted target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national productof the industrialized countries pledged to developmentassistance. The precipitous fall in official developmentassistance has shifted the burden for sustainabledevelopment unfairly to developing countries  destroying inthe process the equitable balance which was reached at thatvery important Conference. Private capital and foreigndirect investment  once touted as the panacea forsustainable development in developing countries  haveshown only selective benefits to some countries and havebypassed the vast majority. A combination of private capitalflows  foreign direct investment and debt relief as part of anoverall financial package may be a solution.In recognizing that an integrated approach tosustainable development is necessary  since political economic  social and environmental issues are closelyinterlinked and intertwined  we cannot overlook the integralrole that women can and should play in the quest forsustainable development. In Rio  women were considereda major group whose involvement was necessary to receivethe sought-after goals. Mainstreaming women’s concernsand participation in the planning  implementation andmonitoring of all development and management ofenvironmental programmes to ensure that women benefit isnecessary for sustainable development. In this regard  wecall on the multilateral and bilateral donors to increase theirsupport for women’s organizations in countries such asmine to enable them to play an active role in all aspects ofthe developmental process.There is  however  the fact that we must stressrepeatedly: the need to reduce the speed of theglobalization thrust. Dominant Governments andinstitutions are setting deadlines and establishing agendaswith such severe demands that most other actors findthem impossible to follow. The alternative toparticipation  as it now stands  is marginalization. If allcountries are required to fully participate  then there is aclear need for selective linking processes with referenceto both national circumstances and national cultures.This brings me to the vexing question of bananas.The undoing of the Lomé trade agreement and the injurywhich this hostile act will inflict on small  banana-exporting countries of the Organization of EasternCaribbean States  of which Antigua and Barbuda is amember  is tantamount to an act of war. Small  peace-loving States  causing no harm to any other State underthe terms of the Lomé agreement  have found themselvesyoked by the recent World Trade Organization ruling.Without some form of protection  the banana industry inthe States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)would collapse  leading to severe social dislocation whichwould ultimately manifest itself in political catastrophe.Be reminded that on more than one occasion  thePresident of the United States has cautioned that in thisgalloping global economy  small States cannot betrampled upon by their large neighbours.When my country chose to host in May of this yearthe regional seminar of the Committee of 24  betterknown as the Special Committee on Decolonization  itwas because we knew that the Caribbean has many otherobstacles to overcome in the emerging history of ourregion and the global community. Highlighted at themeeting was the principled position of the SpecialCommittee that the sustained economic growth and socialadvancement of the Non-Self-Governing Territories is anessential prerequisite of the implementation of theDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to ColonialCountries and Peoples. Of necessity  particular attentionhas to be given to the environment  natural disastermitigation  public health  education  economic self-sufficiency  the prevention of crime and illicit drugtrafficking.The Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbeanhave the same problems as the independent countries inregard to narcotics. There is a multidimensional thrustupon our entities  as there is the challenge togovernability by non-State actors  the drug operators.Caribbean countries additionally have to contend with9extraterritoriality and other forms of sovereignty challengesfrom other States  primarily because of conflicting interestsand because the Caribbean States are small and lacksignificant power.The countries of CARICOM are  however endeavouring to improve most aspects of their existence and new ground in the integration arrangement has beenbroken. Haiti has joined the ranks of CARICOM  adevelopment which is considered to be of immensesignificance  and we wish to applaud the decision to havethe United Nations Mission in Haiti extended. There hasbeen further movement towards the CARICOM singlemarket and economy. When Protocol II is ratified  theground will be laid for the free movement of factors ofproduction among countries which have agreed to be boundby its provisions. A plan is being developed for thesustainability of both tourist and airline industries in theregion. Approval was given to a comprehensive humanresource development plan for the specific purpose ofbuilding a more creative and productive workforce in theCaribbean. Indeed  the countries of CARICOM areendeavouring to overcome the major legacy of colonialism:being placed on the periphery of the industrialized world.As a collective body seeking the betterment ofmankind  the countries which form the United Nations needto recognize that human advancement requires managingmarkets as well as liberating them. Clearly  unbridledmarkets tend to produce a race to the bottom  manifestedthrough a global search for the location with the weakestregulatory  environmental  social and labour standards.What is required is for rich and poor countries to have acommonality of purpose that ensures a path of sustainabledevelopment. Year after year my country pleads for genuineacceptance of the principle of multilateralism  yet what isprojected under the banner is of a selective nature projectedby and through the powerful and the dominant. Togetherwe must find a way towards a global regime that reducesemissions of greenhouse gases  accepting the necessity ofwell-off nations to transfer the technology to make thispossible rather than viewing this shift as anotheropportunity for private industry to profit.It is sad that competitiveness can be pushed in adirection which handicaps and retards human development.State socialism failed  and in the process deprived hundredsof millions of individuals of both liberty and prosperity.Market forces  taken to the extreme  yield poorly distributedrates of growth  plunder the natural environment and aremost devastating in regard to the wreckage of humans. TheStates of the developing world are not just emergingmarkets  they are human societies. Markets must be ourservant  not our master. Clearly  the reality of commerceis global  but the paths to human development havehistorically been proven to be local.In approaching the twenty-first century  theGovernment of the twin island States of Antigua andBarbuda has decided that it should focus on humancapital and its development rather than focusing narrowlyon the economic question. There will be a continuance ofthe policy of carrying out intense investigations andfeasibility studies to decide where to concentrate limitedresources. In addition  even though the Government isdivesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraginggreater private investment in vital services andcommodities  there are some areas  particularly thosesurrounding technology  in which the Government has toremain directly involved and catalytic; it will continuewith its practice of seeking consensus on determining keyindustries and activities crucial and critical fordevelopment.We will continue to take pride in and to cherish theUnited Nations  as we recognize its capacity forachievements in areas beyond the reach of national orregional authorities. Now the nations which comprise thisbody must redouble their collective commitment fortranslating vision into reality. That is why it is essentialto have international cooperation for development in theforefront of our activities. The United Nations is still ourgreatest hope for peace  development and social justice."
"9",333,"AUS",52,1997,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating Mr. Udovenko on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at this fifty-second session. Thecountry and the Group he represents have seen greatchanges in the last decade. It therefore seems particularlyfitting that he is presiding over a General Assemblywhich will lay the foundation for significant changes tothe United Nations itself — changes which must equip itbetter for the new and potentially more cooperativeinternational environment in which we find ourselves.It is thus not only right but necessary that reform isthe major theme of the United Nations at present  and ofthis General Assembly in particular. We would like tothank the former President of the Assembly  AmbassadorRazali  for the outstanding contribution he made topursuing the reform agenda during his presidency  notably16in his capacity as Chairman of the General AssemblyWorking Groups.Today I want to concentrate on three issues inparticular: reform of the United Nations; reorienting ourapproach to human rights so as to promote cooperation andinstitution building  creating durable structures to givesubstance to the goals set out in the Charter of the UnitedNations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights andother international human rights instruments; andreconfiguring the traditional United Nations groups betterto reflect the regional groupings of the contemporary world.In dealing with reform  my purpose is to build a worldfor the next generation  and I am inspired by the hope andaspirations of the next generation.In that context  I am pleased that we are joined in theGeneral Assembly today by Mr. Perry Cross  adistinguished and courageous young Australian who isleading the fight against paralysis. He exemplifies theAustralian belief that individuals with a will and a practicalfocus can make a difference in fighting barriers andreforming structures which are representative of an earlierera.Australia wants to work with you  Sir  and with theSecretary-General and all Members of the United Nations to ensure that by the end of this session of the GeneralAssembly further  substantive progress has been made inthe three critical areas of reform: financial reform andresolution of the crisis surrounding the United Nationsbudget and scale of assessments; reform of the SecurityCouncil; and reform of the Organization.When I made my first statement to the Assembly lastyear  I stressed the need to move ahead urgently withreform and the reinvigoration of this importantOrganization  to ensure its future effectiveness andrelevance. This year reform has been given real impetus bythe new Secretary-General  whose appointment Australiawarmly welcomed. Both in March and in July this year heannounced significant organizational reforms aimed at therenewal of this body. I have enthusiastically supported theseinitiatives. We must now build on them.We share the Secretary-General’s conclusions aboutthe shortcomings of the United Nations. The Organization’smission  as enshrined in the Charter  has been repeatedlyreaffirmed and remains valid today. But the machinery andthe working methods to pursue that mission need thoroughreview and revision. We agree that there is too muchfragmentation of structures  too much rigidity withinbodies and too much emphasis on bureaucracy andprocess.I would like to highlight in particular the reformssuggested to the United Nations structure and to theSecretariat. The integration of 12 secretariats and entitiesinto 5  and the proposed consolidation of fiveintergovernmental bodies into two are particularlywelcome. They will help streamline and removeunnecessary bureaucratic structure and duplication fromthe Secretariat. It is an approach we commend also to thespecialized agencies as Member nations seek to streamlineand even merge some of these bodies.Important steps are proposed in reforming the waythe Secretariat works. We applaud the removal of 1 000staff posts and the cutting of administrative costs by onethird to which the Secretary-General has committedhimself. We also wish to see all Secretariat staff move tofixed-term  renewable contracts to allow for greateremployment flexibility in the Organization. We supportthe introduction of a merit-based promotion system andperformance appraisal in the place of a system whereseniority plays a disproportionate role. We also encouragemanagement to improve training opportunities for junioras well as senior staff.These reforms will not only make the UnitedNations work better  but also provide real savings. Thesesavings will be available for programmes  programmeswhich benefit all of us  but especially support thedeveloping Members of the United Nations. Thus it is apackage which is in the interests of all  and deservessupport from all. We believe the Assembly needs toprovide broad endorsement of the package as a wholeearly in this session to allow the reform process toproceed  even if some details are negotiated subsequently.But I acknowledge that for reform to succeed andfor the United Nations to carry out its mandate adequateresources must be made available to run the Organization.Australia continues to meet all its financial obligations infull and on time and without conditions  and seeks thesame commitment from all our fellow Members. Wecontinue to believe that the negotiation of financialreforms would be facilitated by early settlement of allunpaid contributions. The adoption of a responsible negative-growth budget and a new scale of assessments whichaccurately reflects relative shares of national income andthus the principle of capacity to pay will also be keyissues at this year’s session. It is important that the result17ensures the burden of supporting the Organization fallsfairly on Member States.Australia remains committed to an expanded  morerepresentative and transparent Security Council  better ableto tackle the challenges of the twenty-first century. Itshould include as permanent members important Powersable to make a major contribution to international peace andsecurity  particularly at this time Japan and Germany. Itshould also include permanent seats for under-representedregions as well as additional non-permanent seats.Middle Powers such as Australia have made asignificant contribution to the United Nations since itsfoundation  notably in disarmament  development peacekeeping and human rights. We are concerned that theinterests of small and medium-sized countries not beforgotten in this exercise. In this context  and because ofour long-standing historical concerns about the veto  wewould like to see an expansion of the Council accompaniedby a new understanding on the application of the veto. Wewould also support a review of any new arrangements after10 years so that countries like Australia and all othermembers of the international community have a furtheropportunity to examine the size  composition and workingmethods of the Council.I am optimistic about what can be achieved by theUnited Nations if we can bring about some essentialreforms which would make the Organization function moreefficiently and effectively. Let me mention one of the areasin which the United Nations has proven it can functioneffectively: as a forum and catalyst for international armscontrol and disarmament efforts.In recent years we have witnessed several landmarkdevelopments in this field  notably the indefinite extensionof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. The General Assembly was the forum  one yearago  for the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  and Australia is particularly proud to have beenable to play a role in that historic event.There are many challenges ahead as we work with and through  the United Nations to reduce global stockpilesof conventional and non-conventional weapons and to makethe world a safer and more humane place. Let me singleout two. The immediate commencement and earlyconclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-offtreaty has repeatedly been identified by the internationalcommunity as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts  most recently bythe parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty —which now has more members than the United Nationsitself — at their first preparatory meeting for the sixthReview Conference in 2000.The Canberra Commission on the Elimination ofNuclear Weapons also identified an agreement to ceasethe production of fissile material for nuclear explosivepurposes as an important step towards the elimination ofnuclear weapons. Capping the amount of nuclear materialavailable for nuclear weapons use by extendingsafeguards coverage over currently unsafeguarded sensitive nuclear facilities would in itself be a significantachievement for international peace and security  quiteapart from its significance as a step towards the ultimateelimination of nuclear weapons.As I said to the Committee on Disarmament inJanuary this year  the achievement of a fissile materialcut-off treaty is a priority objective for Australia  and Inow commit Australia to redoubling its efforts to achievea cut-off treaty at the earliest possible date. We must notallow ourselves to be put off by the obstacles thatcurrently face the achievement of this goal.The effective elimination of landmines as a weaponof war is another important task facing the United Nationscollectively and its members individually. I have beengratified by the gains made to date  through the Ottawaprocess  through the Inhumane Weapons Convention through national and regional measures and  perhaps mostimportant  through enhanced contributions to deminingand mine-victim assistance programmes to address theterrible human toll of anti-personnel landmines. We oweit to the victims of anti-personnel landmines to continueworking through all avenues to achieve a real and lastingsolution to the global landmines problem.The elimination of landmines is one necessary stepin creating a more humane world  a world whereindividual human rights can demand proper respect. Butfurther measures need to be taken involving theestablishment of durable national human rights institutionsto advance the goals to which our international humanrights treaty commitments aspire. We are encouraged byand support the proposal to integrate human rights issuesmore fully into a range of United Nations activities. Inour view  the linkages between respect for human rights good governance and sustainable development areimportant. The fact that all four Executive Committeesestablished by the Secretary-General will take human18rights issues into account in their deliberations shouldensure that more effective coordination is possible acrossUnited Nations activities. We warmly welcome also thesteps taken by the Secretary General to reform andreinvigorate the Secretariat’s organizational structure tosupport human rights  particularly the consolidation of theOffice of the High Commissioner and the Centre forHuman Rights into a single office. His appointment of theformer President of Ireland  Mary Robinson  as HighCommissioner for Human Rights is an excellent choice. Wepledge ourselves to support her in her task.Another important recent development at theinternational level has been the negotiation of a draft statutefor an international criminal court. Australia is stronglycommitted to the early establishment of the court as amajor human rights objective. We urge all nations tosupport by consensus the proposed resolution at thisGeneral Assembly calling for the convening of a diplomaticconference in June 1998 to finalize and adopt the statute ofthe court.As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  we pay tribute tothe universal standards the Declaration has helped toestablish. Let us never forget as well that the Declaration along with the two International Covenants  and the wholebody of treaty law and practice that has since developed was reaffirmed by all nations at the Vienna WorldConference on Human Rights in 1993.Australia is a nation committed to the advancement ofhuman rights and regards human rights issues as integral toits diplomacy. However  the Australian Government doesnot want the important area of human rights to become anunproductive battleground or an environment forsloganeering. What we seek is results  not rhetoric  with theoutcome being genuine improvements in human rights. Thereal basis for a sustained improvement in the quality ofhuman rights needs to be through domestic reform foundedon working institutions that guarantee participation andaccountability. Reform of the institutions of civilgovernance must come from within. It is not something thatcan be imposed from outside  for if there is not the politicalwill and the people with the knowledge and a commitmentto making those institutions work  then they will simplyfounder. Almost all nations have dark moments in theirhistory where abuses have occurred  where vigilance hasfailed. Abuses and corruption are most likely to disappearwhen there are institutions established to bring light intothis darkness.All too often  however  instead of working patientlyto encourage and help others to build these institutions countries have tended to address issues of human rightsby criticism alone. There is no doubt that in the 52 yearssince the United Nations was established the world haswitnessed many egregious and vile acts committed for themost inhumane of reasons  and deserving the strongestcondemnation. However  the condemnatory approachalone has only limited practical value.We need to recognize that in practical termsprotecting human rights must primarily be done at thenational level. The international human rights system which we have worked hard to build  inevitably has abroad focus and a limited ability to assist States toimplement agreed standards. Regional human rightsmechanisms also have a role  and we should do what wecan to encourage their establishment and strengthening including in the Asia-Pacific. However  it is clear that theability of each State effectively to protect human rightsdepends to a significant degree on the strength of its owninstitutions  including a representative legislature  anaccountable executive and an independent judiciary. Avigorous civil society is another important element increating a culture of human rights.A critical element that has often been undervalued inthe national implementation of human rights standards isthe importance of effective institutions as a means toachieving good governance. It is this institution-basedgood governance that offers a real hope of eradicating therandomness and violence that can characterize systemswhere there is neither popular participation nor genuineaccountability.Good governance creates the environment in whichcivil and political rights are respected and protected. Goodgovernance also promotes an environment for soundeconomic management and sustainable use of resources toincrease prosperity. These conditions are important to theprotection of economic  social and cultural rights.At the same time  the exercise of civil and politicalrights through participatory processes is essential to goodgovernance because it helps ensure governmentalaccountability and effectiveness. The interlinkages aresuch that action in one area of human rights has apositive reinforcing effect on other dimensions of humanrights  making all human rights indivisible.Accountability  participation and effective institutions arethree fundamental principles necessary for the protectionof human rights.19It is with all this in mind that Australia gives priorityto institution building in the human rights field. One of themost significant developments in recent years has been thespread of national institutions for the promotion of humanrights. Such institutions  able to work with Governmentsand civil society  can reflect to a significant degree thedifferent cultures and local conditions of the societies inwhich they are established  while remaining consistent withinternational human rights standards. Moreover  it is worthnoting that the General Assembly has endorsed a set ofminimum standards for such institutions — the so-calledParis principles. Despite considerable early scepticism recent experience has been very positive  and manyGovernments and non-governmental organizations are nowlooking positively at independent national institutions as animportant means to promote and protect human rights. Thegenerally positive view of the work of national institutionsheld by most States was reflected in the adoption byconsensus of Australia’s resolution on this subject at thisyear’s session of the Commission on Human Rights  withan increased number of co-sponsors.Developing countries are showing rapidly increasinginterest in establishing or strengthening existing nationalhuman rights institutions  as a constructive way to takepositive action at the national level  bearing in mindnational circumstances  to promote respect for humanrights. Important examples of human rights institutionsrecently established in my part of the world that are makinga difference on the ground include those in India andIndonesia. I was encouraged recently by the statement ofPapua New Guinea’s Prime Minister that he intends topress ahead to establish a human rights commission in thenear future.We will also watch with expectation the developmentof the proposed Cambodian national human rightscommission. A credible and independent human rightscommission  along with a genuinely independent nationalelectoral commission  could make an important contributionto protecting stability and promoting the observance ofhuman rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what westrongly hope will be free  fair and credible elections inMay next year.The work of national institutions in individualcountries can be strengthened through subregional andregional arrangements which provide a framework forexchanges of views and experiences. Australia is a strongsupporter of the development of such arrangements in theAsia-Pacific region. Since an inaugural meeting in Darwinin 1996 there has been a steady consolidation of linksamong established and emerging Asia-Pacific humanrights commissions. The 1996 meeting saw thecommissions of Australia  New Zealand  Indonesia andIndia — later also joined by the Philippines — establisha regional network of human rights commissions  theAsia-Pacific Forum of National Human RightsInstitutions  with a supporting Secretariat based in andfinanced by Australia.The aim of this network is to strengthen cooperationamong national human rights institutions  includingthrough information sharing  staff exchanges  technicalcooperation and an annual regional meeting. It also assistsother regional Governments wishing to establish suchinstitutions. The most recent regional meeting has justbeen held  in New Delhi. It attracted participation fromthe founding human rights commissions as well as that ofSri Lanka. Other regional countries from Asia and thePacific attended as observers  some of which areconsidering the establishment of their own human rightscommissions.A most effective area of United Nations operationsin this field has been the work of the Special Adviser tothe High Commissioner for Human Rights on NationalInstitutions  Regional Arrangements and PreventiveStrategies. The United Nations work with a number ofGovernments  including in our own region  is at animportant stage. Australia was therefore pleased toprovide additional financial support this year to enable theUnited Nations to continue to support national institutions.We welcome the Secretary-General’s commitment inhis report on the work of the Organization tostrengthening cooperation on issues of democratizationand good governance. We note his comment that“This past year has seen a dramatic increase inactivities relating to the establishment of nationalinstitutions for the promotion and protection ofhuman rights.” (A/52/1  para. 30)We are heartened by this development and by theresponsiveness of the Secretary-General. His reportclearly reflects the need I am stressing here for supportfor national institution-building to be at the centre ofUnited Nations human rights endeavours.Earlier this year I announced the establishment inAustralia of a Centre for Democratic Institutions. ThisCentre will be devoted to the provision of practicalsupport for the consolidation and strengthening of20democratic institutions in developing countries included inAustralia’s aid programme. It exemplifies a cooperativerather than a conflict approach towards promoting humanrights  and it will be the flagship of our good governanceinitiatives. The focus of the Centre’s training programmeswill be on electoral  parliamentary  judicial and humanrights institution-building and the processes by whichbroader society  notably the media and community groups can contribute to democratic decision-making. It will alsofacilitate visits and secondments of appropriate participants such as Parliamentarians  senior administrators and otherinfluential persons to relevant Australian organizations.While human rights remain at risk  our values arecompromised and international stability is jeopardized. Theprotection of human rights to promote the dignity of theindividual is too important a matter for symbolic gesturesalone. It is only through the pursuit of practical andeffective efforts to promote human rights that we show ourreal commitment to the welfare of individuals and society.And it is vital to such practical outcomes that we orient ourapproach to human rights to emphasize cooperation and thecreation of durable structures.If I may stay briefly with the subjects of practicaloutcomes and durable structures  the nations of the worldare facing today the threat of climate change and will needto agree later this year in Kyoto on sustainable responses tothat threat. At the recent South Pacific Forum  Australia along with other Forum countries  acknowledged deepconcern about the impact of increasing concentrations ofgreenhouse gases on rising sea levels and changing weatherpatterns  especially low-lying islands. Australia  along withothers  is working hard to ensure that the Kyoto meetingdelivers a sustainable environmental outcome. We standready to play our part  although  as we have made clear inthese negotiations  we have no intention of imposing uponAustralians an unfair and disproportionate cost inaddressing this global problem.Before concluding  I should like to address the thirdand final reform issue I said I would be raising. Australiabelieves there is an element missing in the presentdiscussion on reform. I am referring to the existing electoralgroup system  which dates back to the last major reform ofthe group system in 1963. Since the size of the UnitedNations has nearly doubled since 1963  mostly with newnations from Africa  Asia and the Pacific  this issue needsto be addressed again.The present configuration contains many conspicuousanomalies and inequities which constitute powerfularguments for reform. The substantial disparities in thesize of the various groups and the inadequate level ofrepresentation available to the many subregions  includingin our own geographic region of East Asia and thePacific  has long been an evident source of frustration.Comparisons between the size of the African and EastEuropean Groups — embracing 53 and 21 members respectively — demonstrate the legitimacy ofdissatisfaction with the status quo in this regard.This widespread sense of under-representation isexacerbated by the social and political diversity of thelarger groups and the limited extent to which a singlemember can be said to represent the group as a whole.While we have our own ideas  Australia does not believeit would be helpful to prescribe any rigid formula forreconfiguration of the group system. We acknowledge thisis a sensitive issue on which there are many views. ButI believe it is time we began to think about and discussthis matter  as we seek to equip the United Nations forthe future.Ultimately  reform of the United Nations means onething. It means a more efficient organization capable ofdelivering practical outcomes to the people of the world.If we are to achieve that reform  then we must focus oncooperation  not conflict. We must build institutionswhich will guarantee effective vigilance  and above allelse we must have the courage to abandon the ideas andstructures of the past and embrace the changes whichbring the future."
"10",380,"AUT",52,1997,"﻿Let me express mypleasure at seeing you  Sir  the Foreign Minister ofUkraine — with which Austria has close historical linksand enjoys excellent relations — presiding over theGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your profoundprofessional experience in the United Nations systemand your negotiating skills will ensure substantialprogress in our ambitious agenda.On behalf of the Federal Government of Austria  Ishould also like to express our sincere appreciation toSecretary-General Kofi Annan  whose wise leadershipof the Organization we fully support. In the short timesince he took office he has succeeded in reaching outnot only to Governments but also to the people and themedia  thus fostering a new awareness about the goals aspirations and achievements of the United Nations asthe indispensable instrument of global cooperation.My colleague from Luxembourg has alreadyexpressed the position of the European Union  whichwe fully endorse. I should like to elaborate on a fewpoints to which Austria attaches particular importance.The United Nations is currently preparing itself forthe challenges of the twenty-first century. TheSecretary-General and his team  with theencouragement of Member States  have initiatedcomprehensive reform. Austria welcomes this majoreffort to redirect the Organization towards the needs ofthe future  and we fully endorse the Secretary-General'sproposals. In particular I should like to emphasize thefollowing points: first  the streamlining of leadershipand management structure; secondly  the consolidationof the United Nations presence in the field; thirdly  thereturn of development to the centre of United Nationsactivities and the better combining of the potential ofUnited Nations funds and programmes; and  fourthly the strengthening of human rights in all aspects of thework of the United Nations.8Without adequate resources  however  the UnitedNations will not succeed in carrying out its tasks. Aslong as Member States do not fully honour theirobligations  the financial situation of the Organizationwill remain critical. Settling the arrears is therefore animperative. Austria is proud of its traditional record ofpaying its contributions to the United Nations in full andon time. The serious political will and sincerecommitment of every Government will be required.Needless to say  unilateral decisions are unacceptable inthe framework of multilateral cooperation.The fight against drugs  crime and terrorism hasrightly become a first priority for the internationalcommunity. Nearly 1 per cent of the world's populationabove the age of 15 today has abused stimulants. Anestimated 300 tons of heroin a year have been producedduring this decade to supply about 8 million addicts.While I hope that regional cooperation will sooncontribute effectively to the fight against illegaltrafficking and drug abuse  the Secretary-General'sintention to strengthen the United Nations capacities inthis field deserves the support of all Member States.Austria will cooperate closely with the newlyappointed Director-General of the United Nations Officeat Vienna  Mr. Pino Arlacchi. We are convinced that hisprofound knowledge and experience in fighting organizedcrime will be a strong asset in pooling the resources ofthe United Nations system  the Member States andrelevant institutions. To demonstrate its support  Austriawill make a significant financial contribution to theUnited Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal JusticeTrust Fund.Illegal migration is increasingly linked totransnational crime. The reckless exploitation of humansin distress is a particularly reprehensible form ofinternational crime. An increasing number of peoplesmuggled illegally across borders find themselveshelpless victims deprived of all financial means and withan illegal status in a foreign country. The perpetrators  atthe same time  earn the profits and escape justice bycynically making use of a loophole in the internationalcriminal law regime. There is an urgent need for aninternational legal instrument making the smuggling ofillegal migrants punishable as a transnational crime  thusensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice.I have asked legal experts to prepare a draftinternational convention against the smuggling of illegalmigrants. This draft is being circulated as an officialdocument under the appropriate agenda item. Wepropose that the United Nations Commission on CrimePrevention and Criminal Justice consider this draft as amatter of priority at its next session. I am confident thatour initiative will help in closing a dangerous legallacuna  thereby strengthening international judicialcooperation in this field.Substance abuse and drug-related crimes continueto take a high toll in both the developing and theindustrialized worlds. Human and social development isthreatened on a global scale. Strengthening andupdating existing international anti-drug capacities willrequire innovation and new methods. In this respect  thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted tointernational drug control  which is to be held in June1998  will provide us with an excellent opportunity torenew our political commitment by closing our ranksagainst illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly forprogress in preventive efforts.Anti-personnel landmines constitute a particularlymalicious threat to the security of individuals andcountries. Even decades after the end of a conflict  suchas the Second World War  these hidden killers take aterrible toll among civilian populations  killing ormaiming more than 20 000 people each and every year.Every year 20 times more mines are laid than cleared.Estimates speak of 110 million mines laid in more than60 countries. I think that this spiral of death must bestopped.Austria was one of the first countries to ban anti-personnel landmines at the national level. We stronglyadvocated a total ban  and we prepared the draft forsuch a convention. Non-governmental organizationshave played a prominent role in creating the necessarymomentum  and I would like to thank them respectfullyfor that on behalf of the Austrian Government. TheOslo Diplomatic Conference negotiated a treaty on thisbasis  and I look forward to signing the Convention inOttawa  together with so many of my colleagues whoshare this goal. I urge the countries that were not ableto join the consensus in Oslo to become part of theprocess as soon as possible.Ted Turner has generously earmarked a part of hisunprecedented $1 billion donation to support intensifieddemining efforts. I wish to thank him for this uniquegesture.9The dignity and worth of the human person areuniversal. Consequently  it is the duty of our universalOrganization to help implement governmentalcommitments in this field. Since the Vienna WorldConference on Human Rights  human rights have movedinto the centre of United Nations programmes andactivities. Austria welcomes this trend. There is anintrinsic relationship between respect for human rights democracy and sustainable development. Guaranteeinghuman rights is an essential precondition for lastingsecurity and stability. This link has been highlighted bythe Secretary-General in his commendable report on thework of the Organization.I take this opportunity to warmly welcome theappointment of President Mary Robinson as HighCommissioner for Human Rights and to pledge Austria'sfull support for her work. Her outstanding personalitywill undoubtedly contribute to further strengthening theUnited Nations role in human rights.The review of the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action and the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights make 1998 theyear of human rights. This will provide us with a uniqueopportunity to shape the international human rightsprogramme for the new millennium. Its central objectivemust remain that international human rights standards berespected at the level of each nation. For this  the role ofGovernments is crucial; so is that of civil society. Theinternational community  therefore  not only has to ensurecompliance with these commitments and provide thenecessary assistance  but it must also promote the role ofcivil society. We see this year of human rights as anoccasion for reaching out to human rights defenders in allcorners of the world. As host country of the WorldConference and as the country assuming the presidencyof the European Union in the second half of 1998 Austria offers its cooperation to ensure a successfulhuman rights year 1998 in all parts of the world.Austria places great emphasis on the promotion andprotection of minorities. We do so on the basis of ourhistorical experience and owing to our conviction thatethnic minorities do not threaten but rather enrich oursocieties. In this context  I am pleased to refer to thesuccessful solution of an important minority issue. TheAustrian minority in South Tyrol today enjoys a well-balanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris Treaty of1946 between Austria and Italy. This autonomy hasgenerated considerable interest in other parts of theworld.With regard to the human rights year  theimplementation of the Beijing Platform continues to bea priority. In particular  Austria supports efforts tostrengthen the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women. We also arecontributing to the enhanced practical implementationof other international human rights treaties  such as theConvention on the Rights of the Child  in particularwith regard to juvenile justice.Employment  as a matter of growing globalconcern  rightly ranks high on the political agenda.Governments are urged to develop further instrumentsto fight unemployment through the effective monitoringof labour policies. The World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen provided a set ofprinciples and goals in this respect. In order to confirmthese commitments and to identify good practices  Ishould like to recall that Austria  as a follow-up toCopenhagen  will host an international expert meetingon employment in early February 1998.In our joint efforts to promote sustainabledevelopment  the peaceful use of outer space for thebenefit of all countries has become an issue of rapidlygrowing importance to the United Nations in the lastfew years. I should like to reaffirm the full support ofmy country for the United Nations aim to expandactivities in this field. We welcome the holding of thethird United Nations Conference on the Exploration andPeaceful Uses of Outer Space  which will be convenedas a special session of the Committee on the PeacefulUses of Outer Space  open to all Member States  inVienna in July 1999.My country is deeply committed to the peaceprocess in the former Yugoslavia  in particular inBosnia and Herzegovina. The Dayton accords providethe framework for the return of Bosnia to normalcy andstability  for its economic recovery and forreconciliation among its ethnic groups. Full andcomprehensive implementation of the DaytonAgreement is therefore imperative. This includesbringing to justice all indicted war criminals  whereverthey may be. If we want to safeguard the Daytonprocess  the international community must remainfirmly committed to taking the necessary political economic and military measures even beyond July1998. International support must remain conditional onfull compliance with all international obligations. Ishould like to pay a special tribute to the UnitedNations Transitional Administration for Eastern10Slavonia  Baranja and Western Sirmium  which has madean invaluable contribution to fostering peace in thatregion.Austria is in favour of integrating the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia fully into the United Nationsfamily as soon as the necessary preconditions  includingthe application for membership  are fulfilled. In thisrespect  I stress our expectation that Belgrade will grant alarge degree of autonomy to Kosovo and the Albanianminority.Austria has followed the situation in the Middle Eastwith great concern. We regret the fact that the peaceprocess has come to a near-standstill. The confidencebuilt up by the Oslo process has been largely destroyed.Our main task must be to re-establish and to strengthenthis confidence step by step and to bring the parties backto the negotiating table. The present situation increasesthe risk of extremist activity. A precondition for progressin the peace process will certainly be respect by allparties for the agreements concluded and theengagements undertaken.Austria is seriously preoccupied by the precariouseconomic and social situation in the Palestinianterritories  where the unemployment rate is 70 per cent. Itis of paramount importance to create the necessaryeconomic conditions as a basis for political stability.There will be no lasting peace without a credibleresponse to the economic needs of the people in theregion.Since 1960  Austria has participated very actively inUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. Considering thegrowing importance in contemporary peacekeeping ofregional arrangements under Chapter VIII of the Charterof the United Nations  my country has started tocooperate closely with those States and organizations thathave taken leading roles in this field. In 1997 Austriaprovided about 1 200 troops  military observers andcivilian police to 11 different peacekeeping operationsthroughout the world  including the Stabilization Force(SFOR) and the operation in Albania.Austria actively supports the standby arrangementsystem  created in 1994  and in this connection took partin establishing the United Nations Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade in December 1996  which was createdto build a capacity for quick preventive action and crisisresponse.I am deeply convinced that  especially in times ofscarce financial resources  the international communityshould make a greater investment in the field of conflictprevention and preventive diplomacy. The UnitedNations has the mandate to take a leading role infurther developing instruments for preventivediplomacy.Austria is  and will continue to be  a loyalMember and a strong supporter of the worldOrganization. The United Nations — ourOrganization — is the only global instrument that canprovide the necessary response to existing globalchallenges: eradicating poverty; protecting our planet'senvironment; combating drugs  organized crime andterrorism; and promoting human rights  including therights of children. To this end we have to strengthenthe United Nations."
"11",405,"AZE",52,1997,"﻿Allow me first of all  Sir  to congratulate yousincerely on your unanimous election to the post ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession  and to express our confidence that under your wiseand able guidance this session will successfully cope withall its historic tasks. Your election to that high andresponsible post is further evidence of the burgeoningimage of independent Ukraine  with which Azerbaijanenjoys an especially friendly relationship  and of itssubstantial contribution to the work of the Organization.I would also like to address special appreciation toMr. Razali Ismail  whose innovative approach and highprofessionalism to a large extent facilitated the success ofthe last session and showed the irreversible nature of theradical process of reforming the Organization with a viewto strengthening its effectiveness.For the past six years  the Republic of Armenia hascontinued its aggression against my country. Aiming totear away and seize part of the territory of Azerbaijan  theRepublic of Armenia initiated and sponsored a separatistmovement in the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.Here it was gambling with the high principle of the self-determination of peoples and completely ignoring theprinciples of territorial integrity and the inviolability ofborders. Subsequently  as members know  the Republic ofArmenia resorted to armed aggression against theAzerbaijani Republic  occupying a considerable part ofAzerbaijan and leaving about a million people withoutshelter.Their later invention  the so-called Republic ofNagorny Karabakh  is nothing but a tactical trick in thestrategy of Armenian politicians  which is to attach theNagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic tothe Republic of Armenia. The international communityrejected this policy through Security Council resolutions822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) which reaffirmed that the Nagorny Karabakh region is apart of Azerbaijan.The 1996 Lisbon summit of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) put forwardthree principles for the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. These were: the territorial integrity ofthe Republic of Armenia and of the Azerbaijani Republic;definition of the legal status of Nagorny Karabakhthrough an agreement based on self-determination andconferring on Nagorny Karabakh the highest degree ofself-rule within Azerbaijan; and guaranteed security forNagorny Karabakh and its entire population  includingmutual obligations to ensure compliance by all the partieswith the provisions of the settlement.Armenia was the only country out of 54 OSCEmember States that rejected those principles. While7speaking in favour of a peaceful settlement of the conflictat the earliest possible date  the Republic of Armeniareceived  during the period 1993 to 1996  a vast amount ofRussian weaponry  far exceeding its requirements  includingtanks  armoured vehicles and SCUD missiles  worth $1billion. This clearly demonstrates that that country has notyet given up its aggressive plans.In an address to permanent representatives of UnitedNations Member States during a visit to United NationsHeadquarters last August  the President of Azerbaijan  Mr.Heydar Aliyev  stated that Azerbaijan had been and wouldcontinue to be in favour of a peaceful resolution of theconflict. Azerbaijan is ready to provide the Armenianpopulation of the Nagorny Karabakh region with thebroadest possible autonomy  in accordance with worldstandards  but it will never submit to seizure of part of itsterritory or allow a second Armenian State to be created atthe expense of its own land.Azerbaijan supported proposals submitted inSeptember by the Co-Chairmen of the OSCE MinskConference  the United States  Russia and France. Theelaboration of a draft agreement on cessation of the armedconflict on the basis of those proposals would create a solidfoundation for achieving a breakthrough in the process offinding a settlement to the Armenia-Azerbaijan armedconflict.The reform package for the United Nations proposedby the Secretary-General is a serious and fundamentaldocument. Azerbaijan welcomes his report (A/51/950) as areal basis for conducting reforms in order to adapt theUnited Nations to today’s rapidly changing demands andmake it better prepared to meet the challenges of thetwenty-first century. Azerbaijan is prepared to cooperatewith all Member States and with the Secretary-General andhis reform team in order to achieve the goal that has beenset.We support the Secretary-General’s realisticassessment that the main aim of the present reform is tonarrow the gap between the aspirations and achievementsof the United Nations. We think that establishing theposition of Deputy Secretary-General  setting up a SeniorManagement Group  creating a Strategic Planning Unit andstrengthening the executive committees of the sectoralgroups  together with a number of other suggestions constitute an interesting and comprehensive approach thatwill ensure the harmonious management and functioning ofthis Organization as it tackles the new and complex tasksof the twenty-first century.We are of the view that  given the numerouspressing problems  the maintenance of peace and securitythroughout the world must continue to be the mainmission of our Organization. In this regard  Azerbaijanwelcomes and supports the Secretary-General’s ideas onstrengthening the potential of the United Nations in post-conflict peace-building  with the Department of PoliticalAffairs as the focal point for this.This matter is integrally linked to the issue ofadvancing the disarmament agenda. Accordingly  the ideaof establishing a Department for Disarmament and ArmsRegulation  which would address the reduction andregulation of armaments and weapons of massdestruction  deserves every support.With regard to disarmament as a whole  I would liketo dwell on the urgent problem of the proliferation ofconventional arms. The lack of norms regulatingconventional arms causes serious concern. One cannot butagree with the Secretary-General when he says that sucha situation creates a vicious circle  in that Member Statesseek assistance in the settlement of armed conflicts  whilethere is tough competition over arms exports  includingexports to conflict areas where the United Nations isseeking to restore peace. All of this leads to the furtherescalation and prolongation of conflicts.The expansion of the Security Council is a pressing acute and complex issue. We believe that any increase inthe number of permanent members of the SecurityCouncil must be confined to countries with the capacityand will to assume global responsibility  includingfinancial responsibility  for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  and for sustainabledevelopment and stability. In this context  Azerbaijan hason several occasions spoken in favour of the candidaturesof Germany and Japan  which in our view meet thoserequirements.An increase in the number of non-permanentmembers of the Security Council should restore theprinciple of equitable geographic allocation of seats for allregional groups. In this connection  Azerbaijan supportsan increase in the number of non-permanent members ofthe Security Council from the Group of Eastern EuropeanStates  given that membership of the Group has doubledin the past five years. We believe that one non-permanentseat for our Group in the Security Council does notreflect the current state of affairs and is notcommensurate with the role played by the members of the8Group in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.Azerbaijan also supports the approach taken to thequestion of equitable representation of Asian  African  LatinAmerican and Caribbean States in the Council. The issue ofthe total number of permanent and non-permanent membersof the Security Council should first be addressed from theperspective of maintaining and upgrading the efficiency ofthe Council.We fully support the Secretary-General’s idea that oneof the main directions for United Nations reform must beto strengthen United Nations activities in the area ofcoordination of international cooperation for development.We are convinced that at a time when the question ofmore rational use of United Nations resources  includingfinancial resources  has become a priority  the Secretary-General’s decision to focus on the activities that the UnitedNations can best carry out  from the standpoint both ofusing existing intellectual potential and of meeting therequirements of a large group of members of theinternational community  is very wise.The Azerbaijani Republic greatly appreciates thenature and results of its cooperation with the UnitedNations system in the area of socio-economic development.Since our country joined the United Nations  dozens oflarge-scale development projects have been implemented inAzerbaijan with help from United Nations specializedagencies. These projects have had a positive impact on theall-round transformation of Azerbaijani society. I would liketo make particular mention of the establishment of a freeeconomic zone in the third largest city of Azerbaijan Sumgait  and the programme to rehabilitate the territoriesof Azerbaijan liberated from Armenian occupation.We welcome the idea of establishing a United NationsDevelopment Group  and we believe that strengtheningcoordination in the activities of the various agencies willadd to the efficiency of the operational developmentactivities of the Organization. Among the factors that couldhelp us achieve this goal are the elaboration of acomprehensive strategy for the activities of specializedagencies vis-à-vis the recipient countries  the elimination ofoverlap in functions and programmes  a renewedconcentration on priorities  and the improvement ofpartnership mechanisms with State institutions and non-governmental organizations of Member States.But all these good wishes and hopes may prove tobe simply an unattainable dream if they are notaccompanied by a relevant resource base. In this respect Mr. Kofi Annan’s idea of creating a new system formobilizing core resources for development purposes through voluntary contributions and negotiated pledgesthat would be made available in multi-year tranches  is tobe commended and supported. We are convinced that itis necessary to provide the broadest possible mandate forthe Secretary-General’s proposed Office for DevelopmentFinancing.We welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal todeepen and expand the partnership between the UnitedNations and the Bretton Woods institutions with a viewto strengthening cooperation and increasing therationalization and coordination of activities. In recentyears Azerbaijan has accumulated considerable experiencethrough fruitful cooperation with the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). Thanks to thiscooperation it has been possible to improve the overalleconomic situation in the Republic  to curb rampantinflation and restore economic growth.Reforming the structure of the Secretariatdepartments dealing with social and economic matters andconferring new functions on the Economic and SocialCouncil are  in our view  logical elements of thecomprehensive reform programme proposed by theSecretary-General.At the same time  it is obvious that reform will notproduce the best results if the finances of theOrganization are not put into good order. Given this fact we understand the proposal for the establishment  as atemporary measure until the Organization’s financialsituation is on a solid basis  of a Revolving Credit Fundwith initial capital of up to $1 billion financed fromvoluntary contributions or other means that MemberStates may wish to suggest. In this connection we alsofully support the Secretary-General’s proposal to open adevelopment account.We are also firmly convinced that reforming thepersonnel policy of the United Nations should be aninseparable part of the reform. We are deeply concernedby the fact that even today Azerbaijan is still notrepresented in the Secretariat.In recent years the world has been overwhelmed bya wave of extraordinary situations resulting from armedconflict  natural disasters and economic crises. As a9consequence of these situations millions of people have losttheir homes  been deprived of food and basic livingconditions and have become refugees and displacedpersons. This issue is of particular relevance to Azerbaijan as refugees and displaced persons in the Republic are indire need of emergency humanitarian assistance. Recently several regions of Azerbaijan suffered flooding as a resultof continuous rainfall  which inflicted serious damage onthe economy and the people. Azerbaijan greatly appreciatesthe humanitarian activities of the United Nations aimed atprotecting and saving the victims of armed conflict andnatural disasters.We fully endorse the idea contained in the Secretary-General’s report that humanitarian actions today extendbeyond the mere provision of relief and also entail earlywarning  prevention  advocacy and rehabilitation as well asassistance for transition to long-term development. At thesame time we hope that structural changes — such as thecreation of the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinatorto replace the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and themobilizing of its efforts to deal more effectively withcomplex emergencies — will not result in a decrease inhumanitarian assistance for single recipient countries thatare faced with the consequences of armed conflicts  foreignaggression and occupation and that have hundreds ofthousands — even millions — of refugees and displacedpersons.This also applies to the suggested reforms of theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  of whoseExecutive Board Azerbaijan is a member. We believe itnecessary to maintain the independence of UNICEF in theareas of fund-raising and contacts with donors to ensurecontributions for funding the programmes of theorganization and accountability to donors with regard tohow the funds are spent. We consider it important that thespecialized agencies continue to have specific goals andmechanisms to achieve those goals. At the same time wesupport the proposals regarding a common starting point close coordination and interaction  and the adoption ofmeasures to avoid overlap and the dissipation of resources.UNICEF’s mandate includes not only the developmentof children  but their protection and survival. The UnitedNations Children’s Fund  together with such entities as theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees and the World Food Programme  becomesactively involved in saving the lives of children inemergencies. There is an effective mechanism forinteraction between UNICEF and humanitarianorganizations  donors  Governments and local andinternational non-governmental organizations. We hopethat the establishment of the United Nations DevelopmentGroup will not weaken but  on the contrary  strengthenthis function of UNICEF.We support the idea of common premises for UnitedNations missions at the country level  to be called “UNHouse”. This would certainly encourage closer and moreeffective interaction between specialized agencies andUnited Nations programmes. As for ResidentCoordinators  we believe it would be expedient to selectthem from representatives of all interested organizations.A mechanism such as rotation should be worked out forthis. We also support the idea of convening jointcommittees and consecutive meetings of relevantexecutive boards.On the eve of the twenty-first century  it is high timeto consolidate the efforts of all countries for a resoluteattack on crime  drug abuse and terrorism. Organizedunderworld groups that enjoy access to sophisticatedtechnologies and weaponry are challenging law and orderas well as economic  political and other institutions  notonly in individual countries but in entire regions andthroughout the world. The United Nations must be at theforefront of the battle to curtail the activities of suchgroups. At the same time  we need to ensure that theefforts of the international community are centralized ifwe are to succeed in crushing crime and drug abuse. Inthis context we support the idea of uniting the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme with anew Centre for International Crime Prevention to createa new Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention  tobe located in Vienna.Ensuring human rights remains one of the mostimportant of the Organization’s fields of activity. It isespecially urgent today when the issue of human rightspermeates all aspects of public life and is equally relevantto all countries and all regions of the world. Human rightsare closely connected with political  economic  social andother processes. The events of recent years havedemonstrated that expansionist actions on the part ofsome States  aggressive separatism and economicdifficulties deprive States of their ability adequately todefend and ensure the human rights of their citizens. Thatis why the United Nations will have to strengthen itsactivities  exposing and neutralizing the factors that leadto human rights abuse. We approve in particular of themeasures recommended by the Secretary-General withregard to existing or potential conflicts or post-conflictsituations affecting human rights.10We believe it right to suggest that the issue of humanrights must be considered to an equal degree in all foursubstantive fields of the Secretariat’s work programme:peace and security  economic and social affairs development cooperation and humanitarian affairs. In thecontext of enhancing the work of the Organization’sdivisions in the field of human rights  we commend theconsolidation of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for HumanRights into a single Office of the High Commissioner. Thiswill strengthen that entity and lay the groundwork for moreefficient use of available human and financial resources.The Secretary-General’s report “Renewing the UnitedNations: A Programme for Reform” (A/51/950) is acomprehensive and far-reaching set of changes aimed atoverhauling the Organization. The quintessential idea of thereport that reform should constitute a continuous and steadyprocess  not a quick fix  is of particular significance.In conclusion  I would like to point out that thesuggested measures and recommendations are aimed bothat creating new structures of leadership and managementand at harmonizing the activities of all bodies of the UnitedNations."
"12",451,"BDI",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of Burundi  which wehave the distinguished honour to lead in the work of thissession of the General Assembly  and on our own behalf allow us first and foremost to extend the friendlygreetings of the President of the Republic of Burundi Mr. Pierre Buyoya  as well as those of the Governmentand all the people of Burundi.The delegation of Burundi is delighted at theunanimous choice of the President of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly. His lofty  moral andintellectual qualities  his long and rich diplomaticexperience and his in-depth knowledge of the currentconcerns of the planet no doubt augur well for a ringingsuccess in his term of office. Our country offers him itsfull support.At the same time  we would like to extend oursincere congratulations to his predecessor  AmbassadorRazali Ismail of Malaysia  who so brilliantly conductedthe work of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly.We would also like to pay enthusiastic tribute toMr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the United Nations for his continuing tireless efforts to promote the ideals ofthis world Organization.Thanks to the institutions and bodies of the UnitedNations system  millions of refugees and personsdisplaced or scattered in the wake of internal conflicts national disasters and other emergency situations havebenefited from substantial humanitarian assistance particularly in Africa. The Great Lakes region hasreceived special attention in this regard.Aside from peacekeeping and humanitarian reliefoperations on the African continent  it is important tounderscore and welcome the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa. I would like to take thisopportunity to launch an appeal to all our bilateral andmultilateral partners to mobilize the necessary resourcesfor the financing of this Initiative  whose fundamentalimportance for the development of Africa is obvious.For four years Burundi has been going through anunprecedented crisis that has been marked by numerouscrimes and acts of genocide. Aside from the blindextermination of hundreds of thousands of human lives armed groups have attacked the economic  health educational and administrative infrastructures of thecountry. In short  the political change that occurred on 2526July 1996 took place just in time to save the country fromgenocide and nightmare.Contrary to what a certain sector of internationalpublic opinion would have us believe  the vast majority ofthe population of Burundi welcomed the new direction ofthe country with great enthusiasm and relief. New hope wasborn with this change of political regime.The results in the area of security were immediate.Aside from certain areas of insecurity related to sporadicattacks by armed groups  peace and security have returnedto almost the entire national territory. But the populationremains vigilant because terrorist bands have not yetdisarmed. Essentially  they use the territory of Tanzania tolaunch massacres against women  children  men and theelderly.These repeated attacks are at the source of thedisplacement and regrouping of populations. TheGovernment has never decreed any regroupment policy.While the camps of displaced persons have not attractedparticular attention  the so-called regroupment camps havestirred controversy in certain circles of international opinionthat have been exploited and misinformed by terroristgroups such as the National Council for the Defence ofDemocracy (CNDD).Today these centres of the dispossessed are graduallybeing closed. Day by day  people who have been displacedor regrouped are returning to their villages of origin whensecurity conditions permit. A recent report indicates that inless than a month there will practically be no regroupedpersons in the country’s central provinces  which were themost affected.We must  however  recognize that problems persist. Atthe humanitarian level the afflicted people live in deplorableconditions. Overcrowding  lack of sanitation  malnutrition lack of health care and all sorts of epidemics are the dailyplight of the dispossessed.My Government wishes to place on record its realappreciation for all the support of our bilateral andmultilateral partners to relieve the misery of these deprivedpopulations. We appeal again to the internationalcommunity to increase humanitarian assistance to theafflicted populations in order to meet their food  health andclothing needs. In order to ensure the reintegration of thevictims  the Government appeals for assistance forreconstruction and economic recovery.In the context of its vast social reintegration effort the Government of Burundi invites all Burundi refugees wherever they may be  to return voluntarily to theircountry. It is prepared to welcome them with open armsand in conditions of complete security and dignity. Iwould like to take this opportunity to request theassistance of neighbouring countries  in particularTanzania  as well as of international organizations such asthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  to facilitate the return of our exiled brothers. Inthe past year more than 160 000 Burundi refugees havevoluntarily returned to their home provinces.Since the political changes of 25 July 1996  theprincipal objectives of the Government of the Republic ofBurundi have been to ward off the spectre of genocide  torestore State authority  to organize a peace process basedon dialogue  to reintegrate afflicted people  to rebuild andrevitalize the economy and to democratize institutions.At present the great majority of the Burundipopulation is determined to work to restore peace. This iswhy the widespread genocide that was foreseen  andbegan  has been contained and stopped. I can today affirmin all certainty that this danger has been averted. To thedismay of certain prophets of doom and apocalypse  theBurundi nation has not fallen apart either. The peaceprocess under way in Burundi is aimed precisely at layingthe foundation for a lasting peace.Since the beginning of this year the Government hasinitiated throughout the country a series of workshops inpreparation for a genuine national debate  with the goal ofleading the Burundi people to discuss frankly all thecountry’s problems. The governmental team is nowengaged in speeding up the peace process  and severalinitiative have been taken in this regard. A round tablebringing together all the internal actors has just takenplace in the centre of the country. It is in this context aswell that the Burundi peace conference  originally plannedto take place in Geneva under the auspices of the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) from 30 June to 2 July 1997 was held atUNESCO headquarters from 26 to 28 September 1997.Some 50 Burundi political actors  along with about 30international observers  took part in those meetings.That conference was designed to involve all theBurundi people  at home and abroad  in political dialogue taking into account different political and socio-professional leanings. Even those who chose the route ofviolence participated in that forum in great numbers. That27event thus marks an important step in the Burundi peaceprocess.Despite the visible difficulties  the Government ofBurundi is determined to negotiate with the various actorsin Burundi — including the armed factions — withoutexception. Thus  the phase of the peace negotiations thatcould not be held in Arusha on 25 August 1997 asoriginally planned — as a result of difficulties connected tothe mediation arrangements — are going to be resumedvery shortly. Consultations are under way on this matter and  true to its programme  the Government will participate.In this context  I would like to recall that myGovernment asked for a postponement of the 25 August1997 meeting only so that it could better consult with itspartners  improve the mediation arrangements and find alocation more amenable to dialogue  outside of Tanzania.After that postponement the President of the UnitedRepublic of Tanzania called for a summit of the Heads ofState of the region in Dar es Salaam  which was held on 3and 4 September 1997.The Government of the Republic of Burundi  whichwas not invited  expresses its regret that it had no role inthat summit. It considers that at these meetings devotedentirely to the Burundi conflict its presence is indispensableso that it can provide information and explanations that willenlighten the Heads of State of the region  in the interest ofpeace in Burundi.The Burundi peace process must involve dialogue andnegotiation among the Burundi people. At the conclusion ofthe talks  a negotiated transitional government will be putin place to lead the country in the direction pointed by theBurundi people themselves. The ultimate objective is to putin place democratic institutions that all can trust.The Government of the Republic of Burundi againexpresses its concern regarding the mediation arrangementsand the host country for the mediation. No process can leadto peace in Burundi if it is not developed in cooperationwith the Burundi people and carried out with their completeagreement. It is thus imperative that there be greaterconsultations between the mediator and the Burundi people— in particular with the Government that is charged withleading the country and that has the weighty responsibilityof extracting it from crisis.To increase the confidence of all the parties in themediation and to follow the universally recognized rules forsuch undertakings  the Government of the Republic ofBurundi believes that the mediator must be supported byother personalities and by experts in the techniques ofconflict resolution — people who have no personal stakein the Burundi problem.The Burundi peace process will remain stalled  ifTanzania — the mediating country  the host country ofthe mediation — having taken over the Burundi Embassyin Dar es Salaam  continues to play the triple role of hostcountry for the armed factions responsible for thegenocide in Burundi  promoter of sanctions againstBurundi and overweening mediator.The objection of the Government of the Republic ofBurundi to the holding of the talks in Tanzania is thuseasily understood. It is based essentially on the tensionthat has been created by the refugee camps that Tanzaniahas set up all along its border with Burundi. Many ofthem are armed  and from them deadly raids are regularlylaunched on Burundi territory. This tension has beenexacerbated by the hostile campaign waged by theTanzanian authorities in several African capitals preciselyon the eve of the opening of the talks  originally set totake place in Arusha on 25 August 1997.Further  the Government of the Republic of Burundidoes not understand why the fifth summit of the Heads ofthe State of the region requested it to halt the processnow under way. Such a halt would unleash disorder andpublic insecurity in the country. No Burundi citizen wouldbe able to understand how the judicial system couldpunish minor infractions while at the same time it wasunable to try cases of political assassination and acts ofgenocide. The halting of legal proceedings under way andscheduled is thus unacceptable. The ideal is to assureeach defendant a just and fair trial in which the right toa defence is guaranteed. The Government has alreadymade a commitment to do all it can to that end  and wethank the United Nations for its assistance in this area.In this regard  the establishment of an internationalcriminal tribunal for Burundi  which the Government ofBurundi has requested of the United Nations  is nowurgently needed  both to combat impunity and to give thepeace process now under way a chance. Under no pretextwhatsoever should any criminal  nor anyone responsiblefor genocide  be shielded.It is clear that the Burundi peace process is beingheld back by numerous constraints.28My Government’s efforts to restore peace and securityhave been compromised by the completely unjust andillegal blockade that has been maintained by neighbouringcountries since 31 July 1997. Paradoxically  the supportersof these inhumane economic sanctions claim that they wishto restore peace in Burundi. However  those who know mycountry know that it is poor and landlocked and has beenbeset by almost four years of war.To support sanctions by word and by deed istantamount to killing more children and more disastervictims through hunger  disease  poverty and war. Noneighbouring country should adopt such a stance  especiallywhen we take account of the concern that my country hasalways shown for its neighbours when they were confrontedwith the same problems.The measures to mitigate the economic sanctionsagreed in Arusha last 16 April have not been implementedin their entirety. Difficulties remain  particularly in respectof air transport and the supply of humanitarian fuel. Howthen  under these circumstances  can we speak of mitigationwhen the released goods cannot reach their beneficiaries?From this rostrum  my delegation calls once again onthe neighbouring countries in the subregion responsible forthe blockade to please lift these inhumane and degradingsanctions immediately. It strongly urges the internationalcommunity to do everything in its power to make thesecountries understand the pressing need to lift these unjustsanctions  which only impoverish the poorest and enrich therichest — measures that ravage the most vulnerable sectorsof society.I should like to remind the Assembly that myGovernment has already met all the demands made by thecountries of the subregion  which served as a pretext for theimposition of the sanctions. These include the restoration ofthe National Assembly and of the political parties and thecommencement of negotiations with the rebel army.Unfortunately  at the risk of hampering the process  eachsummit gives rise to new conditions. That is why the questfor peace in Burundi often resembles the movement ofSisyphus’ stone.My country  moreover  continues to be confrontedwith repeated border attacks by armed terrorist groups thatare based in a neighbouring country  Tanzania. Thesecriminal bands recruit in camps housing Burundi refugeesalong the common border  in flagrant violation of theGeneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.Some of the rebels are based 15 kilometres from theBurundi-Tanzania border. From there  it takes but a stepto infiltrate Burundi. In that one little step  they canmassacre — as they did last April — several innocentBurundi people.In the face of this situation  my Government urgesthe United Nations firmly to condemn these terroristorganizations and to bring pressure to bear on thosecountries receiving them to separate genuine refugeesfrom tribal terrorist groups.In order to promote the necessary communication inthe context of a political dialogue  we ask Tanzania onceagain to liberate the Embassy of Burundi in Dar EsSalaam in order to facilitate diplomatic relations currentnegotiations and the settlement of the question ofrefugees.The Great Lakes region is experiencing anunprecedented crisis. One of the main reasons for thisupheaval is doubtless the problem of refugees. The spiralof violence that is engulfing our subregion has prompteda vast trans-border movement of peoples fleeing warfareand insecurity in their country or origin. Some areinnocent people who fear for their physical security  butsome belong to criminal groups. Faithful to its policy ofdialogue and concertation  the Government of theRepublic of Burundi will spare no effort to initiatecontacts with its neighbours in order to explore togetherappropriate ways and means to resolve this situation. Thegoal of this endeavour is to work together to restore aclimate of security on our common borders  in keepingwith our tradition of good-neighbourliness.Africa is currently facing numerous challenges. Alow rate of economic growth; intense demographicpressures; a decline in agricultural production; thecontinuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid — theresult of new alliances; the burden of debt servicing; andsocio-political conflicts — these are the many pitfallsalong the path to Africa’s development. Our continentwill never achieve its development if it does not meetthese challenges  which is why my country resolutelyfavours consolidating regional and subregional entities which would represent a crucial stage for progress inAfrica. In this connection  we welcome the System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa  launched officially on 15March 1996. We firmly support and encourage thisambitious programme  which was set up to support ourcontinent in its development efforts.29Our continent  Africa  is doubtless one of the mostturbulent areas on the planet. The efforts to democratizepolitical institutions on which so many hopes were pinnedhave  regrettably  experienced dramatic setbacks as a resultof factors linked with ethnicity  a lack of preparedness anda lack of flexibility.With respect to the Great Lakes region  Burundiwelcomes the positive changes occurring in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  as they can contribute to improvingthe political situation and promote trade throughout theregion. We can therefore only encourage this friendly andbrotherly country to move ahead. We also urge theinternational community to support it.Rwanda  our neighbour  is making a great effort atstabilization and reconciliation. International solidarity vis-à-vis this country should also be encouraged.At the same time  it is deplorable to note that Congo(Brazzaville)  a brotherly country  has also been the site offratricidal confrontation. In that context  we welcome theefforts made by the President of Gabon  His ExcellencyMr. Omar Bongo; by the Special Representative of theSecretaries-General of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  Mr. MohamedSahnoun; and by other mediators  national and international in their efforts to find a negotiated settlement to the Congoproblem.My Government encourages our Angolan brothers andsisters to complete the implementation of the Lusaka peaceagreements.Following a protracted conflict  Liberia hassuccessfully organized democratic elections with the supportof the international community. We wish that country peaceand stability.In the Middle East  the deadlock of the peace processbetween Israel and Palestine can be overcome only if hard-liners on both sides show greater flexibility.My Government has taken note of the report of theSecretary-General on the reform of the Organization.Insofar as it seeks greater efficiency and strives formobilizing means not to maintain a hefty administration butrather to achieve the goal of international solidarity particularly in the area of development  my Governmentsupports that reform.My delegation shares with the Secretary-General hisconcern for efficiency and economy: efficiency in anadministration that is streamlined  and efficiency in effortsto combat poverty as well as in efforts at capacity-building  particularly in the area of development.With respect to Security Council reform  myGovernment supports the provisions taken in the contextof the last OAU Summit  which met in Harare Zimbabwe. The terms of the common African positionhave recently been communicated by the Chairman of theOAU in this forum. Moreover  the developing countriesmust be properly represented in the Council. Beyond thequestion of representation  my delegation is convincedthat reform of the Security Council must above allinvolve its methods of work and its adaptation to therequirements of today’s realities.In keeping with our position as stated during thissession of the General Assembly  my Government firmlysupports the establishment of an international criminalcourt that would be entrusted with prosecuting andpunishing persons responsible for genocide  crimesagainst humanity and war crimes.Despite the many difficulties that my country Burundi  has faced since the national tragedy of October1993  it has always sought to be present at the annualsessions of the General Assembly of our Organization.This assiduous presence attests to our unfalteringattachment to the lofty ideals promoted and defended bythe United Nations. Despite the political and economiccrisis exacerbated by the blockade abusively imposedupon my people  the Government of the Republic ofBurundi has been able to remit an amount of $116 000dollars since April 1997 as its contribution to the regularbudget of the United Nations. Despite the difficulteconomic climate  Burundi will do its utmost to continue to the extent that it is able  to honour its commitmentsand to support our Organization.Before concluding  I should like once again to recallthat Burundi is resolved to emerge from this crisisaffecting our country  and will do so through dialogue.The sooner the next session is programmed  the better.We hope that the obstacles that prevented the meeting of25 August 1997 will be overcome.My country supports the principle of expanding theSecurity Council  but the methodology which will beadopted to that end is of decisive importance. We hopethat all this reform will imbue the United Nations system30with the youthful vitality and energy necessary to redressthe shortcomings of the past  to consolidate theachievements of the present and to lay solid and promisingfoundations for the beginning of the next millennium."
"13",498,"BEL",52,1997,"﻿At the outset  allow me to take this opportunityto congratulate Minister Udovenko  our colleague fromUkraine  on his election as President of this session ofthe General Assembly and to express my most sincerethanks to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia for theinvaluable work he helped us achieve during the fifty-first session of the Assembly.It is clear that the way in which we organizeourselves as a world community is of the utmostimportance for questions of war and peace  poverty andwealth  and justice and injustice in the world.The United Nations Secretariat and the leadership ofour Organization have a key role in this regard. All thoseserving United Nations institutions deserve our gratitudefor the way in which they carry out their work  both herein New York and in the field  often in precarioussituations in which some have even lost their lives.But we should ask whether we  the Member States have done enough to find common responses. Have wegiven the United Nations the necessary tools forcomprehensive management? Have we not blamed theOrganization for a lack of success in some of itsendeavours  when they may have been doomed to failureanyway because there was not enough support fromMember States?We must be fully aware that  as Member States  wesometimes try to impose tasks upon the Organizationwhich are beyond its capabilities  while we are all toooften slow to provide help and support whenever andwherever it is really needed. More than once we haveseen — in Africa  for example — that the UnitedNations has had to spread itself too thinly over vastdistances and that adequate support for a UnitedNations role has not been forthcoming from MemberStates  which has weakened the United Nations abilityto react when a dynamic response was needed in crisissituations.Has not the time come  during this session  toensure that the Organization can act with renewedvigour and reconfirm its authority? I am convinced thatthe answer to this question should be positive  and thatwe should  like the President of the European Unionand other previous speakers  throw our full weightbehind the Secretary-General's proposals to prepare theOrganization more effectively for the comingmillennium.More efficiency and coordination  greater cohesionand better cooperation between Headquarters andagencies in the field are minimal changes  but fullyjustified. However  we need to do more because thisyear we must resolve the United Nations financialcrisis.It is unacceptable that Member States should notpay their dues in full and that they attach conditions tothe payment of what they owe. All the speakers in thegeneral debate should be able to proclaim from thisrostrum not just that they want to improve theOrganization's efficiency and that they support theSecretary-General in his efforts to that end  but alsothat their contributions have been paid in full unconditionally  thus proving their commitment to thegoals of the United Nations and our common agenda.There can be no doubt that this agenda includesthe achievements of the 12 United Nations conferenceswhich  from the 1990 World Summit for Children tothe 1996 World Food Summit  have paved the way forthe current agenda in the area of internationaldevelopment. But responsibilities have often beendistributed injudiciously and too widely  while mandateshave proved insufficient. A more integrated approach inthe social and economic sector has in any case becomenecessary. I therefore welcome the fact that theSecretary-General’s proposals for reform pay particular29attention to development  and I subscribe fully to hisproposals.Furthermore  a well-balanced expansion of theSecurity Council should be achieved without delay.Belgium  together with a number of like-mindedcountries that share the general concern with regard tostrengthening the authority of the Security Council  hasclearly stated its views here in New York. We advocatean increase in both permanent and non-permanentmembers  greater regional representativeness  enhancedCouncil efficiency and a limitation of the right of veto.The right of veto is incompatible with the generalinterest. It should be possible to modify thedecision-making mechanism so as to avoid recourse tothis instrument  which has become entirely obsolete.Belgium also pleads for more transparency and closercooperation between the Security Council and countriescontributing to peacekeeping operations.Such organizational and financial reform cansucceed only if it can rely upon a team of officials whosee themselves as being at the service of the Organizationand of the common good. Ultimately  an Organizationreformed along these lines and better able to meet globalchallenges will have to strengthen its ties with andcomplement regional organizations  not only in thepolitical field but also at the social and economic level. Itwill not be possible to make our world more humanewithout the joint effort of all international organizationsin support of a global approach. In this effort  the UnitedNations  together with regional and specializedinstitutions  is a beacon of hope for millions of people.Strengthening the United Nations also meansstrengthening its ties with other organizations andassociations so that they can keep pace with the overallreshaping of our Organization and of our world vision.I should like to provide two examples. With regardto its policy on Africa  Belgium again stresses the needfor an objective approach on the one hand andaccountability on the other. The approach that we wish topromote is based on universal principles  the mostimportant of which is that of human rights sustained bymutual respect based on equality. It is high time that weprogressed to true mental decolonization. Effortsoriginating in the region itself should be given everychance to prosper and should be fully recognized by theinternational community. As for Central Africa inparticular  our common efforts should give priority to thereconstruction and democratization of the Congo  in theinterests not only of that country and its people  but ofstability in the Great Lakes region as a whole.On the other hand  in certain areas  such asEastern Slavonia  United Nations “blue helmets” havesucceeded in separating warring parties  protectingpopulations and preparing for reconstruction. It istherefore the responsibility first of the partiesthemselves and then of the international community tomake every effort to prevent these achievements fromslipping away. By extension  this is also true for theregion as a whole. With regard to Eastern Slavonia inparticular  it is important for the activities of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe tobe based on the accomplishments of the United NationsTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and for suchactivities to be inspired by and based upon UnitedNations experience in the region.I should now like to focus on anothercontemporary issue: disarmament. Needless to say weapons of mass destruction should be forbidden. Butthis is also true for weapons whose sole purpose is todestroy human beings  such as anti-personnellandmines. In Angola  Bosnia  Afghanistan  Cambodiaand elsewhere  these indiscriminate and cowardlyweapons kill some 9 600 people and maim another14 000 every year. They kill and mutilate more peoplethan all the weapons of mass destruction put together.It is high time that these devices were banned. Inless than two years the objective of a total ban onanti-personnel landmines has met with a positiveresponse in most parts of the world. Belgium  whichwas keen to play a leading role in this field  fullysupports this objective. As chairman of the internationalconference on a total ban on anti-personnel landmines which took place in Brussels in June  I myself notedthe existence of the political will necessary to achieve aban by the end of 1997.The recent conclusion in Oslo of the negotiationson a legally binding instrument means that most of uswill be able to go to Ottawa in early December to signthis important treaty. My country made a great effort toensure that we produced a strong legal instrument  withno exceptions or reservations  and we also advocatedthat assistance to landmine victims should be anessential part of this convention. Belgium is pleased tonote that this international humanitarian standard willsoon become a reality and invites all other States to30join in the effort. It is also my firm hope that States willnot wait for the treaty to come into force before theyhonour this total ban.Humanitarian tragedies will continue to occurthroughout the world. Whatever their origins  crises arebecome increasingly complicated. Still considerable innumber  they create countless victims and immensehuman suffering. Despite greater solidarity and increasedhumanitarian assistance granted by a growing number ofhumanitarian and non-governmental organizations difficulties on the ground have continued to grow inrecent years. Above all  in addition to the problem ofaccess to victims  the lack of security and total disregardfor international humanitarian law and human rightsrequire our particular attention. Indeed  I am especiallyworried about the recent increase in aggression againsthumanitarian personnel. These acts are often carried outwith the sole purpose of blocking their access topopulations who are suffering. It goes without saying thatthe authorities hosting the humanitarian workers bearprimary responsibility for their safety.These authorities must also ensure respect forhumanitarian law  based on values for which a consensusexists within the international community but whoseconcrete application on the ground remains a dailychallenge. This is another task for the United Nations.Existing legal instruments must be strengthened andexpanded in order to extend the same maximumprotection to humanitarian personnel in the field as iscurrently provided for military personnel in peacekeepingmissions. In addition  the directives on humanitarian lawsuch as those proposed by the International Committee ofthe Red Cross should also be revitalized and thoroughlyexamined.Our Organization is increasingly confronted withcrises that require global responses comprising not onlytheir humanitarian dimensions  but also their military economic  political and social dimensions. In thesecircumstances  humanitarian organizations must not onlycontinue to ensure a thorough coordination of theassistance delivered  but also develop stepped-upconvergence between  for instance  United Nations BlueHelmets involved in peacekeeping missions andhumanitarian workers.Greater interaction and cooperation between them isimperative if we wish to devise an integrated and suitableresponse to the ever more complex crisis situations facingthe international community.I believe that much remains to be done in order toimprove and develop such cooperation: for example joint planning for crisis situations  training  definingroles and mandates and  finally  implementation andfollow-up of operations.We must bear in mind that humanitarian assistancemust never be used for mere political purposes  and itcannot by itself be intended to provide a lastingsolution to a conflict. Humanitarian assistance shouldtherefore never be a substitute for political  diplomaticand military action.In this context  Belgium  in close cooperation withthe International Committee of the Red Cross  intendsto organize next year  an international seminar preciselyon the relationship between humanitarian  political andmilitary actions. The focus will be on interactionbetween humanitarian  political and military actors insituations of crisis. This will be an opportunity toanalyse closely the often widely varying approaches tothis problem.The objective of international humanitarianassistance is not only to guarantee the survival ofvictims of humanitarian tragedies. It should also helpthem be reintegrated into society. Viewed in thisfashion  humanitarian assistance is an important factorin the protection of human dignity  human rights andhumanitarian law. The international community musttherefore put an end to the impunity of personsresponsible for grave violations of internationalhumanitarian law  whether committed againstpopulations or humanitarian personnel.The creation of the ad hoc tribunals for theprosecution and punishment of such violations and thenecessary creation of a standing international criminalcourt  are important steps towards the fulfilment ofthese goals.However  it is essential that these internationaljudiciary bodies should be given a fair chance to carryout their functions. Thus  their legal competence shouldbe firmly established and recognized by all MemberStates.Respect for human rights has become an essentialyardstick of the legitimacy of the exercise of Statepower and is increasingly considered a vital part of acountry’s international status and influence. It has31become the new basis for the confidence we bestow onour fellow Member States.Next year the General Assembly will devote part ofits session to the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights.That Declaration  without any doubt  is one of themost important texts of our times. It is the foundation ofthe whole array of standards that came after it and thathave been incorporated into a number of internationallegal instruments. It is also the bedrock upon which restall United Nations activities aimed at better respect forand promotion of human rights  in accordance with theCharter.In the spirit of the Vienna World Conference onHuman Rights  a growing number of Member States  infull exercise of their sovereignty  have acceptedinternational commitments by ratifying those humanrights instruments. However  I should like to express thehope that Member States will also spare no effort inhaving their provisions implemented. By so doing theywill contribute to the universality of human rights.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remainsan inexhaustible source of hope for all those who aredeprived of their rights  especially the victims of social political or economic exclusion or exploitation on thebasis of their race  origin  religion  sex or any othergrounds.Consequently  I  fully subscribe to the Secretary-General’s stated intention to integrate human rightshorizontally throughout the full range of United Nationsactivities. Belgium reiterates to the Secretary-General itsfull support in this respect.Let me conclude by saying that my country willmake every effort — nationally  regionally andglobally — so that the commemoration of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights will be a resoundingsuccess that reflects the capital importance of the event."
"14",543,"BEN",52,1997,"﻿As Itake the floor on behalf of the delegation of the Republic ofBenin  I would like first to associate myself with the wordsof congratulations and deep appreciation expressed to Mr.Hennadiy Udovenko by previous speakers. They spoke soeloquently that I will confine myself to saying how hopefulI am that this session will benefit from his provencompetence and his remarkable analytical mind in order todraw from our debates constructive conclusions thatpreserve a just balance between the different suggestionsand recommendations contained in the various statements.The particular significance and nature of this sessiondo not reside only in the impressive gathering of leadersfrom 185 Member States. That has long been customary and has even become ritual  during this period every yearsince the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.What confers on this fifty-second session a distinctivecharacter  and what promises it an excellent place in theannals of the United Nations  is the central focus of itsagenda  which  as we all know  is devoted to structuralreform.What is our assessment of the specific reformprovisions that are to be discussed and decided upon in thecourse of these meetings? What are the ins and outs ofreform  the issues at stake and the real objectives? Are thereforms capable of giving the Organization the means forproductive and effective action to meet the complexproblems and numerous challenges on the horizon of thenext millennium  whose effects are already strongly felt inthe everyday realities of today’s world?These are a few of the major concerns of countries such as mine  that are today experiencing both hope anddoubt: hope based on the enormous potential of our Earth whose intelligent  rational and well-directed use shouldmake it possible to ensure the progress  prosperity anddevelopment to which all peoples legitimately aspire; butalso doubt  a feeling of stubborn and profound uncertaintyconstantly fuelled by misery and poverty  ignorance anddisease  technological lags  and the economicbackwardness that over 1.5 billion human beings sufferfrom.Since his election in January 1997 our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has resolutely tackled  withcommendable diligence  strength and motivation  thepreparation of a programme for reform  which he himselfrightly describes as“the most extensive and far-reaching reforms in thefifty-two year history of this Organization.”(A/51/950  Letter of Transmittal  first paragraph)It is reform aimed at giving the United Nations“the ways in which the United Nations can moreeffectively and efficiently meet the challenges thatlie ahead as we enter a new century  and a newmillennium”. (ibid.)We regard as appropriate the global approach takenby the Secretary-General  his view of general and sectoralproblems  the thrust of the measures and solutions headvocates  in accordance with a methodology thatcombines pragmatism and the need for democratic andmore effective functioning. Therefore  the delegation ofBenin is in favour of the bulk of the proposals in thereport.Nonetheless  I must draw attention to the followingconsiderations to which my country attaches greatimportance.First  Benin believes that it would not be appropriateto eliminate the Committee for Development Planning which is  inter alia  entrusted with developing theperformance criteria for the least developed countries. Webelieve that rather than having it replaced by groups ofexperts created by the Economic and Social Council weshould consider purely and simply retaining theCommittee.Secondly  since the situation in Africa is one of thepriorities on which the Secretary-General would like tofocus in the next five years. My country would hope thatthe Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa and LeastDeveloped Countries might be strengthened in terms ofhuman and financial resources in order to be better ableto play a full role within the United Nations system.25Thirdly  although on 20 June 1997  following overthree years of negotiations  the General Assembly adoptedthe Agenda for Development  it is regrettable that theSecretary-General’s reform programme made no mention orexplicit reference to mechanisms and means forimplementation and assessment of the Agenda. Mydelegation hopes that this question will be taken intoaccount in the framework of measures envisaged in orderto bring about the renewal of the Organization.Lastly  I would like to anticipate the results of oursession by saying that  both individually and collectively we must firmly commit ourselves to implement thedecisions and measures that will be taken in the frameworkof this long-awaited reform.Our consensus will be not a triumph for the ideas ofone State or group of States over another  but  rather  thefruitful result of a shared political resolve to adapt ouruniversal Organization to the changes and developments ofthis end of the century period.Here  and with specific reference to reform of theSecurity Council  Benin strongly recommends that thefollowing principles should be taken into account: anincrease in the membership of the Security Council trulyreflecting the political and economic configuration oftoday’s world; equitable geographical representation of thefive regional groups  with the African group entitled to fourseats  two permanent and two non-permanent; andprotection of democratic and transparent functioning ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto.By formulating the 15 priority objectives of his reformprogramme as a series of profound changes of major scopewhich should enable the United Nations to embarkresolutely on a course of radical reform  the Secretary-General produced a document of undeniably high quality whose title — “Renewing the United Nations” — issignificant in more than one respect.Given the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entireinternational community for the future of the planet  theOrganization certainly needs to be renewed in order toconfront effectively and successfully the exciting yetdisturbing challenges posed by globalization. Renewing theUnited Nations requires a new vision of the world  newconceptions and approaches to partnership among nations and new methods for the Organization and for handlingrelations among States in a new world. That is the realproblem. Those are the real stakes at a time when we areinexorably approaching a new millennium. Globalization isboth a phenomenon and a process; it has become therecurrent and omnipresent theme of all debates and of allconcerns.Like other members  I noted with particular interestthat President Clinton — first at the Waldorf Astoria hotelon the evening of 21 September  then the following dayin this Hall — forcefully and germanely stressed the needfor the United Nations to ensure that the globalization ofthe economy does not create deep disparities between richand poor and that it establishes innovative partnershipsbetween the private sector  non-governmentalorganizations and international financial institutions.As the representative of a least developed country Benin  I cannot but welcome this great and noble idea imbued with generosity  pragmatism and a spirit ofsolidarity. But  looking the facts in the face  what do wesee?When on 18 December 1991 the General Assemblyadopted the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s  it created a newpolitical covenant  one of whose vital features was theprinciple of shared responsibility and the internationalcommunity’s full and complete involvement with Africawith a view to achieving development objectivesincluding a real growth rate of at least 6 per cent perannum in gross domestic product  and a minimum nettotal of $30 billion in official development assistance for1992  with an annual increase averaging 4 per centbeginning in 1993.Today  six years after the adoption of the NewAgenda  in spite of all the efforts of African countries tomake better use of official development assistance  and inspite of the express intention of a number of developedcountries to support the development of Africa  the totalvolume of official development assistance to Africa hasdeclined considerably: by about one third compared withthe forecast of $30 billion.It was in this context of the decline in officialdevelopment assistance that the famous United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa was launched inMarch 1996 in order to lend fresh momentum to the NewAgenda. But it is obvious that this great initiative can besuccessful only with the support of the internationalcommunity  through a massive mobilization of financialresources to carry out the programmes and projects thathave been set up. While  to be sure  it is first andforemost up to the African countries to make the greater26part of the effort  the excessively restrictive procedures andconditionalities for the granting of loans  and the lukewarmreaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancellingthe foreign debt of poor countries  are obstacles to theeffective mobilization of the expected financial resources.In a publication issued at Washington just a fewmonths ago  in May 1997  the International Monetary Funddefined globalization as“the growing economic interdependence of the entireworld caused by an increase in the volume and varietyof transborder transactions in goods and services  andin international capital flows  along with the rapid andbroad dissemination of modern technology”.Welcomed by some  feared by others  globalizationhas become an unavoidable economic reality for all nations.For most experts and other analysts  this process marks thesuccess of the global spread of an economic liberalizationthat began in Europe half a century ago with the MarshallPlan. In their view  it brings unprecedented possibilities tobillions of people all over the world.For us in Africa  that optimistic vision needs to betempered  for possibilities are not realities. So that it canbecome a reality  the harmonious pursuit of theglobalization process  in the context of real development forall those billions of people throughout the world  especiallyin Africa  necessarily presupposes a new internationalprogramme of solidarity and cooperation for the poorcountries  without which globalization will very soontransform their regions into a poor and marginalizedperiphery of a hyper-rich and hyper-developed world.In fact  the developed countries are already doing agreat deal for Africa  if we consider the sum total of theloans made to the continent through bilateral andmultilateral assistance. And yet  contrary to what statistics curves  graphs and growth rates would have us believe African populations have not yet felt any tangibleimprovement of their standard of living in their daily lives.In spite of all this  for the immense majority of Africansthe will to survive is stronger than despair  and hopeprevails over resignation.The ministerial meeting of the Security Councildevoted to Africa  held on the commendable initiative ofthe United States last 25 September  led to a fruitfulexchange of views that showed us a real will on the part ofthe international community to become more actively  moresignificantly and more concretely involved in a new type ofpartnership with Africa in order to contribute to itsdevelopment.The signs of this real readiness on the part of thedeveloped countries have proliferated in recent years  aswe can see  inter alia  from the resolutions of the G-7adopted in Lyon and in Denver  assistance programmes ofthe eighth European Development Fund  PresidentClinton’s initiative for a partnership for economic growthand opportunity and the Tokyo International Conferenceon African Development (TICAD I)  and so on.All in all  it can be said that the will exists to helpAfrica emerge from poverty and underdevelopment  thatconcrete actions are being undertaken in this direction andthat new commitments are being made. Nevertheless there still remain  unfortunately  enormous problems  andAfrica continues to present to the world the desolatespectacle of endemic poverty  aggravated by crises andfratricidal conflicts.In order to put an end to this distressing situation Africa’s development partners should envisage acomprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible operational and effective financing  free of bureaucraticimpediments and red tape  with the aim of establishing acentralized funding entity to receive resources from allsources to be devoted to economic and socialdevelopment.The end of the cold war  the process of economicglobalization and the progressive realization of theconcept of sustainable development offer the opportunityfor profound change  calling into question some of thetraditional solutions and conventional answers todevelopment problems.In the dark centuries of the slave trade  Africacontributed blood  sweat and the toil of its strongest armsto the building of the bases of the economy of the NewWorld. The collective memory of humankind must notforget this important historical fact. Today the developedcountries have the moral duty to be as concerned asAfricans themselves about the destiny of Africa  not toabandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and tomake available to it part of their enormous material technological and financial strength  in order to supportAfrica’s efforts in the struggle to emerge fromunderdevelopment and to enter the modern age.In order that the implementation of the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in27the 1990s (UN-NADAF)  the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa  Agenda 21 and otherprogrammes of action can be truly successful  it will benecessary to establish a global system of operations andfinancing for Africa  like the Marshall Plan  whichcontributed greatly to the reconstruction and economic andsocial recovery of Europe after the Second World War. Theestablishment of this mechanism before the year 2000 willmake it possible for Africa to stride confidently  not slouch into the twenty-first century.Shortly before the statement that was made on 5 June1947 at Harvard University by General George Marshall todefine the foundations of his well-known EuropeanRecovery Programme  President Harry Truman stated:“Our duty is to help free peoples to fashion their owndestiny in their own way. I believe that our assistancemust be first of all economic and financial  becausethis is essential to economic stability and politicalorder.”Fifty years later  this magnificent and noble spirit ofsolidarity  displayed voluntarily by the great Americanpeople and its Government  still retains all its validity andall its historical meaning.There are cases in which  because of the requirementsof its own unfolding  history repeats itself. Here at the endof a century  we are experiencing one such case: it isnecessary to meet the urgent need for a new Marshall Planfor Africa. And the upcoming second Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development (TICAD II) couldprovide one of the best opportunities to do so.If the international community works resolutely in thisdirection  we will have laid the solid and indestructiblefoundations for a road on which we will all be able tomarch triumphantly into the third millennium.For its part the Government of Benin  while awaitingthe fulfilment of that hope  has developed the concept of ashared social minimum level in order methodically andeffectively to take actions and measures aimed ateliminating poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy providing adequate housing  guaranteeing productiveemployment  improving standards and conditions of livingand ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources. Thisconcept was the subject of an international symposium supported by the United Nations system  which was held inCotonou from 4 to 6 August 1997.The consolidation of our process of democraticrenewal  which began after the historic NationalConference of the Active Forces of the Nation inFebruary 1990  necessitates immediate and short-termsocial and economic successes. That is why we areendeavouring  with our limited resources  to takemultifaceted actions to improve the living and workingconditions of our rural and urban populations. However we know that we can rely on international cooperation founded not only on solidarity  but on mutual interest andpartnership  to overcome the difficulties confronting us  tosupport our efforts at economic and social recovery  tobuild a State genuinely based on the rule of law and toconstruct a free  democratic  modern and prosperousnation."
"15",589,"BFA",52,1997,"﻿Sir  your rich experience in the United Nationssystem  your country — Ukraine — your currentresponsibilities and your personality assure us of thecompetence and dedication with which you will fulfilyour mission as President of the fifty-second session ofthe United Nations General Assembly.We would like to extend our most sincerecongratulations and our gratitude to your predecessor Ambassador Ismail Razali of Malaysia  for a full  hard-working and stimulating fifty-first session. We reiterateour encouragement and support to the Secretary-General 22Mr. Kofi Annan. We also wish to commend the workwhich he and his team have accomplished in only ninemonths.Last Thursday  25 September  the Security Councilissued a statement on the situation in Africa  in which itsaid:“The Security Council reaffirms the responsibility ofall Member States to settle their international disputesby peaceful means and its own primary responsibilityfor the maintenance of international peace and securityin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.”(S/PRST/1997/46)Burkina Faso shares this vision. Together with otherAfrican countries  it has become involved in subregionaland regional initiatives with regard to our brother countriesof Liberia  the Central African Republic and Burundi  toname only a few. Burkina Faso  whose confidence has beenstrengthened by that experience  reaffirms the inestimablevalue of preventive diplomacy. We therefore support anyaction designed to achieve that end  and call upon theUnited Nations to develop a genuine conflict-preventionpolicy. From north to south and from west to east  AfricanStates have been taking action on a continuous basis and ina variety of ways to deal with armed conflicts  politicalinstability and internal disorder in our continent.Africa is daily demonstrating its clear determination tosolve its own problems as a matter of priority by creating among other things  a Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution. Having made the maximumregional contribution  therefore  to the resolution of theseproblems  it wonders why the Security Council seems notto be responding. Where does the Security Council’s chiefresponsibility lie? The worst thing that could happen to theOrganization would be for Member States to begin tobelieve that our common institution has two differentyardsticks. Our statements and appeals would then nolonger be of any value  and our possible actions would beaffected  and weakened.The purposes enshrined in the United NationsCharter — peace and security and economic and socialdevelopment — can only be attained  consolidated andmaintained by means of justice within nations  justiceamong nations and  therefore  justice throughout the world.The task is enormous. The justice demanded would notimply the end of the influence of power  but it wouldindicate whether such influence was positive or negative.With regard to disarmament  we must reaffirm thenecessity of working towards the elimination of weaponsof mass destruction  whether nuclear  chemical orbiological.In Africa  the illicit traffic in small arms has hadnew and increasingly uncontrollable consequences ranging from an increase in armed criminal acts to theproliferation of armed refugees. This provokes and addsto the instability of entire regions. My delegation wouldlike to know what has become of the follow-up to theSecretary-General’s initiative under resolution 51/45 L onassistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic in smallarms and collecting them.Burkina Faso welcomes the results of the Osloconference on anti-personnel landmines  and urges allStates to adhere as quickly as possible to the Conventionadopted in Oslo  and above all to comply with its terms.Burkina Faso remains concerned by all situations ofturmoil  instability and conflict  from Afghanistan and theformer Yugoslavia to Cambodia.The illusions harboured after the end of the cold warare now giving way to a contrasting vision in which thefactors of integration and disintegration in our world arebecoming clearer. In Africa  the tragedy in Somalia hasbeen followed by tragedies in the Great Lakes region andthe Republic of Congo  while the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo is now embarking  with some hesitation  uponthe road towards restoration. In Liberia  elections finallyallowing that country to recover  too  and to contemplatethe colossal task of national reconstruction are takingplace. However  in the neighbouring country of SierraLeone constitutional order has been violated and flouted.Burkina Faso reaffirms its resolute condemnation ofthe interruption of the democratic process in Sierra Leoneas well as its adherence to decision 356  on the situationin Sierra Leone  taken by the Heads of State orGovernment of the Organization of African Unity at itsthirty-third summit meeting in Harare.We welcome the significant advances made inAngola and urge all the parties  especially UNITA  toplay a constructive role.In the Middle East  Burkina Faso is concerned aboutthe repeated setbacks to the peace process and calls onthe parties to ensure that acts of provocation do not create23a deadly chain of violence that would go against theinterests of the peoples of the region.The international environment is undergoing a processof constant change under the combined effect of threephenomena: globalization of the economy and of threats;liberalization of markets; and the information andcommunications revolution. While we welcome the creationand consolidation of large economic and monetarygroupings throughout the world  the upheavals created byglobalization and the demands of a triumphant free-marketmodel illustrate the fragile nature of the successes achieved and show more clearly that moderation and justice are thebasic requirements.Africa  like a patient being cared for on his sick-bed has heard and heeded the diagnosis and the suggestedremedies  including programmes  projects  agendas andspecial initiatives. This continent  which is engaged in aconstant struggle  is achieving some results that run the riskof being wiped out by globalization  in that its internationaltrade is continuing to decrease as a result mainly of outsidefactors  further increasing its marginalization.Developing countries expect the Agenda forDevelopment  adopted during the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  to be a catalyst for a new globalpartnership for development. The sincerity of thecommitment of each and every one of us will be judgedaccording to the effectiveness of its implementation. In thisregard  and on all economic and environmental issues  wesupport the comments made on behalf of us all byTanzania  which holds the presidency of the Group of 77.Burkina Faso  together with other Member States  hasasked for consideration of the need to review resolution2758 (XXVI)  which excludes from the United Nations theRepublic of China on Taiwan. In doing so  Burkina Fasohas no intention of violating the rights of another MemberState. It merely asks that  given the new context  the realityof the Republic of China be acknowledged. This reality isdemonstrated by the many and various relations that theRepublic of China has in one form or another with mostStates. A review would do justice to the 21.5 millioninhabitants while work goes on to resolve the matter by thereunification desired by both sides.While we continue to call for respect for human rightsand respect for freedoms  there is still concern that it hasnot yet been possible to implement a position that theGeneral Assembly has affirmed and reaffirmed  year afteryear. The principle of freedom of trade is overtly beingviolated  and Cuba  a Member State  is the victim.Burkina Faso believes that the international communitymust continue its efforts to convince all the partiesconcerned that since the embargo and obstacles to freetrade have not yet resolved the dispute  new constructivepaths must be explored.Similarly  along with the current Chairman of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  Burkina Fasoaffirms the need to find a solution to the dispute betweenLibya  the United States and the United Kingdom withregard to the Lockerbie tragedy. As well as the sufferingsof the families of those who perished  many other peopleare continuing to suffer from the sanctions imposedagainst Libya. The Organization of African Unity hasalways expressed its concern at the unremitting sanctionsimposed on Libya and their humanitarian consequencesfor its people  and has advocated a fair trial of thesuspects pursuant to accepted principles of justice andinternational law. With the OAU  Burkina Faso hopes thatthe Security Council will give due attention to theproposal made jointly by the Organization of AfricanUnity and the League of Arab States with a view tofinding a just and equitable solution to the crisis.Speaking of the Security Council  a permanentmember of the Council used the formula that it is farbetter to support a proposal for change backed by a largemajority than to support a status quo that enjoys thesupport of almost no one. Such reform is now a necessitywith regard to which Africa has developed a commonposition. Africa  which was absent in 1945  intends togain recognition for its right to a place in the SecurityCouncil  in which most of the matters dealt with areAfrican. Two permanent seats and some non-permanentseats would represent the beginning of justice for acontinent which  along with Latin America  has nopermanent representation. Burkina Faso believes that theenlargement of the Security Council  while includingJapan and Germany  must necessarily provide equitablerepresentation for Africa  Asia and Latin America.In addition to the Council’s composition  itsfunctioning must also be reviewed. The future SecurityCouncil must no longer be a body that behaves all toooften like a club for the privileged; rather  it must behavelike an institution imbued with the highest responsibilitiesand aspirations for the benefit of all  withoutdiscrimination. Without that understanding  reform will befutile.At the fifty-first session  I concluded by saying:24“We are now seeing that the State is surrenderingcontrol over certain elements of its sovereignty.Everywhere  structures and organizations with varyingdegrees of legality are transcending States andestablishing transnational networks and relations. It istherefore imperative that we keep pace with thesetrends and adapt now and in the future our specialinstrument  our common instrument: the UnitedNations at the service of peoples. Political will is whatwill make the difference.” [Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fifty-first Session  PlenaryMeetings  20th meeting  p. 24]Earlier today  speaking of the globalization of theeconomy  I also mentioned the globalization of threats. Ihad in mind poverty  environmental deterioration  terrorism drug trafficking  pandemics and  in general  the greatdisasters caused by man or by nature.The United Nations is in this regard an irreplaceableand invaluable tool. We thank and most warmly commendour brother Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  who  in thespace of nine months  has produced proposals designed tokeep us all in step with the times and future challenges. Inour quest for peace  security  progress  prosperity andjustice  the Secretary-General is proposing that we defineand redefine the instrument of our solidarity and ourcommon condition. Burkina Faso will join wholeheartedlyin this exercise and will support any movement that canlead us to development  which is one of the cardinal pointsof our quest and a platform on which all of the UnitedNations essential missions can come together: themaintenance of international peace and security  thepromotion of justice and international law  the strengtheningof cooperation for development  the protection of humanrights and humanitarian assistance.While we welcome and applaud the generouscontribution a wealthy individual has made to the UnitedNations  we must also remind all States that theircontributions are a fulfilment of solemn and voluntarycommitments. Contributions to the budget must be made infull  on time and without conditions. This is also part of theneeded reform.The developments we are witnessing are profoundlycontradictory. The future is marked by pairs of opposites —integration and disintegration; stability and instability;wealth and poverty; health and incurable disease; theopening and closing of borders; democracies anddictatorships; inter alia. They  it is said  are the very stuffof life.The pendulum swings from optimism to pessimismand then back again. To stop it as it swings towardsoptimism  we will need  as never before  to see to it thatthe international community can find and cultivate thevirtues of inclusion and justice  for otherwise we will seedevelop before our eyes  to an increasing degree  a worldof cruel and pitiless violence.The United Nations is our chance for a world ofhope  justice  peace and progress. Let us seize thischance."
"16",632,"BGD",52,1997,"﻿It affords me greatpleasure and honour to convey to you  Mr. President  onbehalf of my delegation  as well as on my own behalf  ourheartiest congratulations on your unanimous election. It isa fitting tribute not only to your outstanding diplomaticskills and long involvement with the United Nations  butalso to your country  with which we enjoy friendlyrelations.To your predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  I should like to express our sincere appreciationfor the remarkable job that he did. His was anextraordinarily proactive presidency. Indeed  he has givennew stature to the office of President of the GeneralAssembly.This is the first regular session of the GeneralAssembly for our Secretary-General Kofi Annan since hisappointment to that high office. In the discharge of his veryonerous responsibilities he brings to bear unmatchedexpertise with regard to the United Nations system. Indeed he is the archetypical insider of that system. Hisappointment to the highest Secretariat position isrecognition of his manifest competence. The priority that hehas attached to the task of making the United Nationssystem more streamlined and attuned to present-dayrealities and requirements is indeed commendable.While on the subject of reform  let me say that mydelegation lends its full support to the initiative of theSecretary-General in submitting his reform proposal  whichthe Assembly will be examining later in the course of itsbusiness. There is no denying that the proposal is timelyand that it has been put forward to make the UnitedNations more efficient and effective. We expect that thereform process will preserve and promote the centralityand sanctity of the principles and objectives of the UnitedNations Charter. My delegation also wants the process ofreform to be carried out with the primary objective ofstrengthening the capacity of the Organization to addressissues of development. Bangladesh would favournegotiating the reform package in informal plenarymeetings with the full participation of all countries.The United Nations Charter is of enduring validity.By definition  reform has to be a dynamic and periodicprocess as times  problems and priorities change. Mydelegation would fully support any endeavour to improvethe administration and management of the United Nations.Member States have the right and even the duty to insistthat optimal use be made of the resources that they haveentrusted to the Organization for the promotion of theCharter objectives. Bangladesh assures its unstintedcooperation and support to eliminate duplication andoverlap and to effect better coordination and prioritization.However  reform cannot be an acceptable surrogate forpolitical will  and those two aspects must be mutuallysupportive and reinforcing.In the context of the reform exercise  Bangladeshwould like to stress that the exclusively internationalcharacter of the responsibilities of the Secretary-Generaland his staff should in no way be compromised.According to Article 101 of the Charter  the higheststandards of efficiency  competence and integrity shouldbe the basic determinants in making appointments to theSecretariat  with due regard to geographical distribution.We therefore welcome the Secretary General’s proposalto submit a code of conduct for international civilservants.No endeavour at United Nations reform will besuccessful without the necessary financial resources. Thecontinuation of the current financial crisis of the UnitedNations has seriously impaired the functioning of theOrganization. For a financially sick United Nations  themuch needed shot in the arm can come only from the fulland unconditional payment of outstanding contributionsby those Member States that have not yet done so.The cold-war era of adversarial alliances  powerblocs and ideological divides is happily a thing of thepast. However  another war  one in which the United4Nations will have to be in the vanguard  remains to befought and won before a meaningful peace and internationalsecurity can be achieved. That is the war against poverty ignorance and prejudice.Peace does not simply happen or come aboutfortuitously. It must be sedulously built and nurtured andunderpinned by a host of interrelated actions that areinextricably linked to development and human security. Aculture of peace is essential to make it sustainable and allembracing. Over the years  the concept of security hasevolved  as has the concept of development. The UnitedNations can be  as the President of the General Assemblyput it last year  the main development catalyst  one that canstrongly influence coordination at the macro level withother bodies that have more access to resources but that areless democratically set up.We have been discussing for the past few years thequestion of Security Council expansion and reform. Thereis a clear logic and rationale for an expansion of the overallsize of the Council to make it more representative incharacter. On this aspect of the question a generalconsensus seems to have emerged  although there existdifferences as to the exact size of any new Council. Wherea convergence of view — let alone consensus — continuesto elude us is on the question of the expansion of thenumber of permanent seats. Bangladesh’s concern  whichwe have already articulated  is that  in any enlargementexercise  the concerns of the smaller and more vulnerableStates that have the most vital stake in an effective anddynamic United Nations should not be lost sight of.In the decade of the 1990s we have had a series ofhigh-profile global conferences. These mega-conferenceshave addressed some of the major challenges that areconfronting us today and  with the United Nations playinga central role  reached important political consensus. Thosegatherings underscored in particular the primacy of humandevelopment in achieving sustained and sustainabledevelopment.The Agenda for Development adopted in June thisyear is in a sense the culmination of this series representing a synthesis of the plans and programmes ofaction that had been adopted. The Agenda is the result oftortuous and painstaking negotiations carried out over aperiod of four years. It is a matter of gratification to haveachieved a development consensus that was so badlyneeded and clearly warranted. It is  of course  most vitalthat  along with the Agenda for Development  follow-upand implementation should match the outcome of theseconferences.Bangladesh believes that without the fullinvolvement of civil society this process will remainincomplete. Recognizing the key role of civil society inpromoting global partnership  we welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal for a people’s millennium Assemblyin the year 2000.It is now widely accepted that free enterprise  themarket economy  international trade and competition  aswell as broad-based public participation in economicexpansion  are the keys to economic growth and humandevelopment. To this mix must be added the componentsof democracy  good governance and the rule of law. This however  in no way diminishes  particularly in the case ofthe least developed countries  the imperative of asupportive external environment. Improved access toworld markets  greater inflow of foreign privateinvestment  transfer of technology and managerial know-how and larger external assistance all have very importantroles to play in ensuring development. Economicliberalization should invariably be combined  in our view with adequate social safety nets to safeguard the mostvulnerable segments of society.It is a matter of some concern to us that globalofficial development assistance flows continue to slump.We sincerely hope  though  that this trend will bereversed. The development of the South is not only aninvestment in peace and security  but would clearly alsorebound to the advantage of the countries of the North inthe long and not so long run  since this would meanbigger markets for their exports  with all theirconcomitant benefits. Development has been most aptlydescribed as a partnership.The plight of the least developed countries  inparticular  calls for very careful consideration and has inthe past merited a special place and focus in theinternational agenda. Two major international conferenceson the least developed countries have been held in the1980s and 1990s and important decisions and programmesof action adopted. The implementation of these  however has been disappointing. We hope that the third UnitedNations Conference on the least developed countries canbe held in the year 2000 to chart the course of globalsupport for these weakest members at the start of nextmillennium.5We would urge special consideration and concessionsfor the least developed countries in order to enable them tomeet World Trade Organization deadlines. Indeed  if thesituation so warrants  deadlines may even be made flexiblefor that group of countries. We would also urge that  at theforthcoming high-level meeting in Geneva next month  allmajor issues of concern to the least developed countries including duty-free access of their products to foreignmarkets  be given most favourable consideration.The end of cold war perhaps naturally raised ourhopes for a new and exciting world order in which nationswould share the responsibility for freedom and justice andthe strong would respect the rights of the weak — a worldof open borders  open trade and open minds. Such a visioncan and should surely be our goal and inspiration. Toachieve it  in particular at the regional level  cooperation incarefully identified core areas of activity  including tradeand investment  is a valuable tool of development.In our own region  through the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  we arestriving to accelerate progress in core areas of cooperation such as poverty eradication  expansion of regional trade andinvestment. We have also  within the ambit of SAARC launched a “growth quadrangle” involving four memberStates — Bangladesh  India  Nepal and Bhutan — in orderto explore areas of joint economic activity and takeadvantage of the factor of contiguity. Moreover  outside ofSAARC  Bangladesh has entered the Bangladesh-India-SriLanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIST-EC) in orderto boost cooperation in the economic and commercial fieldsamong its four member countries. A consensus decision hasnow been taken to allow Myanmar to join this subregionalgroup as a full member.Last year  while addressing the General Assembly  Ireferred to the negotiations that were being held with Indiaon sharing the waters of the Ganges River. This had provedto be an intractable problem for over two decades and it isa matter of great satisfaction to us all that  in December lastyear  we signed a 30-year treaty at the highest politicallevel with India on sharing arrangements. The signing ofthis treaty  within months of the present Government’sassumption of office  demonstrated that  given goodwill andpolitical will  the most difficult problems can be resolved.At the national level  we are affording every facilityand cooperation to our private sector and providing liberalincentives to foreign entrepreneurs to invest in our country.The Government’s role will be to oversee and to providesafety nets where necessary. The Government is makingevery effort to combat the blighting scourges ofwidespread poverty and deprivation  so that we mayrealize the dream — to which the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  dedicated hisentire political career and life — of a country free progressive and prosperous  at peace with the world andwith itself.Ours has also been a pioneering role in the field ofmicrocredit. Initiated by the Grameen Bank andconsidered a most innovative approach to the eradicationof poverty and empowerment of women  it has beenrecognized and emulated in a good number of developingand developed countries. The Microcredit Summit held inWashington earlier this year was a success: a target wasset there to free 100 million families from thestranglehold of poverty by the year 2005. At the UnitedNations  the “Friends of Microcredit” ambassadors havetaken the initiative to follow up the implementationprocess throughout the United Nations system.In Bangladesh  we have accorded priority to andplaced special emphasis on social sector development insuch areas as health care  education  family planning women in development and the preservation andpromotion of human rights. The initiatives and efforts ofour Prime Minister in this regard have been widelyappreciated. I would particularly mention here that theGovernment  under the dynamic leadership of PrimeMinister Sheikh Hasina  the illustrious daughter of theFather of the Nation  has announced the decision to set upa National Human Rights Commission. Our Parliament isexpected to pass the required legislative mandate for thisCommission next year. We are also working towards theestablishment of grameen  or rural  courts  which willtake justice to the people at the grass-roots level. Thisconcept of participatory justice is still a novel one. Itspurpose is to ensure speedy  effective and inexpensivejustice to the humblest of citizens.While on the subject of human rights  I should liketo express our pleasure that an individual of the eminenceand distinction of Mrs. Mary Robinson has beenappointed United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights. We would like to assure her of the wholeheartedcooperation of our Government. We look forward toworking with her in close concert in the promotion ofhuman rights  a goal that all of us share and cherish  withspecial focus on the right to development and the rightsof women and children.6The Constitution of Bangladesh specifically providesfor our international relations to be based  inter alia  on theprinciples of the United Nations Charter. It is thus for us amatter of singular pride and gratification that Bangladeshshould be playing such an active role in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. This is a role that we consider tobe a solemn duty and an earnest of our commitment to theUnited Nations and the principles and purposes of theCharter.We still have a long way to go in the area ofdisarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. The entryinto force of the Chemical Weapons Convention is a majorstep forward.It is a truism that our world is becoming increasinglyinterdependent. The uncomfortable fact remains  though that it is still a far more dangerous place than that it shouldbe. West Asia  the Palestinian issue  Bosnia andHerzegovina  Afghanistan and the Great Lakes region allpresent problems that impinge on international peace andsecurity. The United Nations  of course  is playing a pivotalrole in seeking peaceful and equitable resolutions of theseproblems.We sincerely hope that the peace process in theMiddle East will move forward and that the years ofnegotiations  investment and effort will bear fruit. Ourviews on this particular issue are well known. RelevantSecurity Council resolutions exist  as do agreementsnegotiated outside the ambit of the United Nations  on thebasis of which a meaningful peace can be achieved in theMiddle East and the legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople  including the right to an independent homeland restored.As we approach the next century  it will have to beour collective endeavour to strengthen and to reinforceinstitutions at the global level that can effectively addressthe problems of the post-cold-war world. The UnitedNations in essence represents the entire human race inmicrocosm  with its wisdom and follies  its successes andshortcomings. It is an experiment  as was once said  inliving together as a single human family. To be sure  theUnited Nations is an Organization of Governments — theapex of intergovernmental organs. And yet it is also truethat its foundations rest on the yearnings of the peoples ofthe world for a lasting peace.The opening words of the Charter read:“We the peoples of the United Nations determinedto save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar”.The peoples and nations of the world will have to workin concert if stability  prosperity and a meaningful peaceare to be achieved on a global scale. Bangladesh  ofcourse  will be at the forefront of this endeavour."
"17",678,"BGR",52,1997,"﻿I would like  first of all on behalf of the Bulgarian delegation to congratulateMr. Udovenko on his election to the presidency of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. His vastexperience and knowledge will be of great importance forthe successful fulfilment of the tasks facing theOrganization today. I would also like to express ourappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  for hiscompetence in presiding over the fifty-first session.The statements of previous speakers have proved theimportance of the necessity for an efficient overall reformof the United Nations. I would like to declare Bulgaria ssupport for the position of the European Union  as stated inthis general debate by the Deputy Prime Minister andMinister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg  Mr. JacquesPoos.The word “reform” has been used so much today indifferent parts of the world that I would be afraid ofclassifying United Nations reform with the various otherreforms advocated by numerous politicians. If I take theliberty of sharing the Bulgarian experience  it is becausein early 1997 my country lived through its genuinereformist resurrection. Hundreds of thousands of citizenswalked in the streets of Sofia and other Bulgarian citiesand towns to demand opportunities  not well-being. Theirvoice precipitated early parliamentary elections andbrought a disastrous rule to an end.Obviously  three things are needed for the success ofreform: vision  strategy and courage. The vision aboutwhere we want to go  the strategy for getting there andthe courage to begin.I hope that the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly will be remembered for decisive progress indesigning and carrying out the reform of the UnitedNations. We have already heard the profound analysis andthe valuable proposals put forward in the report of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. It is now the turn ofthe representatives of Member States to commit theirvision  sense of strategy and courage.Let me briefly present our views on the main aspectsof the reform of the United Nations. The BulgarianGovernment has thoroughly studied the proposals and thereport of the Secretary-General. In principle  we supportand approve of these proposals.The Republic of Bulgaria considers the ongoingdiscussion within the United Nations on the reform andenlargement of the Security Council to be positive andsubstantive. In our view  the decisions on these importantmatters should be reached by consensus. We believe thatthe enlargement should reflect the increased number ofUnited Nations Member States. On the other hand  thegrowing economic and political potential of someMember States may attest to their ability and maturity tosuccessfully assume the responsibilities and meet thechallenges of permanent members of the SecurityCouncil.A fair decision on the enlargement of the Councilshould preserve the balance between the permanent andnon-permanent members  as well as among the regionalgroups. Such a decision should also include the allocationof an additional non-permanent seat for the Group ofEastern European States.We support the efforts aimed at further improvingthe early warning system of the Organization. The newchallenges to international peace and security demand an25enhanced role for United Nations peacekeeping operations.As an active participant in United Nations peacekeepingoperations in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Cambodia Tajikistan and elsewhere  Bulgaria welcomes the growingefficiency of the Security Council and also supports anenhanced role for the Secretary-General in the field ofpreventive diplomacy.Bulgaria shares the view that future peacekeepingoperations should encompass the whole complex ofpolitical  humanitarian and military aspects of peacekeepingin order to achieve maximum efficiency. Close cooperationwith the regional security organizations and other relevantbodies is of key importance to the success of future UnitedNations peacekeeping efforts as well.For years now the United Nations has been operatingunder the burden of a serious financial crisis. Bulgariasupports the initiatives contained in the report of theSecretary-General aimed at elaborating criteria andmechanisms for stringent financial discipline  strict controland accountability. Such an approach could contribute tothe successful implementation of the administrative reformand reorganization of the Secretariat.We believe that a new scale of assessments forcontributions to the United Nations regular andpeacekeeping budgets would allow greater account to betaken of the financial potential of individual Member States.Bulgaria shares the ideas expressed by the Secretary-General that the reform should be implemented within theframework of a complex approach that would not neglectthe specific needs of the countries in transition and thesmaller States.We support the efforts aimed at restructuring thegoverning institutions of the United Nations in the socio-economic field; at raising the operational capacity of theEconomic and Social Council and of the specialized fundsand programmes; and at transferring funds frommanagement and administration to social and economicprogrammes.As Assembly members are probably aware  1997 wasa difficult but successful year for Bulgaria. The beginningof the year was marked by an acute economic  financial andpolitical crisis  which resulted in the appointment of acaretaker government  the dissolution of the BulgarianParliament and early elections. At the same time  thecivilized  peaceful and constitutional way in whichBulgarian society overcame the political crisis is a veryimportant sign of the maturity of democracy in the country.At the elections held last April the Union ofDemocratic Forces won an overwhelming majority fortheir agenda: financial stabilization  market-orientedstructural economic reform and speedy privatization; thestrengthening and modernizing of State administration;rule of law and combating organized crime andcorruption; and the integration of Bulgaria into the Euro-Atlantic community of nations.We have made every effort to implement thisstrategy  and today we already have the first positiveresults. In the political sphere  the transition to the rule oflaw  political pluralism and respect for fundamentalhuman rights and freedoms has been completed. Thedemocratic institutions are stable and enjoy the broadsupport of more than 50 per cent of the people. In theeconomic sphere  a currency board was successfullyintroduced as a means of guaranteeing financialstabilization and of restoring the confidence of theinternational financial institutions and business circles inBulgaria. This has resulted in a radical decrease of theinflation rate and an increase in foreign investment andthe country s currency reserves. The results of thecrackdown on crime and corruption have re-establishedrespect for law and order.Here I would like to point out that Bulgaria attachesgreat importance to the concerted efforts of the worldcommunity in the fight against organized crime andterrorism. We look forward to contributing to the effortsto elaborate the future international convention for thesuppression of terrorist bombings and for the drafting ofa widely accepted text of the statute of the internationalcriminal court.We are also committed to draft regional programmesfor preventing organized crime  international terrorism illicit drugs and arms trafficking  illicit trade in nuclearmaterials and the trafficking of people.The desire of the Bulgarian Government to join theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and theEuropean Union underlies our foreign policy and isoverwhelmingly supported by the Bulgarian nation. Forus  accession to these institutions is an expression of theEuropean identity of Bulgaria and an integral element ofthe political and economic transformation of the country.It is a question of immediate national interest andstrategic priority  a matter of choice of civilization; andnot an issue of politics of the day.26Bulgaria considers the decisions reached at the NATOSummit in Madrid as a historic opening of the alliance tothe new European democracies. We feel strongly that theenlargement should continue as a geographically balancedprocess aimed at achieving equal security and stability indifferent regions; thus the risks of new dividing lines orgrey zones in Europe would be avoided.Our Government is making great efforts to intensifyits preparations for accession to the European Union  witha view to meeting the requirements for membership in thenearest possible future. We strongly hope for a politicaldecision by the European Union to start the negotiationswith all associated countries at the beginning of 1998. Thiswould be a confirmation of the position that all candidatecountries have equal chances of becoming members.Bulgaria considers these integration processes as asignificant contribution to the strengthening of regionalstability and security in south-eastern Europe. TheBulgarian Government is making every effort to promoteEuropean standards of international conduct in this part ofthe continent. Our approach has been backed by a numberof important initiatives at the regional level. Thecooperation between NATO members and partner countriesin the area is an important element in this process  andBulgaria has advanced ideas for an enhanced Euro-Atlanticcooperation on the security of south-eastern Europe and theBlack Sea.Bulgaria will also continue to work actively along thelines of its 1996 initiative for security  stability andcooperation in south-eastern Europe. We attach greatimportance to the coordination of our efforts with the otherinitiatives for cooperation in the region  especially with theRoyaumont process launched by the European Union andthe South-east European Cooperative Initiative  sponsoredby the United States.Our aspiration to non-permanent membership of theSecurity Council for the 2002-2003 period demonstrates ourreadiness to assume responsibilities for peace and securityboth in the region and in a wider international context.As members know  Bulgaria has suffered tremendouslosses as a result of the strict implementation of thesanctions imposed by the Security Council against theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).Combined with the disadvantages caused by the sanctionsagainst Libya and Iraq  the total amount of the direct andindirect costs to Bulgaria is comparable to the country sforeign debt. Therefore  the Republic of Bulgaria willcontinue to attach particular importance to the work beingdone within the United Nations system to address moreeffectively problems related to the implementation ofArticle 50 of the Charter.We welcome the provisions of the General Assemblyresolutions urging the organizations within the UnitedNations system  international financial institutions andother international bodies to continue to address morespecifically and directly the issue of economic assistanceto third States affected by the implementation of thesanctions. I should like to draw the Assembly s attentionto the possibility of granting certain exemptions fromsanctions or creating a preferential regime for the mostgravely affected third States. Naturally  these exemptionsand preferences should be in accordance with the Charter.We believe that the burden of the specific economicproblems created by the sanctions should be fairlydistributed among all third countries and not borne byneighbouring States only.We strongly believe that while negotiating withsanction-affected third countries  the internationalfinancial institutions should take account of the need tocompensate them indirectly.It is our understanding that the United Nationsspecialized agencies play an important role and providevaluable support to countries in their efforts to achievesustainable development. The reforms which are underway in these agencies need the support of the MemberStates. The reform processes in the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and otherorganizations give us hope of success.Bulgaria believes that the activities of internationalforums and bodies for human rights should be aimed atensuring the effective exercise of these rights by everyhuman being. The implementation of internationalstandards could be achieved by improving existingmechanisms and by a constructive and open dialogue onthe most sensitive issues. This approach is not directed apriori against any country or group of countries. In thiscontext  Bulgaria attaches high importance to theguarantees for the human rights of Bulgarians livingabroad and is closely watching the situation of Bulgarianminorities. We consider respect for the rights ofBulgarians in neighbouring States and the relatedimplementation of international human rights standards asan important factor in the promotion of bilateral relations.27The monitoring and the effective control of theimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedomsremains of critical importance  and Bulgaria reiterates itssupport for the efforts of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights. I should like at this point to welcome theappointment of Ms. Mary Robinson to this high post and towish her every success in her activities.The Bulgarian Government regards the possible spreadof weapons of mass destruction and their means of deliveryas one of the major concerns of the 1990s. The existingregimes of multilateral treaties  such as the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the ChemicalWeapons Convention and the Biological WeaponsConvention  provide for basic restrictive norms in this field.The Republic of Bulgaria supports all internationalendeavours to meet the goals of non-proliferation andstands for a further strengthening of these regimes.The Conference on Disarmament is an appropriateforum for negotiations on the elimination of certain typesof conventional weapons. A long-lasting solution should befound to the problem of anti-personnel landmines  the banon which has humanitarian and disarmament aspects andneeds a verification regime. We believe that the text of anew Convention that would ultimately ban all anti-personnel landmines  which was agreed at the OsloDiplomatic Conference this month  could well serve as abasis for achieving a comprehensive and widely acceptedinternational agreement. We also hope that the Ottawaprocess and the negotiations in the Conference onDisarmament will be mutually supportive and will result inan effective ban on anti-personnel landmines.In conclusion  finding an adequate solution to theseproblems will be impossible without the successful reformand restructuring of the United Nations Organization and ofall its bodies. Therefore  we expect a decisive breakthroughin this direction at the present session of the GeneralAssembly. I am personally convinced that by the end ofthis session the United Nations will have changed  and thatthis change will be for the better."
"18",723,"BHR",52,1997,"﻿I have the pleasure at the outset to extend to thePresident and his friendly country  Ukraine  my sincerecongratulations on his election as President of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. In wishing himsuccess in conducting the proceedings of this session  Iwould like to assure him of my delegation's readiness tocooperate with him in making his task a success and inachieving the desired objectives of the session.It is also my pleasure to commend the dedicatedefforts of the President's predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  inpresiding over the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly  and to express the thanks and appreciation of theState of Bahrain to him and to his friendly country Malaysia.I would like to take this opportunity to express theState of Bahrain's appreciation for the tireless and sincereefforts that the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hasmade since his appointment and of the great attention hepays to international issues and  to the reform of theOrganization and strengthening its role in the maintenanceof international peace and security. By virtue of hisextensive experience in the United Nations  he has gainedexpertise in both international politics and the managementof the Organization.I would be remiss in this connection if I did notexpress appreciation for the endeavours of the formerSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and for hisefforts and accomplishments with regard to reform of theOrganization.We do not believe there has been in the history of ourmodern world a period more harmonious with the spirit ofthe United Nations or more expressive of its orientationthan the current period. Had the Organization not beenestablished half a century ago by a farsighted initiative ofthe founding Member States  it would have been incumbentupon the international community to proceed to create itnow  at this important juncture in history. This is becausecurrent international developments relevant to variousaspects of human life require the existence of such anOrganization  which  by its composition and nature  andguided by its Charter  is equipped to handle world affairs in the spirit of one great family. Not a single internationalissue is now beyond the scope of the Organization.The impression that the role of the United Nationshas become marginal or marginalized in the wake of thecold war — true as it might be in certain isolated andlimited situations and cases of international action — doesnot  in our conviction  reflect thoroughly andcomprehensively the current stage of our world's historyor the aspirations of all its States. Such aspirations requirethe existence of a world organization that is active andeffective  not only in political and security affairs  butalso  and increasingly so  in civilizational  developmental economic  environmental  cultural and intellectual affairs.For increasingly  now that they have become the focus ofattention of all nations  big and small  those non-politicalmatters influence world affairs and the life and directionof peoples much more than political matters do.We have followed with interest the work of theGeneral Assembly's Open-ended High-level WorkingGroup on the Strengthening of the United Nations Systemand carefully studied the Secretary-General's report(A/51/950) to the General Assembly  “Renewing theUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform”  which hesubmitted on 14 July. We express our appreciation for theSecretary-General's invaluable efforts regarding thereform process  and the measures and recommendationscontained in his report  and we would also welcome anyGeneral Assembly actions that would reflect the generalattitude of Member States vis-à-vis the reform processthat meets the current requirements and desires ofMember States. My country is both interested in  andappreciative of  the work of the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the Security Counciland Other Matters Related to the Security Council  inview of the great increase in the United Nationsmembership. It should also be pointed out that it is in theinterest of the reform process that the work of theSecurity Council be transparent so that all other MemberStates which are not members of the Council are awareof the latter's proceedings with regard to the reformprocess.Bahrain has presented its candidacy for SecurityCouncil membership for the period 1998-1999 in theelections that will take place during this session  based onthe provisions of the Charter that allow participation forall Member States. The history of civilization has shownus that a number of smaller countries and peoples have not less than the larger nations  taken the lead in progress 12development and creativity. The independent policy whichthe State of Bahrain has pursued throughout the 26 yearsthat it has been a Member of the United Nations  hasqualified its candidacy as meriting the support of the Groupof Asian States for the non-permanent seat allocated to thatGroup.Moreover  Bahrain has a long record of constructiveparticipation in support of United Nations activities and insupport of the rights of peoples to independence  freedomand self-determination  in opposing apartheid and insupporting decolonization. It has also been activelyinvolved in the work of the United Nations system andorgans dealing with the fields of disarmament andeconomic and social development. In addition  Bahrain hasbolstered Security Council efforts in the field ofinternational peace and security  particularly in the ArabGulf region  which prompted the Secretary-General to paytribute to that role to which he referred in paragraph 816 ofhis 1996 annual report on the work of the Organization. Hesaid:“The Government of Bahrain's support for theCommission's [the United Nations SpecialCommission] Field Office has been outstanding andremains essential to the continued logistics lifeline tothe activities of the Commission” (A/51/1  para. 816).Furthermore  the State of Bahrain hosts a number ofUnited Nations regional offices  including  in addition to theUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) FieldOffice  the offices of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Environmental Programme and the United Nations Information Centre.The State of Bahrain welcomes the endorsement itscandidature for Council membership has received from theAsian Group  the Group of Arab States and the memberStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council  to which it belongs.Bahrain  noting the overwhelming support of the MemberStates  will have the pleasure to declare  when elected tothe membership of the Council  that it will do its utmost  incooperation with other Member States  to fulfil its dutiestowards the achievement of international peace and securityand the upholding of the principles embodied in the Charterof the United Nations.Through its experience in its region and larger area my country has played  since the early years of thetwentieth century  a significant and leading role in thedevelopment of civilization  culture and society  inmodernizing management and the economy  and inconsolidating the bases of an advanced civil society — apioneering role to which any objective historian of thedevelopment of civilization in the Gulf region will attest.The question of regional security remains of crucialimportance to the State of Bahrain  in view of thedangerous ramifications and impacts it has on thesecurity  stability and safety of peoples and nations. Thesituation in the Gulf region  which has witnessed in recentyears two devastating wars that have upset the region'speace and stability and delayed the implementation ofnumerous development and construction projects  requiresthat all the States of the region and the world Powerswith vital interests in the region promote and strengthenrelations among the States of the region on the basis ofgood neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interference inthe internal affairs of others and recognition of everyState's national sovereignty.The territorial and boundary claims currentlywitnessed in the Gulf region  aim at changing theestablished and traditionally accepted boundaries disturbing the security and stability of the region. Webelieve that the optimum and most judicious course toavoid that prospect is to respect the status quo; to refrainfrom any claims  total or partial; and to settle anyconsequential disagreements by peaceful means acceptableto the parties to the dispute.Insofar as the situation between Iraq and Kuwait isconcerned  the State of Bahrain  being keen on themaintenance of security and stability in the Gulf region stresses that Iraq should fully comply with therequirements of international legitimacy and uphold itscommitments under relevant Security Council resolutions including those relating to the release of prisoners anddetainees of Kuwaiti and other nationalities. Bahrain isalso keen on ensuring the unity and territorial integrity ofIraq and opposes any interference in Iraqi internal affairs as any such interference is considered a violation of thesovereignty of a Member State of the Organization.The State of Bahrain also expresses its satisfactionthat the oil-for-food agreement between the UnitedNations and Iraq is alleviating the suffering of thebrotherly Iraqi people.In the same context  the continued occupation by theIslamic Republic of Iran of the three islands  GreaterTunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  all of which belong tothe United Arab Emirates  constitutes an important causefor anxiety and concern to the State of Bahrain and the13other member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council  inview of the occupation's serious consequences for thesecurity and stability of the region and the effect it has ongood-neighbourly relations among the States of the region.Consequently  the State of Bahrain calls upon theIslamic Republic of Iran to respond urgently to the calls ofthe United Arab Emirates to resolve the question of theislands through serious bilateral negotiations or through anyother available peaceful means for the settlement ofdisputes through reconciliation among States.The ominous setbacks and impediments that havebeset the Middle East peace process which threaten thatprocess and pose dangers to the entire region are but theresult of Israel's non-adherence to the basic premisesunderlying the process since the Madrid Conference in 1991and to the agreements which emerged from the negotiationsthat followed between the parties concerned. Only throughcompliance with those commitments  which are based onSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and425 (1978)  the implementation of the land-for-peaceprinciple  and refraining from any actions that contravenethose commitments  can there be a viable basis for gettingthe peace process back on its proper track and theachievement of progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracksas well. A just  comprehensive and lasting peace in theregion is not conceivable without the return of the occupiedterritories to their owners and the recognition of thePalestinian people's right to have their own independentstate on their own national soil  with Jerusalem as itscapital.For a just and comprehensive peace to be attained  itis essential that Arab rights be restored  in accordance withthe relevant United Nations resolutions  which call for thecomplete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied SyrianGolan  southern Lebanon and the occupied Palestinianterritories  including  most importantly  Jerusalem.The State of Bahrain has endorsed the peace processsince its inception in Madrid in 1991. It has participated inall the committees that have been established in connectionwith the process and has hosted a meeting of theenvironmental committee. This was in support ofendeavours to achieve a just and comprehensive peace inthe region  which should be the strategic option of all Statesof that region. A just peace which can guarantee thatpeople's legitimate rights are restored is what will ensuresecurity  stability and prosperity for the region's peoples.The continued strife in Somalia has broughtdestruction and devastation to the Somali people. Wereiterate our appeal to all warring factions to implementall agreements reached so far and to exert concertedefforts with a view to reaching a genuine and durablesolution to the problem in order to preserve the unity sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independenceof Somalia. With respect to the situation in Afghanistan we call for an immediate end to the fighting among thesons who belong to the same homeland  for support of theefforts being made to this end  and for the achievement ofnational reconciliation with a view to preserving thesovereignty  territorial integrity and independence ofAfghanistan without any external interference.The State of Bahrain reiterates its support for theDayton Agreement concerning peace in Bosnia andHerzegovina. It calls for full and completeimplementation of that Agreement and for the creation ofconditions that allow for the voluntary return of refugeesand displaced persons in complete safety and security.Such steps would enhance national reconciliation and helppreserve peace and stability in the region as a whole.As we reiterate our support for the unity independence and territorial integrity of the Republic ofCyprus  we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-Generalaimed at the achievement of a just and practicablesettlement in accordance with relevant Security Councilresolutions.The international arena has witnessed terrorist actswhose repercussions have gone beyond the boundaries ofthe countries concerned. Violence has become so rampantand ferocious that it is possible to say that terrorist actsconstitute crimes against the world order  the vitalinterests of nations  the peace and security of humanityand the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.The spread of terrorism has caused the death of hundredsof innocent people and the destruction of public andprivate property  thus shaking internal stability andimpeding the normal development of relations betweenStates. Consequently  my country calls upon theinternational community to seek the best possible waysand means for the elimination of all serious crimes of aterrorist nature.In this connection  the State of Bahrain expresses itssupport for the provisions adopted by the GeneralAssembly in its relevant resolutions 49/60 and 51/210 and hopes that the international community will cooperatein the elaboration of a strategy for cooperation between14States with a view to combating terrorism and not providinghavens to terrorist organizations. Furthermore  States shouldallow neither their territories nor their media to be used  northeir civil liberties systems to be exploited  to the detrimentof other States.Bahrain  being a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  is of the view that theTreaty should achieve universality without anyconsiderations or exceptions restricting it. At the same time it would like to stress that the Treaty  as a vital pillar forthe maintenance of international peace and security  shouldbe upheld  its provisions respected and its purposes pursuedtill fulfilment. It considers Security Council resolution984 (1995)  albeit limited in terms of safeguards  a firstpositive step towards the achievement of comprehensivesecurity safeguards for all non-nuclear-weapon States.Because it believes that international cooperation isessential for ridding our world of all weapons of massdestruction  the State of Bahrain ratified last April theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction. Convinced of the importance ofpeace  stability and mutual confidence in the Middle East it has also endorsed the initiative aimed at establishing theregion as a zone free of nuclear and all other weapons ofmass destruction.The world economy is currently experiencing a periodof growth which  according to the estimates of this year'sWorld Economic and Social Survey  is expected to reach3 per cent this year. An observer of the economicconditions in developing countries  however  can perceivethe extent of the difficulties faced by those countries intheir endeavours to raise their economic level to the bareminimum and so enable their citizens to live with dignity.The close link between economic development and socialdevelopment has become a cornerstone of the security andstability of societies  both in developing and developedcountries. Yet the rising social tensions that we witness innumerous societies in developing countries  emanating fromeconomic problems  underlines the need to address and dealwith that phenomenon at the international level.When developed countries contribute to thedevelopment of the economic systems in developingcountries they do not  in so doing  merely assist thosecountries; they also enable the developing countries tobecome an effective economic partner  which can assist thedeveloped countries in combating the scourge ofunemployment  inflation and economic stagnation.The inability to strike a balance between social andeconomic issues and the preservation and management ofthe resources needed for development  coupled with anincreasing emphasis on environmental protection  hasundermined development  a cornerstone of Agenda 21 which was adopted by the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro in1992. It is therefore imperative that internationalagreements reached and commitments made during thatConference be implemented  and that measures to speedup the implementation of the Agenda be identifiedwithout any need to reopen discussions on matters alreadyagreed upon. The issues addressed by the nineteenthspecial session of the General Assembly last June  inwhich Bahrain took part  for the purpose of an overallreview and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 were more detailed and specific in so far as povertyeradication and environmental protection are concerned although the desired results have not been attained.The destructive effects on humanity of drug andpsychotropic substance abuse  production and illicit trafficare among the most serious challenges we face. Wetherefore welcome the convening of a special session ofthe General Assembly in 1998 to be devoted to thisquestion and related crimes and to the achievement oftangible results in relation to the objectives envisaged inresolution 51/64 concerning the negative and destructiveimplications of drug abuse  on the basis of the principleof joint responsibility in confronting the illicit drug trade.Collective measures should also be taken to solve thisproblem  which constitutes a common threat to theinternational community.In the light of the new world realities  the UnitedNations should play a more effective role in providingorganizational frameworks and appropriate forums toenable various Member States to contribute within theircapacities and capabilities to the reshaping of our modernworld  tending towards increased closeness and interactionon various planes of human activity.The current period  characterized by cascadingchanges  requires a joint intellectual vision on the part ofall Member States of the Organization and their peopleswith respect to what should be done for the commongood of mankind and to prepare for it. Such a visionshould transcend visions of conflicting ideologies  whichcharacterized the world of the cold war as well as thepredictions of future clashes of civilizations.15It is also vital that the United Nations create afavourable climate and appropriate management whereby itcan provide  in addition to the basic functions it undertakes a veritable forum for world thought  into which will flowa variety of opinions  emanating from various regions civilizations and experiences. Thus  the Organization mayhelp crystallize an overall human vision conducive tounderstanding  peace and cooperation  rather than asituation in which new adversaries and enemies are soughtfor one side or another.The current period also requires us to bring aboutcohesion and integration among the various elements in theflow of information and satellite transmissions from everycorner of the Earth. The volume of this information isenormous  its sources diverse and its objectives conflicting;it has deluged societies. It is difficult to absorb all thisinformation  and perceptions of it are often confused.Unless a common  comprehensive and inclusive visionis found to restore cohesion and compatibility to this greatmass of information  the world will be threatened withintellectual chaos that could take it back to a time whendisorder and contradictions held sway in mankind's vision.No global mechanism is better suited to be the propermeans and the appropriate international forum for thisuniversal intellectual task than the United Nations. It shouldat this stage provide direction and guidance for all aspectsof international cooperation  both within the framework ofthe Organization and at the regional and national levels.While we look forward to such a comprehensivevision for our modern world  we must stress that it wouldbe prudent not to let globalization — which is a natural andacceptable phenomenon in the context of technology science  production  economic and information systems andthe related material components of our common humancivilization — be imposed  especially through coercion orpressure  on special spiritual  religious  cultural and politicalattributes. If it is  the world will fall into the abyss of futileethnic  cultural and religious feuds. Development of themoral aspects of civilizations and systems can only occurgradually  through inner conviction  and in tandem with thelogical internal development of each structure and systemrather than through technological development that spreadsrapidly from civilization to civilization. Coerced impositionof globalization on any spiritual or moral facet of a society especially through external sources  would constitute awrongful revival of political and cultural colonialism whose cumbersome legacy and adverse effects the worldhas barely eradicated. It is our hope that if it builds on theremarkable role it played in the elimination of the old formof colonialism  the United Nations will be able to play apositive part in steering the process of globalization in theright direction and in preventing the unilateral takeover ofa world of diverse spiritual cultures and civilizations.In view of the Organization's contribution to thepreservation of world peace and security and the role itcontinues to play in support of the causes of peace andjustice and in the implementation of the principles ofinternational legitimacy  its activities in the field ofpreventive diplomacy and peacekeeping operations  andits constructive role in resolving numerous questions andcrises  it is incumbent upon us to make available to theUnited Nations all possible moral and material supportand to cooperate with it and with its specialized agencies.Hence the importance  in our view  of formulatingwithin the framework of the United Nations a balancedintellectual vision which  in addition to bringing outelements which are common to all peoples  would bebased on respect for legitimate pluralism as it relates tospecial spiritual  moral and political attributes. In theabsence of such a balanced vision  our world is apt tocontinue to be threatened with imbalance  instability anda lack of security."
"19",761,"BHS",52,1997,"﻿I join previous speakers incongratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidencyof the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Mydelegation is satisfied that your vast experience ininternational affairs and your proven diplomatic skills willguide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.I wish to assure you of my delegation’s full support andcooperation in the execution of the duties of your office.I also wish to express my delegation’s gratitude andcongratulations to your predecessor  Ambassador RazaliIsmail of Malaysia  who presided over our Assembly duringthe fifty-first session with great vigour  skill and resolve.Having had the honour of serving as a Vice-President ofthat session  I am particularly appreciative of hisnoteworthy contributions.This is my first opportunity in this Assembly toaddress and congratulate our new Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. He is  of course  no stranger to any of us having faithfully served this Organization for so manyyears. We are confident that he has the vision  ability anddetermination to lead the United Nations as it prepares tomeet the challenges of the new millennium. I wish to assurethe Secretary-General of the continued support andcooperation of the Government of the Commonwealth ofthe Bahamas.On behalf of the Government and people of theBahamas  I also wish to pay tribute to our formerSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. TheBahamas particularly wishes to recall and salute his tirelessefforts in seeking to restore financial stability to ourOrganization.Today  I reiterate the Bahamas’ solemn pledge that aswe lead our nation into a new millennium the primaryfocus of our efforts will be directed towards improving thedelivery of health care  education and skills training  areduction in the level of serious crime and unemployment and the eradication of poverty and poor housing. We arecommitted to achieving the full empowerment of womenand equality among the sexes as we work toward theevolution of a society in which our children will live withhope  a society where there is opportunity for all  wherethere is respect for human rights  fundamental values andthe rule of law.Our efforts on behalf of the Bahamian people alsorepresent our contribution towards the collective effortswhich Member States of the United Nations must maketo ensure a safe  stable and productive global society sothat progress  peace and development can be achieved forall the people represented here. We are thereforecommitted to assisting in the much needed reform of thisworld body  so as to enable us to achieve these goals.One of the greatest threats to quality of life and toproductive development worldwide is criminal behaviour.My Government has set as one of its highest priorities thecomprehensive reduction and prevention of crime  in allits forms  including drug-trafficking  money-launderingand illegal trafficking in firearms  and  indeed  in humanbeings. Those who engage in such menacing activitiesrespect no borders. We therefore implore all MemberStates  irrespective of size or might  to recognize that themost effective means of reducing crime at the nationaland international levels is through joint and collaborativeefforts.The Government of the Bahamas supports thestrengthening of the international legal order againstcrime. We also hope that the special session on thequestion of drugs in 1998 will provide new impetus andresolve to combat this particular menace to all of oursocieties.My Government reiterates its call to urgently addressthe growing problem of the traffic in small arms. TheBahamas  neither a manufacturer nor a vendor of arms urges those countries involved in the production and saleof arms to impose stringent control measures and provideassistance to vulnerable States to reduce the threat of thetraffic in arms.Another concern of the world’s nations is theprotection of the environment. The Bahamas recognizesand appreciates that conservation and enhancement of theenvironment are critically important to the well-being ofour people  and especially that of future generations.Consequently  our national planning process incorporatescommunity environmental education and the regularmonitoring and enforcement of laws for the protection ofnatural resources and the conservation of habitats. Indeed during the course of this year  the Government of theBahamas enacted legislation to protect our physicallandscape and prevent the destruction of certain13indigenous trees. The expansion of green and open spacesfor the benefit of the general population is another keypillar in our environmental policy.Tourism is the leading industry in the Bahamas andthe fastest growing industry in the world. We are all aware however  that the development of tourism does not alwaystake place in harmony with environmental protection andconservation. Mindful of this fact  the Bahamas  along withits regional partners  seeks to develop strategies  policiesand procedures which will ensure that the continueddevelopment of the industry is consistent with standards ofenvironmental sustainability. In this vein  the CaribbeanCommunity has adopted a regional position against thetransportation of hazardous and radioactive substancesthrough the Caribbean Sea  a concern previously voiced inthis forum.While the concept of sustainable development remainssubject to further definition  my Government believes thatpoverty reduction and social development can and must beachieved in concert with environmental integrity  economicstability and good health. The proper integration ofdeveloping economies into the rapidly advancingglobalization of world trade will  we believe  mark themeasure of our success in these areas. Regrettably developments over the past decade have not always metexpectations.In spite of the technological revolution of the lastdecade and the rapid increase in worldwide commerce  thebenefits of the globalization of the world’s economy havenot been evenly distributed. Developing countries continueto be marginalized even as the world’s market economygrows at an extraordinary pace.Globalization can offer great opportunities  but only ifit is managed carefully and with more concern for equity morality and indeed compassion. An enabling environmentmust be created for all to take full advantage of the newopportunities created by globalization.The peculiar vulnerability of small islands — theirsusceptibility to natural disasters  their economy’sdependence on primary products  their small human andmaterial resource base — means that small island Stateshave much more at stake in achieving sustainabledevelopment. The Bahamas  therefore  attaches greatimportance to the 1999 review of the Barbados Programmeof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  and calls for the mobilization of externalresources for its further implementation. We are alsopleased to note that consideration is being given by theUnited Nations to the possible development of avulnerability index. We welcome the proposed conveningof an expert group meeting later this year to reviewvarious proposals  and look forward to the completion ofthe technical study now in progress.The development of a mechanism such as thevulnerability index will help to alleviate a concern whichthe Bahamas has repeatedly expressed in this assemblyregarding the persistent use of per capita gross nationalproduct as the major measurement of wealth. It is ourview that this criterion is an inadequate measurement ofdevelopment and is often inconsistent with the principlesof equity.The vulnerability of small island States is painfullydemonstrated in the unfolding natural disaster on theCaribbean island of Montserrat  where volcanic activityhas forever changed the physical  sociological andpsychological landscape. Indeed  the viability of the islandto provide a base for the livelihood and development ofthe people of Montserrat is yet to be determined. We  theGovernment and people of the Bahamas  wish to expressour solidarity with  and pledge our continued support to the people of Montserrat during this particularly difficulttime.We are similarly conscious of the fact that naturaldisasters affect virtually all the Member States of thisOrganization  large and small  developed and developing.In recent times  typhoons in South-East Asia  floods inEastern and Central Europe and in the central states andprovinces of the United States and Canada  andearthquakes in South America  and most recently in Italyand Indonesia  have wreaked untold suffering on millionsof people.As we look towards the twenty-first century  wemust assess how best this Organization can prepare itselfduring the next three years to enter into this new era inhuman history.Since becoming a Member of the United Nations in1973  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has atsuccessive sessions of the Assembly reaffirmed theimportance of the United Nations and has conveyed itscommitment to work with other Member States in pursuitof the principles and objectives of the Charter.In this connection  we congratulate the Secretary-General on the important reform proposals which he has14presented  and we stand ready to participate in theircomprehensive and constructive review during this session.It is the view of my delegation that reform shouldhave as its end result an improved and more efficientOrganization  fully able to meet the demands of theMembers which it serves. At the same time  reform wouldbe meaningless if the Organization were not to have astable financial basis on which to carry out its functions. Itis imperative  therefore  that we find a way to overcome themyriad obstacles that have eluded resolution to date in areassuch as the reform of the Security Council and the financialsituation of the United Nations.The Bahamas strongly urges all Member States tocommit themselves to resolution of the question of SecurityCouncil reform at this fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly. The Bahamas supports the need to expand theCouncil’s membership in both categories. This expansionmust  however  pay due regard to the principles of equalrepresentation  the reflection of the universal character ofthe Organization and the need to correct existingimbalances in the composition of the Council.In a world confronted daily by press reports on thetragedies of failed efforts to preserve peace betweennations — and indeed  between different ethnic and/orreligious groups within nations — it is frequently easy toignore the successes being achieved by the Organization.My Government welcomes the positive work being done bythe United Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. The fact that increasing numbers ofcountries are willing to cooperate with the United Nationsis an indication of how important it is for the Organizationto continue the implementation of its mandate in this area.We note the success stories in areas such as CentralAmerica and also in Haiti  where the mandate of theSupport Mission has recently been extended. It has alwaysbeen the contention of the Bahamas Government that tooearly a withdrawal from Haiti had the potential of derailingthe hard-earned gains made in that country. The continuingand recently escalating arrival of many Haitian migrants inthe Bahamas is a sobering reminder that a setback inHaiti’s difficult march towards political and economicstability could well be destabilizing.The Government applauds the international communityin its successful negotiation of a treaty to ban anti-personnellandmines. Bahamas will sign the treaty and ratify it assoon as possible  and hopes that the Convention willreceive full support  particularly from the developedcountries of the world. The Bahamas fulfilled its promisemade last year to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  and pledges early ratification  in keeping withits commitment to save succeeding generations from thescourge of nuclear war. These  along with other measures bring us one step closer to the total elimination ofweapons of mass destruction.The Bahamas is of the view that the United Nationsshould serve as a pillar of support for the aspirations ofits Member States and as a beacon of hope for thedestitute of the world. Let us therefore resolve to havethis fifty-second session of the General Assemblyremembered as a decisive turning point in the work of theOrganization. It should be remembered as a session whereMember States were able to attain a greater level ofunderstanding  trust  cooperation and a sense of purposeto empower them to deal with the problems affecting theinternational community."
"20",786,"BIH",52,1997,"﻿I amparticularly honoured to have the opportunity to addressthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina.I would like  first  to extend my warmcongratulations to our respected friend and colleague  HisExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  Minister of ForeignAffairs of Ukraine  on his accession to the presidency ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Mr.Udovenko’s rich experience and extensive knowledge ofUnited Nations affairs are telling proof that this GeneralAssembly session has outstanding leadership.The destiny of Bosnia and Herzegovina has beenclosely linked to the United Nations since early 1992 when my country became a Member State. Bosnia andHerzegovina’s struggle to survive as a sovereign statewithin its internationally recognized borders lasted fouryears. We believe we won the major battle in preservingthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country  butwe know we still have a long way to go.The role of the international community and theinvolvement of the United Nations in the Bosnia andHerzegovina crisis were overwhelming. Month aftermonth  the United Nations  led by the Security Council stood firmly behind internationally accepted norms andprinciples in order to make possible a negotiated andpeaceful solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Unfortunately — for subjective and objectivereasons  most of which are well known to all of us — inspite of all the resolutions and decisions the tragedy inBosnia and Herzegovina continued to take what wasprobably the heaviest toll of any modern conflict.The events also proved that the United Nations wasnot ready to deal effectively with what was certainly oneof the most complex crisis in our times. The conflict inBosnia and Herzegovina was  and still is  an important22case study which should be carefully analysed in thecontext of the United Nations involvement mandate and itsrole in crisis situations.But we respect the help and tireless efforts of themembers of the United Nations mission in Bosnia andHerzegovina to help the civilian population survive. I wouldlike to use this opportunity to say that we remember andgreatly admire the members of the international communitywho lost their lives in the peace mission in Bosnia andHerzegovina. We were deeply saddened by the recent tragicaccident which took the lives of 12 brave peace promoters among them the Deputy to the High Representative Ambassador Gerd Wagner.We cannot forget the tens of thousands people whowere killed or wounded  the thousands of missing andhundreds of thousands displaced persons and refugees.Heavy damage was inflicted on the economic  social cultural and other sectors of life in Bosnia andHerzegovina. But ultimately it was the social tissue ofBosnia and Herzegovina that suffered the greatest damage.The striving for national domination  exclusivity andxenophobia  and also autism  have destroyed bridges ofcommunication and have deepened the gap between variousethnic groups.Given that the tragic consequences of the conflictremain  it will require a lot of wisdom  patience and hardwork to overcome the many obstacles in our way. But webelieve that it is time to turn resolutely towards the future.We must use this precious time to rebuild confidence andestablish relations between different ethnic groups andamong all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Theserelations should be based on internationally acceptedstandards and norms of behaviour. In that context thepromotion and protection of human rights is one of the coreissues. Human rights are universally accepted and inherentto all human beings  and they must be respected.Two years after the signatures on the DaytonAgreement stopped the negative current of events andmarked the beginning of the peace process  Bosnia andHerzegovina is facing enormous tasks: rebuilding the war-torn country and simultaneously establishing a democraticsystem of governance and administration. In spite of avariety of problems and shortcomings  we feel that thepositive energy necessary for such an endeavour isaccumulating. Besides the continuous attention and supportof the international community  we need the partiesconcerned in Bosnia and Herzegovina to show additionalpolitical goodwill if they want to see the peace processprogress and lead  ultimately  to results.The legal framework for this exceptionally complexgoal was established in the Dayton Agreement. TheConstitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was drafted taking into account the political reality and using as thepoint of departure the only possible formula: threepeoples  two entities  one state. To make this ratherunique arrangement viable  in accordance with theprovisions of the Dayton Agreement  institutions at thestate level have been established.The Presidency  Council of Ministers and Parliamentof Bosnia and Herzegovina are functioning but they havenot yet reached the necessary optimal rhythm andperformance. This represents a serious obstacle and mustbe overcome without any delay because of its directinfluence on the functioning of the entire State system and on the external relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as on the key development programmes.At the lower level  the system of cantonal power andadministration is taking shape. It encompasses a numberof important duties and activities but also responsibilities since through it equal representation and participation ofdifferent ethnic groups in power-sharing should besecured. This represents one of the pillars of the multi-ethnic  democratic State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.But what is most important is full and unconditionalcompliance with all the provisions of the DaytonAgreement. That must be understood by all those who puttheir signatures on the peace agreements  and those whodo not honour their obligations must face theconsequences. I would also like to say that the successfulorganization of the municipal elections in Bosnia andHerzegovina  held just a week ago  is of greatsignificance. Imperfect as they may be  these electionsrepresent a milestone on our complex and often difficultjourney towards stable peace and in the building of themodern  democratic State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thefact that the elections took place throughout the territoryof Bosnia and Herzegovina  with hardly any problems orany major incidents  demonstrates the readiness of allparties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to comply with theprovisions of the Dayton Agreement.The very fact that the majority of the population inthis war-torn and exhausted country responded in anorderly fashion and presented themselves in largenumbers at the voting stations speaks for itself. It is a23clear signal that they want to take the destiny of Bosnia andHerzegovina in their own hands. It is also a testimony totheir readiness to pursue the noble goal of healing the warwounds and starting to rebuild the bridges of cooperation tolerance and mutual respect.The post-war experience in Bosnia and Herzegovinaunderlines the importance of democratic reforms  theintroduction of rule of law and the administration of justicein accordance with the highest standards  respect for humanrights and the strengthening of public institutions. For atruly democratic society  it is of particular importance toopen the space for free activities of civil society  citizensassociations  various non-governmental organizations andreligious communities. During the elections process  thesignificance of open  objective and truthful informationdelivered by free media was confirmed once again.In order to achieve all of this  the presence of theinternational community is of critical importance. Help andsupport from the various organizations and agencies withinthe United Nations system is invaluable to Bosnia andHerzegovina and we are grateful for it.Socio-economic development and the building of ademocratic State are closely interrelated. Only with properlytargeted help from the outside will Bosnia and Herzegovinabe able to create a sustainable economic system and thusachieve a stable environment that is less exposed to crisisand conflict situations. Here we are talking about a closeand mutually conditioned relationship between development democracy and peace. The realization of this paradigmholds the key to the door for Bosnia and Herzegovina tocatch up with the fast developing world.Therefore  I am convinced that we all share theopinion that this should continue in order to implement acommon long-term vision for a prosperous and stableBosnia and Herzegovina. We have to move down this roadswiftly and urgently. And this applies beyond the bordersof Bosnia and Herzegovina; we cannot afford to delaystability in the region. In that context  I would like tounderline one growing phenomenon of our time which isparticularly relevant for Bosnia and Herzegovina: theinteraction between the foreign and internal factors in thecountries in transition. Only the combined efforts of the twocan yield the desired results; yet the international factormust never forget that the case of each country is specific.Instead of a schematic and stereotypical approach  a new inventive and flexible methodology and pattern of activitiesshould apply. This would certainly contribute to a betterfocus for programmes and a higher degree of coordination.It would also prevent overlapping and inadequatespending of resources.The purpose of my brief overview was to share withthis body the recent experience in consolidating peace inBosnia and Herzegovina. I am convinced that by the endof this debate we will be enriched with valuable ideas andproposals on how to continue and improve the peaceprocess in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the Secretary-General stated in his address  the international communitymust ensure that its collective investments — military political and financial — have not been made in vain. Wein Bosnia and Herzegovina share this approach entirely.As a Member State  Bosnia and Herzegovina isclosely following the ongoing process of reform of ourOrganization. The fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly is taking place at a time when the mainfeatures of the global political scene are rapidly changing.The new political and strategic structures are takingshape  with far-reaching consequences. With the cold warbehind us  new prospects  with new fears and newchallenges  are looming over the world. In such anenvironment  we attach the greatest importance to theplace and the role of the United Nations.We would like to commend the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations and his collaborators for the immenseefforts in preparing a comprehensive report that containsa programme of action for the reform of the UnitedNations system. We cannot but agree that it is high timefor the United Nations to respond properly to thechanging world and thus confirm the irreplaceable role ofthis universal Organization.We go along with those who insist on a modern streamlined efficient Organization  ready to respond to thedemands of the new times. The United Nations mustreach out to the world with new vigour and offer all of itsassets in order to prevent threats to international peaceand security and also to address the ever-growing numberof universal problems. By breaking bureaucraticsediments  the United Nations must became a source ofgreat intellectual power capable of offering a visionaryperspective on the future.We would like to state that one of the pressing tasksis the reform of the Security Council. However  we mustbe prudent in dealing with this question. A balancebetween more democratic representation in  and fullmobility of action for  this important United Nations bodyhas to be found.24Before concluding  I would like to touch upon the twoquestions which are of particular relevance for Bosnia andHerzegovina.The first question relates to that abhorrent andimmoral weapon — anti-personnel landmines. Bosnia andHerzegovina is unfortunately one of the largest fieldsinfested with this dangerous killing device. We stronglysupport the conclusions of the Oslo Conference and hope tosee the international community united in supporting acomprehensive ban.The second question has to do with our first-handexperience with the most horrible violation of human rightsthat took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We aretherefore strongly raising our voice in favour of theperpetrators of genocide and war crimes being broughtbefore justice and prosecuted. We welcome the idea of theestablishment of an International Criminal Court  and weare convinced that the experience with the InternationalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the InternationalCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda will be taken into accountduring the preparation process.In conclusion  I would like to underline our feelingthat the exchange of views and experiences during the fifty-second session is of great importance. It will certainly bringnew inspiration and  I hope  vision for the overalldevelopment of our planet. It will also contribute to ourpreparations for the encounter with the third millennia  itschallenges but also its new chances and possibilities. Wemust be ready for this historic opportunity."
"21",833,"BLR",52,1997,"﻿It gives me particularpleasure to congratulate you  Sir  the distinguishedrepresentative of Ukraine  on your election to theresponsible post of President of the fifty-second of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I am convincedthat your rich and profound experience in diplomaticrelations  together with your personal qualities  willfacilitate the constructive work of this General Assemblysession and make it an outstanding international event.The delegation of the Republic of Belarus is ready tocontribute to your endeavours in any way required. Iwould also like to use this opportunity to say a word ofgratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  for hiscompetent and efficient presidency during the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly.Every day  international life and internationalrelations acquire ever more multidimensional and everdeeper significance  with new meanings and trends indevelopment that can no longer be constrained within the7criteria and standards of the twentieth century. We live ata time oriented towards the future. A fin de siècle mentalityis not just a nostalgic feeling for the century passing away but also embraces a deep concern for the years ahead. Thedestiny of mankind  however contradictory and diverse  andthe interests of nations and States may become moreamenable to one common denominator  are increasinglyconcerned with the well-being of humanity  and displaynumerous convergent features which make it possible nowto discuss the opportunity for a new international order.Entering the twenty-first century  with its newinternational order  does not mean that we renounce theexperience of the last 52 years in the development of thefamily of nations under one common programme  as set outfor us by the founding fathers of the United Nations andoutlined in its Charter. On the contrary  it means adjustingthese lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted worldand also making the Organization — no matter howdifferent its separate parts are — the mainstream of humandevelopment  where the economic well-being of peoplebrings to an end age-old ills such as starvation andepidemic diseases  as well as huge environmental threats and which helps to achieve multilateral understandingbetween those participating in this development. Solvingthese problems is becoming the overriding ambition and themain goal and hope of the United Nations  as well as ofmankind as a whole.Right now  the United Nations has started displayingits capacity to adapt its structure and policies to thedemands of the future. The orientation of the UnitedNations towards the future is the overriding goal that wasestablished for it during its fiftieth anniversary celebrations.The change of leadership and the measures that are nowbeing undertaken in this direction give sufficient groundsfor optimism. We declare our support for these goals andactions. With a sense of trust and the intention tocontribute  we take note of the actions of the newSecretary-General  Mr. Annan  in regard to reform withinthe United Nations. In this respect  I would like to quotefrom a letter dated 5 September 1997 sent by the Presidentof the Republic of Belarus  Mr. Lukashenka  to theSecretary-General:“These reforms are a timely and meaningful responseto the objectives facing the United Nations during thiscomplex period at the turning point of the millennia including problems which ought to be solved with thepurpose of enhancing the effectiveness of the UnitedNations system.“The Republic of Belarus is in favour of apragmatic  comprehensive approach to UnitedNations reform which would provide for thestrengthening  on the basis of the opportunitiesavailable  of the United Nations potential inpeacekeeping  humanitarian and informationalfields.”In our opinion  these measures are very importantand represent an up-to-date response to the need to settlethe issues coming before the United Nations during thiscomplex historical period as we approach the end of themillennium. These issues need to be solved in order toenhance the functional efficiency of the family of theUnited Nations. When we speak of reform in the UnitedNations  we have in mind first and foremost an effectivedistribution of United Nations resources  the streamliningof the Organization’s administrative and organizationalstructures  and budgetary and structural reform of theUnited Nations Secretariat  as well as personneladjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world.When addressing United Nations reform  we placespecial emphasis on the reform of the Security Council which is one of the principal United Nations bodies responsible for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.Extremely critical in this respect is  of course  theprinciple of balanced representation of all regional groupsof United Nations Member States on the reformedSecurity Council. The Republic of Belarus is convincedthat allocation of one more non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council to the Group of Eastern EuropeanStates — whose membership has more than doubled inrecent years — is in full compliance with the provisionsof Article 23 of the United Nations Charter  which setsforth the principle of equitable geographical distribution.Among all the new realities that are being broughtinto the mosaic of international relations  efficientmechanisms for global and regional security still seemparamount. Belarus considers its national security to beinalienably connected and identified with the collectivesecurity system of the European continent. Each State has of course  ample right independently to select the mostefficient means of protecting its own national interests including the right to participate in regional securityorganizations.For the last two years Belarus has displayed a firmstance against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty8Organization (NATO) as a military bloc. I hope forunderstanding on the part of the international community inthis respect. In the event that we had on our westernborders not the friendly sovereign Polish State we havenow but a military organization  it would certainly push usto seriously analyse and reconsider our national securityconsiderations.However  recently we have noticed developmentsinside the NATO structure itself. We took due note ofseveral meetings of NATO member States regarding thetransformation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Councilinto the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council  as well as thetransformation of the major military aims of NATO itself.Taking into account current realities  we would like toreiterate our position against NATO’s expansion as amilitary organization  but also to add to it that we are infavour of its development into a universal Europeanorganization for peace and security. It is with this intentionthat we have entered into negotiations with NATO andpresented a programme for Belarusian participation in thePartnership for Peace. We sincerely hope that bydeveloping a more constructive approach we will reach amutual understanding  which could be reinforced by somemutual obligations.We would also like to state that with this evolution ofNATO and a thorough analysis of existing world andregional security systems and treaties  further emphasisshould be attached to well-established regionalorganizations such as the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to their closercooperation with the United Nations and its specializedagencies.As to the OSCE  we feel certain that it has alreadyaccumulated profound experience and skills in tacklingmany important security issues and is able to make a majorcontribution to strengthening peace and security on thecontinent. Therefore  the Republic of Belarus readilysupports the initiatives of Russia and the Netherlandsconcerning a number of special events to commemorate theone hundredth anniversary of the First Peace Conference.Should this conference take place in 1999  it would be animportant opportunity to discuss the complex problems ofpeaceful cooperation between Member States and to findand elaborate means to constructively handle major issuesof contention and also to strengthen the legal foundationsof international actions for peace.I should like to state that the Republic of Belarus  asone of the founding Members of the United Nations  hasalways spoken strongly in favour of the peacefulregulation of military conflicts in different regions of theglobe and of elaborating new and efficient measures toprevent the emergence of new crisis situations. That iswhy we share the approach of many who have spokenhere  when they expressed concern about the developmentof the situation in the Middle East. It is our opinion thatthe continuation of the Arab-Israeli dialogue  which willlive up to the agreements previously reached  is a must tostop terrorism in this region  to put an end to the non-stopbloodletting of innocent people and to establish a firmand lasting peace.The same can also be said of the Balkans  which isnow one of the hottest spots in the European region. Weare convinced that lasting peace in the former Yugoslaviais possible only under conditions where violence isrenounced and where the parties involved settle theirconflicts in a peaceful manner.The Republic of Belarus invites the GeneralAssembly to enable the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a founding Member  to resume its participation in thework of the General Assembly and other bodies of theUnited Nations.Unfortunately  conflicts  including military clashes are still a reality of humanity’s everyday existence. Wecall upon the Security Council to be more prudent inhandling these conflicts  to be more diligent in seekingpeaceful means to regulate them  avoiding at all costseconomic destruction as well as the political and moraldamage that comes with attempts to apply sanctions.I should like to seize this opportunity to confirm thewillingness of the Government of the Republic of Belarusto host the Minsk international Conference on conflictsettlement in Nagorny Karabakh.As members know  Belarus has always been amongthose nations which have spoken and acted strongly tomake effective measures undertaken by the UnitedNations in the field of disarmament. I should like toremind the Assembly that Belarus was one of the firstCommonwealth of Independent States countries  after thebreakup of the Soviet Union  to withdraw nuclearweapons from its territory. Belarus aims to achievefurther progress in the field of disarmament  in particularby banning chemical  bacteriological and other toxicweapons  by putting an end to research into new weapons9of mass destruction  and by preventing an arms race inspace. Awareness of these aims means a more secure futurefor our children.The Belarusian position on disarmament issues is firmand logically predictable. Apart from our refusal to stationnuclear weapons on our soil  we have suggested creating anuclear-free zone in the centre of Europe. I must admit thatso far the response to this initiative has been tepid  at best.But I would also reiterate that no matter the tepid response only the creation of regions entirely free from nuclearweapons and the nuclear threat will facilitate each importantstep along the road to the eventual comprehensiverenouncement of nuclear weapons.Apart from general support for the reform programmesof the United Nations  I should like to emphasize theparticularly positive approach of Belarus to the idea and thephilosophy of sustainable development. Pursuant to thedecisions and recommendations adopted by the Rio 1992Earth Summit  the Government of the Republic of Belarusworked out a national strategy for sustainable development whose outline was presented to the General Assembly’sspecial session last June.We appreciate the great assistance rendered to us bythe United Nations Development Programme  the UnitedNations Secretariat and the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe  which helped us to hold ourconference on sustainable development in Minsk in April1997  which was attended by representatives of 30 countriesand more than 30 international organizations. Thatconference was an important landmark on the path toworking out an international strategy for sustainabledevelopment and outlined many of the important issues thatare now faced by countries in a period of transition. Isincerely believe that the sustainable developmentprogramme launched by the United Nations will encouragethe participation of other multilateral organizations in itsimplementation  in particular  the World TradeOrganization  which could advance reforms in countrieswhose economies are in transition by accepting them as fullmembers. We fervently hope that the Agenda forDevelopment  as a long-term policy of the United Nations will not only provide reliable mechanisms to deal withinternational catastrophes  such as the Chernobyl accidentand others  but will also help establish a system to preventsuch catastrophes and eliminate their consequences in allparts of the world.I should like to emphasize that the Chernobyl-relatedactivities of the United Nations as well as the internationalassistance in mitigating the consequences of that nuclearcatastrophe are highly appreciated by the people ofBelarus. Yet the assistance is needed right now —today — though we will need it in the future as well.That is a tragic reality the Republic of Belarus is livingthrough.As members are aware  sometimes and in someareas Belarus has been the object of criticism because ofthe slowness of reform and democratic transformations.Concern has been expressed regarding certain internaldevelopments in the Republic of Belarus. While I wouldcertainly acknowledge that some of the internationalcommunity’s concern has been justified  I would like verymuch to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereignState that develops its own policy with due regard for theopportunities — economic  social  moral andpsychological — of its citizens  within the limits ofinternational patterns of behaviour and with respect forhuman rights and personal freedoms.It has been an uneasy path  but so far the Republicof Belarus has avoided the pitfalls in economic andpolitical areas  and with the due assistance of theinternational community expects to attain certainstandards compatible with the developed countries of theworld. Now we are practically the only country of theCommonwealth of Independent States that had a stableeconomic growth of about 16 per cent during the first halfof this year; we have arrested the decrease in volumes ofindustrial production and we are a country free fromreligious  ethnic or civil strife.Of course  there are many difficulties still ahead ofus. But as long as a consensus of the people is secured onmajor development programmes and aims  the institutesof government and democracy are stable  andinternational cooperation proceeds within acceptableinternational norms. There is hope that we shallaccomplish the goals set before us.Difficult as it might be  we have made quite a fewpositive steps to assure the United Nations that we areseriously focused on strengthening our participation inthis international body. No matter what objective financialor other economic difficulties Belarus is experiencing  weseek to fulfil our financial obligations before the UnitedNations. This year  the Government of Belarus hasallotted the first instalment to gradually liquidate ourarrears to the regular United Nations budget  and beforethe year is over we plan to contribute another $5 million.However  we hope more careful consideration can be10given to reaching a fair solution in the settlement of theissue related to the payment by Belarus of its arrears infinancial contributions to the United Nations regular budgetand financing the United Nations peacekeeping operations.I would take up this issue  not to emphasize the needto avoid payments  but to invite the internationalcommunity to distinguish between the cases when paymentis not made due to objective difficulties and when it resultsfrom the absence of will on the part of some MemberStates to contribute in accordance with the principle of thecapacity to pay  or is an attempt to exert pressure on theUnited Nations and the policy it implements. There must bea common quest for special solutions to further revise thescale of assessments  to reconstruct debt in cases whereeconomic conditions of this or that Member State do notallow for the regular payment to be made in time.During the limited time afforded to us  it is notpossible to cover the whole range of problems whichconfront the United Nations and which involve specialactions and responsibilities of Member States. I haveoutlined only those which the Government of Belarusconsiders of the first priority to be addressed in order tosecure the normal functioning of the United Nations.I would like to close my statement on a note ofcautious optimism. There are many indicators that theUnited Nations is advancing in the right direction  and theparticipation of Member States in the United Nationsprogrammes of settling major global issues is a shade bettertoday than it was yesterday. With all those shades blendinginto a positive optimistic colour  the future of humanity ismore secure today than it was yesterday  and certainly a lotmore secure than it was before yesterday."
"22",868,"BLZ",52,1997,"﻿Permit me first to offer you Sir  the congratulations of Belize’s delegation on yourelection  and the assurance of our fullest cooperation asyou follow through on the accomplishments of yourdistinguished predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia.As the world shifts gears towards a preoccupationwith what could be described as millennium fever  ourannual stocktaking exercise becomes particularly poignant.And if truth be told  the record of our success —measured against the historical vision of the founders andagainst current challenges — is not an unsullied one.Nevertheless  in every sphere of human endeavour  inevery tangible advance of international comity  thesignature of the United Nations can be found. We havecontributed to fundamental changes for good in the fabricof the global community. Of course  and as is always thecase with less than perfect man-made enterprises  our jobis far from done.As the Secretary-General noted in his report on thework of the Organization  we live in an era ofrealignment. Belize shares his view that this Organizationhas to continue adjusting to the changes which enveloptoday’s world  so as to maintain the balance in favour ofa more secure and predictable peace  greater economicwell-being  social justice and environmental sustainability.Despite sea changes in the international climate  therelevance of the original objectives of the Organization’sCharter remains acute. There is still need to respondrapidly to threats to international peace and security.Economic and social development must be furtheradvanced. Human rights  the rule of law and the ideals ofdemocratic  accountable governance must be concretizedin our daily life. And the changes  such as globalizationand reshaping of the United Nations environment muststrengthen the commitment of nations large and small tointernational cooperation. The one fundamental lesson thatthe experience of the last 52 years has taught is that wecannot go it alone. There is large benefit to be derivedfrom multilateralism; and to our mind the United Nationsis the one organization with the wherewithal and capacityto take global action on a global agenda.We have been promised that the renewed UnitedNations system sought by the Secretary-General will3become both more effective and more efficient. Theextensive and far-reaching set of changes proposed in hisProgramme for Reform are said to be designed to achievegreater unity of purpose  coherence of effort and flexibilityin response. Belize therefore joins with those voicesapplauding the attempt to strengthen and streamline theUnited Nations and enhance its institutional capacity. Mydelegation will eagerly await opportunities to hear commentand will participate in joint analysis of the proposedProgramme for Reform.One major hindrance to the Organization’s capacity isits dire financial situation. We have noted proposals withinthe Secretary-General’s Programme for Reform designed toensure a viable financial basis for the Organization. It is mydelegation’s view  however  that there is still a need forgreater clarification if financial solvency is to be assured.We are not entirely convinced that the creation of theproposed Revolving Credit Fund will alleviate the situation.We would rather see implementation of measures forharsher censure in cases of tardiness in meeting obligations.Let us again state our view that this Organization should begranted some measure of autonomy in generating revenuefrom sources outside national Administrations.There is an ongoing parallel at the national andorganizational level aimed at economizing. Streamlining downsizing  or the process of retrenchment by any name carries with it a human cost. We must therefore make everyeffort to ensure that the product of reform is greater thanthe sum of its parts. Within this context  we wish to offerthe caution that in our eagerness to integrate Secretariatentities and units the critical thrust and focus of variousdepartments  divisions and programmes  should not be lost.The gasp of the weak and poor all too frequently can barelybe heard above the loudly trumpeted agenda of powerfulconstituencies.Democracy  human rights and the rule of law havetaken on renewed paramountcy  particularly in the post-conflict societies of Latin America. Good governance is thefoundation upon which we build structures to ensuresustainable development and durable peace. In both thesubregions to which Belize belongs this is a principle thatachieves practical as well as intellectual expression. And wefind this fact noteworthy: that so soon after internalconflicts convulsed the isthmus  the countries of CentralAmerica have been able democratically and constitutionallyto reinvigorate their societies. It is also remarkable that soharmoniously has their economic integration movementadvanced  that they are now prepared to contemplate thenext step of political union. While this is logical  it is alsoa quantum leap.Now  for juridical and historical reasons  Belize canonly be an observer in this process. But we wish to assureour Central American brothers that in our heart of heartswe too are Morazanistas. We too are uplifted and inspiredby this great visionary. And we sympathize keenly withthe spirit of the legacy that now animates his modern-dayprogeny.In the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) thecoming of the single market is only the most dramaticexpression of a new solidarity that Belize enthusiasticallyembraces. We continue to draw vital sustenance fromwhat is  after all  a West Indian partnership rooted in ashared love for  and practice of  democracy  a democracythat is not resting on its laurels  but that is engaged nowin a process of revitalization based on the urgent searchfor collective economic security and social advance.The proposals for reform encompass suggestions toachieve greater coordination and cooperation among theUnited Nations agencies and entities which help nationslike mine pursue the central priority of sustainabledevelopment. We hope  however  that the effectivenessand responsiveness of individual agencies will not becompromised.More will have to be said about seeking innovativemeans to attract greater capital to finance development.The argument that a development dividend can berealized by a shift of resources from administration todevelopment activities  is not  to our mind  persuasive.Any possible savings in administrative costs could hardlybe adequate enough to make significant progress in ourcollective effort to eradicate poverty.We have yet to hear any general admission ofsatisfaction with the outcome of the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly to review and appraisethe implementation of Agenda 21 and other agreementsreached at the 1992 United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development. The special sessionclearly did not meet expectations for the adoption of cleartargets  commitments and specific initiatives as weprogress along the road from Rio. Long-term commitmentand concerted action in the field are still critical if we areto continue to meet the needs of a rapidly increasingglobal population without depleting the resource base onwhich our very subsistence depends.4We are heartened that the practical agreements reachedat the so-called Earth Summit + 5 included those of majorconcern to small island developing States  such as climatechange  tourism and natural disasters. Belize  a country witha low-lying coastal plain  several coral atolls and more than100 coral islands  experiences challenges similar to thosethat face small island developing States. At the UnitedNations we participate within the very active Alliance ofSmall Island States  and we remain faithful to theimplementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  adopted at the 1994 Global Conference in Barbados.We look forward to the in-depth assessment of theBarbados Programme to be conducted at the forthcomingtwo-day special session to be held immediately precedingthe fifty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly.Belize will continue to insist that the constituency oflow-lying coastal States be accorded the deserved supportof the international community so that we too may share inthe tangible benefits to be accrued.Countries like mine will also increasingly depend uponthe United Nations to steer the way forward in building thenew framework within which developed and developingnations interact. Against the backdrop of globalization andmarket liberalization  a new partnership is called for. Therole of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the regional commissions inexamining the issues pertinent to globalization anddevelopment and the effective integration of developingcountries into the international trading system is especiallykey  for the recent negative rulings by the World TradeOrganization on the European Union banana regime  whichsecured access for African  Caribbean and Pacific countries fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridledliberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs ofsmall  vulnerable and disadvantaged economies.In the current climate  it is perhaps basest apostasy toquestion the new catechism of free trade. “Revisionism” isa bad word  and heresy will no doubt be swiftly repaid byexcommunication. But has not the zeal of the convertblinded us to the humanism of the original aims ofpreferential access? After all  this was not some hopelesslycapricious or unreasoning altruism. Preferential accessregimes represented  rather  a real and sincere effort toenable small developing countries to produce for theinternational marketplace  to offer their societies a chanceat a decent standard of living and to assure them a specialstake in the global economy.Although economic thinking has changed  theobjective conditions of poor countries have not. Ferventrecitation of the new mantra alone can never wipe out thediseconomies of scale for small  primary-producing States.We cannot now compete on equal terms. Yet our calls gounheeded for the comprehensive capital inflows andtechnical assistance so vitally necessary to achieve thestructural adjustment that will enable us to participateequitably in the new trading arrangements. I repeat to theindustrialized world what surely has now become our cride coeur: do not cut off our legs  then tell us to run.Development is still one of the most importantaspirations in today’s world. To return to my earliercomplaint  the achievement of economic growth andsustainable development has not been balanced throughoutthe five regions that United Nations comprises. It is anunderstatement to say that globalization and economicliberalization have had a different kind of impact on someof us. A few nations now enjoy the increased well-being while others are visited only by deepeningmarginalization.The recently adopted United Nations Agenda forDevelopment stresses the role of the Organization indevelopment matters. The Agenda is one concrete mannerin which we can collectively address the issues andproblems relevant to development and  in particular development’s peculiar relationship with peace democracy  good governance and human rights.Belize repeats its call for an annual observance bythe General Assembly at which development policy wouldbe the focus of debate. Such encounters could maintainthe Agenda’s impetus  as well as provide a forum fordiscussing effective and coordinated follow-through withregard to commitments made at the several globalconferences.Preventive diplomacy and peacemaking are still thebest means at the Organization’s disposal in its efforts atconflict avoidance. The wide range of activities carriedout in the name of preventive diplomacy must ever bemindful that success can be guaranteed only with theconsent of all parties.Both the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly  in extending existing operations or authorizingadditional ones  must continue to issue clear mandates. Inthe light of the financial situation  some collectivediscipline will have to be applied in authorizing mandateswhen adequate resources are not available.5On a related subject  we have learned of efforts underway to develop the Organization’s rapid-deploymentcapability. This dimension is necessary  but any deploymentin this sense must withstand the scrutiny of nationalconsent. Again  we would prefer to see the preventiveaspect stressed rather than the enforcement side. Further  arapid-reaction capability is not needed solely to respond tothreats to peace in the traditional sense. Recent measuresemployed to enhance the Organization’s humanitarianresponse to both man-made and natural disasters are alsodemonstrative of the requirement for the institutionalizationof a rapid-response capability.In the Secretary-General’s programme for reform deserved emphasis is placed on strengthening internationalcooperation to combat the new threats to civil society. Thedeleterious effects of crime  drugs and terrorism know noborders.The administrative changes to be instituted by theSecretariat to focus action through the United Nations crimeprevention and criminal justice programme should give usthe upper hand in waging war against the forces of uncivilsociety.Countries such as mine expend huge amounts oflimited resources in addressing these concerns  which  in asmall State  can amount to nothing less than threats tonational security. Further  we are convinced that the globalnature of the problem requires the highest level ofinternational cooperation that can be achieved. This mustembody the concept of multilateralism and reject unilateraldevices which disrespect the sovereignty of States.Belize’s declaration affirming respect for thepersonality  sovereignty and independence of States  whichwas sponsored by 30 members of the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS) at the twenty-seventh session of itsGeneral Assembly at Lima  Peru  speaks directly to thisissue and strongly promotes the spirit of partnership thatmust underpin an interdependent approach to addressing thecommon problem of narcotics trafficking and abuse.International cooperation in this regard must mean theavoidance of not just political  but also of economic unilateralism. For example  the banana industry in mycountry may well be destroyed by the efforts of the verypeople who claim to be our partners in the fight againstillicit drugs. We have a saying in Belize that the same knifethat sticks the sheep sticks the goat. If the prosperity ofstrategically vulnerable southern Belize is to be sacrificednow on the altar of the new orthodoxy  it will not be longbefore the substitute blandishments of the drug tradeundermine our national anti-narcotics efforts to the pointwhere they too become only burnt offerings at the feet ofthe deity. The immutable  compassionless law of themarket is very much a two-edged sword.It is in this context that the forthcoming specialsession of the General Assembly on illicit drugs isespecially timely. It will afford Member States anopportunity to discuss joint action in preventing moneylaundering  international cooperation in judicial affairs andlaw enforcement. But the debate must be a thoroughlyholistic one that looks carefully at the interrelatedness ofeconomic well-being and effective anti-narcotics policies.We commend the prudence of this Assembly in itsdecision that the Open-ended Working Group on theQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase inthe Membership of the Security Council and OtherMatters Related to the Security Council should continuedeliberations during the current session.In the absence of any general agreement within theWorking Group  Belize would find it difficult to accept astrict deadline in relation to Council expansion. Further we do not wish to see qualitative distinctions in thedecision making ability of existing and possible newpermanent members. We note with gratitude that Belize’scomprehensive proposals on the subject are still includedamong the views being considered.On another issue related to reform  the principles ofequitability and universality confer urgency on the claimfor consideration of the Republic of China on Taiwan.Twenty-one million people living in a successful  robustand prosperous democracy should be entitled at the veryleast to a discussion of their circumstances. The blanket“no”  the annual ritual that continues to slam the doorshut on even the possibility of debating their aspirations is irrational and unenlightened. A way must be found toreview this situation in a manner consistent with therights of the parties and the spirit of the Charter.This Organization  it appears  is completing a periodof intense self-examination and introspection. We mustcontinue to counter the influences that would ascribe adiminished role to multilateralism. Our flexibility and avisible search for consensus have enabled us to retool.We are demonstrating that we are still equal to the tasksahead. With reform and renewal moving to the fore thisyear  it is clear that the crisis of confidence is over.6With an able chief executive  the United Nations isnow  therefore  strengthening and repositioning itself tosurmount the challenges that face us.It is our sincere wish that in the weeks ahead we willreach a new pass in our great undertaking  and thatmomentous debate will result in keen  relevant and timelydecision-making."
"23",915,"BOL",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to convey the congratulations of theGovernment and the people of Bolivia to you Mr. President. Your well-deserved election is fittingrecognition of your work and prestige.Allow me also to commend the work of AmbassadorRazali Ismail of Malaysia  who so ably conducted thedeliberations of the previous session of the GeneralAssembly.Finally  my congratulations go as well to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whose contributions to the cause ofworld peace and cooperation have earned him theunanimous gratitude of the Member States of thisOrganization.All the countries of Latin America  in one way oranother and each at its own pace  have put long decadesof ideological confrontation and economic crisis behindthem. They have opened their markets  controlledinflation  reduced the deficit and privatized publicenterprises. They have rebuilt their democraticinstitutional structures on new foundations  with newprotagonists  and restarted the process of growth.However  old structural adjustment problems aggravated by the period of crisis  have surfaced. Clearlythe most important of these is the inequitable distributionof income and its results: exclusion  poverty  violence andsocial fragmentation. Such inequities have created ever-greater gaps between the immensely rich and those whohave barely enough to survive. There are no socialsecurity systems to protect the dispossessed  to cushiontheir fall and rehabilitate them so that they can live aproductive life. For this reason  the potential for violenceand discontent on our continent is growing larger andmore dangerous.These factors aside  however  Latin America meetsall of the necessary conditions to forge ahead and grow inthat it has the capacity and courage to continue tochange — to increase society’s store of knowledge  createnew competitive advantages  eliminate internalmarginalization  reduce extreme poverty  rebuild the State and speak with its own voice in the world politicalcommunity.Education stands out as a vital precondition for all ofthese goals. Without a far-reaching revolution in the area ofeducation  we will not be able to achieve these goals ormeet the challenges of our time.Today  Latin America is no longer asking others forwhat it cannot do on its own. Proof of this is the significantprogress recently made in strengthening mechanisms foreconomic integration  such as the Andean Group and theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). Theregion is also taking a different approach in its relationswith the economically advanced countries. The olddefensive and mistrustful attitude has yielded to theconviction that it is necessary to merge Latin America’seconomy into the contemporary current of productive andtechnological development  attract investments and open itsmarkets to its products while preserving its identity upholding its values and attending to its interests  withoutfor an instant losing sight of the fact that the key to itsstrength lies in its own markets and in its resources.Let me reiterate Bolivia’s concern about landmines. Itis incomprehensible that those very same borders acrosswhich we are seeking to promote trade and integrationshould be sown with devices of war that endanger thecivilian population and threaten their fundamental rights.We are convinced that the Governments of the regiondirectly affected by the problem will find a way to resolveit.This matter is of particular and direct relevance toBolivia  due to the well-known and acknowledged fact thatChile has laid a significant number of mines along ourcommon border. Removal of those mines is of the utmosturgency  in keeping with the commitments entered into inOslo  the dictates of morality and the imperative of thespirit of integration that should prevail betweenneighbouring nations. Avoidance of this topic is not theattitude that the international community wishes to see.What is needed is firm resolve and the sincere will tocontribute to peace between countries that must impart asense of solidarity to their borders.Since the early days of its independence  Bolivia hasrejected the use of force and the arms race as an instrumentof its foreign policy. We have the moral authority therefore  to condemn those commercial interests that seekto foster the procurement of war matériel  therebycompromising what we have achieved so far in terms ofpreserving peace on the continent.I have sought to describe the process of change inLatin America in order to show the extent to whichdevelopments in each of our countries are part of abroader and more comprehensive historical trend.However  Bolivia’s transformation has its own particularfeatures. Following a lengthy process of socialconfrontation  we have restored democracy and economicfreedoms in Bolivia. In a spirit of respect for humanrights and freedoms  we have given full support to thepolitical system and fuelled the economic growth anddevelopment that prevail today in Bolivia. It should beunderscored that this was a peaceful reconstructionprocess — the result of democratic dialogue.My Government  the product of a mandate of thepeople  represents more than 70 per cent of the Bolivianelectorate. Nonetheless  we must continue to moveforward and broaden the scope of dialogue and consensus involving social institutions and their leaders in the taskof identifying the main objectives of development inBolivia as well as the broad outlines of our strategy forthe twenty-first century. That is the purpose of thenational dialogue that I have recently called for  whichhas the support of all the political parties — Governmentand opposition; the church; private enterprise; and farmersand workers.Of course  this new country we are building islooking to the future from a different perspective and witha sense of renewed confidence. The time has come toreaffirm Bolivia’s role on our continent — its role as acrossroads and as a land of contacts  at the juncture of thegreat basins and the great cultures of America. Bolivia’skey geographical position may become one of its majorcomparative advantages and an essential element inenhancing the country’s international stature.However  this is not yet a reality. It is a task thatremains to be accomplished  a promise that remains to befulfilled. To this end  Bolivia will need to rebuild itsmaritime capacity; reduce the transportation cost of itsproducts; and create a modern export sector and connectit with the Pacific and the Atlantic. We must see andunderstand our country as a part of the continent.Bolivia’s association with MERCOSUR is not onlythe result of a desire to cultivate a historical friendshipbut also a consequence of the concrete needs of Boliviandevelopment. The exceptional growth in the eastern areas2of Bolivia calls for a more intense and productiverelationship with our neighbours on the Atlantic.That effort coincides with one of the most impressivedevelopment ventures in the history of America  which istaking place now on the territories of Brazil  Bolivia Paraguay  Argentina and Uruguay. Investments andtechnology must be allowed to flow freely in that region.We must set up a genuine common market  a multinationaldevelopment project  around this potential  which shouldalso promote the integration of our countries into the worldeconomy. It is well known that the Paraguay-Paranáwaterway is the natural route linking the area.That major project  however  has already gone beyondthe imagination of the visionaries and the negotiating tablesof the diplomats. It is now in the hands of engineers andworkers. After more than 30 years of efforts  constructionhas begun on the Santa Cruz-San Pablo-Curitiba gaspipeline  the first segment of a network of energydistribution for which Bolivia’s territory provides thecrossroads. This is one of the largest engineering projectsin the history of the region. It will stretch for more than3 000 kilometres  will carry more than 7 billion cubic feetof natural gas over 20 years and will require a totalinvestment of nearly $5 billion.Bolivia’s very existence is directly tied to the Pacific.Accordingly  we have been following with great interest theprocess of consolidating the vast potential of the Andeancommunity. That potential is also found in our immediatevicinity. The economies of Bolivia  Peru and Chile arecomplementary.Our territories are not only markets  but avenues forintegration. The territories of Peru and Chile hold Bolivia’sgateway to the Pacific  while that of Bolivia opens upcommunication between those nations and the vast interiorof the continent.I must stress  however  that the reality still falls farshort of the potential. The reason for this is to be found ina war that took place just over 100 years ago  and whoseadverse consequences continue to be felt in the relationsbetween our countries. Undoubtedly  the most unjust andserious of those consequences is the geographical enclosureimposed upon Bolivia.Bolivia’s demand to return to the Pacific Ocean  withsovereign rights and a coastline of its own cannot berenounced. It is a vital condition for our nationaldevelopment but  above all  a historical claim that cannot becompromised. The recovery of our maritime access temporarily lost  is an essential condition for fulfilling ourcontinental role as a crossroads and a point ofconvergence. My country will turn to the internationalcommunity as many times as necessary in order to callattention to a problem that has already been deemed amatter of permanent hemispheric interest in the light of itsmany implications for continental security and harmony.Despite everything  my Government  as always  remainsready to explore avenues of constructive dialogue with anopen mind.Illicit drug trafficking unjustly distorts the reality ofBolivia and affects and interferes with the proper conductof external cooperation. Bolivia itself has done a greatdeal to contain this problem. It has not permitted drugtrafficking to taint beyond repair its economic institutional and political structure. And it has done sopeacefully  without resorting to violence. Nevertheless  thestigma of drug trafficking exists  and while we aredisturbed by the manner in which it is magnified  it wouldbe a mistake to ignore it.Accordingly  my Government has taken the decisionto remove Bolivia from the drug-trafficking circuit withinthe term of my administration. We shall use dialogue andconsultation with peasant producers of coca in orderdefinitively to eradicate illegal crops. We shall be ruthlesswith the drug traffickers. We shall not give them amoment’s rest until they have been for ever banned fromthe history of Bolivia.Naturally  this is not an exclusively Bolivianproblem  nor can our actions alone resolve the global andhemispheric problem of illegal trafficking in narcotics. Itis a matter that concerns all and that requires everyone’scommitment. Therefore  the time has come to reaffirm theprinciples of shared responsibility. The characteristics andscope of this problem mean that it cannot be facedeffectively through isolated efforts. It undeniably calls forresolute action by all countries  especially those affectedby consumption and who have sufficient economicresources to combat this terrible evil.My country reaffirms its commitment to the peaceprocess in the Middle East in keeping with the principlesand values that guide harmonious coexistence betweenpeoples. However  given the resurgence of tensions andnew acts of confrontation  we call upon the parties not togo back on the commitments already made. That is thefirm answer for maintaining peace in the region.3In another vein  Bolivia has received with satisfactionthe Secretary-General’s initiative proposing a broadprogramme of reforms in the United Nations system. Wefeel it is essential to strengthen the role of the Secretariat.We reiterate the importance of the process of expansion andreform of the Security Council with a view to correctingpresent imbalances  guaranteeing equitable and non-discriminatory geographical distribution  improving itsdecision-making mechanisms and making it an organ thatcan take action in a manner that is increasingly legitimateand representative of the countries that make up the UnitedNations. Bolivia shares the view that we should movetowards the elimination of the veto  limiting its use in theinterim to issues considered under Chapter VII of theCharter.Bolivia reiterates its commitment to the principles thathave guided global solidarity for more than 50 years. WeBolivians believe that there can be no relinquishing of thestandards that establish mutual respect and the sovereignequality of States  regardless of their size or level ofdevelopment. Nor can we surrender the principles ofpeaceful settlement of disputes  the inviolability andintegrity of territories and respect for self-determination ofpeoples that wish to preserve their own systems of life andGovernment  free from threats.If there is a lesson to be learned from the experienceof the century now drawing to a close  it is the versatilityof the human endeavour. Mankind has an incorrigibletendency to make mistakes  but also a talent for correctingthem and for building from the rubble the new portals offreedom and faith.With the approach of the new millennium  at an hourthat is both dusk and dawn  we must look upon the eventsof the world from the dual perspective of humility andhope."
"24",962,"BRA",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of the Braziliandelegation  I would like to congratulate you  my dearcolleague  Hennadiy Udovenko  the Foreign Minister ofUkraine  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session. Brazil has a significantand active community of Ukrainian origin. We Braziliansare thus very glad to see this session headed by adistinguished son of the Ukraine  a country that is close tous.I want to express my recognition to the PermanentRepresentative of Malaysia  Ambassador Razali Ismail  forthe way he conducted the work of the fifty-first session.Ambassador Razali's dynamic presidency paved the way through extensive consultation  for an imaginative andcomprehensive proposal to advance Security Councilreform.I also pay tribute to our new Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  chosen to oversee the political andadministrative challenges of modernization. He has been thefocus of justifiable expectation on the part of theinternational community at a difficult moment in the life ofour Organization.We welcome the Secretary-General's proposals forreform and institutional strengthening as a sign of renewedvitality within the United Nations. These proposals andAmbassador Razali's contribution will certainly warrantclose attention in the General Assembly and in parallelconsultation. We will help to consolidate a new spirit thatshould inspire our Organization. This new spirit is calledleadership - that driving force of history altering thecourse of events within countries and in the internationalscenario  opening new horizons  giving hope to the peoplesof the world  seeing movement where some can onlystand still.Ambassador Razali and Secretary-General KofiAnnan have  in a way  revived the leadership of thecreators of the United Nations. They have shown thesame idealism in establishing goals and pragmatism incarrying them out. It was also the leadership of men suchas Dag Hammarskjöld and Brazilian statesman OswaldoAranha  twice President of this Assembly  that often ledthe United Nations to a decisive role as a factor of changein international relations.This kind of leadership has given the world a forumwithout parallel in history  a stage for negotiation and apolitical force in favour of international peace andsecurity. Although the United Nations has not alwaysbeen able to prevent or to deter conflict  it has certainlyreduced its occurrence and avoided some of its moreserious consequences. For this reason  the United Nationshas been a mandatory reference  a sign of hope and amoral force for world public opinion.We are witnessing today the rebirth of thisleadership  feeling its effects through a remarkable changein the heart and soul of our Organization. There is greateroptimism. There is greater motivation among delegatesand staff. There is greater expectation on the part of manyGovernments. A new atmosphere of hope embraces theUnited Nations. This is something we must nurture andpromote - something we must filter to the public inorder to renew the trust of the international community inour Organization.The agenda of the fifty-second session is vast andreveals the continuing complexity and the numerousconflicts of interests that animate international relations inour times. A new international dynamic combines threepositive impulses: first  modernization and political andeconomic opening in most countries; secondly  economicintegration in regional contexts  with multiple politicaland security benefits; and thirdly  the internationalizationof the economy on a global scale.These impulses tend to generate  foster andconsolidate international peace and security. They arebased on confidence and understanding and should allowus to prosper and achieve the desired material andspiritual results. Economic integration is increasingly thegreat bulwark of international peace and cooperation. Itmust be given emphasis and further promoted.4Precisely because of its many political and economicbenefits  integration is a defining trait of South America'sreality  a direct consequence of democracy and economicfreedom. The Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR)  a new and powerful impetus fordevelopment in the region  is an example of the importanceof integration. With democracy firmly rooted and adynamic process of integration  South America has areduced potential for conflict. It has the lowest rates ofmilitary spending in the world and is following aneconomic course based on strict government budgetcontrols. Our priorities are stability and development. Armspurchases are compatible with the defense needs of LatinAmerican countries. They are aimed at replacing obsoleteor exhausted equipment. Recently announced measures inthe strategic-military domain will not affect thesefundamental parameters.The concrete interests that bring together the countriesof South America - trade  investment and thereinforcement of our international standing throughMERCOSUR - are an unyielding factor of unity andcohesion. There is no threat of military destabilization inLatin America. There is no danger of an arms race in theabsence of political  economic and strategic conditions forsuch. A regional initiative towards self-imposed limitationson conventional arms purchases is therefore unjustified. Itwould be tantamount to disarming those already disarmed.Our preoccupation  on the other hand  should be thefight against the arms trade that sustains organized crimeand drug trafficking. This is the real and grave problemperpetuating a major source of instability that has unfortunately  also affected our region severely. Onlydetermined and coordinated action on the part of theinternational community  especially through tighter controlson the production and selling of weapons in private hands can curb or even suppress this trade; which feeds crimecartels and leads to violence  fear and desperation. Brazilstrongly urges all countries  and particularly those in theWestern Hemisphere  to intensify cooperation in the fightagainst arms trafficking.We have taken great strides in areas of concern andgrowing visibility. Disarmament and  most specifically efforts towards the elimination of anti-personnel landmineshave increasingly held the attention of the internationalcommunity. Today  we can speak of significantaccomplishments  such as the signing of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the willingness of anoverwhelming majority to make firm commitments expressed at the Oslo Conference on anti-personnellandmines.In these two instances  Brazil has sought to add itsown efforts to those of the international community. Thiswas the main thrust of President Fernando HenriqueCardoso's decision to submit the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to congressionalapproval. Brazil can and should make an additionalcontribution to nuclear disarmament. We want to take aconstructive part in discussions within the frameworkcreated by the indefinite extension of the NPT  the mostuniversal of disarmament treaties. This is also theguideline for our participation in the Oslo conference andin the Ottawa process. Brazil stands firmly behind theinterdiction of landmines in all types of conflict.The international community should do everythingin its power to help poor countries devastated by war.They suffer the perverse and prolonged effects oflandmines irresponsibly planted in their territories. Theinterdiction of anti-personnel landmines and their removalmust become an effective commitment on the part of theinternational community. This a question of ethics  aquestion of observing the most elementary principles ofhumanitarian law. We hope that the internationalconvention agreed upon in Oslo and the importantcommitments it enshrines find universal acceptance.These positive tendencies might lead to theimpression that the United Nations is less in demandtoday than 10  20 or 50 years ago. This is a falseimpression. We are still subject to the effects ofdisintegrating factors. Some are  unfortunately by-products of new global trends  such as marginalizationwithin and among nations  transnational crime andconflicts of interest that find expression through violenceand the threat or use of force.The persistent and overbearing nature of terrorismcontinues to be one of the most serious threats tointernational peace and development. It breeds despair andsuffering. In the Middle East  terrorism and intolerancejeopardize a peace process that was once full of promisefor the peoples of the region. In other countries  some ofthem in Latin America  terrorist acts reveal the existenceof groups that still insist on employing tacticsincompatible with the values of civilization and humandignity. We must not falter in condemning those who  indisregard of all moral values  resort to cowardly violencein seeking to advance their own obscure purposes. Brazilis emphatic in repelling these practices and exhorts the5international community to spare no effort in the fightagainst terrorism  whatever its form or the alleged reasoningbehind it.In addition  conflicts that had apparently beensurmounted by a spirit of understanding and constructiveaction on the part of the United Nations still show signs ofresistance that demand a strong reaction from theinternational community. Angola is a case in point. Hopeand promise cannot be constantly undermined by the factorsthat have wrought so much destruction and suffering upona valiant people to whom we Brazilians feel so closelylinked. Angola is now a decisive test for the UnitedNations. We cannot accept even the slightest possibility ofregression. Brazil  currently holding the presidency of theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries  calls uponthe international community  and in particular the membersof the Security Council  to exercise close scrutiny over theAngolan peace process. We must do everything to ensurethat the people of Angola once again find the road ofdevelopment in a context of democracy and pluralism.The United Nations has an irreplaceable role in aworld that still combines forces of integration andcooperation with forces of disintegration and aggression.But we have allowed the United Nations to lose its strengthas an instrument of universal peace and understanding andas a promoter of cooperation and development. We havedone this through inaction  through a lack of consensus through obstructionism and through excessive politicizationof issues. We must react to this situation. We must onceagain find the cardinal notion of leadership.The past few years have shown that reform of theUnited Nations can no longer be put off. We cannot losesight of major institutional issues or waste further preciousenergy. The report of the Secretary-General entitled""Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform""is thus timely and opportune. The Brazilian Governmentwelcomes it with satisfaction and enthusiasm. The strengthof our Organization derives from its universality and fromthe all-encompassing nature of its mandate. The UnitedNations must not be held to the performance of tasks bettersuited to other international organizations or specializedagencies.We cannot be made prisoners of inertia  nor must wecondemn our debates to irrelevancy. The General Assemblymust urgently move towards an agenda focused on what isessential to ensuring a relevant role for the United Nationsin international affairs. For the United Nations to make adifference and provide leadership in today's complex world it must recover the original meaning of the Charter byconcentrating on its essential mission: maintaininginternational peace and security  promoting justice andinternational law  strengthening cooperation fordevelopment  protecting human rights and providinghumanitarian assistance.Member States must create political conditions foreffective action by the United Nations and make thecommitment to setting priorities and eliminating thesuperfluous. Only then will our Organization as awhole - not just the Secretariat - be able to devoteitself to those fundamental tasks. The Secretary-Generalhas assumed a leadership role by putting forth ideas thatmust be objectively discussed by all Member States.Brazil is committed to working constructively with Mr.Kofi Annan on his proposals to strengthen ourOrganization.Brazil has taken an active part in the debate onreform of the Security Council. We have adopted anopen-minded and constructive approach because webelieve this to be a central element in the reform of theOrganization. Brazil has upheld a concept of reform thatwould strengthen the Council and the United Nations asa whole. It is not geared to the individual interests of anyone country. We want the Council to be representative ofcontemporary international realities  as it was in its earlyyears.The Council must be enlarged both in its permanentmembership  to take account of the industrialized and thedeveloping worlds  and in its non-permanent membership to allow for more frequent participation by interestedStates. We repudiate all discrimination in the conceptionor assignment of new seats. We must not create a third orfourth category of member. This would weaken anddepreciate the participation of the developing world  andof Latin America in particular  in the reform process andin an enlarged Council.We have always said that in identifying newpermanent members we must exercise realism andpragmatism by means of a democratic selection processthat leads to universally recognized representation withoutrenouncing regional support. Brazil has expressed through President Fernando Henrique Cardoso  itswillingness to accept the responsibilities of permanentmembership in the Security Council  if called upon by theinternational community to do so. In such a case  Brazilwould be determined to carry out the role of permanentmember as the representative of Latin America and the6Caribbean. We want our region to be present in theSecurity Council on a permanent basis and  through amplecoordination and consultation  to have an even strongercollective voice.The Brazilian Government notes with satisfaction thatwe are moving  if not towards consensus  at least in thedirection of a significant majority in favour of certain basicnotions about how to reform the Security Council particularly enlargement of its permanent membership totake account of the developing world. The proposal byAmbassador Razali  presently under discussion in theWorking Group  constitutes a firm basis for a negotiatingprocess leading to a decision by the General Assembly.Ambassador Razali has helped us regain the ideal ofCouncil reform as a means of strengthening the entireOrganization. Our priority is now to define the mostsuitable format for an enlarged Security Council. This mustbe the prime focus of attention.The international community needs a strong  efficientand ever-present United Nations. We will continue to relyon the political body with the universality and moralstrength that  in the history of humankind  only the UnitedNations has been able to muster. We must display in thissession the determination to create the conditions for theUnited Nations to be an effective instrument for promotinginternational peace and security. The same spirit ofleadership that we have seen in the Secretary-General andin Ambassador Razali has driven many delegations. A newwillingness to make a constructive contribution to theSecurity Council reform process and to other reforms isclearly felt by Member States. There is a new thrust tonegotiations. There is leadership  as well as carefullycrafted proposals. We must take advantage of this uniqueopportunity in the history of the United Nations. We mustnot let the moment pass. Reform has become more than akey concept; it has become the order of the day for theUnited Nations in 1997.Let us do it with that ""fierce urgency of now"" felt byMartin Luther King  a symbol of political leadership and ofthe forces of change in our century. ""This is no time""  saidKing in his most famous speech ""to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take thetranquillizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time..."".Let us do it  then."
"25",1006,"BRB",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  it is mypleasure to congratulate you on your election  to share theconfidence expressed in your leadership  and to pledge thecooperation of the Barbados delegation in the work of thefifty-second session of the General Assembly.I also wish to convey our deep appreciation to HisExcellency Ambassador Razali Ismail for his outstandingstewardship of the fifty-first session. My delegationwelcomed the firm management and dispatch of theGeneral Assembly agenda which characterized his tenure asPresident. We would wish that this businesslike approachreflect the new direction of a reformed United Nations more efficient and more effective  to face the challenge ofrapid global change.The Assembly meets again for its review of the globalpolitical scene against a background of recurring strife andconflict in many parts of the world. The increasingdemands on the resources of the Organization continue tohamper implementation of its priority mission in the post-cold-war world  namely  promoting sustainabledevelopment and  in particular  the elimination of absolutepoverty.My delegation believes that the United Nations mustremain the conscience of the international community inthe fight against poverty and misery  which afflict somany of the world’s people. Yet we face the stark realitythat without peace  the fruits of development and thegoals of economic and social justice will remain for thema distant dream.The numerous conflicts  both old and new  whichdarken the global political scene underline the need for anew urgency in the quest for peace  so wherever conflictexists we call on all concerned parties to redouble theirefforts towards reconciliation and to accelerate theconditions for stability and economic and social progressfor their people.But  as we look to the new millennium  we believethat prospects for an era of lasting peace must extendbeyond traditional responses to conflict after they haveerupted. The promotion of a “Culture of Peace”  launchedby the United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO)  holds considerable promise. Itfocuses greater attention on prevention and addresses thecause of conflict at its roots. We share the view ofUNESCO that this challenge is broad and far-reachingand would require priority commitment by the UnitedNations system  non-governmental organizations  and civilsociety.Institutional reform and restructuring at both thenational and multilateral levels in response to rapid globalchange is an imperative  not an option. Barbados stronglysupports the United Nations reform process  and hasfollowed with deep interest the progress of the variousWorking Groups.The Working Group on an Agenda for Developmenthas completed its task. We now have a comprehensivedocument which embodies the main developmentpriorities contained in the various programmes of action.But if the Agenda is to be implemented  it must claimwide ownership  not only among the organs andspecialized agencies of the United Nations system  butamong the operational Ministries of Governments aswell — in particular  Ministries of Finance. Here weremain concerned that the critical question of the future11financing of development has not been resolved. This hasheightened uncertainty about the international commitmentto development cooperation  through which the UnitedNations system has played such an important supportiverole in developing countries.Negotiations taking place in the Working Group onreform of the Security Council should facilitate  not limit opportunities for membership of developing countries  andreflect the altered structure of the Organization since 1965.Barbados attaches particular importance to the principle ofopenness and transparency in the work of the Council andwelcomes the steps already taken in this direction throughregular briefings and monthly assessments by CouncilPresidents.Difficult negotiations remain on key issues  includingthe size of the Council  the nature of its enlargement andthe use of the veto. We must now step up consultations drawing on the useful proposals submitted by MemberStates and the Co-Chairmen of the Group. We hope suchnegotiations can be conducted in a timely and open manner in a spirit of compromise  and to the general satisfaction ofall.The report on the strengthening of the United Nationssystem contains many important recommendations forimproving the role and functioning of the GeneralAssembly and the accountability and efficiency of theSecretariat. Some may argue that these proposals do not gofar enough. In the view of my delegation  however  theyconstitute a firm basis on which the effectiveness of theseorgans can be built. We look forward to theirimplementation.My delegation remains deeply concerned about theprolonged financial crisis facing the Organization and theserious implications for its long-term viability. We believethat the United Nations is at the crossroads. Payment ofassessed contributions in full  on time and withoutconditions is a hallowed treaty obligation of Member States.Unilateral conditions  however convenient  constitute adangerous precedent which could hobble the United Nationsand the reform process for many years to come. We urgethe Working Group concerned to step up its efforts to putthe Organization on a more secure financial footing.Against this background of United Nations systemreform  we welcome the second phase of the Secretary-General’s reform programme “Renewing the UnitedNations: A Programme for Reform”. It contains many far-reaching proposals designed to streamline the organizationaland management structure of the United Nations and toimprove its overall effectiveness. My delegation willparticipate actively in the relevant forum which willconsider this report  and seek greater clarification andspecificity on a number of key recommendations.In principle  however  we believe that as chiefexecutive officer  accountable to Member States for theOrganization’s performance  the Secretary-General mustbe able to implement those management actions withinhis immediate authority. At the same time  we wouldcaution that reform should not be driven by staffreduction targets  nor predetermined by budgetaryconstraints. We believe reform should be guided by themandated objectives and priorities set by Member States as reflected in the various programmes of action of theglobal conferences  and the financial and human resourcesrequired to implement them.The scientific achievements of this century havebeen truly spectacular. We have visited the Moon andlived in outer space for months. We have made greatadvances in medicine and genetic engineering  ininformation technology  in high-speed mass transport andin food production  to mention only a few. Yet so muchremains to be done. Abject poverty  disease  illiteracy andill-health still afflict far too many fellow inhabitants ofthis planet as we approach the new millennium.This Organization has done much to alleviatesuffering. But it can continue to do so  and do so moreeffectively  only if Member States  according to theircapacities  give unselfishly of the financial and technicalresources necessary for the execution of its socialprogrammes.In Barbados  our own national developmentprogrammes underscore the Government’s assignment ofhighest priority to the social sectors  which at presentaccount for almost 40 per cent of total Governmentexpenditure. Through sustained economic growth supplemented by an effective social safety net  theGovernment aims to spread the benefits of developmentto all its people. Among new major programmes are Edutech 2000  a five-year education-sector programme aimedat enhancing the use of information technology bystudents and teachers  and the Youth EntrepreneurshipScheme  known as YES  which provides training business counselling  mentorship and access to finance foryoung entrepreneurs.12While our strong commitment to social policy has paidrich dividends  as illustrated by the successive highrankings of Barbados in the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) human development index  emergingproblems largely associated with poverty  particularlyamong youth  are of critical concern.The Government has therefore launched a majorinitiative in collaboration with UNDP to elaborate a plan ofaction for poverty alleviation including the feasibility of asocial-investment funding scheme. It will target pockets ofpoverty throughout the country and provide funding forprogrammes submitted by local non-governmentalorganizations and community groups  focusing on skillsacquisition and community empowerment. Through relatedpolicies  the Government is implementing measures topromote gender parity and the full integration of womenand youth in the development process.Barbados enjoys a robust democracy and so recognizesthe increasing influence of civil society in shaping nationalpolicy. The Government has taken a number of actions tofoster and to strengthen this participatory process  includingthe establishment of National Commissions on SocialJustice and on Reform of the Constitution. This underscoresthe highest priority we give to social justice and democracyand the importance we attach to keeping these fundamentalrights under periodic review.Barbados participated actively within the Alliance ofSmall Island States (AOSIS) during the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly  which reviewed theoutcome of the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development. We consider the Rio Conference to beone of the great achievements of the United Nations. Itunderscored the integration of environment anddevelopment policies through a comprehensive programmeof action — Agenda 21 — which speaks to the verysurvival of our planet. More particularly  it called theattention of the international community to the specialvulnerabilities of small island developing States through thefollow-up Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of the Small Island Developing States  andthe Barbados Programme of Action which it adopted.Barbados shared with other developing countries theexpectation that the special session would rekindle the spiritof Rio and reaffirm the commitments made for thefinancing of sustainable development. The special sessionclearly fell short of these expectations. Since Rio  progresshas been made in enacting international law andconventions in the areas of biodiversity  the seas  climatechange and desertification  and in implementingenvironmental policies at the national level. But thefailure of donors to honour commitments on finance andtechnology was clearly the most crucial factor limitingfurther implementation of Agenda 21.We welcome  however  the decision to hold a two-day special session to review the Barbados Programme ofAction in 1999. It is our hope that this review willreinforce the long-term viability of this Programme andunderscore the vital role small island developing Statesplay as a laboratory for the study of environmentalchange in the interest of all countries. While recognizingthat  through self-help  small island developing Statesmust do more to revitalize the Barbados Programme  weurge the international community to provide greaterfinancial support to strengthen its implementation especially its information network and technical assistancecomponents. The upcoming Caribbean ministerial meetingon the plan of action  scheduled to be held in Barbados inNovember  will give strategic direction to our preparatorywork over the next several months.I wish to turn briefly to specific developments ofmajor concern to the Caribbean region. The vulnerabilityof our region  both environmental and economic  is adaily reality. On the emerald isle of Montserrat  naturehas dealt a most cruel blow. There the people face notjust the effects of a natural calamity  but the distinctpossibility that their island home and way of life could beobliterated. The eruption of the Lange Soufriere HillsVolcano shows no signs of abating. Barbados has joinedits Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners inproviding financial and material assistance to the peopleof our sister isle in this time of crisis. We urge theinternational community to come to the assistance of thisbeleaguered island.Man-made disasters can be no less cruel. The recentdecision of the World Trade Organization panel on thebanana question has threatened the very lifeline of theexporting countries of the region. We know thatdiversification is the long-term answer. But sucheconomic transformation cannot be achieved overnight orwithout consistent support from the internationalcommunity. Barbados joins affected countries in appealingfor such support.Last June Barbados and the other CARICOM Stateswelcomed Haiti as the fourteenth member of ourCommunity. Haiti’s future is now linked to CARICOM’sfuture.13In supporting Haiti during its critical hour  CARICOMcountries cautioned then  and we do so again now  that thetask ahead would be long and difficult and that progresswould be uneven  and urged the international community tostay the course with Haiti. We are therefore grateful notjust to the Security Council for agreeing to a UnitedNations Transition Mission in Haiti whose mandate extendsto 30 November 1997  but also to the Friends of theSecretary-General for Haiti  and to other concerneddelegations that made this compromise possible. Thisextension will further professionalize the National Policeforce and enhance its capacity to secure the stability onwhich democracy and development can flourish.In May 1997 Barbados had the honour to host theCARICOM/United States summit on partnership forprosperity and security in the Caribbean. It underlined ourmutual economic and security interests and opened a newchapter in the CARICOM/United States partnership consistent with the changing global economy.The summit adopted the Bridgetown Declaration ofPrinciples. It will guide an ambitious action plan designedto promote sustainable development and foster democracy peace  and economic and social progress in the region.Barbados considers the summit an important landmark inCARICOM/United States cooperation. We look forward tomonitoring the action plan at annual meetings ofCARICOM Foreign Ministers and the Secretary of State ofthe United States of America  starting early in 1998. Wetrust that this process of consultation will embrace theconcerns of Caribbean countries over a number of criticalissues  such as the adverse impact of recent immigrationpolicy on the very fabric of Caribbean society.Barbados and the CARICOM States have beenparticularly concerned with the threat to democracy andsociety posed by drug trafficking  crime and violence money laundering and corruption. Our efforts to rid theCaribbean of those scourges have centred on increasedcooperation and information sharing and on thestrengthening and training of our police and coastguardforces. We welcome the valuable support for these effortsby our bilateral partners as well as by the Regional Officefor the Caribbean of the United Nations International DrugControl Programme. The special session of the GeneralAssembly on the issue of drugs next year will provide avaluable opportunity to share our experiences and also tolearn from those of others.Let me comment briefly on the phenomenon ofglobalization  which has reshaped the developmentlandscape  with far-reaching implications for theCaribbean Community. The reordering and strengtheningof CARICOM-United States cooperation are an integralpart of our adaptation to this powerful impulse. Throughthe liberalization of trade  finance and services and therapid expansion of telecommunications and informationtechnology  developing countries have become a drivingforce in this process  although the level and pace ofintegration differ widely among countries. Barbadosshares the anxiety of small developing States  which arehighly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercelycompetitive environment given our sparse natural andhuman-resource base and limited administrative andtechnical capacity.Globalization presents new opportunities for tradeand investment — witness the performance of East Asianeconomies. But the gains have been largely reaped by thestronger countries  leaving the weak even moredisadvantaged and the inequality between and withincountries even more pronounced. It is for this reason thatwe urge the United Nations to play a greater advocacyrole on behalf of vulnerable States in the policy dialogueon globalization.The CARICOM States recognize that we muststrengthen our technical capacity to negotiate effectivelyour integration into the global economy. Accordingly regional negotiating machinery has been established tomanage these crucial negotiations  which will determineour future relations with major trading blocs.This fifty-second session of the General Assemblyhas before it many critical issues. It must guide thereform process  which  in effect  will determine the veryfuture of the Organization. It must come to terms with thechronic and grave financial crisis that threatens theOrganization’s integrity and viability. It must redouble itsefforts to foster reconciliation and stability in the manystrife-torn countries where millions of people remaintrapped in poverty and deprivation.Barbados believes that this indispensable institutioncan meet these challenges. But it must expeditiously putits house in order so that it can intensify its efforts withregard to the priorities that define its unique mission ofpeace  development  democracy and social justice.Barbados pledges its full commitment and support.14"
"26",1038,"BRN",52,1997,"﻿Iextend my warmest congratulations to you  Mr. President on your election. I am sure you will guide us well  and welook forward to working with you.I would also like to congratulate our Secretary-Generalon the excellent start he has made in answer to theMembers’ call for reform. At the same time  I would liketo thank the outgoing President for his support in this mostimportant work.You take office at a critical time  Mr President. Thereare obviously no easy solutions to the many challengesfaced by our Organization. But there is one thing I hope wecan all do: be positive and constructive in our approach.With this in mind  I would like to comment briefly on twoaspects of current United Nations work that particularlyconcern us in Brunei Darussalam. The first is peace andsecurity and the second is the Secretary-General’s reformpackage.On peace and security  we were pleased to have hadthe chance to do something to help in the Middle East andin Bosnia and Herzegovina. But we have been dismayed bywhat has taken place this year  particularly in the MiddleEast. The current situation is not what we expected. Thedisruption of the peace process clearly started when Israeldecided to build settlements in East Jerusalem. This wasbad policy. It was obviously not aimed at helping the peaceprocess. Thus  we would like to see the Israelis dosomething positive to repair the damage done.We have made our position clear for many years. Wedo not wish to return to the past. It is time for more thanwords  arguments and resolutions. What we want to see isa peace process that actually proceeds. Somehow  theimpasse must be broken  and we greatly appreciate theefforts being made by Jordan  Egypt and the United Statesto do that. We encourage them and all countries that canhelp to continue their efforts  despite the many difficulties.Concerning the situation in Bosnia  we have also beendisappointed by the way certain elements continue toundermine the cause of peace. There are overwhelmingsigns from the peoples of Bosnia that they welcome thenew opportunities they have for a normal life. We aretherefore pleased to see the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and the United Nations taking strongaction to enforce the Dayton Agreement. In our view such action is definitely being taken on behalf of theBosnian people. We offer them our full support.These are just two of the areas where we have seensetbacks to United Nations efforts. We can add manyothers in Europe  Asia and Africa. What is requiredeverywhere is a determination to resolve all problemspeacefully by means of dialogue and negotiation.Given that spirit  progress is possible. We have seenevidence of it in the great efforts being made in northeastAsia to try to find a solution to the problems on theKorean Peninsula. The difficult situation in Korea couldaffect all of us in the Asia-Pacific region  so we verymuch welcome the four-party talks as a way of reducingtension and building confidence. For the same reason  weare happy to support the initiative of the KoreanPeninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) since it will help remove one serious threat to peace.On the question of lasting peace  however  we havelearned to take nothing for granted.Some causes of instability have been dramaticallyhighlighted in our own region this year. The recentattacks on our currencies and our financial institutionshave shocked us all. They cannot be dismissed as mereups and downs in the market. It is all very well forcommentators to say so  but this is not good enough; it istoo simplistic. The effect is like a disease  and it goes forthe heart of our economic systems. It seeks out weakpoints  and developing countries have limited built-inresistance.Yes  we will survive. Our foundations are sound. Butthe experience has taught us a lesson. We are realizinghow deeply we are all affected by globalization  marketforces and interdependence. The playing field is anythingbut level  and this means that the world organizations towhich we belong must be highly effective.The most important of these is the United Nations and this brings me to the questions I know the Secretary-General is keen to hear all of us answer at this session:What do we think of his package of proposed reforms?Are they going to help developing nations?My broad reply would be to say that we think thepackage is better than the previous attempts to achievereform. Overall  it firmly addresses the right questions 4and  having long supported the idea of United Nationsreform  we welcome the proposals.However  we do have a few comments to offer. Webelieve they are constructive and hope they will be takeninto account by the Secretary-General. As many others haveremarked  the proposal seems  basically  to be amanagement package. It reflects the Secretary-General’slong experience in the Organization. But good managementprinciples represent only one aspect of the reforms we need.We hope that an acceptable consensus will be reached onmatters which especially concern developing nations.We would like the Secretary-General to makeabsolutely sure that nothing is going to weaken the thingsthe United Nations does so well for ordinary people. TheUnited Nations work in the field gives the Organizationmeaning for millions. We must not let our agencies down.With regard to the proposals concerning peace andsecurity  we hope that the Working Group will sooncomplete its work on the Security Council. This aspect ofreform will certainly strengthen the Organization as awhole.With regard to development cooperation  we welcomeefforts to enhance it. It represents all that is best ininternational cooperation. It is also directly linked to theimportant Chapter IX of our Charter  which calls for higherstandards of living  full employment and economic andsocial progress. Without these  there can be no lastingpeace and security in the developing world.Lastly  there is the question of financial viability perhaps the most important of all if reforms are to beeffective. We find the various proposals interesting  butwhat we are concerned about is whether they provide along-term solution. We therefore want to give these mattersmore thought. Naturally  we rely on the Committee to lookvery carefully indeed into the details of any such scheme.Having made these points  I should like to concludeby once again offering my congratulations to the Secretary-General on his work. As I said  it is a good start. When thework is finished  we hope that the result will be not onlyadministrative reform but a strong renewal of the deepestprinciples of our Charter.We wish the Secretary-General  and you yourself  Mr.President  much success in the year ahead. We assure youthat we will do all we can to assist fellow Members inresponding well to what the Secretary-General has rightlydescribed as unprecedented demands and opportunities."
"27",1080,"BTN",52,1997,"﻿I have the honour to convey toall representatives the warm greetings and good wishes ofHis Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King of Bhutan  forthe success of the fifty-second session of the UnitedNations General Assembly.May I express  Sir  my heartfelt congratulations onyour election to the high office of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. We are confident that with your vastpersonal experience and in-depth knowledge of the UnitedNations you will lead our deliberations in this importantsession to a fruitful conclusion.I would like to express our deep appreciation toAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the bold andinnovative manner in which he led the fifty-first session ofthe General Assembly.I would like to take this opportunity to pay a specialtribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisdynamic leadership of our Organization. I wish tocongratulate him on his comprehensive report on the reformof the United Nations and also to express our appreciationto the Executive Coordinator for Reform and his team fortheir valuable contribution.This session of the General Assembly has been widelyregarded as a session for the reform of the United Nations.I shall therefore confine my remarks to this subject. Thequestion of United Nations reform is not a new issue andhas been the subject of ongoing discussions. We share theview that concrete steps must be taken this year so that thefeeling of uncertainty can be put behind us and we canconcentrate on other important challenges that confront ourOrganization.Before we embark on the task of reforming the UnitedNations it is important that we first understand what theUnited Nations means to different Member States. TheUnited Nations is certainly unparalleled in history as aforum for international dialogue and cooperation  as well asfor the maintenance of international peace and security.However  for many of the larger Members it remains butone of several means of pursuing their national interests.For smaller Member countries  however  the United Nationsremains the primary Organization for the protection andexpression of their sovereignty. Many of them also relyheavily on the United Nations for their economic and socialadvancement. Any reform of the United Nations musttherefore take into account the needs and aspirations ofthe majority of its Members  which are small developingcountries. The United Nations must be able to protect thepolitical independence of its smaller Members and supporttheir social and economic development in order to enablethem to meet their aspirations for peace and developmentwithout undue pressures or interference from outside.The proposal for reform submitted by the Secretary-General is significant in that he has not only sought theviews of Member States but has also taken into accountthe perspective of the United Nations staff  for thechanges would have a direct bearing on their functionsand responsibilities. In our view  this effort to involveMembers States as well as the United Nations staff willprovide a congenial atmosphere in which to discussreforms and their subsequent implementation.With regard to the reforms  there are clearly areaswhich fall within the mandate of the Secretary-General.It is our view that reforms which are already movingahead in some areas must be allowed to do so. We findmerit in clustering together various divisions within theUnited Nations Secretariat in the core areas of peace andsecurity  humanitarian affairs  economic and social affairsand human rights. We also find the various coordinationand planning mechanisms being put in place among thenew broad clusters necessary and useful.We look forward to receiving from the Secretary-General his report on the measures he is taking toimplement the organizational changes which are withinhis mandate. While the General Assembly and some ofthe existing consultative mechanisms exist and will nodoubt be used for interaction with the Secretariat  thereshould be mechanisms by which the general membershipcan interact with the newly formed divisions.The new post of Deputy Secretary-General isnecessary in our view  given the formidable number ofresponsibilities that the Secretary-General currently has toshoulder. The role of the Deputy Secretary-Generalshould  however  be clearly defined in the larger interestsof the Organization.The question of refocusing the work of the GeneralAssembly itself is an interesting proposal which we fullysupport. The long debates in the Assembly  as well as innumerous Committees  and the large number of issuesand resolutions  are well beyond the capacity of many ofthe smaller Member countries to handle. We support the4idea of dealing with thematic issues  both within theplenary and the Committees  during the annual sessions.We also support the view that the follow-up to allglobal conferences should be properly tied to the work ofthe General Assembly. The resolutions and other decisionsadopted during the General Assembly must be organized insuch a manner that they will have a direct bearing on thework of the Secretariat  providing both guidance anddirection.The proposed Development Group that has beenconstituted  bringing greater coordination of the three keyUnited Nations development agencies — namely  theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UnitedNations Population Fund (UNFPA) — is of special interestto the majority of small developing countries to which theactivities of these agencies provide significant support. Itmust be recognized that the coordination among these threeagencies must support the ongoing programmes which theseagencies have arrived at with individual countries and thatthe changes should be brought about without any disruptionto the current programmes  both in financial andprogramming terms.As a country which has benefited greatly from theactivities of UNDP  UNICEF and UNFPA  we express ourgratitude to these and other United Nations bodies andspecialized agencies for their assistance to my country. Theexperience of Bhutan and many smaller developingcountries clearly indicates that there is a continued role forthese United Nations bodies and agencies. It is our hopethat with better coordination within the Development Groupand field-level implementation of their activities there willbe enhanced financial support by the donor community.The proposal by the Secretary-General to have a high-level ministerial commission to review the work of otherUnited Nations agencies and their relationship with theGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat is timely. The workof the specialized agencies is extremely important  and it istime their methods of work and their activities werereviewed so that all United Nations programmes are bettersynchronized.All the efforts to reform and revitalize the UnitedNations will not be possible if the United Nations does nothave a sound financial position. The financial health of theUnited Nations must be restored. All members must workearnestly towards meeting this objective. We welcome theSecretary-General’s proposal to create a revolving creditfund to meet the Organization’s funding. However  theprimary requirement must be met from the assessedcontributions of Member States. In this regard  it is ourview that the negotiations on the scale of assessmentsmust proceed and be resolved at an early date in amanner that is acceptable to all Member States. We alsofirmly believe that all Member States must meet theirfinancial obligations to the Organization through theunconditional payment of their assessed dues in full andon time. The United Nations must also institute moredynamic means of fund management  including utilizationof the financial market in a prudent manner. All legalrestrictions to such management should be reviewed.One of the most important issues relating to thereform of the United Nations remains the membership ofthe Security Council. It is our view that the discussionson this issue  emanating from complex and fundamentallyinequitable premises  have led to the current difficulties.However  the continued status quo does not benefit thevast majority of Member States. Bhutan fully supports theNon-Aligned Movement’s position that there must beexpansion of the permanent membership to include thedeveloped and developing countries and that there shouldbe additional non-permanent seats. The expansion musttake into account the new security needs and the objectivecriteria  of who would best be able to shoulder the newresponsibilities. We believe that on the basis of objectivecriteria  Japan  as one of the foremost economic andpolitical powers in the world today  qualifies forpermanent membership. Among developing countries India’s case merits serious consideration for permanentmembership due to its massive population — one out ofnearly six people on our planet is an Indian — and itsgreat economic potential  in addition to the fact that Indiahas played an active role in all United Nations activities.Discussion on the expansion must continue  and weshould not be deterred by the complex nature of thesubject. We remain confident that an early and equitablesolution can be found.It is our hope that the reform of the United Nationsand the renewal of the United Nations can be completedin the two remaining years of this century  so that duringthe millennium session of the General Assembly  in theyear 2000  we can concentrate on the vision andaspirations of mankind for the twenty-first century."
"28",1121,"BWA",52,1997,"﻿Allow me  Sir  to expressto you and to your delegation our sincere congratulations onyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session. As you are an experienced UnitedNations diplomat  we entertain great expectations of yourtenure of office as President of the Assembly.We wish also to pay tribute to the outgoingPresident  His Excellency Ambassador Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  whose stewardship of the fifty-first session willforever be remembered for its creativity and dynamism.We wish him well and thank him and his country Malaysia  for a job well done.The Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  deserves inample measure our gratitude for the professionalism hehas demonstrated thus far in his leadership of the UnitedNations. His reports on the work of the Organization andon the wide-ranging reform of the United Nations systemrenew the confidence and trust we reposed in him whenwe elected him only nine months ago.We live in a rapidly changing world. The past fewyears have witnessed an unprecedented expansion ofworld trade and commerce  and the trend continuesunabated. National boundaries are being transcended withease in the interaction of national economies through aprocess which has been christened globalization. In theinternational political arena  there is increasing unanimityamongst the community of nations and other global actorsthat narrow national interests should be superseded byuniversal interests.These complex changes in the world outlook call foran enhanced role for the United Nations in internationalaffairs lest change become brutal  especially for thedeveloping countries. The United Nations has gained newinternational stature in recent years  thanks to theextirpation of the politics of paralysis of the cold-war era.“Blue Helmets” are today being deployed in situationsformerly considered to be outside the range of theresponsibility of the United Nations for the maintenanceof international peace and security.The United Nations has also built internationalconsensus through a series of conferences and meetingson areas and issues as diverse as women anddevelopment  youth  the environment  human rights ageing  population  social development and humansettlements  education and health  the outcome of whichwill guide the thinking and actions of the internationalcommunity into the next millennium. Furthermore  theUnited Nations has proved its capability to dealeffectively with the serious threats posed by nuclear chemical and biological weapons  a capability which isoften frustrated by a lack of political will andcommitment on the part of Member States.8In short  in the present-day reality  no one country  bigor small  rich or poor  weak or powerful  can exist inisolation or act unilaterally without suffering theconsequences of its actions. Terrorism  drug trafficking cross-border crime  the depletion of the ozone layer  acidrain  receding rain forests  advancing deserts  diminishingfresh-water reserves  poverty  disease and many morerecognize no national boundaries; only collective action bythe States Members of the Organization can arrest andreverse their advance.The United Nations is the mother of genuinemultilateralism  and it should occupy centre stage in ourthinking about international relations. The heavyresponsibilities reposed in the world body by present-dayinternational realities demand that the United Nationssystem should undergo substantial reform if it is to respondmore efficiently and effectively to the needs and concernsof its Member States and their peoples  now and in thefuture. The United Nations system needs to be streamlinedto remove administrative bottlenecks  weed out corruptionand other malpractices and eliminate duplication in theactivities of its organs  agencies  programmes  funds andoffices.It is in that spirit that Botswana welcomes the recentreform initiatives of the Secretary-General as the basis forfurther discussion and debate on the reform process. Mydelegation will have occasion to pronounce itself on thevarious elements of the reform package in due course. Atthis juncture  I can only observe that Botswana is disposedto a holistic consideration of the package by the GeneralAssembly. The reform proposals constitute a single unit and its constituent parts should be discussed with thatunderstanding in mind.This means  therefore  that those elements of thepackage — the greatest number  we would hope — whichare acceptable to the majority of delegations  or on whichgeneral consensus is attained  should be implementedforthwith. True  many of the proposals are indeedrevolutionary  as the Secretary-General himself concedes and  if approved  they would in a positive sense changepermanently the way the Organization operates. The reformpackage is the broadest and most extensive in the history ofthe United Nations and  in my view  is an appropriateresponse to the magnitude of the clamour for reform whichhas echoed through the halls of this Organization and whichfor some time now has even threatened its very existence.It would have been the height of absurdity for mydelegation to have expected the whole reform package to beagreeable or acceptable to every delegation in this Hall but I find the arguments and complaints from somequarters that the package does not go far enoughpreposterous to say the least. Reform  as the Secretary-General rightly reminds us  is not an event but a process.Reform should not and must not be apocalyptic. It cannotand must not become synonymous with the downsizing ofthe Organization to the extent that it would deprive it ofthe requisite human and material resources to renderservices to Member States  especially the developingcountries.Such reform would be inimical to the efficacy of theUnited Nations. Reform should lead to a more efficient more effective and more relevant United Nations  that isa United Nations with a capacity to foresee and respondadequately and expeditiously to imminent disastersituations around the world and to other needs andconcerns of humankind today.The Secretary-General’s reform proposals havesignalled the direction to take in the reform process; it isthe collaborative response of the Member States which isawaited. I believe we are all very serious about reform ofthe United Nations; now is the time to approve andimplement those reform proposals on which there isgeneral consensus. Our commitment  seriousness andsincerity about United Nations reform would increasinglybe called into doubt if by the beginning of the fifty-thirdsession of the Assembly we had not implemented any ofthe reform proposals contained in the Secretary-General’sreform package.No one country  region or group of countries canarrogate to itself the right to dictate the reform agenda.What should be established is a balanced  equitable andnon-discriminatory reform agenda in which the commonwishes and interests of every Member State can findexpression. This is the guiding principle my delegationwill follow in its contribution to the ongoing reformprocess.The Secretary-General’s reform package is not theonly momentous issue in the United Nations reformprocess. Close to four years have elapsed  and the debateon Security Council reform continues without an end insight. It is obvious that  unless we can suddenly acquireSolomonic wisdom  we are unlikely to come to asuccessful conclusion of this debate in another four years9or even much longer. Yet there has emerged a body ofthought which favours an increase in the membership of theSecurity Council  in both the permanent and non-permanentmember categories  to reflect the configuration of today’sinternational political realities.Botswana was a member of the Security Council untilthe end of last year  and we are convinced more than everbefore that the composition of the membership of theSecurity Council  as well as its working methods andprocedures  needs reform. It is time for the debate onSecurity Council reform to be brought to a successfulconclusion  so that all geographical regions can be equitablyrepresented in the Council. We should not allow the debateto become sterile or degenerate into a dialogue between thedeaf and the dumb.The financial health of the Organization is anotherissue which remains a source of deep concern and anguishto my delegation. The United Nations cannot be expectedto deliver the goods without the necessary financiallifeblood. In other words  the United Nations cannot operateon the basis of a shoestring budget and be expected to carryout the heavy responsibilities imposed on it every day byMember States. It is therefore imperative that each andevery Member State should meet its financial obligations tothis Organization on time  in full and without anyconditionalities  and clear all its arrears as a matter ofurgency.The international community has made considerableprogress in the struggle for democracy around the worldsince the end of the cold war. Today  peoples and nationsacross the spectrum of the African continent live in relativepeace and tranquillity and are engaged in the reconstructionof their national economies  thanks to the emergence of ademocratic culture. In spite of these positive developments the reality is that Africa is still bedeviled by deadlyconflicts.However  we are happy to acknowledge that fightinghas ceased in Liberia. The Liberian people have at long lastfreely chosen their leaders  and their verdict was respected.The long-suffering and economically plunderedDemocratic Republic of the Congo today enjoys relativepeace and security after a short but devastating crisis thatended with the overthrow of a 32-year dictatorship. Thepeople of the Democratic Republic of Congo need theunderstanding and sympathy of the international communityas they grapple with the reconstruction of their country.The final settlement of the conflict in Angolacontinues to elude the international community  but  thankGod  there has been no resumption of hostilities so far.Progress is painfully slow  due to the failure by UNITAto honour its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol  andespecially its refusal to disarm and demobilize its forces.The United Nations should monitor the situation inAngola very closely to ensure that the present slowprogress does not assume a state of permanence or leadto a reversal of the gains made so far under the Lusakaprocess.The international community should continue to paycloser attention to the situation in Somalia and help theSomali parties hold a peace conference through whichthey can settle  once and for all  their long-runningfratricidal conflict.There is a renewed sense of expectation that theefforts deployed to resolve the conflict in Western Saharawill bear fruit. It is our hope and wish that the Secretary-General  through his Personal Envoy  Mr. James Baker will achieve a breakthrough which will lead to the finalsettlement of the Western Sahara conflict in the very nearfuture.The situation in Sierra Leone is troubling. Theoverthrow of a democratically elected Government inSierra Leone five months ago was a most unfortunatereversal of the political gains that had been achieved inthat country. The international community has taken thecorrect line in making it clear that it will no longertolerate any military dictatorships. The rejection andisolation of the military junta in Sierra Leone shouldserve as a warning to military leaders with similar designsthat military rule is unacceptable  whatever thejustification. The ballot  and not the bullet  should be theonly way through which political leadership can changehands.While the situation in the Balkans remains generallytense  there is a light at the end of the tunnel signallingthe arrival of a new era of national reconciliation in theconstituent States of the former Yugoslavia. The time hascome for the various ethnic groups in the formerYugoslavia to realize that none of their countries can existas an ethnically pure State without causing politicaltensions and reawakening centuries-old hatreds. Theirfuture and destinies are  fortunately or unfortunately inextricably intertwined by reason of geography andhistory. They should accept their fate for what it is.Conflict and war have failed to resolve the ethnic10composition of these States in the past  and are unlikely toresolve them in the future.We salute the Secretary-General for his recentinitiative which brought together the leaders of the twosides in the Cyprus conflict in New York for talks. Weencourage him to continue his good offices until the partiesreach a final solution to this decades old conflict.Botswana supports the Middle East peace process.Experience has shown that peace in that complex cauldronof conflict cannot be achieved through war and bloodshed.Only painstaking and rigorous negotiations conducted in anatmosphere of give and take can lead to the desired result:the peace that everyone is yearning for in the Middle East.We hope that the State of Israel will realize theinsensitivity of the construction of new settlements onPalestinian lands. This has contributed in no small measureto the current crisis in the Middle East peace process. Noeffort should be spared to put the Middle East peaceprocess back on track so that the hopes and aspirations ofthe ordinary peoples of that region to live together in peaceas good neighbours may be realized.We welcome the ongoing talks between the twoKoreas  in which China and the United States are alsoparticipants. It is our ardent hope that the talks will lead toa decrease in political tensions in the Korean peninsula  andthat the two Koreas will henceforth establish some commonground which will assist in the eventual reunification oftheir divided country.I wish to welcome the recent conclusion of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction. I wish the Convention enjoyed thesupport of all nations. Anti-personnel mines are diabolicaland cowardly instruments of warfare which indiscriminatelykill and maim their unsuspecting victims. They should havebeen banned a long time ago  before they claimed morelives and maimed many people. It is our fervent desire thatthe Convention will soon enjoy the support of all MemberStates. It is hoped that the experience gained in thecampaign for the elaboration and conclusion of thisConvention will be extended to all weapons of massdestruction.Several developing countries are still wrestling withdaunting economic and social problems. The number ofcountries whose people still live in abject poverty and lackbasic nourishment is on the rise  especially in Africa.Regrettably  multilateral assistance is declining rapidly inrelation to the rising poverty in the developing countries.Only a handful of developed countries meet the agreedgoal of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to officialdevelopment assistance. At the same time  private capitalflows have been directed to only a few countries. TheUnited Nations funds and programmes are also unable toimplement their respective mandates due to lack ofresources. It is important that this trend be not onlyarrested but reversed through strengthened internationalcooperation for development.For meaningful development to take root in thedeveloping countries  an enabling internationalenvironment should be established which can addresssuch issues as macroeconomic stability  more open traderegimes in developed countries  stable financial systems reasonable debt initiatives  such as those proposed underthe World Bank’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries DebtInitiative  and greater financial flows from developedcountries to the developing countries. The internationalcommunity must also make concerted efforts to supportthe development programmes of the developing countriesin capacity-building  infrastructure and manpowerdevelopment.Obviously  there will be an absolute need for aturnaround in the political and economic orientation of thedeveloped countries in favour of global prosperity if theseobjectives are to be realized. It is such enlightenedthinking  which promises economic and political rewardsto the greatest number of the Member States of theUnited Nations  which is absent in the developmentbureaucracies of many developed countries.As always  our faith in the United Nations as arepository of the hopes and aspirations of humankind isgenuine  deep-rooted and unassailable. We are a youngand developing country in a troubled world — a worldcaught between the extremes of rampant globalization andresurgent isolationism. Our survival rests with this globalOrganization and its Charter  to which we pledge ourunstinting commitment and loyalty."
"29",1164,"CAF",52,1997,"﻿First and foremost  Sir  I would like to echothe eminent speakers who have already addressed you fromthis rostrum in conveying the warm congratulations of theCentral African delegation on your resounding election tothe presidency of this  the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly. The fact that you  Sir  have been chosenbears witness to the fact that your country  Ukraine continues to play an important role on the world stage.Your wealth of experience and your abilities as anexperienced diplomat augur well indeed for the success ofour work  and I can also assure you that you can count onour support and our availability to assist you.I would also like to express our fullest satisfactionwith the work of your predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  forthe talent and skill with which he so wonderfullydischarged his duties. And we assure His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General  whose election wasonly a just reward for his many years of service to theUnited Nations  of the renewed support of the people andGovernment of the Central African Republic.This session is being held at a delicate time in thehistory of our Organization  because it is faced with manydifferent political  economic  social  cultural  legal andinstitutional problems which call for the appropriatereforms.To renew the United Nations  to turn it into adynamic  democratic and effective organization  is a majorchallenge for this session  which the Secretary-Generalquite rightly described as the Reform Assembly. Hisbrilliant report presented on 16 July 1997 is perfectly intune with the Member States’ expectations  because it notonly highlights the challenges facing us on the threshold ofthe first century of a new millennium  but it also  andabove all  puts forward proposals for the longer term.The United Nations has a very important role to playin the areas of safeguarding and maintaining internationalpeace and security and promoting social and economicdevelopment  democracy  human rights and justice. TheOrganization must be reformed and strengthening so as tobetter confront the new realities of today’s world. TheCentral African Republic will make its own modestcontribution to this very important endeavour in closecollaboration with the member States of the Organizationof African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement.As regards reforming the Security Council  theCentral African Republic hopes that the Council will beexpanded so as to provide equitable geographicalrepresentation.But what about the ever-widening gap between threequarters of humankind and the remainder? What about theproliferation of armed conflicts against a backdrop ofintolerance  ethnic tension and deadly politicalconfrontations that jeopardize international peace andsecurity? Our Organization does not seem to be able tocome to grips with these problems.And yet  a few years ago  after a series of majorevents radically transformed the old post-war order  webelieved that the world was at last poised to move into anew era because of the ensuing clear-cut improvement inthe international political climate and the new possibilitiesfor cooperation that emerged. These were supposed tobuild confidence among nations and facilitate the questfor compromise on most of the questions of concern tothe international community.Regrettably  we were overly optimistic. In reflectingon the sad realities of the day  I have in mind particularlythe many human lives lost in vain in Algeria and thethousands of women and children forcibly torn from theirhomes and who  in the neighbouring Republic of theCongo  Burundi  Sierra Leone  Somalia and elsewhere are still paying a heavy price for our imperfections  ourcontradictions and our intolerance.I believe that it is time to call upon the internationalcommunity and our Organization — which in thisalarmingly serious case seems not to be fulfilling itsprimary responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security — to tackle resolutely the internalconflicts that are unfolding within our own States. Wemust address these new conflicts  which entail seriousviolations of fundamental human rights and which we areill-prepared to prevent and manage  because what is atstake is the very existence of our States  along with thebalance and cohesiveness of the international community.The Central African Republic had cause to welcomethe convening on 25 September last of the ministerial-level meeting of the member States of the SecurityCouncil devoted to the situation in Africa. The4recommendations emanating from those deliberations shouldbe translated into reality.The delegation of the Central African Republicnonetheless welcomes the fact that significant progresstowards peace has been achieved in Angola  Liberia andHaiti. But we continue to believe that a great deal of workremains to be done by the parties concerned to overcomethe obstacles standing in the way of reconciliation and therestoration of peace in the Middle East  in Afghanistan andin Cyprus.Unlike in other regions of the world  where renewedeconomic growth is henceforth irreversible  Africa’s lack ofgood performance and its economic and social situationremain a cause for concern in this era of globalization.However  we are not underestimating the scope and thecomplexity of the crucial problems facing the internationalcommunity at century’s end. To resolve these problems  anew type of cooperation is urgently needed so as not toexclude three quarters of humankind from the marchtowards progress and the common weal.Africa continues to experience immense economicdifficulties because of its lack of control over certainexternal factors affecting its development  such as thecollapse in the prices fetched by its commodities  its debtburden and the inadequacy of its capital flows  which haveprevented it from achieving sustained economic growth andraising the living standards of its peoples.Worse yet is the case of the least developed countries most of which are located on the African continent andwhose situation remains abysmal notwithstanding the timidsteps forward taken here and there. Though globalizationhas given rise to a new social contract  the principle ofpartnership and of shared responsibility between the leastdeveloped countries and the international community  withthe goal of reversing socio-economic decline and speedingup the process of sustained growth and sustainabledevelopment  should guide both sides in their commitment.Now the question is how to become competitive without thesupport of official development assistance  which iscontinuing to decline.As we see it  this alarming situation calls for apragmatic approach to cooperation between Africa and itspartners  in particular the international financial andmonetary institutions  which should not lose sight of thesefactors in determining modalities for cooperating with thecontinent and providing it access to global resources. Wecannot overemphasize the urgent need for a greater senseof responsibility and for a far stronger commitment on thepart of the entire international community vis-à-vis thiscontinent  which is foundering economically and socially.It is this new awareness that will help Africa emerge atlast from the chaos and anarchy that continue to engulf it.Without economic and social progress  there can beno talk of peace nor of democracy  because peace democracy and development go hand in hand. This isespecially true in the case of the Central AfricanRepublic  long known  owing to its long-standingcommitment to peace  as the Switzerland of Africa. ItsPresident  Ange-Félix Patassé  rose to the highest officein the land through free and transparent elections anddaily preached peace and dialogue in the Central Africansubregion. Nonetheless  the world was recently witness tothe sad spectacle of the Central African Republic’s beingassailed by what have come to be known as the serialmutinies of Bangui  simply because of its inability toconsolidate its still fledgling democratic experiencethrough sustained economic and social development.The case of the Central African Republic casts lighton the root causes of the wave of violence that issweeping our subregion. The mutinies — which tragically  lasted a full year and have thrown the entirecountry into near-civil war — occurred against thebackdrop of a tribally motivated attempt at regainingpower and as the result of manipulation by outside forcesseeking to put an end to our democratic process. But noneof this would have been possible had it not been for thevery difficult economic and social situation of ourcountry. The joint impact of a terrible legacy  the free-falldevaluation of the CFA franc and the chronically meagrerevenues coming into the public treasury had for allpractical purposes created a situation in which the Statecould no longer regularly pay its civil servants.The upshot of this crisis was all but catastrophicbecause the damage done by the tragic events of April May and November 1996 gravely undermined ourcountry’s potential for economic and social development.The technical committee set up to take stock of thedamage concluded that for the first two cases of mutinyalone  it would cost some 41.9 billion CFA francs tomake up for the losses experienced by the State businesses  projects and individuals — not to mention thecost of the measures needed to help the many victims ofthat conflict.Beyond the necessary mobilization of all ourcompatriots — to whom His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix5Patassé  President of the Republic  has issued a powerfulcall for the restoration of peace and national unity as afoundation for the genuine economic recovery of ourcountry — it is only appropriate for our partners and theentire international community to stand with us and notagainst us. For it is the intention of the Central AfricanRepublic to continue and consolidate the democratic processto which it is resolutely committed.And beyond the praiseworthy support of the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  my landlocked country must be given thewherewithal to continue to be — as we already are out ofa sense of moral duty — a land of welcome and hospitalityfor Sudanese  Rwandan  Burundian  Congolese and otherbrothers and sisters who are paying a heavy price for ourworld’s intolerance  ethnic tensions and deadly politicalwrangling.The fact is that it is in adversity that one knows one’strue friends. Our own adversity has enabled the people ofthe Central African Republic to gauge the sympathy andsolidarity they have enjoyed during the most trying times oftheir history. On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ange-FélixPatassé  President of the Republic and Head of State and ofGovernment  and of the people of the Central AfricanRepublic  I reiterate our thanks to the entire internationalcommunity  and most particularly to France  the FederalRepublic of Germany  the United States of America  Japan the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Gabon  Chad  Senegal  Togo  Mali  Burkina Faso  theUnited Nations  the Organization of African Unity and theEuropean Union  for the support and invaluable assistancethey are graciously according us.I take this opportunity also to convey particular thanksto all the States members of the Security Council  which on6 August last unanimously adopted resolution 1125 (1997)on the Central African Republic. The immediate effect ofthat decision was to deter open attempts at destabilization and to enable — as it continues to do — the Inter-AfricanMission to Monitor the Implementation of the BanguiAgreements (MISAB) better to ensure peace and securityin the capital and the provinces of the Central AfricanRepublic.The peace is still fragile and precarious  and on behalfof the entire people of the Central African Republic weurgently appeal to the United Nations to enable the mandateof MISAB to be extended until the Central AfricanRepublic possesses a loyal national army that can guaranteethe survival of our republican institutions.I wish the Assembly full success in its work on thebasis of the principle of universality which is so dear toour Organization."
"30",1210,"CAN",52,1997,"﻿May I first take thisopportunity to congratulate my very good friend  theForeign Minister of Ukraine  on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session and toconvey to him the best wishes of Canada for a successfuland productive association in this session. I know fromour long personal contacts that the course of thisimportant debate is in the best possible hands.Let me also take the opportunity to thank andcongratulate Ambassador Razali for his tireless andeffective leadership of the General Assembly at the fifty-first session.I come to the Assembly today with a sense ofurgency and an abiding faith and belief that we are nowemerging  not only from the shadows of the cold war  butalso from the uncertainties of its aftermath.Around the world  we see countless examples of thebasic principles and overall vision of the United NationsCharter being put into practice. The people of the worldare laying the foundations of a new international systemfor the new millennium.Of course  I recognize that no part of the world iswithout its burdens of conflict  grief and personalsuffering. Nor are there any great signs of relief from thegrowing burden of global economic inequities. What haschanged  however  is the new international willingness toface the issues  to mobilize political will and to launchreforms. There is a sense  not of helplessness  but ofhope. The old realities of power have not disappeared but alongside them have appeared new forces  newcoalitions and new ways of doing business — and theseforces are impatient. As we have seen  in fact  in recentdays  one person's vision and generosity can make adifference and stand as an inspiration to us all.This new spirit needs to be manifest and inspirethe work of the United Nations. The Secretary-Generalhas proposed a serious and far-sighted set of reforms.Canada strongly supports these proposals and acceptsthem as a package. They promise not simply greaterefficiency  but  we hope  greater effectiveness. Basedon our experiences in Canada  I can say with someauthority that budget-cutting by itself is not the answer.There must be serious structural change to modernizeexisting institutions  both national and international  thatwere formed over 50 years ago.To undertake these reforms  solutions must bebased on agreement and cooperation. Solutions cannotbe imposed by one country or one group  but rathermust be inspired by a sense of openness andinnovation. In other words  we must establish a newcompact amongst United Nations Members to set thisOrganization on a sound financial footing. AsMr. Udovenko has said  we are at a watershed  adefining moment for the Organization that can eitherprovide new momentum or stall our advance. Thedirection we take is ours collectively to decide and theoutcome in all our hands. We must not waste thisopportunity.(spoke in French)Another defining moment  I believe  took placejust over a week ago in Oslo. Ninety nations  spurredon by the efforts of the non-governmentalorganizations  agreed on the text of a treaty banninganti-personnel landmines. The treaty will be signed thiscoming December  just 14 months after it was firstconceived.(spoke in English)While visiting the treaty discussions in Oslo  I wasforcibly struck by how what has become known as theOttawa process demonstrates the changed character ofworld affairs. Above all  it shows how the breakdownof the old bipolar world affords new opportunities forcivil society  private individuals  to influencemultilateral diplomacy. The focus of the Ottawa process19is a weapon that slaughters countless civilians  a weaponthat has lost much of its military utility  whatever somemay say. This illustrates the growing feeling  comingfrom the grass roots of the world community  that theengines of war designed for the twentieth century haveno place in the twenty-first.I should say that this is not the only example of thenew grass-roots activism which points to the emergenceof a global commons as a powerful positive force ofglobalization. For example  Canadian women  appalled atthe treatment of their sisters in Afghanistan  have starteda letter-writing campaign. I will be delivering some 5 000letters today to the Secretary-General  which call on himto take the lead in exposing the gross human rightsviolations of women in Afghanistan as unacceptable inthe eyes of the world's citizens.The effectiveness of these new forces can be clearlymeasured. Nations from every region of the world havepledged to sign on to a complete ban on the stockpiling production  export and use of anti-personnel landmines.We hope to see more join our ranks between now andDecember. For those who are still on the sidelines  weask them to think hard and deep on this issue. Theirengagement is crucial. By joining us  already a majorityof United Nations Member States  they can help rid theworld of this most inhumane weapon.(spoke in French)Canada recently announced its intention to destroyits remaining stocks of anti-personnel mines beforesignature of the treaty. We will also shortly ratify theamended Protocol II of the Convention on CertainConventional Weapons.(spoke in English)This treaty constitutes a promise to futuregenerations. But it does not resolve the equally graveproblems posed by mines already in the ground  nor doesit address the plight of those who have experienceddirectly their dreadful impact.Following the signing of the treaty  the internationalcommunity will have an obligation to develop policies foran enhanced and coordinated approach to humanitariandemining  and to victim assistance and rehabilitation.This is  as much as anything else  a developmentissue. Heavily mined areas of the world cannot pursueeconomic development until they have been demined;and demining is a hopeless task if there is no treaty toprevent the laying of new mines.At Ottawa in December  we will invite nations toengage in a second phase of the campaign: a broadmobilization of groups and countries to tackle theaftermath of the landmines crisis. It is a monumentaltask  to be met only through the combined action of allStates. We invite all present to join us. The generosityof private citizens such as Ted Turner  or of the AutoWorkers' Union of Canada  and the commitment ofthose like Princess Diana must be matched  indeedsurpassed  by the Governments of this world.It is important to ask what is behind thiswillingness to tackle these old problems in a new way?What has brought us to the intersection of high hopesand new strategies  and the real ability to effect changein the world  as exemplified by the landminescampaign? To my mind  these developments and  aboveall the recognition of the need to adopt new approaches are in part a response to the changing face of war.In the second half of the twentieth century  wehave seen one type of conflict become prevalent. Theseare wars fought within  not between  States; wars thattend to be long and bitter; and wars  above all  in whichcivilians suffer the most and children and women areoften deliberately targeted. These are wars in which  inthe words of Saint-Exupéry “the firing line passesthrough the hearts of people”.As this type of war increasingly accounts for thegreat majority of all conflicts  the distinctions that onceinformed the work of international diplomacy —between military security concerns and humanitarian orcivil concerns — break down. This blurring of thelines  along with heightened media presence  hasstrongly affected international opinion. Fewer and fewerpeople are willing to view war as an acceptableinstrument of state policy.In the light of these changes  the concept ofhuman security  which I highlighted when I addressedthe Assembly last year  takes on growing relevance. Itis based on the premise that it is not enough to sparepeople from the “scourge of war” narrowly defined.Ensuring true  sustainable human security meanstackling other severe threats: the unmet needs of morethan a billion people living in poverty; attacks onhuman rights of individuals and groups within society;20transnational threats  such as crime and terrorism; andthreats to health and livelihood through depletion orpollution of our resources.The problems of these new global issues will notwait for long-term solutions. It is urgent that we takeaction to prevent or reduce the incidence of conflict  torestore societies in the aftermath of conflict and toincrease human security around the world.The priorities for action can  in my view  begrouped under three main headings: addressing issueswhich cut across traditional boundaries between areas ofconcern  such as we have in the landmines campaign;identifying and addressing the root causes of conflict; andimproving our ability to respond to crises when wecannot prevent them.Let me talk about that first priority. Landmines arenot the only complex  cross-cutting problem to beaddressed if we are to reduce the impact of conflict. Alltoo often it is small arms  rather than the major weaponssystems targeted by our disarmament efforts  that causethe greatest bloodshed. In the hands of terrorists criminals  the irregular militia and armed bands typical ofinternal conflict  these are the true weapons of massterror. As with landmines  their victims are all too oftencivilians.We welcome the recent report of the United NationsPanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms anddiscussions within the United Nations DisarmamentCommission on disarming combatants as a step towardsmore lasting peace. These should serve as the launchingpad from which to develop practical measures  inconsultation with regional bodies.(spoke in French)To tackle this problem  the first steps must be tocombat illicit trafficking in firearms and to bring greatertransparency to the legal exportation of small arms. TheOrganization of American States (OAS) is currentlyworking towards an Inter-American convention on illicittrafficking in firearms. Canada hopes that the OASnegotiations will result in an effective convention andwill also inspire other regional bodies to take action.(spoke in English)Ridding the world of anti-personnel landmines andbanning or limiting other forms of weapons directlyreduce the human suffering caused by conflict. Theother side of the same coin is building and enhancinghuman security. By building peace  reducingunsustainable military expenditures  promoting equitableand sustainable development and encouraging stable democratic societies which respect human rights  wenot only limit human suffering  but we also address theroot causes of conflict itself.To do this requires solutions that are built fromthe inside  not imposed from the outside. Sustainablepeace can be built only through the active cooperationand participation of Governments  peoples  and groupscaught in the conflict itself.At the same time  a parallel effort is required toreform the United Nations development funds andprogrammes. Canada strongly supports the Secretary-General's reform proposals in this area. We placepriority on improving coordination within the UnitedNations system at the country level  including amongthe specialized agencies and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  in order to maximize development impact.Canada  through diplomacy and developmentassistance  has supported peace-building activities incertain regions for many years. To give further impetusto this approach  last October I announced the Canadianpeace-building initiative. Its aim is to coordinateCanadian programmes and policies in support ofconflict prevention and resolution  peace-building andpost-conflict reconstruction. A peace-buildingmechanism or fund has provided a rapid responsemechanism in areas of conflict.Over the last six months  we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes: to providecritical start-up funding for the historical clarificationCommission in Guatemala; to assist the preparatorycommission for the establishment of an internationalcriminal court by underwriting the participation ofdelegates from developing countries; and to providefinancial assistance for the work of the joint UnitedNations/Organization of African Unity (OAU) SpecialRepresentative for the Great Lakes region of Africa Mr. Mohamed Sahnoun.In addition  Canada is prepared to contribute up to$500 000 from this fund for the establishment in Bosniaand Herzegovina of a non-governmental organizationfoundation to develop civil society on the basis of21multi-ethnic cooperation. I urge other members to join usin supporting this foundation.Finally  I am pleased to announce a Canadiancontribution of $500 000 from the peace-building fund tothe new United Nations Trust Fund for PreventiveAction  created by the Secretary-General in response to aproposal from the Norwegian Government.A second promising area of work on the root causesof conflict lies in exploring the links between securityand development  and particularly in reducing levels ofmilitary expenditures relative to economic and socialspending. Last year Canada sponsored  together with theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) a symposium on military expenditures indeveloping countries which brought together a wide rangeof experts who identified areas for further action: small-arms proliferation  about which I have just spoken regional security  good governance and the rule of law.The United Nations has established important toolsto build the confidence necessary for reductions inmilitary spending  in the form of the United NationsRegister of Conventional Arms and the United Nationsstandardized reports on national military expenditures.Much more work is needed  particularly at the regionallevel  to identify ways to reduce military spending and toredirect scarce national resources to the economic andsocial development goals.A third area of attention is work on conflict thatcomes from threats to environmental sustainability.Environmental problems have the capacity to imperilliving standards and to endanger the well-being of futuregenerations. For these reasons  Canada strongly supportsnew agreements on hazardous chemicals  includingpersistent organic pollutants  and will work to ensure thesuccess of the new intergovernmental forum on forests.Combating desertification also remains a priority for us and we have offered to host the DesertificationConvention secretariat.The fourth and final promising area in addressingthe root causes of conflict is human rights and goodgovernance. Next year we celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. This is an opportunity for all of us to reaffirmstrongly the fundamental importance of this documentand our commitment to the common standards it sets out.In recognition of the importance of thisanniversary  Canada will be sponsoring a broadprogramme of activities  including a major worldconference on human rights and the Internet  to drawtogether work being done in many international forums with a focus on strategies for using the newinternational telecommunications technology to increaserespect for human rights. We are working on thedevelopment and publication of an annual report on thestate of human rights worldwide  based on the findingsof the United Nations independent human rightsmechanisms. And we will hold a conference reviewingthe impact of the 1993 Vienna Declaration  to be heldby Canadian non-governmental organizations.Abuse of human rights is sometimes excused asnecessary in the interests of stability and nationalsecurity  but the facts show otherwise. Countries withdemocratic governments which respect the fundamentalrights of their citizens are less likely to wage war onone another. They are also more likely over time toachieve high levels of economic development.Recognizing this  Canada has recently undertakena series of new bilateral human rights initiatives. Ouraim is to work with our counterparts in other countriesto establish discussions between governments to fosterexchanges between institutions devoted to the protectionof human rights and civil-society initiatives and projectsfor the development of free media.We also fully support the Secretary-General’sproposals for reform measures to enhance UnitedNations work in human rights. And we welcome theappointment of Mary Robinson as High Commissionerfor Human Rights  and offer her our support.As we move towards the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  the challengesfacing the international community  if anything  haveincreased. The trend towards targeting civilians inwarfare has resulted in severe infringements of thebasic rights of women and children. Too often we haveseen children recruited as soldiers or women subjectedto sexual assault as a deliberate weapon of terror.Canada continues to make the rights of the childand of women  both in conflict and in peace  a top22human rights priority  which we pursue actively in theUnited Nations and elsewhere. We welcome theappointment of Mr. Olara Otunnu as SpecialRepresentative to study the impact of armed conflict onchildren. We will shortly host a preparatory meeting forthe main donor countries invited to the Oslo child labourconference. And domestically we have launched a ChildLabour Challenge Fund to support the efforts of ourprivate sector to address the problem of exploitative childlabour.Nowhere is the link between human rights andhuman security clearer than in the issue of children’srights. By protecting the basic rights of the world’schildren  we are nurturing a future generation of citizenswith both the means and the desire to live in peace.The final overall priority for action is crisisresponse. And despite our best efforts  there will be timeswhen conflict looms  or when it cannot be prevented.These situations call for rapid  decisive action  whether toforestall conflict or contain it when it breaks out. Theseactions include not only peacekeeping and other militarymeasures  but also humanitarian and judicial responses.To date  the international community appears tohave identified the lessons that the missions to Somalia Bosnia  Rwanda and Zaire have taught us  but not tohave learned from them. In crisis situations  speed is thekey to effective response. This is why Canada has beenso active in efforts to develop a United Nations rapid-response and deployment capability  in particular arapidly deployable mission headquarters here in NewYork. This would not only permit the timely insertion ofmilitary forces  but also integrate civilian andhumanitarian organizations into mission planning anddeployment.Canada hopes to see measurable progress on therapidly deployable headquarters and on the Danish-ledStandby Forces High-Readiness Brigade initiative. Theseimprovements to the United Nations rapid-responsecapability are complementary  feasible and should beimplemented without delay. Let us learn our lesson  andnot ignore it once again.In addition to rapid military and humanitarianreaction  a key element of the United Nations response toconflict is the application of justice and the internationalrule of law. Canada strongly supports the timelyestablishment of an independent  effective internationalcriminal court. In order to be effective  the court musthave inherent jurisdiction over the core crimes ofgenocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. Inorder to be independent  the court must not beprecluded from dealing with matters on the SecurityCouncil agenda.In conclusion  let me say that  as we all recognize the United Nations was originally established as aninstrument of international peace. Since that time  warhas put on a new face. More and more  it has targetedprimarily civilian populations. If the United Nations isto be effective — and I believe that the need foreffective multilateralism has never been greater — theUnited Nations must adapt to this changing face of war.At the same time  the United Nations must alsorecognize that it  too  has changed at its veryfoundation. Both its membership and its mandate haveexpanded  and the growing importance of UnitedNations development and humanitarian activities havemade their mark. Clearly  it is time for concertedreflection on the purpose and functioning of this bodythat we have built together — including on the difficultissues of financing and reform of the Security Council.The reform and expansion of the Security Councilis a major undertaking of direct concern to all MemberStates. The long-term implications must be fullydebated and carefully weighed  and the process must befair and open. It must attract a broad consensus andcannot be rushed to accommodate other goals —including a short-term solution to the United Nationsfinancial crisis. Canada wants to see a Security Councilthat is effective  transparent  broadly representative and above all  less elitist and more democratic. The primarycriteria for membership should be commitment to theideals and undertakings of the United Nations and awillingness to remain always accountable to the fullmembership of this Assembly.Broader United Nations reform must necessarilyfail so long as Member States continue to demand moreof a system to which they contribute less. Effectiveleadership and moral authority are rooted in respect forundertakings and obligations freely entered into byMember States. It is the responsibility of each andevery Member to pay its dues. These obligations applyin full  on time and without conditions.Looking ahead  there may be a time when we willchoose to reconsider aspects of the current financialunderpinnings of the United Nations. Indeed  we may23collectively decide that in order to broadenresponsibilities and share power in ways that betterreflect current international realities  some adjustments tothe scale of assessments are warranted. Such decisions however  can be neither prejudged nor presumed  andwould no doubt be influenced by the commitment ofthose advocating such changes to the broader purposes ofthis Organization.The international context in which the UnitedNations functions has changed profoundly. Around theworld  people are reshaping the way they live — be it byseeking more food  better air or greater democracy.Crucial to this massive transformation is the search forsecurity  through both the reduction of conflict and thebuilding of a better life in times of peace. The UnitedNations has long symbolized these dual hopes  for escapefrom “the scourge of war” and for “better standards oflife in larger freedom”.I close my remarks today on a note of hope  quotingPresident Václav Havel of the Czech Republic  who said “Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism.It is not a conviction that something will turn outwell  but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out.”Our hope lies in the certainty that the United Nations  asthe standard-bearer of international values  of a sense ofmultilateralism and of a sense of cooperation andpartnership  makes sense for all of us. This must spur uson in this Assembly for the challenges that lie ahead."
"31",1271,"CHL",52,1997,"﻿It is with particular pleasure that I extend to you  Mr.President  my sincerest congratulations  and those of myGovernment  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly. Your election will ensure that the business ofthe General Assembly will be conducted skilfully impartially and very efficiently at this important momentfor the General Assembly  when it will have to makedecisions that may be vital to the future of ourOrganization.The General Assembly session that we are nowbeginning is a particularly important one in that itspurpose is to ensure that in the future multilateral activitywill be assured of validity  effectiveness and credibility.With the United Nations having completed more than 50years of existence  we need new ways to view the world without forgetting the many achievements made and thevaluable experience gained both from successes and fromfailures.This is an appropriate time for us to renew ourcommitment to multilateralism as the guiding principle ofinternational relations and the essential tool to resolvecrises and problems that are beyond the ability of anyState  however important or powerful it may be  toresolve on its own.This is particularly important in the face of agrowing unilateralism that has recently emerged as afeature of the international scene. The new internationalreality makes it essential for States to act together so asto confront energetically and resolutely the problems ofthe environment  organized crime  arms control  humanrights  democratization  poverty  unemployment  socialfragmentation and many other issues.Chile has consistently contributed to theOrganization and  to the limits of its ability to do so  willcontinue to lend its strong support to the great work ofthe United Nations in all its forums.I wish to speak first of the issue of the SecurityCouncil and its reform process. I stressed before theGeneral Assembly last year the importance of greaterinvolvement by Member States in the decisions of theSecurity Council in order to strengthen its legitimacy and25give it the necessary political backing for the actions itundertakes.We reiterate once again the desirability of revising thecomposition of the Security Council and its workingmethods. In this connection  we appreciate the arduouswork conducted by the Working Group on this issue  whichhas served to clarify the various positions and to allow aproper appraisal of this enormously complex subject.I wish especially to pay tribute to the outgoingPresident of the General Assembly  Mr. Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  for his keen sense of responsibility and hiscourage in taking the initiative to make specific proposalson these matters in order to ease the difficultiesencountered within the Working Group and make itpossible to analyse and discuss them in specific terms.My Government considers that any future compositionof the Council must combine the requirements of itseffectiveness with the need for an equitable representationof the developing countries that properly reflects theincrease in the number of Members in the past 50 years.Where these fundamental issues are concerned  Chilesupports and endorses the content of the Declaration on thestrengthening of the United Nations and the reform of theSecurity Council issued by the Heads of State orGovernment at the eleventh summit of the Rio Group inAsunción  Paraguay  on 24 August of this year.In that Declaration we expressed the great importancewe attach to the process of expanding and reforming theSecurity Council  which must result in a broad generalagreement that will make it possible to correct theimbalances in its current composition  improve the decision-making mechanisms  make the conduct of its work moretransparent and represent with greater legitimacy all StatesMembers of the Organization.With regard to the total number of members of theSecurity Council  we believe that a membership of up to 25would not impair its effectiveness  provided that theexpansion met the requirements of responding properly tothe increase in United Nations Member States since the lastreform of the Charter and the undeniably growingimportance of developing countries.Chile shares in the broad base of agreement onallowing the entry of Germany and Japan as permanentmembers of the Security Council. Nevertheless  there isalso a conviction that this can take place only in the contextof suitable regional representation  including otherpermanent members from Asia  Africa and LatinAmerica.We support a process of regional consultation andconsensus to fill these seats. This  however  does notexclude a possible role for the General Assembly in casethere is an absence of regional agreement. In thisconnection  the Assembly will have to analyse carefullythe proposals that have been put forward regardingrotation. These are undoubtedly attractive since theyinclude a larger number of countries  but they couldimpair the effectiveness of the Council and increasetensions between permanent and non-permanent members.As far as the Latin American and Caribbean regionis concerned  its fundamental responsibility is to fill itsseats through a process that gives its members legalvalidity and political legitimacy. In this process consideration must be given to all the possibilities thatwill allow for appropriate regional representation. Chileis prepared to accept any formula that reflects this.Serious consideration must be given to the possibility thatonly one of its members will occupy the permanent seatallocated to the region.The question of the veto will also have to bediscussed in greater depth  taking into account manyfactors  such as legal ones relating to Charter obligationsand the evolution of modern international law  andpolitical ones  such as the evolution of the internationalsituation  which are today very different from thoseprevailing at the time the United Nations came into being.The outgoing President of the General Assembly hasmade some very interesting proposals in this regard which need to be carefully considered by Member States.Chile is concluding this year  with a sense ofsatisfaction  its participation in the Security Council afteran absence of more than 30 years. Our decision toparticipate was motivated by the need to assume ourinternational responsibilities  and we did so in theconviction that we could make a contribution.As a preliminary conclusion  I would like toemphasize that the rich contribution of the non-permanentmembers of the Council provides genuine balance andenables the Council to renew itself over time. Ourexperience has been a rewarding one  and we have soughtto focus our contribution  beyond our natural interest inissues relating to the Latin American region  on a number26of areas in which welcome progress has been made  towhich Chile has made an effective contribution.We welcome the important progress the Council hasmade regarding its responsibility in the humanitariansphere  which has necessarily become a major aspect of themaintenance of international peace and security. This is thefoundation of the presidential statement issued by theCouncil on the protection of humanitarian workers. Thestrengthening of this aspect of the Council's work was oneof the main issues in which Chile participated. Motivatedby our concern about this matter  we proposed a mechanismthat establishes the modalities by which the Councilcommunicates with the humanitarian agencies working inthe field.Similarly  Chile has been particularly concerned thatcountries that have experienced severe conflicts should notbe abandoned by the system once conflict ends. We havetherefore insisted on the need for a United Nations presencein the field when peace-building gives way to overallreconstruction and development activities.With respect to sanctions  it has been demonstratedthat  where authoritarian Governments are concerned  broadsanction regimes merely penalize the population withoutbringing about political change. We have noted the progressmade by the Council in devising sanctions  as in the caseof resolution 1072 (1996) on the situation in Burundi andthe one recently adopted on UNITA in Angola  which areindeed capable of yielding the desired results withoutharming innocent populations.Lastly  Chile has attached special importance toAfrican affairs while a member of the Security Council. Webelieved it important to assist the Council in takingdecisions on the problems that region is facing at thishistoric moment when African countries are assuming theirown responsibilities for regional problems  as has beenapparent in the Organization of African Unity initiative inthe Arusha process and the activities of the EconomicCommunity of West African States  among others.We are aware that the reform process is not confinedto the Security Council. The Secretary-General has told usclearly and lucidly that we are facing the most extensiveand farthest-reaching reforms in the 52 years of thisOrganization's history. Accordingly  we welcome hiscomprehensive report of last July  entitled  ""Renewing theUnited Nations: A programme for reform"". We agree withhis proposals aimed at transforming the leadership andmanagement structure of the United Nations so as to enableit to act with greater unity of purpose  coherence andagility in tackling the problems.We wish to convey to the Secretary-General and hiscolleagues our gratitude for the report  which the GeneralAssembly will have to analyse in depth  and Chile willcontribute to the debate with interest and dedication andin an open spirit of consensus.In this connection  we agree with the Secretary-General's statement that the major source of institutionalweakness in the United Nations is the fact that over thecourse of the past half century certain of its organizationalfeatures have tended to become fragmented  duplicatedand rigid  resulting in their ineffectiveness in some areasand superfluity in others. As Chile sees it  the mainobstacle to the reform process has been the fear of changethat exists in the Organization  which has paralysed theprocess since it began here in the General Assembly fouryears ago. The time has come for all of us  the Secretariatand Member States alike  to show proudly our collectivecreativity  courage and realistic inventiveness. The periodof bureaucratization in the United Nations must give wayto the era of creation.Only through flexible and efficient management willwe be able to give new impetus to the Organization andprovide it with the proper tools for the true modernizationthe international community demands. Reform is notintrinsically an exercise in cutting costs or reducing staff.Its aim is to ensure a real and growing increase in thepolitical effectiveness of the United Nations  from theSecurity Council and the way it deals with and resolvespresent-day conflicts in today's world to the Economicand Social Council and the development agencies.Many of the problems facing the Organization resultfrom the fact that Member States have been remiss inresponding to the need to adapt intergovernmentalmachinery to the new requirements of the internationalsituation. This is perhaps one of the main aspects of thereform process we have embarked upon.Accordingly  it is essential to proceed further withthe reorientation and restructuring of the Economic andSocial Council in order to coordinate both the agenciesand its subsidiary bodies so that it may engage inexecutive interaction with the functions of the GeneralAssembly. In that way  it can regain its leadershipposition as a flexible and efficient organ and contributeeffectively to answering the challenges on the economicand social agenda of the Organization.27Given this mandate of the Economic and SocialCouncil  its future relationship with the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund will be extremely important.In this connection  the establishment of a substantivesecretariat of the Economic and Social Council seems to usan interesting proposal.Furthermore  the reform process should leave room forthe progressive regionalization that is taking place withinthe United Nations system. In the review of the regionalcommissions to be carried out by the Economic and SocialCouncil  there is a need to find mechanisms which  withoutaffecting the regional mandates of each commission  cancontribute to the definition and regional implementation ofthe major agreements and consensuses reached by the majorconferences sponsored by the United Nations system overthe past decade.We are following with interest the proposal to give tothe Resident Coordinator of the Secretary-General authorityover all United Nations bodies in the field. This newintegrated approach  in which the funds and programmeswill retain their autonomy  will contribute to the necessarycohesion and reduce the natural tendency towardsdivergence between the multidisciplinary agenciesrepresented  thereby strengthening their activities.It also seems to us essential to evaluate the subsidiarybodies in greater depth  using as the main criteria theirrelevance and effectiveness  and to take the appropriatedecisions. Accordingly  we are concerned by therecommendation to merge the Commissions on NarcoticDrugs and on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice  sincethat would run the risk of limiting treatment of the problemof narcotic drugs merely to its criminal dimension  losingsight  in the process  of elements that are an inherent partof the drug issue  such as education and prevention. At thesame time  the reform process must assign specialimportance to measures and mechanisms designed toaccelerate economic and social development  especially inAfrica  by supporting domestic efforts at economicrestructuring  diversification of raw materials and increasedfood security being carried out by the countries of theregion.We welcome the proposals designed to strengthen theOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  bothinstitutionally and substantively  since they seem to us to beof great importance for the future development of theOrganization. The protection and promotion of humanrights and fundamental freedoms  together with democracyand equitable growth  are the three pillars of present-dayinternational society. As the Secretary-General himselfhas stated  they constitute an essential component ofinternational peace and security. Any measure thatcontributes to strengthening the ability of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights to take action willreceive the firm support of the Chilean delegation.Similarly  we strongly support the initiatives by theSecretary-General with regard to the proposals forinteraction between civil society and private enterprise which have become major actors at both the national andinternational levels. The time has come for civil society including the business community  to participate in theUnited Nations at a level that reflects the contribution thatit has been making for some time.A series of measures have been recommended to usthat are designed to make more flexible the proceduresfor deliberations in the General Assembly  to reduce thelength of meetings  apply a thematic approach to topicalissues  overcome delays and enable us to concentrate onthe most essential matters. While technically theseproposals appear to relate more to formal than tosubstantive aspects  we know that in fact they will not besimple or merely procedural decisions. In reality  theiraim is to promote the capacity of this Organization tobuild consensus  so as to arrive at concise decisions in theshortest possible time.On financial matters  we endorse the proposal forresults-based budgeting  with few institutionalmechanisms having a major strategic impact. This seemsto us an innovation will have far-reaching consequencesfor the Organization. We also support the idea ofreallocating savings to economic and social activitiesthrough the establishment of a development account.28We have focused our statement on the great task ofreform  which is difficult  complex and full of potential aswell as of problems. We are determined to find thesolutions that the United Nations requires if it is todischarge all its mandates and satisfy the demands andaspirations of an international community that is anxious toplace in the Organization great hopes for the future. We aredetermined not to let this opportunity to restructure andrenew the United Nations pass us by. The full cooperationof the Chilean delegation can be counted on in this effort."
"32",1317,"CHN",52,1997,"﻿Please allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly atits current session. I believe your wisdom and experiencewill enable you to accomplish your lofty mission withdistinction. At the same time  I would like to express myappreciation to Mr. Razali Ismail for his contribution asPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.This year  1997  is no ordinary year for China. LastFebruary  when Deng Xiaoping  the chief architect ofChina’s reform and opening-up  passed away  the 1.2billion Chinese people were immersed in deep sorrow.Turning grief into strength  we are determined to heed hisbehest by deepening reform  opening the country still widerto the outside world  stepping up national development andpromoting the cause of world peace. Here  on behalf of theChinese Government and people  I would like once againto thank the United Nations and its Member States for thesincere condolences they expressed on the passing of DengXiaoping. Your kind words gave us strength at our time ofbereavement.Just a few days ago  the Fifteenth National Congressof the Communist Party of China came to a triumphantconclusion in Beijing. This Congress  holding high the greatbanner of Deng Xiaoping theory  charts the future course ofChina’s development with a blueprint and displays theresolve to carry forward the cause of building socialismwith Chinese characteristics well into the twenty-firstcentury.On 1 July of this year  China resumed its exercise ofsovereignty over Hong Kong  which wiped out our nationalhumiliation of one and a half centuries and opened up anew chapter in our peaceful reunification. During the morethan two months since its return  Hong Kong has enjoyedsocial stability and economic prosperity  which fills thepeople of Hong Kong  of China and of the world at largewith great joy.The realization of Deng Xiaoping’s concept of “onecountry  two systems” in Hong Kong carries profoundsignificance. Firmly adhering to this concept  we willkeep up the peaceful reunification of our motherland byensuring a smooth return of Macao and eventuallyresolving the Taiwan question. Taiwan is an inalienablepart of Chinese territory  and the Taiwan question ispurely an internal affair of China. Any country thatattempts to use the Taiwan question to put pressure onChina or even clamours for “two Chinas” or “one China one Taiwan” has acted in total contravention of thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter andthe relevant General Assembly resolutions. Suchbehaviour will be absolutely unacceptable to the Chinesepeople  as well as to all the countries upholding justice inthe world.As the international situation continues to undergoprofound changes  peace and development have becomethe main themes of our times. The world is evolvingtowards multipolarity with growing diversity in countries’political  economic and cultural lives. This trend hasbecome an irresistible tide of history.The two world wars in the first half of the twentiethcentury plunged mankind into unprecedented havoc. Andthe cold war  which lasted for more than four decades inthe latter half of our century  kept humanity in the darkshadow of war. Reviewing the past and looking to thefuture  people throughout the world are anxiously waitingfor the establishment of a just and equitable newinternational political and economic order  and they arehoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in thecoming century.The cold-war security regime that featured militaryalliances and the arms race is  as has been proved incapable of making peace. Expanding military blocs andenhancing military alliances under new circumstances cando little to bring about greater security. Relations betweenStates should be based on the five principles of mutualrespect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutualnon-aggression  non-interference in each other’s internalaffairs  equality and mutual benefit and peacefulcoexistence. Each country has the right to choose a roadof development according to its own national conditions and no country should interfere in the internal affairs ofother countries on whatever grounds. This must serve asthe political prerequisite for global and regional security.16All countries should increase their mutually beneficialcooperation in the economic field  eliminate unequalpractices in trade and economic relations  and do away withdiscriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowingthe gap between the rich and the poor and achievingcommon prosperity. This should serve as the economicfoundation for global and regional security.All countries should step up consultation andcooperation in the security field  increase mutualunderstanding and trust  and undertake to settle throughpeaceful means  whatever differences and disputes they mayhave. This is the practical way to achieve global andregional security.In the first half of the year  five countries — China Russia  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan — signedthe agreement on mutual reduction of military forces in theborder areas; the four-party talks aimed at bringing about anew peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula werelaunched; and the Regional Forum of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) introduced apreliminary form of cooperation on security issues featuringequal participation and negotiated consensus. These aresome of the examples of searching for new models ofsecurity cooperation and of the initial progress alreadymade.We feel concerned about the recent setbacks in theMiddle East peace process. We are of the view that therelevant United Nations resolutions should be compliedwith  agreements reached among the parties concerned inthe peace process should be honoured  the principle of landfor peace should be adhered to  and terrorist activitiesshould stop. We hope that the parties concerned will worktogether on that basis so that the Madrid Peace Conferenceon peace in the Middle East will resume at an early date.We are also deeply concerned about the incessant conflictsand turmoil which have plagued Africa since the beginningof this year  and wish the African countries steady progressalong the road of peace and development.The past year has seen new progress in the field ofinternational arms control and disarmament. The ChemicalWeapons Convention has entered into force; the PreparatoryCommittee of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyhas started its work; the extent of nuclear-weapon-freezones is increasing; and negotiations on the efficacy of theBiological Weapons Convention have made furtherheadway.In our view  no one should try to monopolize themarket in the name of preventing proliferation or try tointerfere in the economic and technological cooperation ofother countries  developing countries in particular. Anoverhaul of the discriminatory and exclusivenon-proliferation regimes and arrangements is thusnecessary  on the basis of universal participation  and theUnited Nations should see to it that it accomplishessomething in this regard.We maintain that continued efforts should be madeto advance the process of multilateral arms control anddisarmament. The universality of international arms-control treaties should be strengthened and completeadherence to them ensured. Instead of weakening andundermining security  arms-control and disarmamentefforts should reinforce it. The target of disarmamentshould not be shifted to developing countries  as countrieswith the largest and most sophisticated arsenals bear aspecial responsibility for disarmament.I would also like to draw the Assembly’s attentionto China’s recent announcement of a unilateral step ofdisarmament — that is  having reduced its troop strengthby 1 million in the 1980s  China will further reduce itsmilitary by 500 000 troops within the next three years.This is a move of major significance in the field ofdisarmament.In the past year  the overall situation of the worldeconomy has been good. Economic links and mutualpenetration among countries and regions are on theconstant increase. The importance of internationalcooperation should be given a fresh evaluation with aview to making it broader  closer and more fruitful.Developing countries are most vulnerable to theimpact of adverse environmental conditions because oftheir weak economic foundations. At present  theinternational financial market is highly globalized andvery risky. We should work to stabilize the financialmarket and ensure steady economic growth of thedeveloping countries.The Uruguay Round agreements should beimplemented in a comprehensive  faithful and balancedmanner  and attempts to impose a linkage betweenenvironmental or labour standards and trade must beopposed.Environment and development pose a commonchallenge to mankind. The United Nations has held two17important conferences in the 1990s  setting forth a set ofguiding principles for the solution of the issue. We hope theinternational community  developed countries in particular will honour its pledges to provide funds and transfertechnology to the developing countries so as to translate thedeclaration of partnership into real action.Many transboundary issues  such as poverty unemployment  refugees  drugs and crime  need to beaddressed through consultation by the internationalcommunity. The work of the United Nations in the socialfield needs to be strengthened. All countries should  inkeeping with the principles of mutual respect  equality andmutual benefit  endeavour to promote internationalcooperation. They should get down to practical tasks  thefirst of which is to help developing countries deal with theirmost urgent difficulties. We hope that the special session ofthe General Assembly on international drug control scheduled for next year  will yield positive results byformulating a cross-century strategy for combating drug-related crimes through strengthened internationalcooperation along with effective measures ofimplementation.China will continue to support the United Nations inits work in the social field and will make a greatercontribution to social progress around the world.The realization of human rights is the common idealof mankind. All countries have made great efforts to thisend  with both achievements and lessons. We maintain thatthe universality of human rights should be respected; yettheir realization must be integrated with the conditions ofeach country. A review of United Nations practice over thepast 50 years and more shows that when countries orregions do this they will enjoy social stability  economicdevelopment and popular contentment. When they do not society will face disintegration  with people losing theirmost basic human rights and freedoms  and gross violationsof human rights will even take place when chaos erupts asa result of war.We say it is quite natural for people to differ on thehuman rights issue. The question is how to deal with thesedifferences. Which is the better approach: dialogue orconfrontation? I opt for dialogue. Only dialogue canenhance mutual understanding and cooperation.Confrontation  on the other hand  can only lead to furtherestrangement and do nobody any good. We are pleased tosee that more and more countries are in favour of dialoguein handling the human rights issue.The Chinese Government attaches importance tohuman rights and is dedicated to promoting and protectinghuman rights of its people. Having repeatedly sufferedfrom foreign aggression in the past  the Chinese peopleknow full well how state sovereignty and territorialintegrity fundamentally guarantee the realization of theirhuman rights. We in China — taking upon ourselves thetask of feeding  clothing  sheltering and educating  andproviding travel facilities to  our 1.2 billion people —know full well how vitally important our right tosubsistence and our right to development are. To enableour people to lead a freer  happier and more democraticlife  we are focusing above all on the development of oureconomy and on advancing democracy and our legalsystem.China will soon sign the International Covenant onEconomic  Social and Cultural Rights and is studyingearnestly the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights. We stand ready to work with other countries in acontinued effort to promote cooperation in theinternational human rights field.As the most important intergovernmentalorganization in the world  the United Nations occupies anirreplaceable position in international life. At the sametime  an evolving situation calls for reform of the UnitedNations.Last July  Secretary-General Kofi Annan submittedan extensive report on the reform of the United Nations.We appreciate his effort.We are in favour of reforming the United Nations.The purpose of such reform is to strengthen the role ofthe United Nations and enhance its efficiency. Measurestaken in this regard must reflect the common interests ofall Member States and the results must be able to standthe test of time. To this end  we offer the followingviews.United Nations reform is the shared cause of allMember States. It should allow full play to democracy heed the voices of all sides and take into account theinterests of various parties. The reform plan should bewidely acceptable to Member States.To enhance efficiency  an appropriate reduction ofpersonnel and expenditure is necessary. What isimportant  however  is for the reform to put greateremphasis on development issues with a view to18strengthening rather than weakening the United Nations rolein the promotion of economic and social development.The reform should help preserve the diversity in theUnited Nations  which is a microcosm of the diversity ofthe world. Only when world diversity is recognized andrespected can different countries live in harmony and makeprogress together.The reform should stress practical results  place valueon quality  and progress in an incremental manner.The enlargement of the Security Council should followthe principle of equitable geographical distribution andensure a proper balance between developing and developedcountries. The Security Council will better perform the loftymission entrusted to it under the United Nations Charteronly when it becomes more broadly representative.Payment of assessed dues is the bounden duty ofevery Member State under the Charter of the UnitedNations. We urge the countries concerned to pay off theirarrears without conditions and as early as possible in orderto put the United Nations on a sound financial basis fornormal operation.Countries around the world need the United Nations.So does the United Nations need their support."
"33",1351,"CIV",52,1997,"﻿The illustrious election of the President of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations at its fifty-second session is not only a well-deserved tribute to hiscountry  Ukraine  in recognition of its important role onthe international scene  but an acknowledgement of hisown human and professional qualities and  above all  hisrich experience in international relations and in the UnitedNations system. Furthermore  as his former colleaguewhen I was Permanent Representative of my own countryhere for many years  I am personally delighted at thiswell-deserved demonstration of the confidence theinternational community has in him. It is therefore apleasure for me  on behalf of the delegation of Côted’Ivoire  to address to him and to the other members ofthe Bureau our sincere congratulations and to assure himof our full support in the accomplishment of his mission.21I also extend my heartfelt thanks to his predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail  for his remarkable efforts togive decisive impetus to the process of the reform of ourOrganization.Finally  I should like to extend my warmestcongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan  a worthy son of Africa on his illustrious election as Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  and I pay heartfelt tribute to him for thegreat competence that he has unfailingly demonstrated atthe head of the United Nations. In less than a year he hasbeen able to instil our Organization with a new dynamismthrough actions that bear witness to his firm will tostrengthen the effectiveness and credibility of the UnitedNations and to improve its operations in facing the manycomplex demands of the world at the dawn of a newmillennium. We assure him of the support of the delegationof Côte d’Ivoire in his noble and exhilarating task.I also take this opportunity to extend my warmcongratulations to Mrs. Mary Robinson on her appointmentto the post of United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights. We consider her strong personality to be aguarantee of success in the delicate and important missionwith which she has been entrusted. We assure her of ourcomplete support in the exercise of her new functions.Today  regardless of what our assessment of the workof the United Nations may be  it is necessary to recognizethat it remains a unique and irreplaceable tool for dialogueamong nations at the service of international peace andsecurity.Clearly  it is unanimously held that the United Nationsis useful and that it must exist; with equal unanimity wecall for its revitalization. The question of the reform of theUnited Nations is thus at the heart of this session  whichstrikingly demonstrates how necessary and urgent it is. TheSecretary-General rightly proclaimed this session thesession of reform.Adapting the United Nations to make it better able toenter the next millennium seems to be the great challengeof the reform to which we all aspire.But before expressing my delegation’s observations onthe Secretary-General’s proposals for reform  I should liketo share some of our major concerns  which I believe mustbe taken into account if the continent to which my countrybelongs is to experience real development commensuratewith its immense potential. I wish to speak about conflictmanagement in Africa and international cooperation forthe economic and social development of Africa.One cannot fail to note that over 60 per cent of theagenda of the Security Council is devoted to situations inAfrica  and that of the 48 least developed countries  35are in Africa.In respect of conflicts in Africa  our continent hastaken charge of its own destiny. To this end  it establishedlegal instruments at the Organization of African Unity(OAU) summit in Cairo in 1993  in the form of theMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution. If this venture is going to work Africa needsabove all the support of the international community inthe framework of a partnership with the United Nations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter.Thus in Liberia  at the end of a seven-year fratricidalwar which devastated that fraternal country and causedenormous damage to neighbouring countries such asGuinea and Côte d’Ivoire that had to deal with massiveflows of refugees and displaced persons  the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) was ableto broker a peace process which led to the election ofMr. Charles G. Taylor as President of the Republic on 19July 1997 in elections that the OAU and the UnitedNations recognized as just and democratic.In the context of the meeting to support thereconstruction of Liberia which will take place tomorrow I would like to make an urgent appeal to donor countriesand international and non-governmental organizations tobe generous  because a reconstructed and prosperousLiberia can only benefit our entire subregion.While we are delighted at the positive developmentof the situation in Liberia  a military coup d’état on 25May 1997 put an end to the constitutional order in SierraLeone by overthrowing a democratically elected President Mr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Côte d’Ivoire immediatelycondemned the coup d’état  which belongs to a bygoneera.The thirty-third meeting of heads of State andGovernment of the OAU  held in Harare from 2 to 4 June1997  by its decision 356 also condemned the coup d’état as did the Secretary-General of the United Nations andthe Presidents of the Security Council on 27 May  11 Julyand 6 August 1997  who all demanded the immediate andunconditional restoration of constitutional order.22Unfortunately  the negotiations initiated by the groupof five States mandated by ECOWAS with therepresentatives of the junta in power in Freetown have sofar not succeeded in achieving the objectives of theinternational community. Therefore  the heads of State during the last ECOWAS summit  in Abuja on 28 and 29August 1997  were obliged to take a certain number ofmeasures which we hope will be endorsed by the SecurityCouncil to allow the Committee of Five to resume  with thecomplete support of the international community  newnegotiations for a return to constitutional order in SierraLeone  a country whose instability remains a serious threatto the fledgling Liberian democracy and the entiresubregion.In the view of the OAU  ECOWAS and the SecurityCouncil  the Abidjan peace agreement of 30 November1996  signed by President Kabbah and the leader of theRevolutionary United Front (RUF)  Mr. Foday Sankoh remains the best framework for finding a definitive solutionto the crisis in Sierra Leone. Once constitutional order isrestored  Côte d’Ivoire is prepared to organize  togetherwith the other guarantors of this agreement and the partiesconcerned  a conference aimed at reactivating the manyorgans of that agreement in order to find a lasting solutionto this crisis.In Central Africa  we remain profoundly concerned bythe fratricidal battles now taking place in the Congo. In thisrespect  we wish to express our sincere appreciation toMr. Omar Bongo  President of the Gabonese Republic  forhis patient and courageous mediation in the inter-Congoleseconflict. While urging him to continue his noble efforts  weregret the deterioration of the situation and above all thefact that no cease-fire has been accepted by the warringparties  which has prevented the establishment of anAfrican interposition force.In the Central African Republic  we welcome the roleof the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementationof the Bangui Agreements (MISAB)  which has helpedstabilize the situation.In respect of the crisis in the Comoros  we urgentlyappeal to all parties to give priority to dialogue and torespond favourably to the OAU initiative with a view toholding a conference in Addis Ababa to find a solution. Weinvite the international community to support the efforts ofthe OAU and to give the Comoros all the economic andfinancial assistance it needs to confront the difficulties it isfacing  which are the root cause of the crisis.With regard to Angola  we take note of the recentSecurity Council resolution 1130 (1997)  which wasadopted unanimously. While we welcome the recentmeasures taken by UNITA in response to the Council’sappeal  we hope that it will persevere in that direction inorder to meet all its obligations pursuant to the LusakaProtocol.Finally  in respect of the question of Western Sahara we applaud the progress made during the series ofmeetings under the auspices of the Special Envoy of theSecretary-General of the United Nations for WesternSahara  Mr. James Baker III  with a view to holding areferendum on self-determination.Given the renewed upsurge of instability and conflictin many parts of Africa  we fervently appeal to the UnitedNations to organize a regional conference in collaborationwith the OAU and ECOWAS to deal with the illicitcirculation of small arms in the West African subregion in accordance with General Assembly resolution 51/45.In the same context  we are delighted with theresults of the Oslo conference on anti-personnellandmines  and in view of the human disasters that thistype of weapon continues to cause in Africa and theworld over  we urge all States to adhere to the results andrespect the terms.My delegation believes that the present state of ourcontinent requires a concerted policy of internationalsecurity and implementation of preventive strategies  andCôte d’Ivoire intends to be actively involved. This is why in defining recently new missions for Côte d’Ivoire’sarmed forces  President Henri Konan Bédié specified thatthey can henceforth participate in peacekeeping operationsand that they stand ready to carry out possible protectionand security missions which might be conferred uponthem by the international community.More specifically  it seems to us increasinglynecessary to have a standing African interposition force.In western Africa  for example  ECOWAS  drawing fromthe experience of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group(ECOMOG) in the settlement of the Liberian conflict could envisage the reorganization of this force in order tomake it a genuine subregional force. In this context consultations for the establishment of a peacekeepingforce are under way in the framework of the Agreementon Non-Aggression and Assistance in Matters of Defense(ANAD) which includes Côte d’Ivoire  Senegal  BurkinaFaso  Benin  Niger  Mali  Mauritania and Togo.23The elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force wouldbe coordinated in predetermined tactical or logisticalmodules in a state of operational readiness on theirrespective territories and could be sent into action at shortnotice. These stand-by elements could be regrouped at therequest of ECOWAS  the OAU or the United Nations.However effective our rapid-reaction capacity may be we will have to seek  above all  to strengthen the effectiverule of democracy and the rule of law in each of ourcountries in order to avoid crises turning into armedconflict.Above all  every country must seek to achieve politicalstability and to promote social progress by establishingreliable democratic institutions based on freedom andjustice and which guarantee the protection of the citizen andindividual rights. We must develop the elements of goodgovernance and promote the emergence of responsiblesociety.For its part  Côte d’Ivoire under the leadership ofPresident Henri Konan Bédié  is endeavouring day by dayto strengthen democracy and the rule of law by resoluteaction towards a peaceful democracy.Recent measures in this connection have beenannounced  including the forthcoming opening of theGovernment to the opposition  the granting of status to theleaders of the opposition parties represented in Parliament;the creation of a Senate whose President will be actingHead of State in the event of a power vacuum; and thecreation of a National Commission for monitoring andarbitration of elections. It will be presided over by a judgeand made up of personalities and representatives of theleading political parties  along with international observersfrom the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the UnitedNations  the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  the European Union and the CanadianElectoral Committee. All of those elements are contributingto speeding the progress of democracy in Côte d’Ivoire.Lastly  our people remain profoundly committed to theculture of peace  and it is to that commitment that Côted’Ivoire owes its unquestioned political stability  based onthe constancy of social dialogue and on the desire forshared progress that strengthens social unity. That is whymy delegation  along with a number of co-sponsors  intendsto submit to this session of the General Assembly  as it didat the summer session of the Economic and Social Councilheld last July at Geneva  a draft resolution proclaiming theyear 2000 as the international year for the culture of peace.My second subject of concern relates to the effectsof globalization on African economies with respect toaccess to foreign markets  the volume of officialdevelopment assistance and favourable treatment forforeign debt.With regard to access to foreign markets globalization  carried out in the name of liberalization andcompetitiveness  has led to the erosion and even theeradication of preferences that allow the goods of ourcountries to gain access to the markets of developedcountries. We must be given time to adapt  or becompensated in some other way  if our countries are toparticipate in international trade to their full potential. Wecommend the recent United States initiative  “Growth andopportunity in Africa”  which is aimed  inter alia  atpromoting the access of African goods to the Americanmarket.With regard to the effect of globalization on thevolume of official development assistance  we note thatfor all the enthusiasm for the development of the privatesector — development which we welcome  recognizingthat private investment is the driving force of economicgrowth — a trend towards a decline in officialdevelopment assistance  despite its importance in the fightagainst poverty in our countries. That trend concerns us because official development assistance is essential insupporting our domestic efforts  above all in sectorsrelated to the development of human resources. Wetherefore urge the donor countries to redouble their effortsto achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of their grossdomestic product.Lastly  with regard to the question of foreign debt there is now broad agreement that without favourabletreatment for the stock of African debt  particularly in themost heavily indebted countries  no economic recoveryprogramme can produce the desired long-term positiveeffects. We must therefore insist that serious considerationbe given to measures in this regard. We welcome themeasures recently taken in favour of Uganda  Bolivia andBurkina Faso within the framework of the debt-alleviationInitiative of the International Monetary Fund  the WorldBank and the Paris Club. I am delighted to learn that myown country  Côte d’Ivoire  along with Mozambique andGuyana  will be the next to benefit from that Initiative. Iwould also note that my country is involved in asatisfactory dialogue with the London Club with a viewto a significant restructuring of our commercial debt.24Turning to the question of United Nations reform which lies at the heart of this session  we must distinguishbetween two aspects that dovetail to form a single coherentand logical unit. We have on the one hand the reformsbeing set in motion by Member States and on the other theprogramme of reforms proposed by the Secretary-Generalin his report (A/51/950) of 14 July 1997.With regard to the reforms being driven by MemberStates  I would refer to the activities of various open-endedWorking Groups of the General Assembly. Havingpersonally been privileged to conduct the consultations thatled to the establishment of three of those Groups during myown term of office as President of the forty-ninth session I am pleased to note the relatively positive results of two ofthem: the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on AnAgenda for Development and the Open-ended High-LevelWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United NationsSystem. The States participating in those Groups haveshown a magnificent spirit of solidarity.The Agenda for Development  adopted last June bythe General Assembly  is an important stage in the dialoguebetween nations on international cooperation fordevelopment. It establishes the consensus framework withinwhich developed and developing countries can work toestablish on a more solid basis a renewed and strengthenedpartnership for development based on mutual advantage.The Open-ended High-Level Working Group on theStrengthening of the United Nations System  which has hadto deal mainly with the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly and the Secretariat  has producedrecommendations that are part of the dynamics of thereforms proposed by the Secretary-General  inter alia  torationalize the work of the General Assembly and itssubsidiary bodies. My delegation is pleased with thosepositive results.With regard to the High-Level Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations andthe Open-ended Working Group on the reform of theSecurity Council  we cannot help but feel frustrated thatthey are apparently bogged down and have not made theexpected progress.We are all aware of the crucial importance of thefinancial situation of the United Nations. The success of theentire reform process depends on a solution to thatquestion. We should like to reaffirm here the need for allMember States to fulfil their obligations under Article 19 ofthe Charter  namely  to honour their financial obligationstowards the United Nations fully  on time and withoutconditions. Similarly  we express our complete support forthe principle of capacity to pay as a basis for the scale ofassessments. We believe it is necessary to deal with thosequestions courageously and responsibly in order toprovide our Organization with a viable  sound and solidfinancial base.Turning to the important question of SecurityCouncil reform  our position is that of the African Groupas defined at the recent Summit Meeting of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) at Harare  whichstressed that the new configuration of the SecurityCouncil must reflect the realities of today’s world througha geographically equitable representation of all the regionsof the world. In that connection  my delegation  while infavour of the admission of Germany and Japan aspermanent members of the Security Council  is of theopinion that Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean  aswell as Asia  should also be represented as permanentmembers of the Security Council.The new permanent members should have the sameprerogatives as the present permanent members  inparticular as regards the right of the veto  which  if notdone away with entirely  should be restricted to theconditions set forth in Chapter VII of the Charter.Turning to the reforms proposed by the Secretary-General  I want to express my delegation’s sincerecongratulations on the work accomplished. These reformsare the broadest and most profound that we have everseen. My delegation therefore supports thementhusiastically.It is our expectation that this reform process willlead to the promotion of the economic and socialdevelopment of less developed Member States  thestrengthening of multilateralism and an increase in theUnited Nations effectiveness and credibility.T oaccomplish that  we must see to it that the reformexercise is not confined to an obsessive desire purely andsimply to reduce costs.The measures aimed at increasing the Secretary-General’s guidance and management capacity seem to usamply justified. In fact  the presence of a DeputySecretary-General  a Senior Management Group and aStrategic Planning Unit will provide the Secretary-Generalwith an internal support mechanism that will considerablystrengthen his authority and his overall control system-wide.25The new configuration of the Secretariat organizationalchart is attractive in its concision and coherence  but aboveall in its objective of effectiveness. Nonetheless  thecomprehensive measures aimed at regrouping 12 entitiesand administrative units into five services should not resultin either a decline in the programme level of operationalactivities for development or in a decrease in the quality oftechnical cooperation services due to a reduction of staff.In the same context  the establishment of aDevelopment Group composed mainly of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United NationsPopulation Fund (UNFPA) should not affect the dynamicnature of their activities in the field.Lastly  the proposals of the Secretary-General torefocus the work of the General Assembly on high-priorityquestions and to reduce the duration of its sessions reflecta concern for rationalization that we fully support.We agree with the Secretary-General’s statement thatreform is a continuous process and not a one-time event. Infact  this reform is the result of an entire series ofreflections that began in the 1970s within and outside theUnited Nations system to adapt it to the changes that havetaken place since 1945. I have in mind the report of theFord Foundation  the Bertrand report  the work of theCarlsson group and the work of many universities in theUnited States and in Europe  whose research clarified manyaspects of our debates  especially during the work of theworking groups on the different aspects of reform.Nonetheless  any reform is above all part of a certainlogic aimed at achieving an objective. But its success in thefinal analysis will depend on the quality of the individualswho are going to implement it  and above all on thepolitical will of the States that will be called upon to worktogether to respect the spirit of compromise that made itpossible to arrive at the package.For its part  Côte d’Ivoire is prepared to participateactively with other delegations when the time comes in theconstructive consideration of the Secretary-General’sproposals for reform. Their consequences involve all of us."
"34",1438,"COD",52,1997,"﻿I wish from this rostrum tocongratulate His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on hisunanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session. I am certain that thesuccessful conduct of the work of this session will justifythe confidence we all have in his outstanding qualities as astatesman.I wish also to pay tribute to his predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail  whose ability and intelligencewon the high regard of us all.Let me pay tribute also to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dedication to the cause ofinternational peace and security and for his in-depthknowledge of the issues on which the future of worldpeace depends.I want to emphasize my country’s commitment tothe Charter ideals of peace  security  democracy  humanrights and development. It is for the triumph of thoseideals that we have struggled. The Democratic Republicof the Congo is among the few countries that from timeimmemorial  owing to its geostrategic placement and itsvast human and natural resources  has borne the burdenof a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violationsof human rights and the rights of peoples.In 1885  when Africa was being colonized  mycountry was set up as a State that was the personalproperty of the King of the Belgians; it endured violenceand blatant violations of human rights connected interalia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds offorced labour. It became a Belgian colony in 1908  andwas later to experience a decolonization process that wasnot merely botched  but was disastrous because mycountry became part of the global stakes in the East-Weststrategic rivalry.After my country acceded to independence in June1960  at the height of the cold war  the symbol of oursovereignty  Prime Minister Patrice Emergy Lumumba was martyred to that sovereignty.Under the complaisant eyes of the internationalcommunity  a bloody and reactionary dictatorship wasformed in the very heart of Africa  in the strategicinterests of the dominating West  with the mission ofdestabilizing neighbouring countries. Thirty years later thanks to the political changes that took place in theworld in 1989  the international community sawregretfully the disastrous results of the support it hadgiven to a regime that was a State in name only.The disasters caused by these years of bloody andignoble dictatorship are so well known that there is noneed to recount them. The World Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund and all the bodies of the United Nationssystem have studies  evaluations and gripping and moving15testimony of what the Mobutu regime represented at theend of the twentieth century.The opening of this fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly coincides happily with the emergence in Africaof a new generation of leaders who are totally dedicated tothe cause of African renaissance and who are inspired bythe decisive will to take in hand the destiny of the continentand to play their role in the community of nations.Among these individuals is Mr. Laurent-Désiré Kabila whose struggle for the restoration of the Republic datesback to 14 September 1960  the day when the firstCongolese democratic experience was interrupted.The triumph of the Congolese revolution on 17 May1997 is  after the defeat of apartheid in South Africa  thehistoric event of greatest political importance in modernAfrica. It represents the triumph of the return to pan-Africanism  the only road to salvation for Africa in thecircumstances of today’s world.The massive and spontaneous adherence of theCongolese to this armed struggle and the support receivedfrom friendly countries and from the entire world is enoughto underline the positive nature of this liberation struggle.The Congolese people are grateful to all for theirsupport of the coming to Kinshasa of a progressive newpower concerned with a state of law and improving of thewell-being of the people. The victory of the Alliance ofDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo over theMobutu dictatorship is indeed a victory of progressive andpan-African Africa over obscurantism  pessimism morbidness and defeatism  which for such a long time werepretexts for certain Powers to keep political and strategiccontrol of the continent. In that country in which the Stateand the Republic were moribund  the Government of publicsecurity  led by President Laurent-Désiré Kabila  is workingtirelessly and incessantly to restore the State and to rebuildthe Republic.The efforts at domestic stabilization throughreorganization of the State and the reconciliation ofopinions and the return to work of the civilian populationare accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peaceand regional stability in order to create economic andpolitical conditions conducive to productive national andforeign investment.Our African policy is designed to improve bilateralrelations with all the States of the region  help them adaptbetter to the new geopolitical context and strengthencooperation and regional integration. Along with theobjective of promoting economic development  we arealso working to achieve the prevention  management andresolution by Africa of the regional conflicts and crisesthat are paralysing our continent.This desire to change our foreign policy is based onour domestic policy  which is designed to rely primarilyon our own efforts and to give greater importance toregional and South-South cooperation in our tradeactivities. Here  emphasis will be placed on tradepromoting productive commerce and investments leadingto the transfer of new and appropriate technology.We intend  moreover  to pursue efforts designed toimprove our bilateral and multilateral relations with allour partners to ensure greater understanding for andcommitment to our programme of national reconstruction.This programme essentially addresses urgent actions andsteps for rehabilitation  and their highly humanitariannature deserves the unconditional support of theinternational community.This Government programme comprises thefollowing priorities: infrastructure for transportation andcommunication  agriculture  health and social services national education  job creation and the elimination ofunemployment  safety and protection of individuals andproperty and  in addition  peace and national and regionalstability.In the four months in which we have been leadingthe State  we have been able to achieve encouragingresults  in particular at the political and diplomatic levels.These include ensuring the safety of the populationthrough the restoration of justice; guaranteeing the rightof ownership; efforts to eradicate corruption  which hadbecome institutionalized in our country; the reintegrationof the military personnel of the former armed forces ofZaire and the establishment of a national republican army;the establishment of good regional relations  in particularthrough the holding in Kinshasa of a summit of Heads ofState designed to work on strengthening regionalcooperation; the working visits to Kinshasa by thePresidents of Uganda  Rwanda  Eritrea and Tanzania  aswell as the visits of the Congolese Head of State toAngola  South Africa  Rwanda  Namibia and Zambia.Furthermore  our Government has participated in meetingsheld in the subregion on specific regional issues. Weshould also note that President Kabila has been consultedby the actors in the current crisis in Brazzaville.16Economic steps include overcoming inflation and therevaluation of the local currency  the decline in food prices the provision of essentials to urban centres  a monetaryreform project now under way and the restructuring of thecentral bank.Social and cultural steps include a resumption ofcultural and artistic life  a resumption of primary andsecondary education despite a difficult situation for parentswho work for the State  providing drinking water for thecapital and electrification and public road projects.In the debate at this session on proposals forreforming the United Nations  I would like  at the outset  tostate that the strategic objective of all of the reformsenvisaged must be to provide better conditions for theproper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfilits founders’ dream of a lasting  democratic  responsibleand credible Organization.The first stage of the effort must be to assess theimpact of the cold war on the original system of collectivesecurity. Since the cold war paralysed the system set out inthe Charter  the end of the cold war should createconditions favourable to the triumph of the collectivesecurity regime provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.The second stage will be to analyse why the continualprogress of preventive diplomacy is accompanied byinefficiencies at the operational level in peacekeeping andpeace-building. Furthermore  we must also consider thepolitical powers of the main agent of preventive diplomacyto ensure that they conform to institutional limits.Our position with regard to the administrative reformsof the United Nations and the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil is that of Africa as a whole  as set out anddefended by the Secretary-General of the Organization ofAfrican Unity. We are opposed to cosmetic reforms and tohaving members of the Security Council acting as merefigureheads.Our interest in reform should not make us forget thenumerous conflict situations and threats to peace andinternational security throughout the world. Today Africacontinues to occupy centre stage with regard to armedconflicts. Central Africa in particular has become a powderkeg as a result of uncontrolled armed bands crossing almostall our borders  bands who  in the guise of refugees  aredestabilizing the entire region.That is why we urgently appeal to the United Nationsto do everything it can to end its present policy of buryingits head in the sand  which can only result in weakeningand destabilizing those  such as the Democratic Republicof the Congo  that have a role to play in the subregion.It is now clear that the crisis in Brazzaville  forexample  is increasingly escaping the control of theparties to the conflict  and requires an urgent SecurityCouncil meeting. This crisis is unacceptable to theCongolese in both Brazzaville and Kinshasa. TheDemocratic Republic of the Congo  which has beensubjected to deliberate shelling from neighbouringBrazzaville  which has been receiving refugees fleeingthat country and which  since 29 and 30 September 1997has suffered loss of human life  without being a party tothe conflict  believes that the conflict has reached thelimit of what can be tolerated  given the damage to itspeople and the threat it represents to regional andinternational peace and security. Just this morning welearned that more shells had fallen on Kinshasa  and thisis unacceptable to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The Central African Republic  which was badlybattered by the rebellions in the Kasayi camp  mustbenefit from special cooperation from the United Nationsto strengthen the Inter-African Mission to Monitor theImplementation of the Bangui Agreements  which isalready operational on the ground.We firmly support the Lusaka Protocol  which isdesigned to re-establish peace and stability in Angola  acountry with which we share a frontier of 2 600kilometres. We therefore demand that the Protocol bestrictly respected  and we condemn the repeated violationsof its terms by UNITA.With regard to Burundi  we support the Arushaprocess  and adhere to the principle of democracy andsecurity for all.In Sierra Leone  we hope to see a return to legalityand the democratic exercise of power.We welcome the return of peace to Liberia  and theelectoral victory of President Charles Taylor  and we hopethat this experience will become a landmark and a pointof reference for neighbouring States. The march towardsdemocratization in Africa is inevitable and irreversible but the road is one which only the Africans can set out onand walk down.I should like to hail here the American initiative tohold a ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council17to strengthen the capacity of African States to build peacethrough conflict prevention and management and by theimprovement of good governance.The situation in the Middle East remains worrying.The Democratic Republic of the Congo urges all partiesstrictly to respect the Madrid and Oslo agreements  and inall cases to give priority to genuine dialogue. The prize ofpeace is won through tolerance.In the Far East  the reunification of Korea is apeaceful process that the Democratic Republic of the Congofully supports. We hope for a positive outcome to thenegotiations under way.Global peace is also threatened by environmentalproblems and by the continuation of the debt crisis of theleast developed countries. The Democratic Republic of theCongo  which has significant global forest reserves  appealsto the international community for assistance in preservingits forest heritage.My country  whose foreign debt amounts to $14billion  calls upon the major donors to demonstrate greatersolidarity and adopt a more responsible and consistentapproach to possible solutions. In the specific case of theCongo  which has been devastated  we wonder what goodthose billions of dollars did  as the country is in a state oftotal ruin — without roads  bridges  schools or hospitals. Itis public knowledge that these funds never reached theCongo  and were for the most part deposited in American European and Asian banks. That is why we call for thepure and simple cancellation of this debt; if necessary  wewill request the cooperation of the United Nations for therestoration to the Congo of the $14 billion  now circulatingin the world.We should like here solemnly to express our gratitudeto the Governments of the Republic of South Africa  theKingdom of Belgium  the Swiss Confederation and theUnited States for their cooperation in this matter  and hopethat everything possible will be done for a positive outcometo the processes under way.In any case  the insolvency of my country and of otherAfrican countries is a global problem that requiresconsistent global treatment. It is therefore unfortunate thatinternational cooperation in this area is only serving tointensify it and  furthermore  that any new contribution tonational reconstruction is conditional on the payment ofarrears.The Democratic Republic of the Congo supports allthe initiatives and recommendations relating to therestoration of cultural property confiscated in the past bycolonial Powers. In the same spirit  we support theestablishment of an international criminal court  whichwould have competence over political economic  social cultural and humanitarian crimes.Disarmament issues and their relationship withdevelopment are also on our foreign policy agenda. Whilewelcoming the Secretary-General’s initiative to establisha new department for disarmament  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo would have liked to have beenapprised of how matters stood regarding the Conferenceon Disarmament in Geneva to avoid duplication ofefforts.We hope that the United Nations will continue itsefforts to guarantee a world free from nuclear weaponsand that efforts aimed at general and completedisarmament in regard to conventional weapons bear fruit.The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party tothe Ottawa process on anti-personnel landmines. Itcondemns both manufacturers and users and hopes thatcondemnation of these weapons will go hand in hand witha genuine will to find international settlements for civilwars and to prosecute individuals responsible for thosewars for crimes against humanity.I could not conclude my remarks without mentioningthe general situation in the Great Lakes region particularly the Rwandan refugees and the United Nationscommission of inquiry on the allegations of massacres inthe east of our country.The world campaign for human and humanitarianrights orchestrated against the Alliance of DemocraticForces for the Liberation of Congo and against theGovernment of His Excellency the President Mr. Laurent-Désiré Kabila  in some ways recalls thedeplorable and unfortunate United Nations intervention inthe Congo in 1960.Our position is that the problem of refugees  whetherthey be Hutus or not  must remain a humanitarian issueand can in no way become a political issue. Therefore any attempt to politicize it should be condemned becauseit goes against the spirit and letter of the Charter of ourOrganization.18With particular regard to the question of the allegedRwandan refugees and the allegations that they weremassacred  the Democratic Republic of the Congo continuesto repeat  for anyone who wants to listen  that it hasnothing to hide. Moreover  we have never concealed ourmoral concern regarding the Rwandan women and childrenwho were taken hostage and fell victim to Rwandanextremists bent on genocide. What we do dispute in thismatter is the fact that the former Rwandan armed forcesand the militia  the INTERAHAMWE  are classed asrefugees  which totally disregards the provisions of theGeneva Conventions and the relevant convention of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU).Here  I should like to call to witness the SecurityCouncil  some of whose members rightly refused tosubscribe to the idea of an international intervention forceled by Canada for the simple reason that the real Rwandanrefugees had returned to Rwanda. The armed bands whowent from Kibu as far as Congo (Brazzaville)  the CentralAfrican Republic and regions of Angola controlled by theUnião Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola(UNITA) are not refugees. They are hostage-takers and noone has the right to ignore that.In two and a half years  the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and all kinds ofhumanitarian agencies could not repatriate more than 100refugees to Rwanda. While they spent more than $1 billion to the tune of $1.2 million per day  the Alliance ofDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo was able toassist in the voluntary repatriation  in conditions of fullsecurity and dignity  of over 700 000 Rwandan refugees infour days. In the same way  the Alliance of DemocraticForces for the Liberation of Congo had called more thanthree ceasefires for humanitarian reasons. That samemovement had opened humanitarian corridors — road  railand air — to allow for and assist the repatriation ofRwandan refugees. That same movement had fed and caredfor the so-called refugees  whom today it is accused ofhaving massacred  in the equatorial forest.The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a place ofrefuge and anyone who is being persecuted anywhere in theworld will find asylum there in accordance with theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  the 1951 GenevaConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and therelevant OAU convention. Thus  the Congolese fromBrazzaville were welcomed shortly after the Rwandanswere repatriated but  paradoxically (spoke in English)these refugees did not receive the same attention from theinternational community as the Rwandan refugees. Theyhappen to be second-class refugees.(spoke in French)Can people at least realize what kind of and howgreat a toll the presence of Rwandan refugees  particularlyof members of the former Rwandan armed forces andINTERAHAMWE  in the Congo will have taken? Hasanyone taken the trouble to assess the impact of theactivities of these phoney refugees on the territory of theCongo?And since we could not speak of refugees withoutmentioning the United Nations commission of inquiry  Iwould like to make the most of this opportunity to drawthe attention of this Assembly to the clearly humanitariannature of the mission of the commission. In no wayshould it turn itself into a political mission  as it has beentrying to do so far. It should be understood that itsdeployment in the field must not violate our independenceand sovereignty. Our confidence in the internationalOrganization is neither a sign of weakness nor a failure tosee  in this particular case  that there are plans afoot touse these structures to undermine certain forces.The Government of the Democratic Republic of theCongo has accepted  and I repeat (spoke in English)we have accepted that the team can do its work and weare expecting it to go ahead and do the work. OurGovernment will do anything in its power to make surethat the team does its work. However  the team will thenhave to answer a certain number of questions  especiallyin the eastern part of our country. Mainly  who did what when  why  with whose help? The team will have to tellus why the refugees were armed. The team will have totell us who armed them. Why were they not disarmed?The team will have to tell us how many amongst therefugees were really refugees and how many werepseudo-refugees. The team will say how many Congolesepeople were butchered by these people who have beencalled refugees  but more importantly  the team will tellus if there was any continuation of Rwandese genocide onCongolese soil because  as the Assembly knows  the samepeople who committed genocide in Rwanda crossed theborder with their arms  with their machetes  with theirideology  and they continued their work in our country.And  more importantly  the team will establish the19responsibility of everybody in that matter. But let me repeatagain  our Government is willing to help the team  to givefull access to the team  so that the team can go ahead anddo its work.(spoke in French)I should like to conclude my statement today with amessage from Mr. Laurent-Désiré Kabila  President of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  which reads:“My country has lost a great deal of timebecause of the injustices of the cold war. My peopleask only one thing: to build the well-being andprosperity they need  in full sovereignty and withrespect for the sovereignty of others. We thank allthose countries that are willing to assist us in ourrecovery.“We have no other ambition. We are onlyconvinced that the world opinion that will satisfy uscan come only from ourselves. What we ask of theother nations of the world is that they assist us inseeing that those who are not in agreement with ourview of things cannot thwart us.”World peace is one and indivisible  and the principleof collective responsibility obliges all of us to take that intoaccount."
"35",1485,"COG",52,1997,"﻿I wish to congratulate the President on hisbrilliant election to the presidency of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly. This election is both asign of the respect his country enjoys in the internationalcommunity and a tribute by the Members of ourOrganization to his qualities as a diplomat and hisoutstanding experience in the United Nations system. Allof this is  undoubtedly  assurance that efficiency willmark his presidency and a guarantee that the work of thesession will be successful. My delegation would also liketo express its full gratitude and congratulations toMr. Udovenko’s predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismailof Malaysia  for his outstanding  imaginative and effectivework  in particular regarding his numerous initiatives —especially the initiative that gave a decisive impetus to thereform of the Security Council.25The Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  has  in a veryshort space of time  done considerable work  in particularin the area of reform. The results of this work will bring anew perspective to the work and objectives of ourOrganization.I must tell this Assembly that my sorrow is greatbecause so many Congolese children  men and women havefallen every day since 5 June 1997  under the crossfire ofshells in the civil war that has cast a pall over my country.Therefore  with the indulgence of the General Assembly  Iwish to devote my comments to this tragic situation.But what a dilemma confronts me at this rostrum! Asa Minister  I might be tempted to paint a picture ofpropaganda  of oversimplification  of extremism andexclusively of governmental platitudes. The intellectual andthe patriot I would wish to be must go beyond diplomaticconvention and express what I feel in my heart — mydeepest convictions — which are undoubtedly shared byother Congolese of my generation.They feel  as I do  great sorrow for all the victimswho continue to fall in the camp of President Lissouba andin that of former President Sassou-Nguesso. And they feelstrongly  as I do  that the international community has leftthem to their own devices to face this tragedy. And yet inmy country  which today is in the grip of civil war  almosteverything has been done since the sovereign nationalconference to spare our young democracy from the tragicupheavals inherent in any sudden social change  which inthis case consisted of the move from a single-party politicalregime banning any organized opposition to a veritableexplosion of freedoms — individual  political and religious.The Constitution  the charter of national unity and theentire institutional and legislative framework set up sincethe transition period  which lasted for more than a year  fallwithin this framework. The holding of transparent  free andfair elections — and in particular the presidential election which put President Pascal Lissouba at the helm of theState with more than 61 per cent of the vote — was theharbinger of an outstanding future for the process ofdemocratization in the Congo.Moreover  President Lissouba has since his electionfocused on establishing mechanisms to consolidate ouryoung democracy. In his quest to establish nationaldialogue and social peace  President Lissouba  immediatelyfollowing his inauguration  launched an appeal to theopposition to participate in the government of the Republic.That offer  whose purpose was to correct or at leastminimize certain constitutional restrictions  was rejectedby the opposition. From that point on  for the oppositioneach lost election became grounds for contention andconflict. This has further distanced it from political powerand endangered the future of its own leaders.The war that has brought bloodshed to Brazzaville our capital  is the culmination of the rejection by oneparty of our political class to accept the rules ofdemocracy. The seeds of this war can be found in theeconomic problems and difficulties of the country. Facedwith this war  we understand — though of course we donot share — the indifference of the internationalcommunity to the fate of several thousand Africans  lostin one corner of the globe. The concern of the greateconomic Powers lies in preserving the richness of thesoil and the subsoil of that area  and the lives of itsinhabitants mean little to them.But there are lessons to be learned from thisindifference. It has caused us to look at ourselves as if ina mirror  in order better to understand the place thatAfricans really hold in the community of nations. It hasalso taught us that while patriotism could be a valuecommonly shared by Africans  the cruel reality of Africa at least a part of it  is that it counts only for its wealth. Soin times of political setback  Africa can expect from theinternational community only indifference at the outsetand condescending judgements later on. Often  andbelatedly  the only consideration it receives is to bereminded of the human rights violations perpetrated inwartime by conflicting parties.But that right to judge  which we readily recognizefor other peace-loving and democracy-loving peoples does it not in turn imply a duty on the part of those who in time of war  stand by silently  failing to providehumanitarian assistance to a people threatened with deathand extinction? The people of the Congo  who have  since5 June 1997  been dying slowly under fire from rocketsand cannons — bought by the Congolese  yes  but sold tothem by Western “philanthropists” — do they not deserveto benefit from that much-vaunted right to humanitarianintervention?We refuse to believe that  in the framework of ourOrganization  whose solid  founding values include theprinciple of justice and equality among peoples  this rightto humanitarian intervention  which on a global scaleinvolves an obligation to solidarity and to safeguard life applies only to certain colours or geographic locations depending on the colour or the geographic location of the26victims. If that belief were to be a certainty  or even toexist  then it would — at least for some of the Members ofour Organization — undermine needlessly and in a lastingway the legitimate trust that so many peoples  the innocentvictims of atrocities and injustice  have placed in the UnitedNations.Some Members of this Organization are tempted tosay that the Congolese must solve their problemsthemselves  and we must take this appeal to our sense ofresponsibility into consideration. Yet while today it is theCongolese people who are hostages  perhaps tomorrow itwill be another people’s turn to be taken hostage by apolitical class that is driven by selfish ambitions unprepared to accept the rules of democracy anduninterested in seeking and maintaining peace.Every day and at an increasing human cost  theexcessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance ofothers defer to a later date the establishment of conditionsfor a negotiated peace. That is what happened at Librevilleduring the second week of September 1997. PresidentPascal Lissouba agreed with President Omar Bongo President of the international mediation committee  on aplan for the country to be run by a presidential collegecomposed of the incumbent President of the Republic andthree Vice-Presidents. But many Congolese saw in thisproposal an effort at power-sharing among those individualsvying for power in the Congo and  hence  an end to thewar.Unfortunately  their hopes were dashed as a nightmarescenario unfolded. In response to this proposal from theinternational mediation committee  the United DemocraticForces of former President Sassou-Nguesso demanded thatthe First Vice-President be one of their own and that heexercise also the functions of Prime Minister of Minister ofDefence. Such a demand  in view of the political history ofour country  marked as it is by numerous coups d’état thatto this day still have supporters  could not be accepted bythe Government nor by the other parties of the mostrepresentative opposition.Following that refusal by former President Sassou-Nguesso  a new Government was formed. Mr. BernardKolélas  Mayor of the city of Brazzaville and leader of theopposition  was appointed head of that new Government.Several ministerial posts were reserved for the formersingle party  the Congolese Labour Party of formerPresident Sassou-Nguesso.To date  this effort to join the Government has alsobeen rejected by the armed opposition. What is to bedone?The Government continues to believe in the virtue ofdialogue and not in the force of weapons. That is why itcontinues to hope that the efforts of the InternationalMediation Committee will offer the Congo a chance forlasting peace  and for a transition managed jointly by thevarious political forces of the country so that our peoplecan freely elect its President.With the goal of finding this negotiated solution President Pascal Lissouba and Prime Minister BernardKolélas recently signed the ceasefire plan proposed by theInternational Mediation Committee. To date  onlyMr. Sassou-Nguesso has not signed.When those who make secret contributions tofratricidal massacres and destabilization in somedemocratic States  guided by their own interests  invokethe principle of non-interference as a pretext to give themgreater freedom to manoeuvre  should we not fear thathere non-interference may well become  given thecomplaisance and the silence of the United Nations  theworst form of interference against these massacredpeoples and these destabilized States?Just about a year ago  speaking before this sameAssembly  I questioned the relevance of applying the ruleof rotation of power in the context of democratization inour countries  which are economically weak and whosepolitical classes have for a long time gained their fortunesand their social ascendancy exclusively from politicalactions. The events in my country  unfortunately  givegreater meaning to this question. We are called upon tounderstand better our contemporary political history andthe need to share power in order to ensure a lasting peaceand to better ensure the success of the democratic regime.In the economic and historical context of someAfrican countries  this approach towards democracy  withthe development of respect for its basic needs  can be afactor for peace and development  instead of being afactor for destabilization and a vehicle for heightenedethnic hatreds during elections  as in the case today in mycountry.This is a fundamental question  and undoubtedly mycountry  today at war  will be able to answer it by findingthe road of reason  peace and pursuit of the democraticprocess. The road leading to democracy in my country 27which has for a long time been under the yoke of a single-party regime that flouted freedoms under a quicklyabandoned ideology  has been seen as a crossroads by ourpeople.The opposite would have been preferred butsurprising  because the single-party regime andtotalitarianism cannot disappear without jolts or resistance.Our struggle — that of all the Congolese who believein the values of democracy  in the development of thehuman being in a democracy  in the unleashing of greaterintelligence and energy in our country thanks to democracyand its regime of freedom will be in vain if theinternational community — primarily the United Nations —does not show us any sign of the solidarity that could  onceand for all  in spirit and in fact  do away with thetemptation to resort to weapons to gain power.The Government of the Republic of Congo wishes toexpress once again its regret and its great compassion to theGovernment and to the brotherly people of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo for the damage and loss of liferesulting from the Brazzaville war. We are convinced thatthe peoples of the two Congos  who have already shed toomuch blood and too many tears in their history and in theirreturn to a state of law  wish to live in peace together.That is why this situation has shown us how urgent itis for all peace-loving and democracy-loving forces to cometo the aid of the Congolese as quickly as possible in orderto find a solution to return peace to Brazzaville and tospare the entire subregion the further spread of destabilizingacts and war.We greatly appreciate the commitment of someGovernments that  in view of the Congolese tragedy  havemade known their readiness to provide troops that couldconstitute a multinational interposition force  given theprocrastination of the United Nations.The wounded and the dead in our own country havehelped us better understand and better regret such sufferingin the rest of the world. We wish here to express ourfeeling of solidarity with all other peoples that aresuffering  the Algerian people in particular. There again our hope is that reason will prevail over any otherconsideration so that Algeria can pursue its economicdevelopment.I wish to conclude by affirming that the politicaldetermination to restore peace to Brazzaville exists.However  the return to peace is made difficult in the fieldby the fact that any deliberate or uncontrolled shootingmight  at any moment  lead to a further escalation ofviolence and might endanger numerous human lives.These acts are committed with such ease  irresponsibilityand impunity that there is no neutral international force inBrazzaville that can determine who is responsible.We believe that the presence of the troops of themultinational force envisaged by the Secretary-General which was never established  would have enabled us tomove more quickly and more surely towards lastingpeace.May our appeal for help be heard  or may it resultin greater understanding for future calls of distress. Andmay my comments from this rostrum resonate within eachof us  like an echo in this General Assembly  to spareother African peoples from ever suffering the torments ofwar or the dictatorship of a handful of lawless andfaithless politicians  with wheelers and dealers on all sideswho are themselves lawless and faithless."
"36",1532,"COL",52,1997,"﻿As President of Colombia and Chairman of theNon-Aligned Movement  I would like to extend to you Sir  my sincere congratulations on your appointment topreside over this most important session  and I also wishto thank Ambassador Razali for his diligence inperforming his duties during the fifty-first session of theAssembly.Over the decades the United Nations has shown thatits founders were not mistaken when they entrusted to itthe mission of developing a new model of co-existencefor our planet  thanks to which we defeated colonialism fought against apartheid  prevented territorialconfrontations  extended our hand to help children defended the rights of women and protected theenvironment.However  we find ourselves today at a crossroadssimilar to that which led us to sign the San FranciscoCharter. The globalization of the world has brought aboutthe internationalization of problems such as drugtrafficking  terrorism and corruption  all of whichseriously threaten our systems.Certain industrialized nations are behaving selfishlyin defining new rules of the game for free economies.Unilateralism and conditions imposed by the powerfulupon others are rampant throughout the world. The sparecapacity of the military industrial complex since the coldwar is encouraging the beginning of a dangerous armsrace. The open wound of foreign debt is still an obstacleto the development of many of the poorest countries. Theviolation of human  political  social and economic rightsis also the order of the day.The new United Nations  which the Secretary-General has proposed we should reflect upon as thecentury comes to an end  will surely not deal only witharmed conflicts. We must be prepared to face otherkinds of war: social war against poverty; judicial waragainst organized crime; political war againstinterventionism in our sovereign economies; and moralwar against the violation of human rights.We cannot yet assert that the process ofglobalization really represents progress for all ofhumankind. While globalization has generated greateconomic and technological advances  such progresscontinues to be the privilege of the industrializednations and very small segments of the population ofthe rest of the world. True progress for humanitycannot be brought by phenomena which generate newand more profound imbalances in the quality of life forindividuals. We must work hard to ensure that Statesand multilateral organizations such as the UnitedNations  direct their efforts to guaranteeing that thebenefits of globalization do not remain in the hands ofa few.Therefore  any reform of the United Nations mustbegin with the return of the concept of solidarity whichinspired the San Francisco agreements  and which is thevery raison d’etre of our Movement. We want not moresummits  but more compliance with the summits not yetcomplied with; a summit on compliance with othersummits would be welcome.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) is not being properly complied with.Important members have yet to ratify the ChemicalWeapons Convention. There seems to be no interest inmaking progress on fundamental agreements to restrictthe conventional arms markets run by the world’smerchants of war. Government aid  as a proportion ofthe resources transferred to developing countries bydeveloped nations  has dropped from 42 per cent to 24per cent in recent years. Funds for military operationswithin the United Nations system have increased 17times compared with increases in funds for socialprogrammes.We must find new paths for the United Nations tofollow. The reform of the United Nations systemproposed by the Secretary-General must encompass allspheres of the United Nations system as a whole.In the first place  there is the economic sphere.The Bretton Woods organizations — the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund — which wereborn as part of the agreement of March 1946  have6progressively been removing themselves from the originaldirection exercised by this Assembly over their economicand social policies. They have ended up by configuring adevelopment model which they impose on developingeconomies  without those economies being able to discusstheir own priorities. Reform should include matters suchas having greater international liquidity  greater flexibilityin the management of multilateral debt  concessionarycredit flows for social investment and coordination witheconomic bodies representing the interests of developingcountries  such as the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (UNCTAD)  the Economic andSocial Council and the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization (UNIDO).The situation of the United Nations social sphere isthe most worrisome. The greatest burden of theOrganization’s budgetary crisis has fallen upon the bodiesinvolved  whose financing has dropped by many millionsof dollars during the present decade. Some developedcountries have inexplicably withdrawn from bodiesdevoted to children  culture  population  employment andthe environment  such as the United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF)  the International Labour Organization(ILO)  the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization (UNESCO)  the World FoodProgramme (WFP) and the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme. The report of the Secretary-General contains interesting proposals to restore theactivities of such bodies  which constitute the very heartof the United Nations.In a world where 1.3 billion people still survive onless than a dollar a day  in a world where  for the priceof one combat plane  57 000 children in Africa can befed for a year  it is impossible to conceive of a reform ofthe United Nations whose priority is not to strengthen thework of its institutions and programmes dedicated tosocial issues.Finally  there is the matter of the politicalrelationship between the Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. The proposed strengthening of the SecurityCouncil cannot be carried out at the expense of takingpower away from this Assembly  the highest democraticbody of the system. Any expansion of the Council musttake into account that developing countries by theirnature and as spokesmen for various regions of theworld  need to have greater representation. Theinstrument of the veto should be abolished because it isanti-democratic  since it places in the hands of onecountry the power to ignore the will of the majority. Ifthe veto cannot be eliminated  it should be restricted tothose matters truly fundamental for world security  andthe right to appeal vetoes before judicial or politicalbodies  such as this Assembly  should be established.A few months ago the Secretary-General presentedto the United Nations a very interesting proposal for thereform for the Organization. The Non-AlignedMovement  which I represent  is reviewing thisinitiative and considers that a number of its proposalswould contribute to the revitalization of the UnitedNations.We do not want a United Nations divided betweenrich and poor  with Members having first- and second-class status according to their economic contributions.The United Nations is not a private company  but theforum of solidarity in which all the countries of theworld come together.I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to theUnited Nations  and the international community atlarge  to confront the grave problem of armsproliferation with a clear and well-defined strategy thatwill lead us to concrete results. To that end  I wish topropose five points for effectively dealing with of thismatter.First  I propose the declaration by the developingcountries of a two-year  worldwide moratorium on thehigh-technology-weapons trade.Secondly  I propose the expansion of the UnitedNations Register of Conventional Arms to include lightweapons  as well as production and storage  with aview to strengthening its role as a means of promotingconfidence.Thirdly  I propose that the Governments of arms-producing countries commit themselves to theestablishment of a moratorium on the sale of high-technology weapons in regions in conflict  as well as toconverting their weapons-production industrial capacityand workforce to other economic sectors.Fourthly  I propose the follow-up and verificationof all multilateral commitments and existing treaties inthis area.Fifthly  I propose that the regulation of trade inlight arms  as well as in high-technology weaponry 7should be a subject of deliberations at the fourth specialsession of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.This initiative is designed to deal with the variousfacets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation which — besides draining vast resources that could bedevoted to the social and economic development of ourpeoples — constitutes the most dangerous threat to thepeace and security of the world.Much water has flowed under the bridge that webuilt in San Francisco half a century ago to make theworld a better place to live.We have  without any doubt  progressed  but wecannot claim to be satisfied despite what we haveachieved. So long as there is a sad  hungry child in theworld  there will be a United Nations. So long as there isa weapon raised to kill a neighbour  there will be aUnited Nations. So long as entire populations aredisplaced from their homes by violence  hunger andintolerance  there will be a United Nations. So long asthousands of young people do not have access toeducation because they must struggle every day tosurvive  there will be a United Nations. So long as thewhims of the powerful continue to defy the aspirations ofthe powerless  there will be a United Nations. So long asdrugs on the streets threaten the future of our children there will be a United Nations. So long as terrorists andviolators of human rights continue to run loose  there willbe a United Nations. So long as there is a need forsolidarity  love and joy in the world  there will be aUnited Nations."
"37",1572,"COM",52,1997,"﻿The unanimous election of the President of thefifty-second session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations was a tribute not only to his outstandingdiplomatic qualities  but also to his country  Ukraine —with which the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comorosfully intends to have good relations of friendship andcooperation. I would like to associate myself with theprevious speakers in extending to him  on behalf of mydelegation  our warm congratulations and to wish him allsuccess in carrying out his noble task.Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  for the dedication andskill with which he guided the work and shouldered thetask of President of the fifty-first session of our GeneralAssembly.I would also like to take this opportunity to extendmy sincere congratulations to our new Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  on his outstanding election. I would liketo express our deep gratitude to this illustrious advocateof the ideals of peace  solidarity and justice for hisunswerving dedication to the service of our institution.His experience in international affairs  together with hispersonal qualities  clearly guarantees that the UnitedNations will be given new impetus as it faces the newchallenges confronting it.7At a time when we are meeting in the GeneralAssembly to assess — as is our custom — the work carriedout by our Organization in the areas of peacekeeping  thestrengthening of international cooperation  the developmentof reforms required if the United Nations is to adapt to theneeds of our time  we are obliged to note that the worldcontinues to fall prey to numerous types of threats  tensionsand ills of all sorts.Thus  it is obvious that our Organization must play avery critical and primary role. However  in this period ofglobalization — of the obvious and irrevocableinterdependence of nations  democracy  good governanceand transparency in the management of public affairs —our Organization remains the target of those who wish tominimize and limit its role by preventing it from payingstill greater attention to the problems of poor anddisadvantaged countries. It goes without saying that thisconcept is not conducive to promoting the atmosphere ofdetente in international relations that has been awaited forso long.Bearing in mind the noble tasks for which theOrganization was founded  in particular the building of ajust  peaceful and better integrated world society  it wouldbe wise and reasonable for the major concerns of ourOrganization  since the end of the cold war  to bemobilization for disarmament and the search for solutionsthat can encourage the development policies of States cooperation and international solidarity.The trials and tribulations of history have once againplaced my country  the Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros  on the first page of international news. The tragicevents of the last few months are the result of anunprecedented social and economic crisis which is batteringmy country. Indeed  counted among the least developedcountries  over the last few years the Comoran State haswitnessed a deterioration of the markets for its exportproducts — vanilla  cloves  perfume oils  and so forth —due to strong international competition.The poor sales of these products  which are the majorsources of revenue for the State  and therefore for amajority of the inhabitants of the Comoros  have beencompounded by the devaluation of our currency  withoutappropriate accompanying measures. This economic state ofaffairs has only served to exacerbate the already poor andvulnerable condition of a considerable sector of thepopulation of the Comoros. Here I have in mind thegalloping unemployment and the rising curve of poverty.In this situation  which is of concern in many ways the authorities of the Comoros  together with the BrettonWoods institutions  decided on a number of measuresaimed at balancing State revenues and expenditures.These include a reduction in gross salaries; theprivatization of State firms; a reduction of the operationalState budget; and the launching of projects to generaterevenue and permanent jobs.These new guidelines were put forth on the eve ofthe free and democratic elections organized under theaegis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  theEuropean Union and the United Nations. On 16 March1996  these elections carried President Mohamed TakiAbdoulkarim to the highest post in my country.Indeed  the catastrophic situation inherited by thenewly elected President required the swiftest possible startof political  economic and social reforms capable ofmeeting the numerous challenges impeding the buildingof a democratic  prosperous and united society.Among the efforts made along these lines by thenew political authorities of the Comoros  we couldmention the regular payment since 1997 of State officials'salaries.However  despite this new impetus  the discontentspawned by a series of crises and tragedies in mycountry's recent history finally caught up with the harshsocio-economic facts of life of the Comorian people.Expressed in different ways  in line with thesusceptibilities on all sides  the rumblings of thisdiscontent got out of bounds on the Comorian island ofAnjouan. Indeed  since March 1997  variousmovements — both trade union and political — coalescedinto an organization whose activism threatens the veryheart of the Comorian State.From the illegal occupation of public buildings tothe trampling underfoot of the national flag  these factionssowing terror on the island of Anjouan used all kinds ofmethods to provoke the central power.These outrageous actions  which have beenunanimously condemned by the international community were exacerbated by the proclamation of a pseudo-independence of the island of Anjouan.Despite all these acts of provocation  the Presidentof the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros 8determined to preserve peace and national unity  opted forthe path of dialogue and agreed action. Within thisframework  the Government of the Comoros requested themediation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) witha view to achieving a peaceful settlement of this domesticcrisis.As a result of the discussions initiated by the OAUmission  certain decisions  accepted by all sides  were takendesigned to facilitate a return to normalcy — in particular the withdrawal of military reinforcements  the provision tothe island of vitally necessary foodstuffs  the organizationof examinations at the end of the school year  and so on.The response to this spirit of reconciliation by theseparatists was the continuation of one act of escalationafter another; they occupied the presidential residence atHombo  in Anjouan and levied direct and indirect taxes onthe island  having emptied the coffers of the State.Faced with such an exacerbation of the situation which was a violation of the authority of the State  theGovernment was obliged to send a military mission toAnjouan to re-establish public and Republican order.This mission  which began on the morning of 2September  had nearly achieved its goal by 4 September without bloodshed. But the subsequent turn of events ledthe President of the Republic  still determined to preservecivil order  to take the necessary emergency measures underarticle 20 of the Constitution of the Islamic FederalRepublic of the Comoros  dealing with full powers.This is why  acting under this Article  a Statetransition commission was appointed and given theprerogatives normally given members of the Government:to carry on the conduct of current affairs of State; tocontinue the indispensable negotiations begun with theOAU  the United Nations  the League of Arab States andall other bodies involved in the search for a solution to thecrisis afflicting the country; to implement and give concreteform to solutions agreed on  in consultation with the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); toprepare for signature the programme of adjustment with theBretton Woods institutions; and to prepare the finalprocedures for ultimate signature of the eighth EuropeanDevelopment Fund  in collaboration with the EuropeanUnion and the countries of the Asian  Caribbean and Pacificregion.During this transitional stage it should be possible torestructure institutions with a view to giving the islands ofthe Republic broad management autonomy and moreactive participation in the process of development in theislands of the Comoros as a whole.At a time when my country's territorial integrityremains threatened  at a time when arbitrary separatistactions are again battering my country  I should like fromthis rostrum to launch a heartfelt appeal to the entireinternational community to assist the Islamic FederalRepublic of the Comoros to eradicate the ills which aredestroying it  namely underdevelopment anddestabilization.While it is true that we must first and foremostcount on our own strengths  the Islamic Federal Republicof the Comoros also knows that it can count on theUnited Nations  our Organization  with its specializedagencies  including the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Children’s Fund  theWorld Health Organization and the Food and AgricultureOrganization.The Comoros also knows it can count on OAU  theLeague of Arab States  the Organization of the IslamicConference  and the European Union.We can only reiterate here our full confidence in and deep gratitude for  the tireless and determined effortsthey have unceasingly made to ensure the economicdevelopment of  and peace and security for  the IslamicFederal Republic of the Comoros.After this broad overview of the terrible eventswhich my country is enduring  we are obliged to notethat  today  more than ever before  the question ofunderdevelopment remains the major source of threats topeace and international security.While we recognize that on the threshold of the thirdmillennium our Organization remains the guarantor of theemancipation of peoples and the progressive eliminationof poverty  it is also incontestable that the daily strugglewith hunger  malnutrition and illiteracy and the problemof ensuring good health for everyone are challenges toour collective conscience.What can more significantly illustrate the will of ourinstitution to eradicate these scourges than the series ofconferences which have been held throughout the pastdecade? I have in mind the New York World Summit forChildren  the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the Vienna World Conference on Human9Rights  the Cairo International Conference on Populationand Development  the Copenhagen World Summit forSocial Development  the Beijing Fourth World Conferenceon Women  the Istanbul Conference on Human Settlements and the Rome World Food Summit. All these conferencesaroused great hopes in all of mankind but their effects arestill in an embryonic stage  particularly for the developing least developed and island countries.The hopes born of these international meetings are likea distant horizon that seems to recede as one gets nearer toit.The Government of the Islamic Federal Republic ofthe Comoros reaffirms its support for the reformsrecommended for our Organization  in particular thoserelating to the enlargement of the Security Council  sinceour evolving world has taken on new contours. Theseinclude new forms of violence  and our current means ofdealing with them seems increasingly inadequate andunsuitable. The strengthening and maintenance of peacewithin States is today a new concern of our Organization confronted as it is by civil wars  genocide  ethnic cleansing terrorism  mercenaries and all forms of transnational crime.The new international political landscape is  to be sure a result of the new forms of tension  which tend toovershadow some of the conflicts well known to ourOrganization.Since horrors know no limits  the ComorosGovernment is still concerned by the resurgence of violencein the Middle East  which has had a negative effect on thedynamism that had been set in motion by the signing of theOslo agreements between the Palestinians and the Israelis.Thus the provocations by the new Israeli authorities the continuation of the settlement policy  the closing off ofPalestinian territories  the demolition of houses  and thearbitrary arrests all furnish eloquent proof of theimpediments to the peace process.The new conflagration in that part of the worldrequires the international community to redouble itsvigilance so as to ensure the peoples of the subregion theright to peaceful coexistence  for which one of theprerequisites is respect for the right of the Palestinians to afree and independent State.Along the same lines  the occupation of part ofLebanese national territory by foreign troops is a seriousthreat that every day delays the national reconciliation ofa long-suffering people that continues to seek stability.From East to West  from North to South  otherconflicts with various motivations continue to rage andpose serious threats to international peace and security.While it is true that it has been possible to find thebeginnings of solutions thanks to the perseverance of ourOrganization  it remains no less true that other solutionswhich have been advocated have proved of limited value.The pictures of desolation  exposing the sufferingsendured by countries subject to economic embargoes  leadus to question the effectiveness of a solution that first andforemost punishes vulnerable and innocent populations.Africa unfortunately has not been spared the cycle ofviolence  despite the resolution of certain conflicts thathad long plunged this continent into fratricidal wars.Other hotbeds of tension remain  and Africa thereforecontinues to be at the forefront of the internationalcommunity’s concerns. In the Great Lakes region  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Sudan and Somaliacontinue to be theatres for bloody and tragic events.Faced with all these situations of crisis and conflict my Government unreservedly supports the initiativesunderway to achieve negotiated settlements.As for Sierra Leone  the Comorian Republic mostfirmly condemns the violent coup against the leaders ofSierra Leone  whom the people of that country —wishing to break with the practices of a bygone age —legally and democratically chose.As two sides of the same coin  at the internationallevel  political and economic situations remain closelylinked. Thus this gloomy view of the internationalpolitical landscape is made even darker by thedisheartening international economic environment.Despite the priorities and objectives set forth by thenew development strategies  we are obliged to note thatthe results are less than expected. But we venture to hopethat the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative onAfrica  which recently became a supplement to the NewAgenda  will provide the impetus to speed up Africa’sintegration into the international system of trade. Underthis system  small States continue to experience reducedprices for their raw materials  and their burden of debt isbecoming ever more unbearable.10The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  a smallisland State and one of the least developed States  sharesthe plight of those who are excluded from the internationalmarket. For  in addition to limited natural resources and thehigh cost of international transportation  it suffers fromother political and structural restraints  which are slowingdown its socio-economic development.Given the virtually chronic instability that hascharacterized the recent history of the Comoros  theComorian people are obliged to ask whether they have theright to peace and the right to life.The Comorian people remain convinced that the searchfor a just and lasting solution enabling it to embark on apath of harmonious socio-economic developmentnecessarily hinges on a final settlement to the question ofthe Comorian island of Mayotte  which is under Frenchadministration. I reserve the right to speak on this subjectduring the debate. For there can be no doubt that thepresent events in my country are a corollary to theincomplete decolonization and to the socio-economic crisisfrom which the Comorian people have suffered.In conclusion  I associate myself with previousspeakers in extending to the brotherly and friendlyGovernment and people of Indonesia condolences on thecrash of the aircraft that claimed so many lives  as well asour profound grief at the disaster that their country hassuffered as a result of the fires that are devastating theirforests."
"38",1611,"CPV",52,1997,"﻿My delegation is pleased to greet you  Sir  asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession. I congratulate you warmly on your election; wehave full confidence in your notable qualities as a wise andexperienced diplomat.I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail  for the outstanding manner inwhich he carried out his responsibilities. We all benefittedfrom his exceptional ability and his dedication.We were delighted at the election of the illustriousAfrican Mr. Kofi Annan to the post of Secretary-General ata critical time in the history of the Organization. Hissplendid performance in other high United Nations postsand the creativity and dynamism that have marked thebeginning of his term justify the legitimate hopes we haveall placed in him.The numerous and complex challenges before us at thedawn of the third millennium can be faced only by thecombined will and efforts of all Member States. MyGovernment fully recognizes the prominent role of theUnited Nations in the constant quest for relevant solutions.In today’s world  in which sovereignty is less and lessrespected  interdependence and globalization are becomingincreasingly real and tangible. As a result  we need thecreation of new tools capable of raising confidence to ahigher level and increasing cooperation between allinternational actors in a collective effort that alone canprovide answers to the global questions confronting us.For several years  our Organization has beenexperiencing an intensified process of reform aimed atgiving it revitalized energy  renewed representativeness andlegitimacy  increased effectiveness and greater transparency.The first consensus is emerging  and its benefits willdoubtless soon be felt. Recent examples of this include theresolution adopted by the General Assembly followingdiscussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Groupon the Strengthening of the United Nations System  as wellas the adoption of an Agenda for Development  and thegains achieved so far on the road towards an Agenda forPeace.It is very desirable that equally worthwhile progresstake place in parallel with regard to the financial situationof the Organization. In this regard  my country shares thevery broad consensus on the need for Member States torespect their obligation under the Charter to pay theircontributions on time  in full and without conditions.Reform of the Security Council is one of the mostdifficult elements among all the reforms being studied.The broad agreement required for a formula has not yetbeen found. Cape Verde recalls the joint position of thenon-aligned countries  which are demanding non-discriminatory treatment for the developing countries  inparticular with regard to the prerogatives accorded to thepermanent members of the Council. For its part  Africa isnow working to refine practical means for rotation withinthe continent of the seats that it expects to be at itsdisposal to represent its Member States.The Secretary-General has shown us how convincedhe is of the imperative for reform. He took certaindecisions and began to implement them. He then asked usfor advice and proposals. A fundamental objective of theproposed reforms is to provide unity and consistency tothe global activity of the system  and thereby to have anincreased impact. Structural transformations and changesin working methods are the favoured instruments for theimplementation of this objective.We thank and warmly congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative  whose focus and broad scopereveal a deep knowledge of the Organization’s situationand an enlightened vision of the directions that should betaken. We will give constructive support to theseproposals in the consultations that will soon beintensifying at different levels: in the African Group  theGroup of 77 and the General Assembly.The quality of the future to which humankind aspiresdepends on what we can do today to give human beingstheir dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy thefundamental rights recognized in the international legalinstruments that reflect our collective conscience. Wemust all commit ourselves to the resolute protection andconstant promotion of human rights. The United Nationsis dedicated to doing so at several levels and throughdifferent instruments. The Commission on Human Rightsis one of the important ones  and Cape Verde is gratifiedthat it is able to contribute to its work. To accomplish thistask  which is limitless  we must ensure that we constructhuman rights around the axes that complement and5interact with them  as is the case with democracy anddevelopment.Fully functioning democracy provides a vital impetusfor the establishment of a human and institutionalenvironment conducive to development and theimplementation of human rights. However  beyond theformal political dimension  conditions must be created thatallow all of our citizens to live in dignity and achieveimproved standards of living. The right to development istherefore reaffirmed as a cornerstone for concerted actionto ensure that such a right can be enjoyed by everyonethroughout the world.It is time to establish a true international understandingfor development. Everything possible should be done toensure that the Agenda for Development  long the subjectof negotiation and recently adopted by the GeneralAssembly  is fully implemented in practice. In this context we regard as promising those concerted efforts recentlymade by the global institutions  including the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development  the UnitedNations Development Programme  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the World Trade Organization in areascritical for development  such as financial flows  investmentand commerce. We encourage the intensification of thisconcerted action  which has also been requested by theEconomic and Social Council and encouraged by theSecretary-General. It can make a considerable contributionto the establishment of international cooperation  leading todevelopment at both the global and country level.We are presently engaged in a race against the clock.Many developing countries urgently need  finally  toexperience the stirrings of an economic lift-off within theinternational trend. Otherwise  we are afraid that the hard-won reforms of the past and present will not be sustained and will still less be able to gain the social backing thatalone can ensure the eventual transition to the secondgeneration of reforms.The progress that we envisage is not limited solely tothe economic arena. Solidarity will also be required. Wecannot accept the continued existence of certain barriersthat we have erected and that are now impeding us fromfully enjoying our fundamental rights. I am thinking of suchperversions as racism and exclusion areas based onxenophobia  discrimination which is inflicted on so manyindividuals  particularly immigrants.Migratory movements have taken place throughouthistory. We should treat them with understanding anddialogue  which will enable us to find solutions to theinevitable problems  rather than allow them to becomeexacerbated. In this regard  international instruments canbe extremely useful. It is important that the InternationalConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All MigrantWorkers and Members of Their Families finally enter intoforce. We also hope that the Assembly will follow up theresolution of the Economic and Social Council onconvening a world conference against racism  racial andethnic discrimination  xenophobia and other relatedcontemporary forms of intolerance.On this continuing and unequal march towardsdevelopment  in which all are involved  some of ourcountries remain among the least advanced. At a time ofincreased globalization  to warn against the risk ofconsolidating and perpetuating the marginalization ofthese countries is not mere rhetorical overstatement. Onthe contrary  this danger is very real. The least-developedcountries’ share of world exports continues to languish atvery low levels  and their rate of growth even dropped in1996.External trade is vital for reversing the presentsituation of the least developed countries. The decisionadopted in Marrakesh regarding measures to help them as well as the World Trade Organization Plan of Actionadopted last December in Singapore  recognize that theleast developed countries urgently need to achieve alasting increase in their exports. These countries musttherefore significantly improve their competitivecapability  and their exports of goods and services musthave free access to all global markets.In this sense  we are expecting initiatives from thehigh-level meeting on the least developed countries  to beheld next month in Geneva aided by increasedinstitutional synergy between those international bodieswith competence and responsibility in areas critical forthe development of the least developed countries.The foreign debt of these countries continues togrow. The problem continues to be inadequately handled as regards both the categories of countries covered byinitiatives and the actual level of the initiatives. All leastdeveloped countries — not only the most criticallyaffected — need adequate and lasting relief.Moreover  the financing of certain elementsindispensable for international integration of thesecountries  such as infrastructure and education  to citeonly a few  requires a significantly increased flow of6public development aid. For the least developed countries this will become ever more necessary in the future.In Cape Verde  a least developed country which hassuffered a prolonged drought  there is today nationalconsensus about the country’s future and the major paths tobe followed. The reforms which we are undertaking havethe support of the nation  which can legitimately aspire toimproving its living conditions today  and not in the distantfuture.The fact that the African continent contains themajority of the world’s least developed countries speakseloquently of its limitations. For the internationalcommunity  Africa is a test of its will and its ability tomeet the challenge of global development. The world willnot be developed so long as Africa is not developed.Solutions  as we know  begin at home. The presentand the recent past of our continent confirm that weunderstand this  and are acting upon it more and more. Itake this opportunity to thank those in the internationalcommunity who are firmly supporting Africa’s developmentand encourage them to have greater confidence in the futureof our continent and in the partnership between Africa andits friends.If the Africans continue to step up the changes underway in the right direction  and if there is concrete progressand cooperation in the international environment  it is likelythat the positive signs of the last few years willprogressively be consolidated in Africa.However  there are constraints of another natureimpeding the general progress sought by our continent:situations of conflict and potential conflict  which continueto proliferate  some of them particularly bloody.Experience — particularly recent experience — has shownthat these conflicts are often highly complex. They becomedeeply rooted and thus thwart any diplomatic or otherattempts at solution. However  that is no reason for theUnited Nations and its Member States to give up theirefforts to solve these problems.Working together and in concert with the UnitedNations  the Africans are becoming more active in theirefforts at the regional level to contribute to preventing andmanaging the conflicts on the continent. Africa needsinternational support in order to step up its capacities in thisarea. Such support should not become a means ofdiscrimination  negative or positive  with regard to certainconflicts as compared with others  based on the subjectivepreferences of donors. The multilateral nature of theUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity(OAU) implies avoidance of this risk and balancedtreatment of conflict situations.The case of Angola has called for the greatest effortsof the United Nations in Africa — lengthy and repeatedefforts. Unfortunately  a new deterioration in the situation with violent consequences  is not impossible at a timewhen UNITA is persisting in failing to respect the termsof the Lusaka Accords. Therefore  the most recentSecurity Council resolution on Angola is fully justified and we hope that it will have the desired effect. Only afew days from the expiration of its time limit  we urgeUNITA to take the decisive steps required for lastingpeace in Angola.We would like to reaffirm here the support of CapeVerde for the people of East Timor in its quest forgenuine self-determination  the preservation of its identity and recognition of and total respect for its rights. Wewelcomed the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 totwo eminent individuals from East Timor  Don XimenesBelo and Ramos-Horta. That award brought even moreinternational attention to the situation of their people. It istime for reason and justice to prevail  and we welcomethe appointment of a Special Representative for EastTimor by the Secretary-General within the framework ofhis redoubled efforts to assist in finding an equitablesolution to the conflict in the territory.Last June  a special session of the General Assemblyto assess the implementation of Agenda 21 achievedmeagre results. All sides — Governments  internationalinstitutions and social groups — are again challenged tohonour the Rio commitments and show moredetermination and responsibility on the environment.Certainly  with regard to control of the causes ofenvironmental degradation and long-term management ofthe planet’s non-renewable resources  different partieshave different responsibilities  but those responsibilitiesare shared. Among the numerous constraining factors population and consumption remain major factors. Whiledemographic growth presents encouraging medium- andlong-term indicators  unbalanced rates of consumptionpersist and even increase  putting unsustainable pressureon resources.My country  a country of the Sahel and an islandnation  is particularly sensitive to certain threats to theenvironment  such as drought and desertification  which7were the subject of an international Convention givingparticular attention to the situation in Africa. ThePermanent International Committee for Drought Control inthe Sahel (CILSS)  of which Cape Verde is a member  istaking action with a visible impact  which merits continuedsupport by its external partners.Another factor for environmental deterioration — thistime a social one — is the scourge of drugs and the humandegradation to which it leads. To combat illegal drugtrafficking and the laundering of the money it generates close international cooperation is required  particularly inthe exchange of information and logistical and materialsupport. This is a global phenomenon  and the means tocombat it must also be formulated globally  with nationaland regional foundations. The West African subregion through the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  has begun concerted efforts. The PoliticalDeclaration of Praia last July laid down the basis forgrowing cooperation between the countries involved.The last years of this millennium mark the end of anextraordinary period. The era which began with the fall ofthe Berlin Wall will go down in history as an era of anexplosion of the ideals of liberty and progress such as hadnot been seen since the great wave of independence in the1960s.These gains  together with the dizzying advances ofscience and technology  attest to mankind’s extraordinaryability to come up with imaginative answers. However mankind has not yet freed itself from feelings ofindifference and exclusion  and often even of hate. This isperhaps the major challenge as this century comes to aclose.The complete achievement of the noble objectives ofthe Charter would doubtless represent a decisive steptowards such emancipation."
"39",1657,"CRI",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to begin by congratulating you  Sir on your election as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session. Costa Rica joins the previousexpressions of appreciation that have been addressed toyou and wishes you every success in this period that willbe remembered for its special contribution to the reformof this highest forum of international politics.Ten years ago Central America surprised the worldby proclaiming peace. Ten years ago nations separated byhatred and divided by ancestral injustices decided to putan end to their differences through dialogue andreconciliation and to move  without haste  but alsowithout delay  towards a more promising future ofequality and sustainable development.The world has changed greatly in this decade. Thewalls of intolerance fell in Berlin and in Pretoria; the20Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo have not lost any morechildren. There is no doubt that we live in turbulent timesbut  most world leaders  regardless of their religion orethnic origin  subscribe to the widespread conviction thatthe models of the cold war cannot guide us through the newmillennium. Moreover at the global level  despite thetemporary images from Sarajevo  Kigali  Rwanda andMonrovia  there prevails a vision of a twenty-first centuryin which democracy  reason and justice reign.My people believes in peace. My people believes indisarmament. My people believes that the destiny of thehuman family is one of harmony and solidarity under theauspices of international law. These beliefs are not theproduct of intellectual speculation. Costa Rica has lived formore than 100 years in a democracy protected by pluralismand respect for human rights. My compatriots  men andwomen  are aware that they are the sons and daughters ofa nation whose history proves that there is no force strongerthan that of reason. This is why  when our armed forceswere abolished as a standing institution in 1948  almost atthe same time as the United Nations was being born  CostaRica declared peace to the world and thus unequivocallyshowed its profound love for harmony among all thepeoples of the world.Central America comes to this forum united around anideal of common integration and working together on ashared democratic project. For the first time in history  ourcountries come before the General Assembly to declare notjust their reiterated adherence to the Charter and to theprinciples and obligations inherent in civilized coexistencein the community of nations  but also their intention tomarch decisively towards unity as a higher stage in thecommunitarian partnership that we already enjoy under the1991 Protocol of Tegucigalpa.For the last three years  Central America has made agreat effort to link up with the rest of the world  somethingwe regard as essential if we are to realize the objectivesand priorities of our Alliance for Sustainable Development.This initiative  signed in 1994  was the first in the world tobe adopted since the Declaration of the United NationsConference on Environment and Development.The fruits of this effort have been abundant. CentralAmerica has established preferential relations with Canada Chile  the United States  Japan  Mexico  the Republic ofKorea and the European Union. The biggest innovation hasbeen the definition of agendas based not on short-terminterests  but on regional strategic priorities. We are nowconcentrating on improving integration by thoroughlyreforming regional institutions. Convinced that economicgrowth can be achieved only if accompanied byincreasing levels of sustainable development  the CentralAmerican countries wish to inform the internationalcommunity of our decision to move forward resolutelytowards a common future  a future of great progress andsolidarity for our peoples.The world today is still diverse  still divided. Manycultures and societies live on a single shared planet. Intoday’s complex scenario  now that the Cold War is over divisions remain and new dangers threaten internationalsociety. This is why the United Nations continues to bethe meeting point  the unifying institution for all of us. Itwill continue to play that important role  provided weshoulder our commitments  face our challenges and makeprogressive changes.Since our Secretary-General presented his proposalsfor reform in July  the Central American countries haveexpressed firm support for his ideas about a modern efficient  nimble Organization with better coordination inline with current administrative and financial trends  anOrganization enabling us  without further delay  to movefrom lofty aspirations to real actions that will helpeverybody  especially those in developing countries which comprise the overwhelming majority of themembers of this body. We take this opportunity toreiterate our clear and firm support for the Secretary-General’s proposals submitted to Member States forconsideration at this session.United Nations reform should be accompanied by aconstructive review of the scale of assessments. In CentralAmerica we believe that the criteria for the scale ofassessments need to be changed so that all Member Statescontribute financially to the Organization in accordancewith their means.The Central American countries believe that theinternational peace and security system designed in 1945should be subject to detailed review in a broad andconsensual exercise. In principle  we support the idea ofincreasing the number of Member States with permanentmembership in the Security Council. We believe  at thesame time  that any such proposal must be democraticand representative of the plurality of States and regionsthat make up the United Nations. In particular  westrongly support the argument that the three developingregions of the world should have permanentrepresentation in that organ and that the veto power  if21there is no willingness to eliminate it  should be confinedto topics under Chapter VII of the Charter.The founders of the United Nations saw a world thathad to decide between peace and extermination. Stillaffected by the Second World War  they were well placedto understand that humanity had no other choice but toshelter under the protection of international law as the onlyway of preventing a new Holocaust. More than 50 yearslater  we have a similar duty  but one that is less dramaticthanks to the significant progress made since the end of theCold War: the duty to provide the United Nations with thepolitical  financial and administrative conditions it needs sothat it can continue its work for peace and internationalsecurity. Central America is ready to make its contributionso that these noble objectives may be attained."
"40",1726,"CUB",52,1997,"﻿Ernesto Che Guevara  Commander  Minister andhead of the Cuban delegation to the nineteenth session ofthe General Assembly  stated 33 years ago  from this veryrostrum:“We wish to see this Assembly stretch its limbsand march forward; we want the Committees to begintheir work  which should not stop at the firstconfrontation.” [Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Nineteenth Session  Plenary Meetings 1299th meeting  para. 81]And  as if he could already see the present  he added:“Imperialism seeks to convert this meeting into apointless competition in oratory  to prevent it fromsolving the serious problems of the world; that designwe must frustrate.” (Ibid.)At that time  on our planet some 700 million peoplewere illiterate; 200 million were unemployed; and over 1billion were eking out a precarious existence. That realitycontravened the principle that humans are the source ofdevelopment  as well as its agents and beneficiaries  andshould be considered  above all  as the justification andpurpose of development.As the years went by  the situation worsened. Today not only are the industrialized nations imposing conditionson or denying outright a meagre share of their plentifulresources as official development assistance for thedevelopment of the poorest nations  but some of them  likeostriches  are burying their head in the sand anddisregarding that obligation.Although missions to Mars are widely publicized andassurances are given that the world economy is growing the distressing truth remains that today in the world abillion people are illiterate; as many are unemployed orunderemployed; and more than 2 billion are living undersubhuman conditions.Among these  we note with dismay  are the 425 000children worldwide who  since Tuesday  16 September when this session started  have died from preventablediseases. Those 425 000 children were sacrificed in thename of efficiency  quality and consumption — a patternof consumption that today requires an irrational andunsustainable development  to which those children nevereven had access.Time is not just slipping by; we are letting it slipthrough our fingers. With it  we are losing also ouropportunities to save our planet  which is sick and besetin a thousand ways because the men and women whohave been gathering here for the last 52 years on behalfof our peoples have in many cases been unableconsistently to translate words into deeds.Why  on the threshold of a new century  should weallow such a crime to take place? Where is that promisedland  that higher society  that paradise craved by millionsof human beings? How can we dream today  when theoverwhelming majority of human beings cannot evensleep because violence  hunger and disease keep themawake?Over five decades ago  the nations of the worlddecided to unite against war and to work in peace forprogress and cooperation among peoples. But since then no one has enjoyed real and lasting peace. As manypeople have become the victims of violence and armedconflicts in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall aswere killed in the 15-year Viet Nam war.Our memory has become so short that those samepeople who raised their voices against the Germancapital’s concrete wall now justify  promote and evenstand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavilyfortified wall that would divide the poor South from thedeveloped North  along the Rio Grande all the way toBaja California  and which very few dare to denounce.Likewise  an absurd hypocrisy allows militaryexpenditures to be the number one business in the world with close to $900 billion in circulation  followed by drugsmuggling  with upwards of $500 billion  while as muchmoney is invested in a modern bomber as would berequired to relieve the foreign debt of the 20 countriesmost heavily burdened by that scourge.“Divide and conquer”: the Roman maxim forsubduing the ancient world is increasingly and ever moreforcefully becoming the slogan of the era of outer space27and information superhighways. The only form of concertedaction that seems to be fully consolidated is the one that from here  proposes and undertakes humanitarianinterventions and operations aimed at enforcing maintaining or consolidating peace and democracy in thewake of conflicts; preventive and early-warning actions; andall those various ways of disguising new wars.If we fail to stop this  the upcoming third millenniumwill not find peaceful and generous comity among nations.Nor will it bring any closer the anticipated miracle ofmultiplying loaves and fishes for all through developmentand rational exchange. On the contrary  consumerism environmental deterioration  illiteracy  xenophobia terrorism  drug addiction  famine  AIDS  prostitution and allthose visible symptoms of the human rationalityimmunodeficiency syndrome that our planet is sufferingfrom will devour us. Can it be  as one poet says  thatpeople are mean and undeserving and we should thereforeaccept the idea that the already foreseen end of history willbe followed by the end of the human race?If we resign ourselves to the fact that 285 people canpossess riches equal to the ill-apportioned wealth of 2.5billion other human beings  it might be that a doomsday ofsimilar proportions awaits us should we fail to change thecourse of events. Just one detail: were it not for the 2.5billion people doomed to sacrifice  it would be veryunlikely that the other 285 people could survive  regardlessof how much more wealth they would be able toaccumulate.All these problems belong to this world  not another.They are ours  as much as these “Disunited Nations”  whichwe are unable to cast into a true gathering of Governmentsand peoples designed to change and save our planet.In the light of these problems  many of us wonderwhether the words of a powerful minority are worth morethan the lives of that overwhelming majority of humanbeings who for many reasons are not only deprived of theirright to say a word  but also lack the resolution and thepower to exercise that right when they do have it.We also wonder how there can be talk ofmultilateralism when we see an endlessly increasingunilateralism and when the so-called de-ideologized worldimposes on us a sole and exclusive ideology. Something iswrong when speeches on plurality are made while attemptsare made to impose uniformity on the world; things areeven worse if  instead of everyone having the same rightsand duties — as should be the case — in fact  a few havemore and more rights whereas the vast majority only getmore and more duties.We dedicated the decade which is just concluding tointernational law with a view to honouring it withconcrete actions. However  in this very building therehave been talks and negotiations about  and even votesagainst  these principles and international law itself. Weshould ask ourselves once again when we will actuallyconclude the agreements on nuclear disarmament  andwhen the use of force or threats will be once and for allbanned in international relations. Why allow certainPowers to pursue with impunity the arms race  theirmilitary hegemony and the defiant nuclear tests inlaboratories and computers while they try to ban them forthe rest?How can we stop those who split whole nationsapart  prevent their peaceful reunification and finance andarm regimes that violate human rights? All theendeavours to establish a new  just and equitableeconomic world order  free of humiliating conditions andrestrictive and onerous practices  are brutally challengedby a powerful minority that reserves the worst andcruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet.A handful of the rich will never be able to representthe vast multitudes of human beings  deprived every dayof their right to know that they are human  multitudes onwhom cultural transnationalization imposes an informationorder capable of homogenizing even the news of theirvery lives. Nor can one accept that the select club shoulddecree in a totalitarian way the political and juridicalorder of the peoples  without even asking who we are where we are coming from and what we rely upon to gowhere we sovereignly wish. Those belonging to that club and they alone  are the ones primarily responsible for thefact that today cardinal principles of international law such as self-determination  national independence  non-interference in domestic affairs  and particularly respectfor the sovereignty of States are questioned.That is why Cuba asserts our right to differ  andwhy we reiterate the position expressed by our Presidentmore than three decades ago:“As long as the concept of sovereignty exists as aprerogative of nations and independent peoples  as aright of all peoples  we do not accept the exclusionof our people from that right. As long as the worldis guided by those principles  as long as the world isguided by those concepts  which have universal28validity  because they are universally accepted andenshrined by the peoples  we will not accept beingdeprived of any of those rights; we will not relinquishany of those rights.”For us there is absolutely no doubt that sovereigntycontinues to be a concept and a prerogative of independentStates  and that in today’s unipolar world that principle haseven more force and validity than ever before.Economies  cultures and peoples are subjugated underthe drum roll of globalization; development becomes asremote as stars to which we cannot travel  and wealth isincreasingly polarized. Under the impulse of thisglobalization  vaunted new technological and scientificdisplays are poisoning the environment  crushingbiodiversity and condemning to extinction the mostprecarious and wonderful of all species: mankind.It would be good if that global interdependency couldstop the frantic consumption  balance national developmentpatterns  make economies sustainable and multiply theriches of the peoples. Even better  if ideas are to be trulyglobalized  let us welcome the clamour for urgent reform ofthis United Nations  as remote from its own origins as it isunable to cope with the era in which we are living. Thatcould be dreamt of  if at least the reform started with acomprehensive and inclusive endeavour  democratizing allits bodies while preserving its universal character  itspolitical essence and its intergovernmental nature.It is high time to go beyond the rhetoric in which wehave been immersed for two years  since we celebrated thefiftieth anniversary of the Organization with talk of reform with talk about transformations  without saying what  who how and when. If we are to be occupied  and not onlypreoccupied  with reform  let us reject  as incompatible withthis Organization  the corporate and transnational approachpromoted by some of the main United Nations contributors as if this building were a stock exchange and the justdesires of the peoples were mere merchandise.The reforms must permit the General Assembly toreally exercise its prerogatives  including those which havebeen usurped  while preserving the principle of equality ofall Member States  whose genuine political will is essentialto advance. Intergovernmental participation in consideringand adopting decisions on any reform package should be afundamental precondition if we really want to tend to theneeds of the historically forgotten majority in the world.Likewise  our peoples  especially the poorest ones  willunderstand only those decisions that are reflected in theirlives and homes — not those that satisfy only theirGovernments.Cuba also advocates reform that especiallystrengthens United Nations structures and activities thatare related to the promotion of economic and socialdevelopment. The simplification  rationalization orreorientation of those structures must be the result of aprocess that always guarantees full completion andimplementation of all programmes  mandates andactivities in those areas.The United Nations should recover its real decision-making capacity in other critical issues  such as thoserelated to free trade  development financing and othermonetary topics. Any measure handing that role over tothe main contributors must be blocked.Further  we should all endorse again the Charterobligation to contribute to stable and unconditionalfinancing  making possible the effective and efficientimplementation of all programmes  priorities  mandatesand activities approved by the General Assembly. Theapproval of a budget for each programme reflecting thetotal resources required for the Organization to carry outall its activities will be a cornerstone of that endeavour.Along these lines  we oppose any formula based onthe extortion and pressure that are exerted by somecountries  particularly by the country which is the maincontributor to the United Nations — as well as its deepestdebtor  economically and morally speaking.But to achieve the more democratic  efficient anddynamic United Nations we are dreaming of  it isessential that the reforms reach the heart of one of itsprincipal organs: the Security Council must stop being abunker impenetrable to the General Assembly’s demandsfor an equitable and fair expansion. While some of therichest and most powerful States are already taking longstrides towards any new seats that might appear  there areattempts to mislead  and even to deny the right of thethird world to its due representation on the Council on anequal footing with the rest of the permanent members.Worse yet  the saw of division is once again cuttingthrough the body of the poor to the benefit of the bigindustrialized countries.Let us reach agreement once and for all. If we wantreal security  what we agree upon must not furtherincrease the appalling imbalances that today insult andexterminate us. Hence the importance of reforming the29composition and procedures of the Security Council  and ofrectifying the largest existing imbalance  by enablingdeveloping countries to become members based onequitable geographical representation and simultaneity ofaccession by new members.The Council will never be secure until transparency democracy and the participation of non-member Statesforever take the place of the present dangerous andconcealed manoeuvres. Peace will never be guaranteed untilthe obsolete and antidemocratic institution of the vetodisappears  or is at least restricted pending its finalelimination. That is the only way to prevent the abuses ofpower that today prevail in this Organization and in theSecurity Council. By confronting these abuses together  wewill prevent the coercive policies and unilateral measuresgenerated by certain States from becoming multilateral.I know a teenager who is the pride of his parents. Helikes baseball  is a good student and dreams an ocean ofdreams. But it has recently been discovered that he suffersfrom leukaemia. The medicines to cure him exist  and thetreatment could cost less than $15 000 if we act in time.Cuba has been forced to arrange a discrete transaction toobtain through friendly third parties  and at a total cost of$60 000  the medicines to save that child’s life.That is the blockade: for the price of four treatments we could afford only one. With the money to save fourlives  only one will be saved. But this is not the onlyexample. Despite its very limited income  Cuba continuesto pay hundreds of millions of dollars in price differences surcharges  freight and other additional charges in itsimports of fuel  food  medicines and other basic products.Financial credits crucial for the economic recovery andgrowth were suspended or postponed or became moreexpensive  while all markets labelled us as a “risk” for fearof the unilateral punishment that could fall on Governmentsand banks if they lent us money.On top of all of that  and because of the protectionismof pharmaceutical patents  Cubans have been deprived offree access to medicines that have appeared on the marketsince 1979  including third-generation antibiotics and otherdrugs to treat AIDS and cancer.Cuba has no need to exaggerate the facts. It suffersthem first  contemplates them afterwards  and alwaysexposes them with a calm sense of responsibility. The taleof a giant Goliath against a small David could have beentaken from the Bible  but the minstrels and chroniclers ofthe next millennium will find plenty of inspiration in theconflict between the United States and Cuba.Almost 40 years of resistance and of defence of ourbold ideals of independence against our brutal neighbourwho covets and loathes us provide us with the authorityto speak. More than 35 years of struggle against the crueland inhumane economic  commercial and financialblockade by the United States of America support ourarguments. Every new charge made by Cuba is supportedby more than $60 billion in losses — and that is not afull assessment — by an economy distorted by the warconditions imposed on us  and by the incalculable human physical and psychological damage we have sustained.Every year sees an increase in the number ofcountries that vote by an overwhelming majority to put anend to that dirty  savage and silent war. Yet the blockadenot only remains in effect  but has been cruelly andarrogantly strengthened before the very eyes of the world which remains hamstrung in the face of the power of theEmpire.Where are the courage and bravery that turned ourspecies into a giant? Why should we tolerate thediplomacy of intimidation and blackmail? For how longwill the world sit on its hands and watch so merciless acrime?It was such impunity that gave free rein to thosewho expedited the enactment of the criminal Helms-Burton Act as a new escalation of the blockade and asadditional and convincing proof of a threat that goesbeyond all borders. It is extraterritorial from top tobottom  because it was conceived and implementedagainst another sovereign State  with which theyhypocritically maintain they are not at war; at the sametime  it is extraterritorial against the rest of the world upon which they are attempting to impose the narrowjurisdiction of a clumsy national legal artifice.This abhorred and oft-condemned imperial recipe hasnot met with any actions forceful enough to stop it. Itsadoption gave rise to other aberrations  such as theD’Amato-Kennedy Act; and state and federal legislationof the same kind proliferates in that country.Similar measures already affect more than 35sovereign States — that is  2.3 billion people  accountingfor 42 per cent of the world’s population and a potentialmarket of $790 billion. These data  provided by theUnited States President’s Advisory Council on Export30Control and the American Institute for InternationalEconomy  prove that such extraterritorial policies also resultin harm to the American people themselves  who in oneyear alone lost half a million jobs and more than $1 billionin salaries because of them.Insane politicians and legislators end up by restrictingthe very values of freedom upon which that great countrywas founded and  in its name  prevent millions of Americanyouth from gaining access to information about a worldfestival of youth and students held in Havana last summer.Those who attempt today to cross that new iron curtain risk$250 000 dollar fines and up to 10 years in prison. Despitethose threats  about a thousand young men and womenfrom the United States challenged the veto on theirfreedom — no one could prevent them — and attended theHavana festival anyway.Such policies and concepts also affect the vastmajority of our countrymen living in the United States  foryears victims of criminal organizations and their hirelingsbased in Miami  used in the dirtiest deals and electoralmanoeuvres  and even used as cannon fodder against theirown people and their own motherland. Among them  asilent majority of immigrants is emerging ever strongerevery day  rejecting the genocide against their motherland.Despite all this  the raving obsession of the reactionarycircles never seems to stop  as a true tyranny attemptsincreasingly to reach out for the goal of world power.Today  new bills are being debated in the Congress inWashington  blooming under the shelter of instrumentsalready approved in the Helms-Burton legal atrocity.Today  independent nations are being bullied every sixmonths so that they can obtain a sovereignty certificatefrom the White House Oval Office to avoid retaliation fortheir relations with Cuba.Today  attempts to curb free trade with false excusesof national security are jolting the newly born World TradeOrganization  and their doubtful seriousness begins to worrythe most distinguished United States authorities.Today  deals are made behind the backs of peoples Governments and Parliaments to impose moratoriums oninvestments  and secret pseudo-legal arguments  based ondubious morality  are concocted to disguise theshamelessness of those who yield to pressure.Today  there are blacklists of foreign companies andbusinessmen who do not submit to the rules  thereforebeing denied entry to that country  which regards itself assuper-free. Visas are also denied to their spouses andchildren  to force them to yield to the empire’s will.Today  there are Governments that receive or awaitcertificates of good democratic behaviour  certificates thatthey are defenders of selected and manipulated rights orare outstanding anti-drug enforcers  in order to gainaccess to a fast track to a free trade agreement  a tradecredit or development aid.Today  European citizens are being blackmailed byattorneys  indicted and unjustly found guilty by UnitedStates courts  which boast about their impartiality  undersuch illegalities as the Helms-Burton Act.Today  there are imperialist diplomats  clones ofpolicemen  who share the stage with famous Hollywoodstars and who parade arrogantly among the Governmentsand Parliaments of the world  with their siren song andtheir well-known threats and offers of charity in exchangefor the most abject complicity.All of this madness has revived official and covertoperations  mercenaries  spies and assassins  as ready nowas in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleashterror against human beings and even employ aggressivebiological agents against our economy.No one  absolutely no one  has lifted a finger in theUnited States Government to stop them. Diehard sectorshave usurped their constitutional rights in order toexercise that power  and are obstructing them in themeanest and pettiest way.The same gang of ultraconservatives and gangstersis responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedesthe use of the term “terrorists”  while with a silent andmysterious complicity they are bolstered  funded organized  armed  trained and assigned to intelligencemissions.Disguised as tourists  defenders of human rights orphilanthropists  those who today stir up greater and morepainful confrontations between Cuba and the UnitedStates are identical to those who 35 years ago wereinvolved in the climate of aggression which led to themissile crisis in October 1962.Unfortunately  there are people in the world who donot see  or  even worse  do not want to see  these facts 31and from their sanctuaries they worry about our problems study us  advise us to surrender  design our future with thesame ingredients as our past  and even urge us to beareverything with the utmost patience.Believe me  it is very hard to understand  for example the uneasiness caused by the lack of a variety of dishes onthe Cuban table  when there is not the least concern for themillions of human beings to their south without tables ordishes  and often without even a slice of bread. We shallnever understand or accept the longed-for renunciation ofwhat we are and what we have been as the contemptibleprice that the people of socialist Cuba  like any otherpeople in the world  should pay for an uncertaincoexistence with a neighbour as disrespectful and arrogantas it is powerful.The moral and legal support of 136 votes in thisAssembly encourages and comforts us in our struggle. Butit has not been enough to overcome the persistent arroganceof the one who thinks himself the divine judge and lacksthe humility to admit the failure of a mistaken policy.Although their representatives may  as usual  leave theChamber  we know they are listening. Therefore  on behalfof the people of free Cuba we wish them to know and toconvey to their Government and Congress that we haveabsolutely no fear of them.We also know that only international pressure canprevent these forms of aggression against Cuba  or anyother sovereign State  from multiplying.For these reasons  and because of our commitment tothe millions of Cubans whom we represent and on whosebehalf we now speak  we confirm that if our stubborn willto resist costs us our lives  so be it a thousand times over.Never shall we submit again to being slaves of a haughtyand arrogant empire that refuses to recognize pluralism orboundaries  an empire that decides to blockade ourexistence and kill all hope.Our experience confirms to us today  more than ever that only the spirit of sacrifice  the loving  valiant  free andselfless unity of our people and Government  can give usthe strength of character of Quixote to stand up to suchgigantic hardships.That is how we have been able to resist  along withthe most generous solidarity and understanding of thousandsof millions of people.Desiring only the noblest satisfaction  our peoplevolunteer and join in the titanic task of putting an end tothe cataclysms shaking the Earth and fighting for theadvent of a new millennium of emancipation  peace security and development for all nations.We ask for nothing  absolutely nothing  in return.We can only offer the example of having stoicallyendured the harassment of the greatest Power in history of maintaining our principles and of continuing to believe work and move forward when many thought we hadstopped and were dying.The father of our independence said “We Cubans do not seek and do not want anythinggreater than honour  homeland and freedom.Everything else will come for sure and in bulk afterall that. What we need is to succeed.”And our existence today is reason enough for us to assertproudly that we have already succeeded.Because of that unique experience  we can also saythat this is a solemn and decisive time.The imperial Power that wants to subjugate theworld is no match for us if we stand together.We are a great and very powerful majority.There will be no place in history for those who stayon their knees. Let us all rise  united!"
"41",1772,"CYP",52,1997,"﻿I would like to begin byextending to you  Sir  my warmest congratulations onyour election as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session. We are certain that your longexperience and diplomatic skills will guide us successfullyin our work at this session of the General Assembly.I would also like to thank your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for the determinedleadership with which he steered our work at the fifty-first session.Our Organization  with its universal membership comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve theuniversal goals we all strive for: a secure and peacefulfuture  a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor  fullrespect for human rights  free and equitable trade  theprotection of the environment and the promotion ofsustainable development.I am pleased once again to be able to take thisopportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals andaims that all of us here share.This year is a landmark in the reform process of theUnited Nations because of the active measures taken bythe Secretary-General of our Organization to tackle long-standing and deep-rooted issues. Last July  the Secretary-General presented to us a comprehensive package ofreforms designed to help the Organization rationalize andstreamline its operations  secure its financial position andrefocus itself to meet the changes in the global order  thusallowing the United Nations to fully utilize the strengthsand expertise it already possesses.We are therefore particularly pleased to welcome theseproposals by the Secretary-General. We hope that  by theconclusion of the debate on this issue that will take placein the plenary during this session  we shall reach aconsensus  thus creating the necessary momentum for theirspeedy implementation  and produce concrete results beforewe reach the new millennium.The reforms are being introduced at a time when it isgenerally acknowledged that the High-Level WorkingGroups mandated by the General Assembly to examinespecific issues  from the restructuring and strengthening ofthe main United Nations organs to ensuring a firmer andlasting financing for our Organization  have yet to achievesubstantial progress.From this rostrum  I have stated before that wesubscribe to the need to reform the Security Council bymaking it representative of the increase in the membershipof the United Nations and reflect the changes in the post-cold-war world. We consider the need to reform theSecurity Council a top priority  for it directly affects itscapacity to discharge its cardinal responsibility — that ofmaintaining international peace and security.In this regard  we welcome the progress alreadyachieved in the working methods of the Security Counciland expect further steps towards transparency anddemocratization. A number of proposals have been putforward by Member States over the last three years. Furtherdeliberations are required  however  to achieve anagreement that would command the general support of themembership of the Organization.An important step this year concerns the work of theOrganization in the field of international economic andsocial cooperation. After three years of hard deliberation the General Assembly adopted its Agenda for Developmentlast June. This is a great step forward because  as theSecretary-General himself states in his report on the workof the Organization  it addresses not only the conventionaldevelopment issues but also stresses the mutually supportivethough complex relationships among development  peace democracy  good governance and human rights.Equally important was the convening of the nineteenthspecial session of the General Assembly to review theimplementation of Agenda 21 — the global plan of actionfor sustainable development — which was adopted fiveyears ago at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.I believe that an important part of the future work ofthis Organization will lie in following up the work doneat the major conferences and in reviewing theimplementation of the plans and programmes theyadopted.The United Nations of the future must give mosturgent priority to the Agenda for Development. Anymodern concept of international peace must recognize thatpeace  security and development are indivisible.It is indisputable that one of the major strengths ofthe United Nations is its universality. It is at once global regional and locally based. It has achieved great results inthe fields of international interaction. Its activities have atremendous effect on our everyday lives.At this juncture  I should commend and stress theimportant role of the Organization in the promotion offull respect for and universal application of human rights as well as for the progressive development andcodification of international law. In this respect  we fullysupport the establishment of the international criminalcourt  which we have long advocated  and welcome theprogress made in the Preparatory Committee and theincreased momentum towards its fruition.Though local and ethnic conflicts still persist seriously affecting the maintenance of international peaceand security  the role of the Organization in disarmamentfor the past twelve months has been marked by greatsteps. A number of significant conventions have alreadybeen concluded or have entered into force. In welcomingthese achievements we feel we must continue to moveahead for their full and effective implementation.We must also cherish the Organization’s contributionto development and education  its work against hungerand illiteracy and  in short  its role in restoring andupholding human dignity.We believe in the United Nations and in the Charter not as an abstract ideal  but as a functioning indispensable  concrete entity. The principles and idealsof the United Nations have formed the cornerstone of ourforeign policy since our independence and membership inthe United Nations. We are fully committed tostrengthening the Organization by helping it tackle its2precarious financial position  streamline and rationalize itsoperations and exploit to the full its uniqueness and itsunrivalled expertise. We are confident that the Organizationwill be able to harness the forces of change in ways thatwill benefit us all.This year the United Nations has been especiallyactive on certain long-outstanding issues such as EastTimor  Western Sahara  the situation in the Middle East andCyprus.We welcome the developments on the question ofWestern Sahara and the agreement reached on theimplementation of the settlement plan under the auspices ofthe Secretary-General and his Special Envoy. We hope thatthese positive achievements will move the peace processforward and bring a final settlement to this long drawn-outsituation of tension and conflict.Despite our earlier hopes based on the peaceagreement  the current events in the Middle East and theworsening situation in the occupied territories are cause forgreat concern. As a neighbouring country  we wish toreiterate our support for the efforts to achieve peace in thearea on the basis of the agreements reached and of therelevant United Nations resolutions.As to the question of Cyprus  1997 has been a year ofintense diplomatic activity  culminating in face-to-faceintercommunal talks under the auspices of the UnitedNations last July and August in Troutbeck and Glion respectively. The resumption of the talks was the result ofthe untiring efforts of the Secretary-General  encouragedand actively supported by the international community. TheSecurity Council closely pursued the developments on thequestion of Cyprus  and nine individual countries appointedspecial representatives on Cyprus. The European Union through the Special Representative of the Presidency  wasalso following developments closely.When invited by Mr. Kofi Annan last June to attendface-to-face talks with the leader of the Turkish Cypriotcommunity in Troutbeck and later in Glion  we respondedpositively and demonstrated our sincere and unwaveringcommitment to the peace process as the only means ofsolving the Cyprus question  and our will to work for acomprehensive  just and viable solution.Our will was tested even harder when  on the eve ofthe talks  Turkey and the so-called Turkish Republic ofNorthern Cyprus  which is not recognized internationallyexcept by Turkey  signed an illegal agreement purporting tolead to the annexation by Turkey of the areas occupied bythe Turkish forces if the European Union proceeded toaccession negotiations with Cyprus. Despite this enormousprovocation  we reacted in a low key in order to avoidtension which would affect adversely the climate of thetalks.During the talks we worked hard and cooperatedconstructively with Mr. Cordovez  the Secretary-General’sSpecial Adviser  with the sole aim of breaking theimpasse and moving forward to reverse the status quocreated and maintained by Turkey since 1974 by the useof force and declared unacceptable by numerous SecurityCouncil resolutions.In contrast  the response of the other side wascompletely negative. Despite our constructive attitude despite the efforts of Mr. Cordovez and those of otherinterested countries through their representatives Mr. Denktas¸ refused to hold any discussions on thesubstance of the Cyprus problem unless the EuropeanUnion froze its plans for accession talks with theGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus  which were inaccordance with the European decision of 6 March 1995.Mr. Denktas¸ even threatened that if the European Uniondecided to proceed with Cyprus’ application he would notnegotiate at all in the future. It was therefore abundantlyclear that the other side did not go to the talks with theaim of finding a solution to the problem  but in anattempt to impede Cyprus’ European Union accessionprocess.Any doubts as to the real cause of the failure of thetalks to produce results on the substantive aspects of theCyprus problem were dissolved by the unanimous verdictof the international community  pronounced last 20August by the President of the Security Council in astatement to the press after the briefing by Mr. Cordovezon the outcome of the talks in Glion. In the statement  ourpositive attitude and cooperation was commended whereas the Turkish Cypriot side was blamed forimpeding substantive progress by the attempt to bring inpreconditions to the table. The same verdict was reachedby the European Union  which also rejected any linkbetween the talks and the start of the European Union’saccession negotiations with Cyprus.It is with great regret that once again in addressingthe General Assembly I have to report that no progresshas been made towards the solution of the Cyprusproblem due to the inflexibility of the Turkish side.3The result of this deliberate inflexibility is theperpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per centof the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces the artificial forceful separation of the two communities  thecolonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers fromTurkey  the refugee problem  the usurpation of the GreekCypriot properties in the occupied area and the continuedblunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assemblyand Security Council resolutions.I fully share the disappointment of the SecurityCouncil at the absence of progress during the Glion talks despite the interest shown by the international community and more particularly by those countries that had theirrepresentatives in the wings observing the talks. The clearconclusion to be drawn  however  is that more activeinvolvement of the international community  and inparticular of those who are in the wings of the talks  isneeded if the talks are to produce results.After the end of the talks  Mr. Denktash and Ankaracontinued to maintain the same negative attitude. There wasa barrage of threatening statements against Cyprus  in directviolation of international law  and in particular of theUnited Nations resolutions on Cyprus  which  inter alia call for the respect of the sovereignty  independence territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus andthe withdrawal of all foreign troops.The Turkish side continues to threaten to annex toTurkey the territory of the Republic occupied by Turkishforces if the European Union commences accessionnegotiations with Cyprus  and to use force against theRepublic of Cyprus to prevent the implementation of theagreement to buy and instal in Cyprus the S-300 defensiveground-to-air missile system.Last year we pledged before this body ourcommitment to do everything in our power to help theSecretary-General of our Organization succeed in hisrenewed efforts in the search for a lasting solution to theCyprus problem. I believe that we have honoured ourpledge to the full. I wish to reiterate our commitment tocontinue our constructive attitude  despite ourdisappointment.However  I wish to make it abundantly clear that wecannot and we will not relinquish our inalienable right todefend our country and to decide about our armaments. Aslong as the Turkish threat emanating from the continuedaggression and occupation of 37 per cent of the territory ofthe Republic exists  we have not only the right but also theduty to provide for the security of the people of Cyprus.We will not tie our hands behind our backs and allow theTurkish air force to bomb our towns and villages at will— as it has done in the past — without the ability todefend ourselves. If it is again necessary for our forces totake the battlefield  never again will they do so withoutadequate protection from air attacks by the Turkish airforce.During the talks in Glion  in an attempt to assist thepeace process  I proposed to Mr. Denktash that bothleaders should make a declaration denouncing the use offorce as a means of solving the Cyprus problem andshould agree to work for a specific programme ofreduction of military forces and equipment and aprogramme for demilitarizing the island and limiting theimportation of arms.I believe that my proposal  if accepted by the otherside  may open the way for substantive progress towardsa comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus question andthe restoration of respect for the human rights of thepeople of Cyprus  which have been grossly violated forthe last 23 years.To my Turkish Cypriot compatriots I wish to saythis: Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will live inCyprus for centuries to come. We must live as friendsand as citizens of a bi-communal  bi-zonal federalRepublic  respecting each other’s ethnic origins  traditions culture and religion and the equal political status of ourrespective communities. We must also be citizens of theEuropean Union. This will give us greater security andprosperity  both for our respective communities and forCyprus  our country.The question of Cyprus has been on the agenda ofthe United Nations for too long. A momentum has beencreated for the solution of the Cyprus problem as a resultof the renewed efforts of the United Nations  stronglysupported by the international community. Let us not missthis opportunity. It is clear by now where the attention ofthe Security Council and the international communityshould be focused. It should use all the means in itspower to persuade the Turkish side to abandon itsintransigent position.Let me assure this body once again that myGovernment will continue to work with the Secretary-General in his efforts to find a solution based on a Stateof Cyprus with a single sovereignty and internationalpersonality and a single citizenship  with its independence4and territorial integrity safeguarded and comprising twopolitically equal communities  as described in the relevantSecurity Council resolutions  in a bi-communal and bi-zonalfederation  and that such settlement must exclude union  inwhole or in part  with any other country or any form ofpartition or secession.At this point I wish to express the gratitude of theGovernment and the people of Cyprus to all those countriesthat have been assisting and supporting the Secretary-General’s efforts.Before I conclude allow me to refer to a matter whichis of great importance to my Government. This is the issueof missing persons in Cyprus.My Government considers this issue a purelyhumanitarian one whose solution is long overdue. Allefforts should be made so that the legitimate rights of thefamilies to be informed in a convincing and conclusivemanner about the fate of their loved ones are fullyrespected by all concerned. This also includes the right toa decent burial for the missing persons who are proved tobe dead.In this spirit  I recently had two meetings in Cypruswith the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community Mr. Rauf Denktash. Certain steps were agreed in thepresence of the resident Deputy Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General that we believe will contributetowards the desired progress in the efforts to solve thishumanitarian problem.The hopes and expectations of all — especially therelatives of the missing persons — centre on theimplementation of what was agreed in a true spirit ofhumanitarian principles and practice.However  the agreement I reached with the TurkishCypriot leader  Mr. Denktash  will prove of little use if thethird member of the Committee on Missing Persons is notappointed. It also is my earnest view that the work of theCommittee on Missing Persons will be greatly assisted andexpedited if experienced investigators are appointed toassist it in its task.In conclusion  may I reassure the Assembly — andindeed the world community — of my country’s dedicationto the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as emphasize our determination to spare no effortin working  in concert with other nations  for the prevalenceof justice  peace  progress and stability in the volatileregion that is our part of the world."
"42",1796,"CZE",52,1997,"﻿At the outset  may Icongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election asPresident of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly and wish him much success in this important andresponsible function. I should also like to use thisopportunity to thank his predecessor  Ambassador RazaliIsmail  who  with his typical energetic approach contributed greatly to the success of the fifty-first session.The recently concluded fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly can certainly be described withoutexaggeration as one of the key periods in the history of theUnited Nations. The important reform proposals submittedduring its course will  if carried out  result in the mostfundamental change in the structure and activities of theUnited Nations since its foundation. We strongly believethat the Organization will emerge from the reform processreinforced and that this process will increase the importanceof the United Nations as a global forum that focuses on theserious problems facing our world today  open to all whowish and are willing to take part.We greatly appreciate the vigour and vision withwhich the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hascommitted himself to the reform efforts. We support themeasures he has already taken to make the work of theUnited Nations Secretariat more effective as well as thepackage of recommendations he submitted to the GeneralAssembly last July. Whether or not these concrete andeffective reform steps are really put into effect nowdepends on the political will of the Member States. TheCzech Republic will make every effort to be mostcooperative in this respect.We are glad that the reform efforts of the Secretary-General have met with a favourable response on the partof the Member States. His proposals have been supportedalso by the 16 Heads of State and Government associatedin the Carlsson Group  of which Czech President VáclavHavel is also a member. As this Group stated in itsdeclaration of 10 August 1997 on the Secretary-General’sreform proposals  the United Nations has a chance to takea step forward  and this chance should not be missed.As for restructuring the Security Council  the CzechRepublic prefers the expansion of both Council-membercategories while preserving the Council’s effectivenessand flexibility. We continue to support an increase in thenumber of permanent members to include Germany Japan and three other countries representing Africa  Asiaand Latin America. My country also advocates expansionof the category of non-permanent seats  including one seatfor the Group of Eastern European States.The reform of the Security Council should alsoresult in improving and simplifying the Council’s workingmethods. My country has actively participated indiscussions of this question and has submitted a proposalfor a broader interpretation of Article 31 of the UnitedNations Charter. We are pleased that our proposal hasbeen backed by a number of Member States and believeit will become part of the working methods of thereformed Security Council.It is quite unthinkable to restructure the UnitedNations without changing its present system of financing.In order to make cost-sharing more equitable it isnecessary to change the existing scale of assessments. Thenew system of contributions to the regular budget and topeacekeeping operations should reflect the real economiccapacity of individual Member States. All Member States without exception  should also duly comply with theirfinancial obligations.For my country  this year is a year of importantevents. The invitation extended at the Madrid Summit tothree Central European countries  including the CzechRepublic  to open talks on accession to the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO)  is a key and historic17decision which we regard not as a first and last step  but rather  as the beginning of the process of NATOenlargement. The Czech Republic is convinced that thealliance will in the future invite some other democraticcountries. The signing of the Founding Act on MutualRelations  Cooperation and Security between the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Russian Federationconstitutes an important step towards the strengthening ofEuropean security.The Czech Republic has noted with satisfaction thatthe effort of the European Union to further enhance theintegration process achieved concrete results at theIntergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam. Wewelcomed the European Commission’s positive assessmentof the Czech Republic as a candidate for European Unionmembership. We believe that negotiations with the CzechRepublic and other candidates for membership can start inthe early months of 1998.One of the basic prerequisites for a country’s stabilityis harmonious relations with its neighbours. This is why weattach great importance to the Czech-German declaration onmutual relations and their future development  signed inPrague in January of this year. By signing this documentthe two sides confirmed their political will to furtherintensify all-round bilateral cooperation as an expression oftheir determination to work jointly on shaping a peacefulfuture in Europe. In fact  this joint determination andpolitical will is already being transformed into concretesteps in different areas.We are very sensitive to the political problems of ourpresent world  and  within our capacities  participate in theirsolution. One of the most complicated issues is undoubtedlythe conflict in the former Yugoslavia  and particularly inBosnia and Herzegovina. We support the peace processbased on the Dayton Peace Accords and on the LondonProgramme of Action  and consider them the best possiblesolution to the protracted conflict. It is beyond dispute thatone key prerequisite for the success of the peace process isthe just punishment of all war crimes committed during theconflict.We also focus our attention on the situation in theMiddle East  the region currently being visited by PresidentHavel. The peace process is now in a difficult phase  but itsrole is irreplaceable. We hope  however  that bilateral talksbetween the State of Israel and its neighbours will lead togreater stability in the region and eventually result in justand lasting peace for all.The Czech Republic follows with much concern thesecurity and humanitarian situation in certain Africancountries  in particular in the Great Lakes region  but alsoin Somalia and Sierra Leone. We fully support the effortsof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity aimed at putting an end to unrest  wars andsuffering in Africa. Positive changes taking place inLiberia  for example  fill us with optimism. We believethat the work done by our own military observers in theoperations of the United Nations Observer Mission inLiberia has also contributed to this progress.My country wishes to continue to participate inbuilding a global security architecture. Within the UnitedNations we want to work actively  mainly in the fields ofpeacekeeping operations  arms control and disarmament.Our military observers  doctors and other medicalpersonnel participate in a number of United Nationspeacekeeping operations. A Czech Army battalion hasbeen operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina under NATOcommand within the multinational Stabilization Force  onthe basis of the Security Council mandate. It has beenperforming its tasks well  and we are pleased that itsactivities are being viewed positively.The inclusion of the Czech Republic at thebeginning of this year in the Special Committee onPeacekeeping Operations is both a sign of appreciation ofour activities in this field and a manifestation of ourcommitment to participate further in peacekeepingoperations and to improve the level of our participation.The Czech Republic has been actively participatingin the field of arms control and disarmament. As a non-nuclear-weapon State  we are naturally interested inattaining universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its strictobservance  which  we expect  will lead to the furtherreduction of nuclear proliferation and will advance thelong-term objective of nuclear disarmament. We attachgreat importance to the sessions of the preparatorycommittees  and expect that their positive suggestionscould set the tone of the Review Conference to be held inthe year 2000 towards reinforcing the Non-ProliferationTreaty.The Czech Republic has from the very beginningvoiced support for the idea of strengthening theinternational safeguards system of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency within the so-called 93 +2Programme. It was within these efforts that the CzechRepublic only a few days ago officially informed the18International Atomic Energy Agency’s secretariat of itsinterest in concluding a supplementary protocol to thesafeguards agreement between the Czech Republic and theAgency  as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty.The majority of Member States of the United Nationslast year signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty  and I am pleased to state that my country was oneof the first to ratify it.We welcome the establishment of the Organization forthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We expect it toeffectively control and carry out the verification process  inwhich we are prepared to participate fully.We are convinced that the Biological WeaponsConvention needs more effective control mechanisms. Tothis end  Czech experts are actively participating in talks onfinalizing the verification protocol  which will considerablystrengthen this Convention.In the field of conventional weapons  the CzechRepublic supports all measures contributing to greatertransparency  and has been systematically fulfilling all itsobligations concerning notification to the respectiveregisters. At this year’s Brussels Conference on anti-personnel land mines  the Czech Republic joined the so-called Ottawa process  and it is prepared to sign in Ottawaearly in December a convention on the complete ban ofsuch weapons.It has been an honour for my country to chair twoimportant United Nations bodies this year. The Economicand Social Council plays a very important role in promotinginternational cooperation in the economic and social fields.Its reform is therefore very important. The Czech Republichas always stressed the need for better coordination effectiveness and simplification of the Council’s structureand activities. We also believe that when chairing theCouncil we have helped shape its new image. We notedpromising signs of this new image already during itssubstantive session in July. One example was the high-levelsegment with participation of ministers and seniorgovernment officials  which proved the growing interest ofthe Member States in discussions on specific subjects. Aninformal political dialogue with representatives of UnitedNations funds and agencies also proved the Council’sability to serve as a platform for useful and fruitfulexchanges of views. The reform and strengthening of theEconomic and Social Council should continue. In thisrespect  we welcome all steps taken to implement resolution50/227  and above all to further simplify the structure ofthe Council’s subsidiary bodies.In its priorities  the Czech Republic pays greatattention to the protection of human rights as one of thenecessary conditions for free development of humansociety and democracy. We had the honour to chair theCommission on Human Rights in the first year of ourmembership in this important body. On the basis of thisexperience  the Czech Republic has been urging theelimination of factors negatively influencing the work ofthe Commission  and has been seeking new approachesand methods of dealing with individual cases of flagrantviolation of human rights.Next year the international community willcommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We hope thatthis event will be an occasion not merely for ceremonialassemblies and declarations  but for presenting concreteresults of work in the field of human rights.My country supports all efforts aimed at earlyestablishment of an International Criminal Court  whichwould create a new system for punishing the most seriouscrimes of human rights violations and violations ofinternational humanitarian law. The need for such aninstitution is acute  and the Czech Republic fully supportsthe convocation of a diplomatic conference in 1998 toadopt and open to signature the convention on theestablishment of the court.One of the burning scourges of our world today isthe growth of international organized crime and therelated problem of drug abuse. This global problem canbe solved effectively only through close internationalcooperation. We believe that the special session of theGeneral Assembly in 1998 will stimulate thestrengthening of this cooperation.Another threat hanging over the world isinternational terrorism. This is a threat which can beneutralized only by the tough and uncompromisingattitude of the international community and by effectiveinternational cooperation. Every country sincerelyinterested in security throughout the world must strictlyobserve and comply with commitments arising fromrelevant international instruments. The Czech Republicsupports every effort aimed at the elaboration of aninternational convention for the suppression of terroristbombings. In this respect  my country has also activelyparticipated in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee set up19to deal with this problem and believes that the currentsession of experts will make further progress in thefinalization of the draft convention so that it may beadopted and opened to signature as soon as possible.One of the most dynamically developing spheres ofinternational and global cooperation is that of environmentand sustainable development. The United Nations has beentraditionally working hard in this field. The key irreplaceable role in this field is played by the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UnitedNations Commission on Sustainable Development. It seemsthat UNEP is already on the way out of crisis  although notall the problems are solved by any means. The recentestablishment of the high-level committee is undoubtedly astep towards improvement of the governing structure ofUNEP and towards stabilization of its programme andbudget. In a short time we expect the strengthened UNEPto start a new endeavour to fulfil its mandate.The process of follow-up activities of the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development wasgiven a new and strong impulse at the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly. The results of this specialsession were not unambiguously positive. On the one hand we welcome the wide support for the promotion ofsustainable development and for efforts of Governmentsand international organizations  further strengthened bycomplementary activities of non-governmentalorganizations  national Governments  entrepreneurial circlesand other interest groups. On the other hand  however  thesession proved that not all of them are prepared to takeresolute steps towards achieving sustainable development.The tasks facing the United Nations in the next periodare numerous and difficult. However  they have beenclearly outlined and can be fulfilled. It also depends on us Member States  whether and how we will cope with them.It is the results of our joint efforts that will decide not onlythe fate of the world Organization but also of the worlditself on the threshold of the next millennium."
"43",1858,"DEU",52,1997,"﻿I congratulateyou  Mr. President  on assuming your responsible office.Major decisions are to be taken at this session and I wishyou good fortune in your conduct of the proceedings.I wish to thank Ambassador Razali for hisexceptional commitment. He has made us all aware of thegreat responsibility we carry during this phase of reform.The Secretary-General  through the impressive manner inwhich he presented his reform proposals  hasre-emphasized that responsibility.Nowhere else are we so acutely aware as at theUnited Nations General Assembly that  regardless of ourorigins or the colour of our skin  we have a commondestiny and that we all  North and South  the smallcountries and the big countries  need one another.Millions of people all over the world  especially ouryouth  ask themselves whether we politicians anddelegates from 185 nations have drawn the rightconclusions from this; whether we can summon thepolitical will for joint action to improve their security  togive them better opportunities in life  and to safeguardtheir rights  or whether we will go on wasting anddestroying the natural sources of human life at their10expense. Those of us with adult children know howsceptical their generation have become about thecapabilities of the governing class. That is good reason forall of us to stop  think and take action  and to do so hereand now.The world about which we are talking here today andthe world which we participate in shaping is not ours alone.We have to preserve it for future generations as well. Andthis we can achieve only through a united effort. For we areonly one world community that has to survive together.There is only one boat for all  our vulnerable blue planet and there is only one common future  good or bad. That isthe reality we face as we cross over into the thirdmillennium and it is the reason why policies deriving froma sense of responsibility are not utopian. Indeed  in our agethey are the only realistic approach.The world organization’s programmes and funds  thatis to say  those of the United Nation’s Children’s Fund(UNICEF)  the United Nations Development Programme the United Nations Population Fund and the World FoodProgramme  together dispense more than $4.6 billion a yearin the form of economic and social aid. That comes toabout 80 cents for every person on earth. By contrast  in1994 the world’s Governments spent about $767 billion onarms  which was roughly $134 per person. This grossdisproportion is intolerable.I believe that we must all look beyond the rim of ourown national interests. There is no more time to lose. Wecannot simply come here  make and listen to speeches andthen return to business as usual for another 12 months. Wehave a duty and responsibility to leave our children andgrandchildren a world which is worthy of humankind. Andthat means doing something about it now  today. We mustprotect the earth’s atmosphere by reducing greenhouse-gasemissions. We must ban lethal anti-personnel landmines byjoining in the Ottawa process. We cannot accept that wehave hundreds of millions of anti-personnel landmines stillin place in the ground of many  many countries in thisworld of ours.We must halt the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  and we must streamline the United NationsOrganization. But above all  we must pay our contributionson time and in full. These are the criteria which showwhether we are living up to our responsibility.The opportunity for effective action is there. Despitecarping criticism  international cooperation within theUnited Nations framework is working. Malnutrition andundernourishment have been reduced by a third since1960 and illiteracy by 50 per cent. Most of the credit forthis  no doubt  goes to the United Nations. Infantmortality has been halved in the same period — a greatachievement by UNICEF.Between 1990 and 1995 the world populationincreased by 1.48 per cent  considerably less than the 1.72per cent growth between 1985 and 1990. This nourishesthe hope that we have got over the hump of thepopulation explosion. Again  this is a big achievementlargely attributable to the work of the United NationsPopulation Fund.Much  I am pleased to note  has also been done toimprove the situation of women. This is importantbecause with all the tremendous social challenges weface  the success of our efforts depends heavily on them.They are the natural advocates of future generations. Thatis why one of our main objectives still is to ensure theyhave equal rights  not only on paper but also in practice.The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna the Earth Summit in Rio  the International Conference onPopulation and Development in Cairo  the Summit forSocial Development in Copenhagen and the WorldConference on Women in Beijing have demonstrated thatthe strategies for creating a better and more equitableworld are in place. What is missing is the political will toput them into effect. We must learn to give commoninterests priority over national interests.We must start to think not only of the present but ofthe future as well. The first step — and I think it cannotbe underlined enough — is to reform and strengthen theOrganization which embodies all these objectives: theUnited Nations  our United Nations.There has been enough talk. Time is running out. Atthis fifty-second session  the General Assembly mustmake decisions. The backlog of reforms must be dealtwith during this session.True  Governments and politicians don’t possess amagic wand with which to put the world in order. And Ireadily admit  as a politician  that it is disappointing todiscover how relatively little we ourselves can change even in high positions  and I take it that it is the samewith the others present here. But that does not absolve usfrom the responsibility to do everything in our power tobring about necessary change and progress.11There is more than enough to be done. The world isstill profoundly unjust. From the moment of their birth millions of people have hardly any chance of leading a lifein conditions worthy of the human race. According toUNICEF  more than 20 million children all over the worldare on the move. About 300 000 children were killed in theRwanda massacres. As a result of the 17-year-old war inAfghanistan  another 280 000 or so have died fromundernourishment and disease. The civil war in Cambodiahas made some 350 000 children orphans. Every 90 minutesa child is maimed by a landmine.Yet it is on our children  the weakest members of anysociety  be it in the North or the South of our planet  thatthe world’s future and hopes depend. They are the weakestmembers of any society. They are little people who needbig rights. How much worse off would they be if therewere no United Nations? What would become of theworld’s conscience? Who would demand consideration forand solidarity with such children if we allowed thisOrganization to decline?At this moment about 25 000 soldiers  civilians andmembers of non-governmental organizations are serving thecause of peace around the globe. All of them deserve ourthanks and appreciation.A week ago today five Germans  including the Deputyof the High Representative  Ambassador Gerd Wagner  fiveAmericans  a Briton and a Pole lost their lives in a tragicaccident. We mourn their loss and share the grief of theirfamilies. Their deaths are an admonition to redouble ourefforts for peace. They wanted to help people in need andin doing so brought a ray of hope to Bosnia and to thepeople working on the ground. That hope must not beextinguished.Last Saturday I attended the memorial service inSarajevo. I have visited the region more than once  and theinner conflict among the people was again obvious. Asbefore  the main obstacles to lasting peace in the region arehatred and fear among the various ethnic groups. On theother hand  most Bosnians  in spite of the terrible events ofrecent years  realize there is no future for them and theirchildren if the hatred and fear are not overcome  despite allthe terrible things that have been done  despite the rapesand the “ethnic cleansing”.That is why I am speaking out here today — to appealto all political leaders in Bosnia to change their attitude andto mount a reconciliation campaign. The internationalcommunity has provided assistance  making millions ofdollars available. We have done a lot. We are verycommitted on the ground  and we want to see the resultsof what we have done. We believe that those who live insecurity and peace have an obligation to help others.So far more than 300 troops have sacrificed theirlives for the cause of peace in Bosnia. My countryalone — Germany — has spent more than 17 billionmarks on the peace process and on the more than 350 000asylum-seekers in Germany coming from Kosovo. That isa lot of money  and those on whom we spend it will haveto react in some way and have to give us a clear sign oftheir willingness to implement the agreements.But outside help  including military support  cannotbe provided indefinitely. And on no account — I want tobe unequivocal about this — will it be given to those whothwart peace and reconciliation. Attempts to underminepeace  to incite the people and to torpedo theimplementation of the Dayton Agreement  especially inRepublika Srpska — must stop.I appeal to all political factions in the region to usewhat time remains to launch a new and serious attempt tosettle their differences and to see to it that Karadzic andother alleged war criminals and enemies of peace arebrought before the Hague Tribunal. These people mustnot be allowed to sleep peacefully. But this demand mustbe made by the international community  not justGermany: these people must not be allowed to sleeppeacefully.We Europeans have done quite a lot this year toimprove the situation on our continent in order to securea peaceful future for coming generations. Nations thatbelong together are now growing together  and that in aregion that for centuries was divided and at war withitself. The European Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization are gradually opening up to Europe’s newdemocracies  while Russia and Ukraine are forming anew  close partnership with both organizations.And let the world be prepared. In 1999 weEuropeans  right on schedule and in conformity withbinding stability criteria  will introduce the Euro  thecommon European currency. The enlargement of theEuropean Union and the introduction of the Euro arehistoric steps to safeguard the future for cominggenerations  steps that hardly anyone would have thoughtpossible only 10 years ago. And mark my words: therewill be no going back in Europe.12At the same time  we are aware that Europeconstitutes only a small section of the much larger globalconstruction site. Everywhere the harbingers of the new eraare knocking on the door. Nothing is like it used to be  yetthe hopes and wishes of citizens everywhere have remainedthe same. They want peace and work. They want a roofover their heads  protection from crime  and schools fortheir children.Thus the aims and ideals enshrined in the Charter arejust as valid as they were in 1945: peace  sustainableeconomic and social development  protection of humanrights and democracy. These aims form a whole  and thereis no order of preference.Eighty per cent of United Nations activities focus onworld poverty  and rightly so  because this is the bigproblem that has remained unsolved since the ending of theEast-West confrontation. Nearly a quarter of the world’spopulation — 1.3 billion people — live in poverty  while840 million suffer from chronic undernourishment. In theAgenda for Development we have adopted the right coursefor the fight against poverty: good governance  marketeconomy  the rule of law  security for the citizen  regionalcooperation and international integration.Following the lead of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations countries (ASEAN)  the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and the now-expandingSouthern African Development Community (SADC)  thenations of Central America too are forming closer ties. It isbecoming more and more apparent that this is the path ofprogress. The worldwide trend towards closer multilateralcooperation is increasing  and will lead to progress  securityand prosperity; it is the path of the future. One the onehand  the Information Age with undreamed-of possibilities and  on the other  exclusive communities and citizenswithout rights — this does not add up.Yes  globalization is a great leveller. Basically  itconfronts industrial and developing countries alike with thesame question: are we going to accept the challenge ofbeing part of a “single world market”  or are we going tomark time? A good number of newly industrialized anddeveloping countries have chosen the way forward  and ithas proved to be the right one. They have received the bulkof global direct investment  which in 1996 increased by 8per cent to almost $350 billion. Nor have the others beenforgotten. Within the framework of the G-8 process  thenew global partnership for development was established ontheir behalf. A beginning was made at the Denver summitin June  focusing particularly on the sub-Saharan nationsof Africa.Since 1978 Germany has cancelled debts incurred bythe least developed countries and other land-lockeddeveloping countries in Africa amounting to more than 9billion marks. These countries will continue to be thefocal point of our development cooperation. Between1991 and 1995 Germany made available 16.3 billionmarks for Africa’s sub-Saharan nations  and we are proudof that.I am glad that the Security Council is holding aspecial meeting tomorrow on the situation in Africa.Many positive developments have taken place there inrecent years  a fact that is often overlooked.But light and shadow are still very close together. Ineed only mention Congo Brazzaville  Sierra Leone Somalia and especially the Great Lakes region. Mycountry  the Federal Republic of Germany  has played ahumanitarian and political role in all these conflicts  andwe recognize that the African States themselves — in theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and in thesubregional organizations — are making significantefforts to settle these conflicts. We must keep onsupporting them.But Africa’s real problems lie deeper  in the socialand economic sphere  and in the lack of cohesion amongthe different population groups. In my view  Europe’svast and important neighbouring continent  which has apopulation of about 800 million covers about 23 per centof the world’s land surface  has little chance of achievingstability and economic progress unless it follows the pathof regional cooperation. Such cooperation brings stabilitywhere nations are too weak to achieve it individually.Southern Africa is a good example. At the 1994Berlin conference  cooperation between the SADC and theEuropean Union was raised to a new level. At ourmeeting in June we and our African colleagues redefinedthe framework for the dialogue between the EuropeanUnion and the OAU. Europe will stay on Africa’s side.Part of this support is that we are helping countrieslike Angola and Mozambique to rid themselves of thescourge of mines. So far mine clearance by hand hasbeen  at least to me  like trying to remove a sand-dunewith a thimble. We cannot accept that. What we need forthis task is safe  large-capacity machinery.13The Oslo Conference gave rise to a sign of hope.Eighty countries have put their names to a comprehensiveand verifiable ban on anti-personnel mines. I wish to thankthe Secretary-General for his personal efforts on this issue.Anyone who  like me  has seen the poor  crippled victimsin Cambodia  Mozambique or Bosnia knows that thesetreacherous killing devices are wholly — I repeat wholly — immoral. I therefore appeal to all countries stillon the outside to join the Ottawa process and help us banthese infernal devices from the face of the Earth.The world  galvanized by the spirit of freedom  hasbeen totally transformed. But this new freedom and its by-products constitute a major test for us all  not only asregards competitiveness but also as regards our solidarity our ability to show tolerance and to work together  and theopening of markets.The East-West conflict has been consigned to the past.Here too  the question now is: are we going to try andsafeguard the future for posterity  or are we going to allownew enemy stereotypes to divide us once again? There mustbe no clash of civilizations. Hence  the dialogue ofcivilizations and world religions must be raised to a newlevel. To me this is the spiritual challenge as we approachthe twenty-first century  for only thus can we bringdifferent standpoints closer together and mobilize theenergies needed for the joint resolution of humanity’scolossal problems.I suggest that we hold a forum here at the UnitedNations to consider how we can generate new momentumfor this dialogue worldwide. The matter is importantenough. Considerable cultural energy and potential forinnovation lie unused  and the United Nations is the propercatalyst for their development.But we must be very clear that there cannot andshould not be dialogue with terrorists. Terrorism has againraised its ugly head in Mostar  Jerusalem and Cairo. Thevileness of the latest carnage in Algeria would be difficultto exceed: it really does take your breath away. How longcan the international community look away? I know howdifficult it is to help from the outside  but the worldcommunity cannot accept the cruel killing of utterlyinnocent people in the dark of night without standing upand reacting. We are not powerless in the face of such evilslaughter of mostly uninvolved persons. In Denver  theGroup of Eight called upon all nations to sign theinternational conventions on terrorism. We must resolutelycombat terrorism all over the world  using all democraticmeans at our disposal. I call upon the General Assembly tocomplete by the end of this session the negotiations on aconvention against terrorist bomb attacks  as proposed bythe Group of Eight.Extradition or suitable punishment remains theprinciple underlying our efforts to combat terrorism. Noone should give refuge to terrorists. We need a unitedglobal front against terrorism. To combat fanatical killerswe can only consistently apply the law as well as policeand judicial measures. The source of sympathy forterrorist objectives must be withered by political means.In other words  we must get to the roots  which in mostcases are social problems.On my last visit to the Middle East I spoke withmany citizens in Jerusalem  Bethlehem and Hebron  andin the refugee camps in Gaza. I sensed their fears andconcerns. Those who have seen the wretched conditionsin the camps know that these people must be given achance to improve their lives. They need to be able tohope again that the peace process is something fromwhich they will benefit  that the violence will stop  thatthey can find work and have enough to eat  and that theirchildren can go to school.For these hopes to materialize  both sides must showa large measure of good will. President Arafat must doeverything in his power to stop the terrorism. And theIsraeli Government must desist from any measures whichcause the Palestinians to doubt Israel’s commitment topeace. The settlements issue remains the crucial test here;at least  that is what I believe. Continuing to build in HarHoma only makes matters worse  so a moratorium isessential. To my mind  this is the only way to reopen thedoor to peace talks.As for Iran  the new Government has changed itstone. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to anew  constructive policy  especially with regard to theMiddle East peace process  human rights and internationallaw. Germany has always maintained close and friendlyrelations with the Iranian people  and in spite of all thathas happened  in spite of the Mykonos affair  we areready for talks. It is up to the Iranian Government toprovide the basis on which these can take place.We are pleased that Mrs. Robinson has taken up herpost as the new High Commissioner for Human Rights.Nowhere is the need for a new culture of dialogue sogreat  we believe  as in the process of protecting suchrights. This is crucial to world peace and globaldevelopment. Any society that fails to respect human14rights  which include the right of development  is blockingits own progress. Our policy on this matter is based ondialogue and respect for different cultures. But we alsoagree with Pope John Paul II  who has said that if we wantpeace we must respect the conscience of the people. Nocivilization or religion denies people their rights orapproves of murder and torture. Nor can any such action bejustified on political grounds.We need an international criminal court of justice. Thestatute of such a court is to be drawn up in Rome nextsummer. The court must be empowered to act of its ownaccord where genocide  crimes against humanity  warcrimes and wars of aggression are concerned  and to do sowherever national courts either do not exist or cannot or areunwilling to prosecute such crimes. The terrible genocidesin Rwanda and Srbrenica are warning signs. Such cardinalcrimes should not go unpunished.Our responsibility towards future generations isparticularly acute where protection of the natural sources oflife is concerned. That is why it is crucial to maintain thespirit engendered by the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  the Rio Summit. That is thepurpose of the environment initiative put forward byChancellor Kohl together with Brazil  South Africa andSingapore.The climate conference to be held in Kyoto inDecember will be a major test of the industrial world’scommitment to the environment. Germany intends to reduceits greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 per cent by the year2010  based on 1990 levels. We and our partners in theEuropean Union are asking the other industrial countries tocut theirs by at least 15 per cent. That would go part of theway towards meeting our responsibility towards posterity.When we look at the air pollution in southern Asia we cannot fail to admit that we urgently need to agree ona forest convention. We must put an end to the ruthlessburning of forests to clear vast areas of land. Those whodeplete and destroy their own natural resources will makeus all lose out in the end. The eleventh hour is approaching.Two weeks from now the decision on where to locatethe secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertificationwill be taken in Rome. We ask members to vote for Bonn.Since the secretariat of the Framework Convention onClimate Change already has its headquarters there  it makessense to combine the two.The General Assembly is at a crossroads. Either wesolve our reform problems now and come out of ourintrospective shell  or the United Nations will losepolitical standing — that is what would happen. Allregional organizations  industrial  developing andnon-aligned countries have a joint responsibility forimplementing the reforms we have been talking about forso long. This applies to all areas of United Nationsactivity: economic and social  Security Council andfinance.The Secretary-General has submitted a bold packageof reforms. Even though we do not agree with everydetail  we support the package as a whole. I appeal to allMember States: let us not talk it to shreds  but makequick decisions so that the necessary measures can be putinto effect. The United Nations has to be streamlined inorder to increase its efficiency. Whatever savings aremade through reform should be used for developments-assistance purposes.The Security Council must reflect today’s politicalrealities  one of which is the greater status of Africa Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean. The debate onthis matter should not be artificially prolonged. This themost important body of the United Nations  and it cannotcredibly and effectively perform its role as the guardianof peace in the twenty-first century if its compositionremains basically as it was in 1945.It is gratifying to note that a large number of Statesregard the reunited Germany as a suitable candidate for apermanent seat on the Security Council. If elected  wewill be able to make a good contribution  one that is inkeeping with the spirit of the Charter.Two years ago  on the Organization’s fiftiethbirthday  we solemnly pledged to hand on to the nextmillennium a United Nations equipped and funded for itstask. That promise has to be kept  and it has to be kept byall. This means  first and foremost  paying ourcontributions in full and on time  because withoutfinances this Organization is a powerless one. TheEuropean Union has submitted its proposal for changingthe scale of assessments  the purpose of which is toensure a fair distribution of burdens.Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights reads “All human beings are born free andequal in dignity and rights. They are endowed15with reason and conscience and should acttowards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”This vision must be sustained: the vision of a world inwhich it is not the law of the strongest  but the strength ofthe law which prevails; a world in which both the strongand the weak feel at home; a world fit to live in which wecan safely leave to our children and to our grandchildren."
"44",1896,"DJI",52,1997,"﻿I wish to extend to thePresident the warm congratulations of my delegation on hiselection to preside over the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly. We are on the verge of what may be adefining moment in the direction and capabilities of theOrganization. His vast diplomatic experience assures us thatat this moment the reins will indeed be in very capablehands.We must also deeply thank his predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for the high levelof relevance  focus and commitment achieved at the fifty-first session under his bold and astute stewardship asPresident. His forthright appraisals of the critical issuesfacing the Organization  particularly the extraordinaryimpetus he injected into the question of the reform of theUnited Nations  will be felt well into the next millennium.We are also very pleased to offer our sincerecongratulations to the new Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan. In less than a year since assuming that highresponsibility he has already brought his considerableexperience and vision to bear on the operations of theUnited Nations. Throughout his long and faithful servicewith the United Nations he has demonstrated a keenawareness of the need for a strong and responsiveOrganization. His all-encompassing reform proposals go along way towards realizing a dream that has often eludedus in the past. We are confident he will persevere in hisonerous task of keeping the Organization afloat.The report of the Secretary-General on the work of theOrganization is an excellent starting point for an overviewof the principal issues confronting mankind today. On theone hand  there are widespread ripple effects emanatingfrom the end of the cold war  the advent of a single globalmarket and the trend towards democratization and respectfor human rights. On the other hand  there are the ominoustrends towards the fragmentation of societies  the search fornew identities and the consequent spread of civil strife andconflict. Today  therefore  the need to deal with post-conflict situations is as critical as the need to prevent them.There is now universal recognition that much of thisconflict is the result of the widespread poverty and severeunderdevelopment facing many societies.For an economy to overcome poverty andunderdevelopment it must today participate in the globaleconomy  which has become a driving force in the world.The 1997 World Economic and Social Survey suggeststhat all developing countries and countries witheconomies in transition need to raise per capita income byat least 3 per cent annually. To achieve that  however  theSurvey contends  and the Secretary-General agrees  theless affluent countries  in particular  require a moreconducive external economic environment than now existsfor them.The elements that until quite recently served todefine our world have dramatically and rapidly changed.The predominant concerns of global atomic warfare andthe cold war and the destructive policies of colonialismand apartheid have quickly given way to the challenges ofpoverty  globalism and development. This has created anunprecedented demand for the services of the UnitedNations at a time when it is facing critical challenges ina world of revolutionary change.To remain relevant  the United Nations must carryout fundamental structural adjustments or changes  whichcan no longer be addressed through ad hoc  piecemealreforms. A coordinated  top-down  comprehensive reformof the entire edifice is necessary to overhaul andstreamline the Secretariat; create a new organizationalculture and focus; consolidate functions; do away withoverlapping programmes and duplications; eliminatefinancial waste; mobilize new resources for development;and strengthen and enhance coordination of UnitedNations operations at the field level. The savings derivedfrom such rationalizations  trimming of inefficiencies andadministrative costs could be directed to development foreconomic and social activities. These  it seems  areprecisely the aims of the Secretary-General’s extensiveand far-reaching proposals  issued under the title“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme forReform”. They are a serious and bold set of proposalsthat deserve our utmost consideration. Djibouti fullysupports the proposals and endorses their implementationas a package.The General Assembly at this session hasdemonstrated overwhelming support for the Secretary-General’s reform proposals  particularly in their design asan integrated package. They should be considered as suchby this plenary. It would be helpful to look at theproposals as the United Nations equivalent of the WorldBank’s new Strategic Compact. Each initiative is intendedto take its respective organization into the nextmillennium by bringing about a fundamental renewal ofthe institution.15We know that every element of the Secretary-General’s package may not generate agreement across theboard. Divergences of views are bound to occur and are tobe expected. Indeed  genuine fears  even scepticism  havebeen voiced against a reform process that may translatesimply into a cost-cutting exercise  which ultimately maymean less focus on underdevelopment  poverty and socialdislocations. These are valid concerns which I am sure theSecretary-General is conscious of and must address. But forthe sake of the larger purpose at stake  let us refrain fromminuscule nit-picking. We need  rather  to adopt apragmatic and positive approach to the package. In thisway  we can spare ourselves from long and protracted  ifnot interminable  discussions which  as we know fromexperience  too often end in committee gridlock  a type ofparalysis by analysis.Bowing to the realities of the Organization’s direfinancial predicament  the Secretary-General hasaccordingly fashioned a credible reorganization that willenhance efficiency and responsiveness and effectivelycontribute to a strengthened Untied Nations  capable offulfilling its mission.There appears to be a near universal consensus on theneed to reform the United Nations. Regrettably though much of the impetus is dictated by the Organization’s acutefinancial situation. Were all Member States to honour theirtreaty commitments to pay their assessment obligations infull  on time and without condition  reform would focusmore on what the United Nations can and must do than onwhat it cannot and is unable to do. An effective UnitedNations cannot operate on subsistence  hand-to-mouth andever dwindling resources that perpetually keep it on thebrink of bankruptcy.Ultimately  the financial solvency of the UnitedNations is the responsibility of Member States. Soundfinances are the sine qua non of the effectiveness andstability of the Organization. Without a continuous andpredictable flow of resources  the danger posed to theindependence  if not survival  of the United Nations is veryreal.The issue of Security Council reform need not belinked to the reform proposal presented by the Secretary-General. The latter must run its own course and  acted uponindependently  culminate in a resolution for its adoption.In step with the growth in membership of theOrganization  the Council must be enlarged to reflect thepressing need for equitable representation. In view of theconsiderable debate this issue has generated over theyears  we believe that the time has come for a change inthe Security Council  particularly with the admission ofnew permanent members from all the regions of the worldand from the industrialized countries  wielding the samepowers as the existing ones. As we all know  a cardinaltenet of the thesis of good governance is that all membersof a body politic have a fair and equal role in decisionswhich affect them. Djibouti fully endorses the position ofthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement regarding the expansion  compositionand working methods of the Council.Except as a metaphor for international peacekeepingfailure  Somalia has exited the international radar screenof concern. This is regrettable  for there have beenpersistent regional and international efforts to initiatedialogue among the parties. True  much of Somaliacontinues to exist in a cycle of misery and politicalimpasse  lacking a central authority  internal security andnational cohesion. The spread of conventional weaponshas engendered insecurity and political uncertainty — alooming threat even to the warlords and to the long-rangeprospects for peace in the country and the region.Perhaps  as is often the case  there may be foreignelements that are developing profitable interests under thepresent state of anarchy.There is  however  a growing and encouragingemergence of a movement to reconstitute some form ofnational structure and to set aside differences. We cannotignore this glimmer of hope  however elusive. With oneor two notable exceptions  the factions seem to haveresolved to hold a conference this November in Somalia in the town of Bossaso. The aim is to establish an interimauthority whose main task will be to prepare thegroundwork for drafting a constitution  holding electionsand the emergence  hopefully  of a national Government.This subregional effort  spearheaded by Ethiopia  not onlyenjoys the wide support of many Governments andorganizations  but is perhaps the most promising initiativeat the moment.The interminable stalling of progress towardsreconciliation  the stifling stalemate  must come to an end.The time has come to say to our Somali sisters andbrothers  “Enough is enough!” Enough misery  mayhem bloodshed and destruction. Enough of the senselessindifference to and reckless disregard for life  propertyand nationhood. Enough of the grim prospects of anuncertain future for a whole generation of Somalis.Enough of assigning Somalia to the footnotes of history.16In the final analysis  the creativity  vision and determinationof the Somali people shall prevail. For all its anarchy anddestruction  Somalia can benefit from the example ofLiberia  which  like Somalia  was a country written off  acountry in name only  just a few months ago. There aswell  conflict between warlords and factions succeeded onlyin bringing the country to its knees. Now  throughconcerted dialogue and determination  and constantprodding by the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations  elections havebeen held and stability and peace reestablished  and thereis a legitimate Government which enjoys internationalrecognition. The same could be true for Somalia.The countries of the region  the United Nations nations with a historic relationship with Somalia and theinternational community at large must support  morally aswell as materially  the ongoing efforts to bring aboutdialogue  reconciliation  lasting peace and harmony inSomalia. As in Liberia  that may be the gist of the messageSomalia is sending the international community at thiscritical juncture. We must respond  and respond united with one voice.By virtue of the close proximity and the manycommon factors that bind us together  Djibouti has a specialinterest in the destiny and well-being of the Somali people.That is why  as far back as 1991  at the advent of theconflict  we took the lead in bringing the contending partiestogether in two successive and substantive reconciliationconferences in Djibouti. Since then we have remainedseized of the situation there. It is well known that Djiboutihas received a staggering flow of refugees from Somalia which  in relation to our size and resources  has beenoverwhelming. This mammoth humanitarian undertaking onour part is indeed beyond our capacity to sustainindefinitely. We appeal to the international community tocontinue to be supportive of our sacrifices by contributingsubstantially towards the mitigation of this burden.The Horn of Africa region is passing through a periodof relative stability and rejuvenation. The aftermaths ofprevious conflicts are still visible  of course  in the extentof physical  institutional and human destruction.Reconstruction will require genuine regional cooperation.Our peoples  our land  our waters and coastlines and oureconomies are too interdependent to survive in isolation.That is the spirit which must prevail.We have an important regional institution in theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) which serves as a regional focus for developmentcooperation and conflict resolution. Its capability andresources deserve the continued support of theinternational community.Djibouti continues its economic transformation institutional reform and demobilization process. For eachof these we continue to require generous internationalassistance  and towards this end wish to express ourappreciation for the commitments pledged during theround-table conference held in May this year under theumbrella of the United Nations Development Programmeand the Bretton Woods institutions.The legacy of past instability  widespread conflictand State collapse in the Horn of Africa have had manydisruptive consequences for Djibouti. No doubt wesuffered in tandem with our neighbours. But we areconfident our efforts to deal with these difficulties will besupported by the international community.The Mid-Term Review of the Implementation of theUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s and the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development Least Developed Countries 1997report indicate that the ominous slide suffered by manyleast developed countries during the 1980s was reversedin 1995  and improvements continued into 1996. Despitedeclines in commodity prices and terms of trade  anumber of least developed countries have enjoyed positivegrowth rates  indicating the beneficial effects of ongoingstructural adjustment efforts. These encouraging signscomplemented efforts towards democratization  goodgovernance and regional economic cooperation.Nowadays it is commonly accepted that as morepeoples and countries participate in the global economy production and wealth increase for everyone. It is equallytrue  however  that in this era of rapid globalization manydeveloping countries with small markets  poorinfrastructures  unskilled manpower and high levels ofexternal debt are excluded from the benefits ofglobalization and are unable to cope with the challenges.Most of the least developed countries — and 33 of theworld’s 48 are in Africa — face the risk of furthermarginalization despite determined efforts towardsreforms which must merit greater international support.Coupled with this is the falling of officialdevelopment assistance  which Norway’s Minister forDevelopment Cooperation described as unacceptable since the poorest countries need to finance basic social17services and infrastructure as well as capacity-building andcompetence.The least developed countries  particularly those inAfrica  tread a fine line between sustainable progress anddecline. They are expected to carry out extensive reformswhile concurrently addressing the social needs broughtabout by widespread poverty  environmental degradationand urban explosions. Africa also continues to attractnegligible foreign direct investment flows  which are largelyconcentrated in a few countries.The internal conflicts raging in a number of Africancountries seriously further undermine an already fragileregional stability. African leaders and organizations such asthe Organization of African Unity  the EconomicCommunity of West African States  IGAD and the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  together withthe international community  are engaged in active andrelentless efforts to bring about cessation of hostilities reconciliations and the re-establishment of law and order.On the positive side  we congratulate Liberia forhaving finally overcome the prolonged and sustainedbloodshed and self-destruction. We deplore however growing signs of a resurgence of hostilities in Angola  andwe condemn the overthrow of Sierra Leone’s constitutionaland legitimate Government. We hope the efforts of thecountries of the region through ECOWAS will be crownedwith success.Likewise  we applaud the tenacity of President OmarBongo of Gabon and Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun  theUnited Nations/Organization of African Unity SpecialRepresentative  in the effort to secure a durable ceasefire inBrazzaville and to find a political solution in the face ofopen and undisguised challenges to the authority of theelected President.Similar challenges have either succeeded or stalematedin Burundi  the Central African Republic and  now Comoros. We hope reason will eventually prevail in allthese situations so that the people are spared further strifeand uncertainty.In this context  I welcome the timely initiative bySecretary of State Madeleine Albright  to convene a specialministerial meeting of the United Nations Security Councilon Africa  which took place on 25 September 1997. Webelieve such bold initiatives will help mitigate the ominoustendencies of increasing insularity and inward focus ofmany developed countries  where events in far-off placesno longer seem so relevant to core interests within them.We welcome Secretary of State Albright’s injectionof new momentum into the peace process between Israeland the Palestinians. Unilateral decisions by Israel muststop  and Israel must also refrain from actions whichcontinuously disrupt and divert the direction of the talks.Contrary to what Israel wants us to believe  the peaceprocess has not been faltering on account of the suicidebombings alone — which  unfortunately  took manylives — but because of Israel’s refusal to implementterms of the Interim Agreement.No one  of course  condones the bombings  withtheir gruesome human toll. They are acts which must becondemned and only underscore the urgency of resumingthe peace process with a genuine determination. Thepunishment meted out on Palestinian territories has onlyfurther aggravated an explosive situation. Predictably  theeconomic effects have been devastating. Ironically  Oslohad convinced a majority of Palestinians that it might bepossible to coexist with Israel in peace under anindependent Palestinian State controlling its own destiny.Yet now they are little more than security hostages underrelentless coercion and pressures.The basic situation in Palestine has not changed.Israel needs security and peace; Palestinians need land  aswell as peace and security. Neither can unilaterally dictateterms to the other side. Escalating punishment will notbring security. Israel needs to demonstrate its seriousnessand its willingness to move towards secure peace in theMiddle East and towards credible negotiations and lastingsettlement on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973)  and 425 (1978)  exchanging land for peace.For the overwhelming majority of humanity thedisillusioning regression in the peace process has causeddeep anguish. It would be a pity if the yearning for peace security  justice and resolution continues to be eschewedand misdirected. We are quite hopeful Secretary Albrightwill persevere to keep the process on track.Once again we implore Iran and the United ArabEmirates to commence serious negotiations to peacefullyresolve the dispute regarding the three islands occupiedby Iran.The recently concluded Oslo Diplomatic Conferenceseeking a worldwide ban on the production  distribution stockpiling and use of landmines was clearly a watershed18event. We welcome this landmark achievement  which nowprovides us with a vehicle to stop the slaughter of so manythousands of human beings each year by the 110 milliondevices already in place all over the world.To prevent our global village from becoming an armedcamp  the landmine Convention  to be signed in Ottawa thisDecember  is perhaps as critical as the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the ChemicalWeapons Convention. Landmines are surely as dangerousas terrorism  drug trafficking and international mobs."
"45",1917,"DMA",52,1997,"﻿I recall two years ago  when on the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversaryof the founding of the United Nations  this podium was thefocus of attention. There was much enthusiasm and hope asleaders looked back on the past 50 years and lookedforward to the next 50 and the coming of the newmillennium. I had the honour to be among world leaderswho shared the privilege of participating in that historicoccasion. It was then that we as leaders made a number ofpledges and committed ourselves to effecting necessary andappropriate changes to reshape and reform the UnitedNations. We pledged never to repeat the mistakes of thepast and to work for a better world through an improvedand more dynamic United Nations.I take this opportunity to congratulate you Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of thefifty-second session and to thank Ambassador Razali Ismailfor his work in guiding the fifty-first session. It is withprofound pleasure and a sincere sense of hope andexpectation that I welcome and congratulate our newSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. I assure him that hehas the full confidence and support of the Commonwealthof Dominica in his endeavours.Notwithstanding the leadership changes  if we are toachieve our ultimate goal of a better world for all  muchmore must happen. The reform of the United Nations which has been the subject of such intense debate for solong now  must become a reality. We have noted andtaken seriously your commitment  Mr. President  toencourage action-oriented discussions on measures andproposals that encompass the reform of the UnitedNations system. It is our wish that the discussion  as vitala part of the process as it is  will be as short-lived aspossible and that the implementation of reforms which weall want to see will very soon be effected.The people of this world are demanding reform. TheOrganization itself needs the reform. Let us do it now.The numbers  geographic representation and decision-making process of the principal organs of the UnitedNations must urgently reflect the realities of the newmillennium.Membership in the United Nations is based on thesovereign equality of its Members. Whether we are smallor whether we are big  we are worthy of respect. And weall have an obligation to work towards maintaininginternational peace and security; achieving internationalcooperation in solving economic  social  cultural orhumanitarian problems; and encouraging respect forhuman rights and for fundamental freedoms.We do not expect to be in an Organization where therule is the law of the jungle; that is  the survival of thefittest. Rules and regulations of any organization whichcan be interpreted and implemented in a manner whichthreatens the survival and the very existence of itsmembers are undesirable.Most of us are members of the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  and I wish to bring it to theattention of the General Assembly and of allrepresentatives that recent decisions taken in the WTO atthe request of some Members of this very United Nationsare threatening to destroy the livelihood of smallernations. The Commonwealth of Dominica  my country and other countries of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) are threatened by this action. Our mainmeans of livelihood — bananas — has been placed on theshakiest of grounds by this decision. Such uncertaintybrings about instability and can threaten peace.While the General Assembly has no enforcementauthority  its resolutions and recommendations to MemberStates carry the political and moral force of majorityapproval. I appeal then to Member States to use whateveris in their power to persuade the complainants against the5European banana marketing regime to consider theconsequences of their action and to think again.Cliches like “desperate times call for desperatemeasures” and “a hungry man is an angry man” may soundbanal  but they cannot be ignored. Peace in our region andpeace in the world depend much on the humanitariandispensation of justice. The action which has been takenagainst us in the WTO is not justice.The raison d’être for the establishment of the UnitedNations was to maintain peace and security. You Mr. President  in your address to this body recognized thatpeace and security are threatened by international terrorism.May I draw to your attention that peace and security canalso be threatened by economic terrorism. Our region isnow threatened by economic terrorism  and ourOrganization — the United Nations — has a responsibilityand a duty to ensure that no form of terrorism succeeds inundermining our peace and security.This matter is so serious that I urge the Secretary-General to pay a visit to the now tranquil and peacefulCaribbean region  starting in the Windward Islands  to geta sense of the situation for himself. For there is a flameignited in that area which has the potential to transformitself into a conflagration of a magnitude capable ofengulfing the entire hemisphere.In May of this year in Bridgetown  Barbados CARICOM and the United States entered into a Partnershipfor Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean. Our ability tomeet our obligations for implementation of the Plan ofAction will be seriously compromised by this decision ofthe WTO which seeks to deny us the opportunity to earnour living.Our Caribbean region is often described as paradise but sometimes there can be trouble in paradise. Our regionis prone to natural disasters. Hurricanes  earthquakes andfloods are not uncommon  and the world knows of the slowdestruction of the island of Montserrat by the volcaniceruptions which have been going on now for over twoyears. Member States of CARICOM have come to the helpof this small territory  however there continues to be a greatneed for humanitarian assistance  and we look to theMembers of the United Nations for their meaningfulcontribution to rebuilding the Emerald Isle.Man-made threats also plague our region  one suchbeing the trans-shipment of hazardous waste through theCaribbean Sea. The indiscriminate pollution of the sea  thedestruction of marine life by the discharge of waste intothe waterway by ocean liners  and the trans-shipment ofillegal drugs and arms all pose serious threats to theorderly development of the region. There is a need toestablish a regime under the auspices of the UnitedNations to stem such practices.We cannot help but lament that after 50 years andmore our world has not yet found that peace for whichthis body was instituted. In the past years we have seenthe struggles in the former Yugoslavia and in CentralAfrica. We have witnessed the scourge of ethniccleansing and killings. And the Middle East remainsunsettled. Unrest in any part of the world affects us all.It is therefore our responsibility to work towards that totalpeace.We congratulate the 100 nations which have signedthe Treaty banning the production and dissemination oflandmines. Such weapons of destruction do not deserve toexist in a civilized world. We trust that nations which arestill hesitating will soon come around and sign — andeventually ratify — the Treaty.For there to be peace we must acknowledge the rightof peoples and nations to exist  regardless of colour  class race  creed  political belief or model of government. Thisdecade was declared the International Decade of theWorld’s Indigenous People. We are happy to report thatin the Commonwealth of Dominica the first peoples ofthe Caribbean  the Caribs  coexist peacefully with the restof the population. It is our intention to work diligentlywith the Secretary-General so that before this decade isover there will be some tangible and positive impact onthe lives of our own indigenous people which would givemeaning to the noble intentions of this body in makingthis declaration.The Commonwealth of Dominica as a member ofCARICOM  the Organization of American States (OAS)and the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)  isheartened by the spread of democracy throughout thehemisphere. We intend to play our part to ensure that thismovement is not transient  but  rather  reflects a deep-rooted conviction of our people that this is indispensablefor development and prosperity.We respect the right of all countries to chose theirown model of government  while at the same time weurge all Members of the Organization to practice orcontinue to practice the democratic process and to provide6for their people full opportunity to enjoy all the benefits ofa democratic society.It is against this background that the Government andpeople of the Commonwealth of Dominica call again onthis world body not to continually close its ears to the pleasof the Republic of China for international recognition. Itmust be remembered that the Republic of China is afounding Member of this Organization and has been aMember for the greater part of its existence. The Republicof China on Taiwan is a politically democratic andeconomically dynamic society with a directly electedGovernment and Parliament. Dominica therefore urgesMember States not to continue to ignore or block theefforts being made to admit the Republic of China tomembership of this and other international bodies.Peace in this world also requires that the hungry befed  the homeless sheltered  the ignorant educated  allpeople enjoy good health  and our patrimony — theEarth — kept in a condition that we all can enjoy. Weapplaud and encourage the efforts of internationalorganizations — including United Nations specializedagencies  which work to satisfy these needs and aspirations.The effective functioning of this Organization requiresproper management of its resources  both human andfinancial. We encourage the Secretary-General in his effortsin this regard  and we call upon all members to do theirbest to provide the necessary financial support to the limitsof their ability. I take this opportunity to congratulateMr. Ted Turner on his generous donation to theOrganization and  like him  call upon others to do likewise.I am convinced that the Secretary-General will use this giftmost wisely and judiciously  knowing that proper utilizationof these funds will dispose others to come forward.Every country  even the most developed ones  has itsneeds. We in Dominica  a developing country  have many.Globalization and trade liberalization  combined with theimpact of natural disasters  have increased the urgency fordiversifying our economy. In this regard  attention is beingpaid to our human resource capacity  to take advantage ofthe revolution in technology and communication.A major thrust in the process of diversification istourism  but tourism with a difference: ecotourism. EarlierI mentioned the need to preserve and conserve the Earth forthe enjoyment of all. My country Dominica has much tooffer to visitors who want to enjoy nature  and we areworking hard to make ourselves the ecotourism destinationof the Caribbean. Some of those listening to me may havevisited Dominica and know how difficult it is to enterthere. We are taking steps to make it easier to visit mycountry by the construction of a 24-hour landing facilityfor long-range aircraft. We trust that our approach tofriendly nations and institutions for assistance in thisregard will receive favourable consideration.The beginning of the new millennium is close athand. Two years ago we all pledged to redouble ourefforts to work towards fulfilling the obligations weassumed when we became Members of this greatOrganization. Let none of us waver in our resolve. Thekey to it all lies in our working together as Members ofthe United Nations. Let us join hands and wills to buildthis better world. History will judge us harshly if we donot."
"46",1961,"DNK",52,1997,"﻿First of all  I wouldlike to refer to the intervention which will be madetomorrow by the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg onbehalf of the European Union. I should also like tocongratulate the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on hiselection as President of the General Assembly.Allow me to reflect a bit on the fact that threedecades ago a Danish Prime Minister  Mr. Jens OttoKrag  presented our yearly address to the twenty-secondsession of the General Assembly. The challenges of todayare not very similar to those of that time  and yet they areno less complex nor of lesser magnitude. For the UnitedNations to face these challenges  the Organization mustadapt. It must reform  must change and must modernize.That is why reform must be a priority for this session ofthe General Assembly. And that  in all humility  is whyI am here today: to support the Secretary-General and theGeneral Assembly and to do what I can on behalf of mycountry in order to reach our goal at the end of thissession and to help make decisions that are necessary inorder to modernize and to reform.Since the twenty-second session of the GeneralAssembly  30 years ago  we have seen disappointments.We have seen civil wars. We have seen frustrations backlashes and incredible suffering. Yet we have alsoseen light. We have seen peace where war once raged.We have seen former enemies living peacefully together.Indeed  we have seen apartheid disappear. We have seenthe Berlin Wall fall. We have seen the oppressed comingout of jails and being elected leaders of their countries and some of them rank among the world's mostoutstanding leaders. We have seen the winds of changesweep over entire continents.I believe this: if our generation cannot believe in theimpossible  who can? If our generation cannot take thedecisions that are necessary  who else can? All in all  Ithink this is of crucial importance for the United Nations.A reform programme for the United Nations is notonly about a more efficient use of scarce resources. It isalso  and more importantly  about strengthening andrevitalizing the Organization so that it can effectivelycarry out its core activities and meet the challenges of thefuture. It must be a reform closer to the people  a reformcloser to non-governmental organizations andparliamentarians  a reform unifying Governments  theUnited Nations and peoples.11The core activities and priorities are very clearlydescribed in the Secretary-General's reform programme.With great precision and clarity  the Secretary-General hasspelled out elements that my Government fully subscribesto: peace and security  economic and social affairs;development cooperation; humanitarian affairs; and  as anactivity cutting across the others  human rights - becausehuman rights makes the United Nations the people's UnitedNations. These core functions of the United Nations areinterdependent and mutually supportive. No amount offunding will create sustainable development without peace good governance and respect for human rights. None of ourefforts in the field of peace and security or humanitarianrelief will have a lasting effect without efforts to createsustainable development.Denmark gives its full support to the reformprogramme of the Secretary-General. We consider theprogramme  in its totality  to be a significant contributiontowards strengthening the Organization and towards makingit more responsive  legitimate and efficient. I also note thespirit of the Secretary-General in creating much greatermotivation among the employees of the United Nations andmuch shorter lines between the Secretary-General and allthe rest of the people working for our common goal andcause  here in this House and all around the world.Reform is about shifting resources to the corefunctions of the United Nations: shifting resources fromadministration to development - in short  getting morevalue for money  centrally  on the national level andlocally.The reform programme constitutes a package. Itshould be dealt with by the General Assembly as such. Theprogramme as a whole should receive the politicalendorsement of the Assembly in the coming weeks. Mycountry endorses the package fully and wholly.Ground-breaking work has been carried out on theway towards Security Council reform. Expansion of themembership of the Council is essential to enhance itslegitimacy. At the same time  its effectiveness and decision-making capacity must be safeguarded. But - and I thinkthat there is a ""but"" - we must unify in order to reform.We are gathered to reform  to open a new chapter ofreforming and modernizing the United Nations.It has to be said that no institution can discharge itsfunctions without a sound financial basis. Member States'fulfilment of their financial obligations must be consideredthe touchstone of their attachment to the United Nations. Iam not a billionaire; I am probably not even a millionaire.I am the Prime Minister of my country  and I know theway to go. I know  on behalf of my country  ourobligations. I also know  on behalf of my country  thefinancial duties my country has. I therefore hope that thissession will also be a turning point for all Membercountries of the United Nations  because a sound financialbasis first and foremost requires that Member States paytheir contributions in full  on time and without anyconditions. The contributions of Member States must bebased on their capacity to pay. Therefore let us join  aswe have done on the reform process  to finance theUnited Nations on its path to the next century.Political instability  violence and the collapse of thestructures of society have led to massive movements ofrefugee populations. Large numbers of people - millionsof people - have fled to regions far from their homes.We are deeply concerned about this situation. We must doour utmost to support the humanitarian organizations intheir efforts to assist refugees and other displaced personsas close to their local environments as possible: as closeto their homes as possible.Yet refugees and other displaced persons cannotreturn to their homes so long as anti-personnel minesremain scattered throughout the countryside  so long ashuman beings by the thousand are being injured or killedwhen they work their fields  so long as children cannot goto school without risking losing a limb on their way.Mr. Secretary-General  you said it yourself in yourspeech in Oslo: you underlined that the very presence  orjust the fear of the presence  of only one mine can stopthe work in a whole village  can stop the work in a wholefield  can make it impossible for families  or wholevillages  to survive and to create proper living conditions.We must realize that  without mines  we would havecountries that could double or triple their agriculturalproduction and thereby help themselves. We must get ridof these anti-personnel mines and must do it today ratherthan tomorrow.I look forward to the day when the last anti-personnel mine has been produced. That will be a goodday for mankind. I look forward to the day when the lastanti-personnel mine has been removed. That will be agood day for mankind  and that day must come soon. Ilook forward to the day when a United Nationsconvention will settle this matter so that it never comesbefore us again.12We must at the same time work at improving the basicconditions of life for ordinary people in areas of conflict.Only in this way can we prevent people from becomingpermanent refugees.In the past year we have once again experienced howquickly crises can break out in different parts of the world.This underlines the need for the international community tobe able to react swiftly and in unity in order to prevent thespread of violence and human suffering. As the Secretary-General has noted  my country  Denmark  has taken theinitiative to establish a multinational standby high readinessbrigade (SHIRBRIG) within the framework of UnitedNations standby agreements. The planning element for thebrigade was officially inaugurated by the Secretary-Generalearlier this month in my country. The initiative is beingtaken to increase the rapid-reaction capability  and it mustbe carried forward. Improvements in the planning capacityof the United Nations are under way and will help reducethe overall response time.Capacity within other areas must be enhanced as well.Civilian police has proved crucial in many of the recentoperations. We must improve both the capacity and thetraining of civilian police officers.Next year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of amajor achievement in the history of mankind: the 1948adoption by the General Assembly of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. The noble object of theDeclaration is the protection of individuals - not theinterests of States. All human beings are equal and deserveequal protection against abuse. Therefore the standards ofthe Declaration are by their very nature universal. Anydenunciation of human rights obligations is unacceptableand demonstrates a lack of respect for human dignity.On the subject of credibility  I wish to underline thata connection must also be made between violence andhuman rights violations and the consequences. I think therefore  that a significant recent development since theadoption of the Declaration is the establishment of theoffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Iwelcome the new High Commissioner  Mrs. MaryRobinson. She will receive our full support in herendeavours to promote and ensure universal respect forhuman rights.But respect for human rights demands alsointernational justice. After the Nuremberg trials we allbelieved that the Holocaust would never happen again  andyet new genocides are haunting us. Therefore  we need apermanent international criminal court. We will not allowcrimes against humanity to go unpunished. This is afundamental question of credibility  a fundamentalquestion of consequence and of justice. Setting a precisedate for a diplomatic conference in 1998 is essential tomaintain the momentum for the early establishment of thecourt  by the end of this decade.The need to assist the poorest countries is asimportant as ever. The poorest countries do not  I believe attract sufficient private capital flows  nor do they havethe potential to benefit from the liberalization ofinternational trade. It is time for action. It is time tonarrow the gap between rhetoric and action. I wouldremind the Assembly of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  held in Copenhagen  and I would recall theobligations undertaken there and our vision of narrowingthe gap between rhetoric and practical action. Education health and participation for women are fundamentals.The role of the United Nations system in the field ofeconomic and social development is indispensable. Ishould like to emphasize in particular the importance ofthe United Nations as an Organization operating with aglobal mandate and on the basis of a global approach ofsustainable development  security and good governance.Let me mention by way of example the WorldConference on Women  held in Beijing. It should be aprimary task for the United Nations system to ensure aneffective follow-up to these conferences.The United Nations should be at the forefront of theglobal efforts to ensure sustainable development for all.And yet let us be direct  clear and honest. The UnitedNations development organizations concerned are entirelydependent on voluntary contributions  and these have regrettably  followed a decreasing trend in recent years. Ithink it is fair to say that the United Nations developmentorganizations themselves can be partly blamed for theemerging funding crisis. All too often they have failed tocooperate. Many donors have been frustrated to seeUnited Nations organizations engage in a costlycompetition for funds. The mere fact that it has not beenpossible until now for the United Nations organizations toestablish common premises at the country level is anexample of this situation.Here again I feel that the Secretary-General's reformproposals are a significant contribution towards redressingthis unfortunate situation. Let us have one coordinatedUnited Nations house in each country  and let us notcompete among United Nations organizations but13cooperate effectively. That is a vision that we want tofollow and to support.The many  many problems faced by minorities in ourworld  and not least by indigenous peoples  must beaddressed in a coherent manner. We must ensure thatindigenous peoples are given real influence on matterspertaining to them.That is why my country  Denmark - in closecooperation with the indigenous population of Greenland -has called upon the United Nations and its Member Statesto establish  within the framework of the Economic andSocial Council  a permanent forum for indigenous peoples.This forum should have a broad mandate to cover a widerange of issues. Indigenous peoples themselves must beensured the possibility of active and effective participationin its establishment and in its function.The United Nations is the future for all of us on thisglobe - a future that can be improved by closercooperation with regional organizations. This cooperationmust be strengthened. Since the political changes in Europethat began at the end of the 1980s  the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has taken onan important role in that region. This role is a naturalexpression of its status as a regional arrangement underChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. TheOSCE cooperates closely with the United Nations in anumber of areas. By taking on responsibility within its owngeographical area  the OSCE contributes to the UnitedNations ability to deal with crises elsewhere.As Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE  my ForeignMinister has given high priority to strengthening therelationship between the OSCE and the United Nations. Wehave frequent contact with the Secretary-General and haveencouraged closer relations between the secretariats.Let me conclude. It is time for reform  as theSecretary-General so wisely said  and I should like in thisconnection to make three points.My first point is that the reform programme putforward by the Secretary-General deserves our full support.If adopted  it will leave this Organization in much bettershape. For the sake of our common future this is needed.Let us decide and let us follow up.My second point is this: we need the United Nations and the United Nations needs us. We must ensure thenecessary funding for the world Organization and itsdevelopment agencies. We must do this to make theworld a better and safer place. Every Member must payin full  on time  without conditions.Finally  my third point: we must address the negativelegacies of the past. We cannot solve the problem ofrefugees and displaced persons without making it possiblefor them to return to their homes. They cannot and willnot do that as long as their physical well-being isthreatened by inhumane anti-personnel mines and as longas their political future is threatened by war criminalswho have not been brought to justice.Human rights are not just about words. It should alsobe a human right to be able to live a secure life. At theWorld Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen we said  ""You cannot any longer have secure Stateswithout secure people inside"". This is what we need theUnited Nations to help us with.This is not a perfect world  but I remain an optimist.With the United Nations as an organization for the peopleand by the people  we can make this world a better place.Let us join hands to make the twenty-first century ahappier one."
"47",2006,"DOM",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of the Dominican Republic andits President Mr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna  I wish toconvey to our President our warmest congratulations onhis well deserved election to preside over this fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly  at a time when theOrganization is taking important steps forward in its re-structuring and modernization in order to meet thechallenges of peace and economic and social developmentfor our nations.Our delegation pays tribute to the outgoingPresident  His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail  for hisoutstanding conduct of the deliberations during the lastsession of the General Assembly.23We take this opportunity to express our gratitude tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his assiduity dedication and hard work in guiding the Organization downa road of reform and modernization that will make itstronger for the new millennium.While remaining faithful to the purposes and principlesset forth in the Charter — the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  cooperation for economic  social andcultural development  defence of human rights  andhumanitarian assistance — the United Nations should alsopromote and pursue a reform process which takes intoaccount the many changes that have taken place in acomplex international scene. That scene is marked by theend of ideological confrontations and  at the same time  byincreasing levels of poverty and ethnic and religioustension  phenomena that pose a threat to our supremeobjectives of peace and development for our peoples.The trend within the Organization in recent years tothe establishment of working groups  as well as the reportof the Secretary-General entitled “Renewing the UnitedNations: A Programme for Reform”  reflect the strongresolve of Member States to engage in a negotiation andconsultation process that could  once their distrust of thepast is overcome  culminate in far-reaching changes in thevarious United Nations bodies. The Dominican Republicattaches special importance to the ongoing reform process given that it is capable  while respecting the principles andpurposes that gave birth to the Organization  of ensuring amore democratic  transparent  representative and efficientsystem capable of facing the current challenges  especiallythose of peace and the problems of poverty that affect thepeoples of the world.In this regard  the strengthening of the GeneralAssembly  the main forum in which Member States arerepresented  cannot be postponed. It is imperative topromote a process of better coordination between theAssembly and the Security Council  so that the Assemblycan be properly informed  and hence make betterrecommendations to the Security Council.Aware of the need to strengthen the United Nations the Dominican Republic calls on this forum to adoptresolutions that can return to the Assembly its capacity asthe governing body of the Organization. In this regard  wewelcome the proposals of the Secretary-General designed tofocus the work of the Assembly on the highest-priorityissues and to reduce the duration of its sessions as well asthe number of agenda items  so as to allow for their in-depth study.This reorientation should not interfere with theprinciple of sovereign equality  nor with the plural anduniversal character that the Organization has maintainedover the more than half a century of its existence.Reaffirmation of the democratic principles contained inthe Charter must constitute the basis for the currentreform process.The Dominican Republic proposes the establishmentof mechanisms and working methods that would enablethe Assembly to allow reasonable time for makingprogress on resolving certain conflicts. The problems ofpeace  security and development are multiple andcomplex. However  the commitment of the internationalcommunity expressed in the United Nations should gobeyond merely recalling them each year.The aspect of the reform of the Organization that hasraised the greatest debate is the one relating to therestructuring and enlargement of the Security Council.Our country hopes that these reforms will promote greaterparticipation by the membership as a whole. Thus  witha more democratic base and a just and equitable selectionprocess  the Council would be in a better position to meetits purposes and objectives. In this regard  the DominicanRepublic proposes the expansion of the Security Councilfrom the current 15 to 25 members. This represents lessthan 14 per cent of the total number of United NationsMember States  whereas in 1945 the figure was slightlyabove 20 per cent.The Dominican Republic  a founding member of theUnited Nations  has not yet been a member of theSecurity Council. In this new phase of its internationalrelations it has a strong interest in participating activelyin bodies such as the Security Council and thus makinga direct contribution to the maintenance of peace  onwhich depends the very existence of nations.An encouraging sign in the proposal of theSecretary-General is that the reforms are constantlyrelated to the achievement of the founding principles ofthe Organization  as expressed in the Charter. Thus  theresults of reform will be assessed primarily not on thebasis of the relationship of costs to benefits  but rather onhow they facilitate the realization of the Organization’sobjectives.Our country supports the restructuring of theOrganization as long as it promotes more transparent clearer and more coherent mandates and is directedtowards finding lasting solutions to the problems of24hunger  underdevelopment  extreme poverty and socialinjustice  not forgetting the mandates related topeacekeeping.Allow me to refer to the issue of development. Theincrease in global poverty and the gap between rich andpoor countries is today the crucial problem for theinternational community. Poverty has a negative impact onprogress with regard to peace and security  human rightsand the strengthening of democratic systems. We mustaddress forthwith the challenge posed by the tremendouseconomic and social instability of a large number ofcountries.The Dominican delegation associates itself with thedeclarations of the Group of 77 adopted in July of this year at the twenty-second meeting of the group coordinators because we support strengthening the role of the UnitedNations in promoting international cooperation for socialand economic development. And we are in favour ofmeasures that will promote the formulation andcoordination of policies and the provision of technicalassistance to developing countries.Our country is making serious efforts to position itselffavourably in the world economy and to prepare forglobalization. For this purpose  it is currently conductingmajor economic  monetary  tariff and judicial reforms while at the same time negotiating free-trade agreementswith countries of the region. Also  together with othercountries  it is formulating strategies to take advantage offunds from multilateral sources.The achievements of regional groups such as theCentral American Common Market  the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  the Andean Group and theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)  amongothers  are indications of the strong willingness of theMember States to expand their capacities and reduce thenegative impact that the new rules of international tradehave on our economies and societies.Aware of the commitment to promote at the regionallevel mechanisms for improving economic growth andcombating poverty  the Dominican Republic has in the pastyear strengthened its relations with the countries ofCARICOM and Central America  primarily through theparticipation of our President in the meetings of heads ofState and Government. We are pleased to announce that ourcountry will host the next summit meeting of CentralAmerica  Belize and the Dominican Republic and thatnegotiations for the establishment of a free-trade areabetween CARICOM and the Dominican Republic shouldbe concluded by the end of this year.At this time allow me to welcome veryenthusiastically the initiatives of the group of CentralAmerican countries designed to strengthen CentralAmerican unity. It is precisely these efforts that havegiven us faith and confidence in the future of our peoples.During this year  the Dominican Republic hasdeveloped a programme for strengthening our links withour neighbouring country  Haiti. For the first time  bi-national joint commissions are crossing the border to find through dialogue  areas of mutual interest and solutions tosome of the problems common to both countries.Regarding our sister Republic of Haiti  we insist onthe need for the international community to dischargeeffectively the economic commitment it made in 1994with regard to Haiti’s economic recovery anddevelopment. The peacekeeping efforts in Haiti  which wehave promoted in the United Nations  will not besufficient to achieve democratic stability unless they areaccompanied by resources directed to alleviating the greateconomic and social problems affecting that nation.We must again emphasize how external debt isweighing down our economies. The onerous costs ofdebt-servicing hinder our investing more in our peoples thus deepening the levels of poverty. For the DominicanRepublic  the payment of outstanding debts and theinterest on them represents nearly 20 per cent of thenational budget. As a means of promoting developmentand social investment projects to combat poverty  we wishto propose to this Assembly that it take the necessaryactions to reduce the burden of the external debt in thosedeveloping countries that have demonstrated a high levelof responsibility in handling their debt.We reiterate the commitment of the United Nationsto develop efficient measures for the struggle againstpoverty. Along with peacekeeping  developmentcooperation must constitute an overarching goal of theOrganization. No financing of activities for peacekeeping the defence of human rights or humanitarian actions willbe sufficient if we do not act responsibly in undertakingmultilateral cooperation for development.The proposal to unify the various programmes of theUnited Nations devoted to development seems to us to bea very important step towards the effective coordinationof intersectoral policies  concentrating strategies and25development operations in a United Nations DevelopmentGroup. These initiatives must reorient resources towardareas of priority and achieve better coordination withinternational funding organizations.Allow me to express the position of my countryregarding the evolution of the international situation. Peaceis still among the highest aspiration of our peoples.Different points of the planet are currently involved inbloody conflicts which affect common citizens. Security istoday not only a matter of the survival of political regimes but is linked to the very existence of human beings andnature.The Dominican Republic expresses its solidarity withthe many conventions of the international communitydevoted to eradicating corruption  terrorism  drug traffickingand money laundering. These evils disrupt the lives of ourpeoples  erode our institutions and prevent the strengtheningof democracy.We reiterate our conviction regarding the defence ofdemocratic principles and institutionality. In this regard  mycountry is making tremendous efforts to reform andmodernize the State and the judicial system. Establishingmeans of promoting a transparent public administration controlling all forms of administrative corruption  is amongthe ongoing processes in our nation. Dialogue and thesearch for consensus among the branches of the State andbetween the executive branch and civil society have becomethe polestar of public administration of the DominicanGovernment.The Dominican Republic welcomes and associatesitself with the measures taken by the United Nations toextend the presence of the peacekeeping forces in Haiti.Their presence  we believe  strengthens the possibilities fordemocratic stability and will allow the people to take suresteps on the road towards consolidating the country’sdemocracy.We stress the need for a definitive and peacefulsolution to the conflict in the Balkans  and we call upon theinternational community to strengthen its efforts to achievepeace in the Middle East. The crisis in that region  whichhas deteriorated in recent months  demands specialattention. We call for respect for all the agreements signedin recent years in order to restore peace in the region.With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan  theDominican Republic reiterates its position as presented byour President  Dr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna  regarding theneed for the international community to consider theimportance of that country  owing to its geographicallocation and given the fact that security and stability areof great significance for the peace and prosperity of theregion. We call for a constructive dialogue between thetwo sides of the Strait of Taiwan in search of mutualunderstanding and cooperation. We reiterate that parallelparticipation of both countries in the United Nationswould contribute to the maintenance of peace.Our country supports the efforts under way invarious international conferences in Brussels  Oslo  andvery soon in Ottawa  regarding the process to achieve atotal ban an anti-personnel landmines. The commitmentto peace is a commitment to life. The internationalcommunity has an obligation to promote peace and todefend life in all situations and circumstances.The Dominican Republic  traditionally a peace-oriented nation  does not produce or consume nuclearenergy for military purposes; it utilizes such energy forpeaceful purposes. In this spirit  the Dominican Presidentsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyduring his visit to the United Nations last year.Various international conferences are currentlydiscussing conventions on the use of nuclear energy. Oneof them is the convention to regulate the harm caused topersons and the environment by radioactive waste. TheDominican Republic depends to a large extent on tourism a tourism of beaches and sun. The quality of our coastalwaters is vital for the sector’s development  and anyinternational radioactivity-related damage can mean thecollapse of this important sector of our economy. Weappeal to the good judgement of the internationalcommunity to preserve our natural resources.We reaffirm our commitment to the protection of theenvironment and natural resources. In this spirit  ourcountry has acceded to the United Nations InternationalConvention to Combat Desertification.The Dominican Republic reiterates its commitmentto defending and protecting human rights. In thisconnection  it welcomes the efforts made by the UnitedNations to concentrate the activities of the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights. During this year we have had thesatisfaction of receiving two international missions onhuman rights  invited by our Government. A High-LevelMission of the Inter-American Committee on HumanRights (ICHR)  of the Organization of American States 26visited the country in June  and a mission of the Committeeof the International Covenant on Economic  Social andCultural Rights of the United Nations  with headquarters inGeneva  is in the country at this very moment. These visitsindicate the Government’s interest in ensuring transparencyof action to defend and protect human rights in theDominican Republic.Allow me to refer to the situation of the UnitedNations International Research and Training Institute for theAdvancement of Women. Our country wishes to reiteratethe mandate given in Economic and Social Councilresolution 1979/11 of 9 May 1979  in which it is clearlyand explicitly stated that the headquarters of the Institutewould be established in the Dominican Republic  adeveloping country.The objectives that led to the creation of the Instituteare still valid today. Research and training for the purposeof creating new ways for women to contribute to thedevelopment of their countries  in the light of women’sneeds  are a priority. This concern was manifested at theBeijing Conference of 1995 and in the Platform for Actionto follow up the agreements reached in that importantforum.In order to cooperate with the United Nations  theDominican Government not only donated the buildinghousing the Institute but also invested large amounts ofmoney to renovate the building and adapt it to theInstitute’s needs. This explains our surprise when  in 1993 the United Nations Secretariat proposed the merger of theInstitute and the United Nations Development Fund forWomen (UNIFEM)  without prior consultation with ourGovernment and ignoring the headquarters agreement.However  in 1995 the Fourth World Conference onWomen  in its Beijing Platform for Action  confirmed theInstitute’s mandate.We hope that in the process of United Nations reformall the mandates approved by the Member States will beequally respected  since these States bear sole responsibilityfor renewing or changing decisions adopted by the GeneralAssembly.Lastly  we welcome the summoning of Member Statesto reflect on and endorse these transformations in our worldOrganization. The Assembly of the millennium proposed tous for the year 2000 would be an unprecedented forum forevaluating what we have done on the road to these reformsand for reiterating our tremendous faith and trust in thefuture of the generations of the twenty-first century.At this fifty-second session of the General Assemblywe are faced with the historic responsibility of givinggreater reality to our hopes and expectations for a betterfuture for humankind. The changes in those realities aretaking place faster than the changes in the structures wehave given ourselves for dealing with them. We have aunique opportunity to ensure that the reforms of theOrganization respond to the expectations of a UnitedNations that is in line with the needs of the new age."
"48",2053,"DZA",52,1997,"﻿Your election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its fifty-second session  Sir  gives me the pleasantopportunity to congratulate you most warmly and to wishyou all the best for success in carrying out the noble taskentrusted to you.I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail  who discharged his mandatewith a skill and effectiveness that earned our respect andappreciation.My praise goes also to Mr. Kofi Annan  who sincetaking up his duties has worked with courage andselflessness to revitalize the Organization with a view tobringing it into step with the times and with theaspirations of the peoples it brings together.10We are meeting once again at a time when it is beingconfirmed and reconfirmed that the internationalOrganization is facing a comprehensive transition involvingtwo fundamental questions: whether mankind is able  first to form a concept of the Organization and to put thatconcept into practice  and secondly  to ensure that theconcept and its implementation enjoy universal participationrather than being the sole preserve of the dominant Powers.The fact is that this transition has both a political anda strategic dimension. Now  soon after the cold war  theclosure of the East-West rift and the end of the bipolarsystem  we must find a new pattern of balances in order toestablish a new  more just and more unified world order  aworld order that respects the interests and aspirations of all a world order that quite simply restores the values andideals on which our Organization was built.This transitional phase also has a basic economicdimension: the challenge of globalization  which must befaced by us all in unity so that there will be room for theaspirations of each of us. The test is to masterglobalization  for unbridled globalization would bring newsetbacks and new exclusions  which would pose a threat toall.Finally  this transition has a new dimension: that ofcoping with threats thus far misunderstood orunderestimated  such as the scourges of internationalterrorism  drug trafficking  international organized crimeand environmental degradation. In a related vein  we mustshare the objective of establishing States based on the ruleof law  human rights and good governance as thefoundation of the new international relations we arebuilding.Clearly  the United Nations is an active partner in thisglobal transition; hence  it must first of all adapt itself toongoing changes so that it can influence their development.The Secretary-General has in fact taken the good step ofbeginning reflection along these lines  for which wecommend him  and has taken the initiative to reform theOrganization.Here  let me share some of my thoughts on this greatplan for the future.My first thought is somewhat methodological innature. In the package of reforms submitted we distinctlysee those which come within the sole purview of theSecretary-General of our Organization  and he has the rightas well as the duty to implement these reforms. But at thesame time  it is equally clear that other proposed reformscome only within the purview of Member States  whichmust naturally discuss them before taking a decision.My second thought gives me the opportunity first ofall to express our satisfaction at the inclusion of newpriorities in United Nations activities — be they in thearea of human rights  humanitarian affairs  theenvironment  combating terrorism or the crackdown ondrug trafficking. These are all new universal concerns and the United Nations has a central place in dealing withthem.Having said that  the objective of streamlining ourOrganization’s activities should not sacrifice what hasbeen and remains the very reason for being of the UnitedNations — the two pillars on which it has always rested namely peace and development.From this standpoint  international cooperation fordevelopment  as much as international security anddisarmament affairs  must not suffer on account of therestructuring contemplated. Otherwise  the credibility andeffectiveness of the United Nations would be eroded inthese areas of action  which are destined to remain at theforefront of the challenges which our countries will haveto face.My third thought concerns the financial crisis of ourOrganization. Proposals made by the Secretary-General be it to introduce a new culture of management ofresources or to create a revolving fund  are of someinterest. However  it is important that Member States bemotivated  first and foremost  by the obligation they havepursuant to the provisions of the Charter to pay theircontribution to the budget of the Organization regularlyand fully. This  in effect  is where we find the genuineand lasting solution to a problem which seems to go onindefinitely and which should be distinguished and solvedas such  without its serving as justification for deprivingthe United Nations of essential functions which it intendsto undertake in the service of all.My fourth thought relates to the United NationsGeneral Assembly. If it has become absolutely necessarytoday to streamline the work of this central body and tore-examine its programme and work methods  we should by the same token  see to it that the Assembly continuesto be the special forum of States where essential issuesconcerning peace  security and development can bedebated and considered. This is certainly one of the mostappropriate ways to ensure effective participation in the11management of world affairs  in our quest for solutions tointernational problems  and to promote genuinedemocratization of international relations.In the era of democracy  transparency and propermanagement that we are claiming for our countries  thereis nothing more normal than to insist  together  on the samevalues and principles in this Organization which unites us.It is in this same spirit that we see the problem of thelegal nature of General Assembly decisions and resolutions which should be given the necessary effectiveness. It is alsoin this spirit that we see the problem of re-balancing thepowers of the Secretary-General and the General Assembly which should come consistently within the scope ofredefining all the relationships among the principal organsof the United Nations.Finally  and this is my last thought  a revision of theUnited Nations Charter is of crucial importance andrequires in-depth thought which would raise ourOrganization to a level on par with the vision  principlesand objectives which are inherent in it.In this same line of thought  and even if this goesbeyond the context of reforms proposed by the Secretary-General  I would like to refer to the issue of the expansionof the Security Council. The Council is  quite obviously the body whose role and responsibilities best reflect thehopes  expectations and  above all  the frustrations ofStates. Consequently  it is important that the reform tries toreflect correctly the qualitative and quantitative changeswhich have taken place in international relations.The enhancement of the political and moral authority as well as the legitimacy  of this vital body requires abalanced representation within it  whether with regard topermanent or non-permanent seats. Furthermore  anydecisions regarding its expansion and the revision of itsmethods of deliberation and decision-making would benefitby having the broadest possible support of Member States.The declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs ofthe Non-Aligned Countries in New Delhi in April 1997 which was reaffirmed here in New York  and that ofAfrican heads of State and Government in Harare in June1997 are  in this regard  valuable contributions for ourcollective thinking regarding the membership andfunctioning of the Security Council which we all hope willserve our common expectations.Among the new challenges facing the internationalcommunity  terrorism is the one which apparently is themost formidable because of its threats not only to thebasic rights of the individual but also to the verydemocratic foundations of our societies. No State canconsider itself immune from these threats in the long run.In this regard  we should welcome the internationalcommunity’s awareness which has taken shape of the realnature of this phenomenon. This has been accompaniedby greater mobilization of efforts against this scourge which  above and beyond hindering economic and socialdevelopment of States  engenders the most seriousdangers to international peace and security. In addition we should welcome the decision of the General Assemblyto include the campaign against international terrorismamong the major priorities in its medium-term plan ofaction. The present stage requires that we make effectiveuse of every achievement by guiding United Nationsaction in an innovative and practical direction  based onoperational legal aspects of multilateral activities againstterrorism.In the same vein  the conclusion of an internationalconvention to suppress acts of terrorism in an integrated global manner must be one of the major priority areas formore effective international action. The internationalcommunity must  above all  resolutely respond to theneeds of the struggle against terrorism  depriving terroristsof sanctuary and strictly abiding by the relevantinternational instruments.In every sphere  Algeria is continuing to work forthe emergence and consolidation of mutually beneficialframeworks for dialogue  solidarity and cooperation andfor the promotion of relations based on confidence mutual respect and common interest. That is what guidesAlgeria in its commitment to building a Maghreb that isunited  acts in solidarity and is stable and prosperous.Algeria  which has made the Maghreb project a nationalpriority  is resolved to work together with its partnersthere to relaunch the process of building the Maghreb ona solid and durable basis.To this end  my country is contributing to the searchfor a just and lasting solution to the question of WesternSahara. Aware of its responsibilities as both aneighbouring country and an official observer of theSettlement Plan  Algeria has repeatedly urged the12international community to shoulder its responsibilities withregard to the peace process in Western Sahara. The recentagreement in Houston  resulting from the direct talksbetween the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIOFront  under the auspices of Mr. James Baker  the PersonalEnvoy of the Secretary-General  brought a solution toproblems that had until then prevented implementation ofthe United Nations Settlement Plan. This constitutes majorprogress towards the final settlement of this conflict  andAlgeria  like the rest of the international community  isdelighted. Concerned for the stability and security of theregion  Algeria will continue to make a full contribution tothe efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoyaimed at the holding of a referendum to enable the peopleof Western Sahara freely to exercise their right to self-determination.In the Mediterranean almost a quarter of a century agomy country distinguished itself through its pioneering rolein highlighting the indivisible link between the two coastsof our common sea with regard to security and cooperationmatters. The Helsinki process began at that time. Becauseof its dedication to the Barcelona process  Algeria is todaycontinuing to work to establish and consolidate permanentframeworks for dialogue and cooperation so as to ensurethat we deal in a satisfactory manner with the political security  economic and human concerns of all the States inthe European-Mediterranean theatre as well as thelegitimate aspirations of their peoples. We are encouragedin this regard by the reaffirmation at the Second Euro-Mediterranean Conference  held in Malta on 15 and 16April 1997  of the dedication of the Mediterranean countriesto the Barcelona process  which rightly constitutes a majorpolitical achievement that should be preserved and promoted.In the same context  I am pleased to refer to theholding of the fourth meeting of Foreign Ministers of theMediterranean Forum in Algiers on 11 and 12 July. Thisprovided the European-Mediterranean theatre with a specialmeeting place for dialogue to foster mutual understandingand give a new dynamic to the promotion of the European-Mediterranean partnership  at both the multilateral andbilateral levels.Within the Mediterranean theatre  recent developmentsin the Middle East are in many respects causing great alarmand legitimate concerns on the part of the internationalcommunity. Prospects for peace that were recently openedup by the peace process now seem dangerously distant  andfear of a return to confrontation is increasing every day.At the heart of the current impasse are the IsraeliAdministration’s renunciation of the Oslo declaration andthe Washington agreements; its negation of the principleof land for peace and its refusal to resume negotiations atthe point at which they were suspended; and itscontinuing policy of settlement  including in Al-Quds Al-Sharif  where a programme of systematic judaization iscontinuing. The Israeli Administration must understandthat only a lasting peace — that is  a just andcomprehensive peace — can ensure genuine security forall the peoples of the region.The revitalization of the peace process requires theIsraeli Administration urgently to end its unilateralactions  which are contrary to the spirit and letter of thecommitments that it entered into.Similarly  it cannot indefinitely and with impunity goagainst the will of the international community  which hasset as an absolute requirement for peace withdrawal fromthe Golan and southern Lebanon  as well as the right toself-determination of the Palestinian people  includingtheir right to an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharifas its capital.Also in that part of the world the Iraqi people arecontinuing to suffer unjustly from the effects of a cruelembargo. My country can only renew its appeal for thelifting of sanctions  which have lasted for too long andcannot be justified today. This appeal also applies to thesituation of the Libyan people  who also continue to besubjected to an embargo that is as unjust as it is invalid.Given the start of the process of disengagement fromAfrica by the international community  and the dangers ofmarginalization  Africa’s resurgence demonstrates its firmdetermination to take charge of its destiny and to breakthe cycle of dependence once and for all. This welcomedevelopment also demonstrates the collectivedetermination of Africa to face the considerablechallenges that confront it by relying first and foremoston its own resources. In fact  every day Africa gives thelie to the theory that it is condemned to be a zone withoutlaws or development  a zone of insecurity and instability.The democracy and pluralism  which are gainingground every day in Africa and taking firm hold and theeconomic growth at rates that are often spectacular  pointto new development prospects. At the same time  Africais showing a promising capacity for conflict managementand resolution.13The establishment of the Organization of AfricanUnity Central Organ’s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution and the Treaty setting up theAfrican Economic Community are the product of the spiritof solidarity and mutual assistance which is rooted inAfrican culture and of a strategy for giving fresh impetusto intra-African factors of integration and complementarity.This is the forum to state that the international communitymust encourage and help these praiseworthy efforts.In this regard  we welcome the convening of a specialministerial meeting of the Security Council on Africa which is a major political advance. We venture to hope thatwe are thereby taking steps towards international solidaritywith the African continent  which will finally be consideredan active partner which cannot be excluded fromhumankind’s great march towards the fulfilment of itsdestiny.The signs of recovery which have recently beenevident through the growth of the world economy are a realsource of satisfaction. However  this slight improvementneeds to be consolidated so as to make it the lasting trendof the end of the century.In this regard  it is particularly important that theproblems of development around the world  and particularlyin developing countries  be given priority  since the currentcontribution of developing countries is still well below theirpotential and falls short of the role they legitimately wantto play.The phenomenon of globalization  which promises somuch  instead continues to bring great uncertainty to thecountries of the South  which is compounded by concern atseeing many of them further marginalized and evenexcluded from the long-awaited overall developmentprocess they so desire. This state of affairs is mainly due toa structure of international relations still marked by theNorth-South divide. It highlights the continuation of thebasically adverse nature of an international economicenvironment characterized by the North’s increasingmonopoly of the decisive elements of development: trade financial and stock markets  flows of capital andinvestment  and technology transfer.The countries of the South have made economicallyand socially costly adjustments  and carried out boldreforms in their quest for greater integration into worldtrade  but they still encounter numerous difficulties. Theseare aggravated by  inter alia: stifling external indebtedness;a continued deterioration of the terms of trade; an alarmingdecline in official development assistance; and an equallyworrying reduction of international cooperation fordevelopment in general.These disturbing trends are in contrast with theglobal consensus that has emerged during majorinternational conferences organized over the past decadeunder the auspices of the United Nations. They raiselegitimate questions as to the very future of the systemestablished to organize international cooperation fordevelopment.On the eve of the third millennium  and at a timewhen we are trying to find consensus on the need toreform our Organization to prepare it to take upchallenges and face future tasks  we all need to do somesoul-searching. Tomorrow’s United Nations will be whatwe  the peoples of the United Nations  want it to be. Andthe new United Nations that our countries intend to buildwill  above all  need to be freed from the mistakes andbad habits of the past.Yesterday  the United Nations was a melting pot forthe ideals and values that unite us; tomorrow its job is toreconcile these ideals and values with all the expectationsof our peoples and nations that are still to be met. Thisreform project should result in our ideals and values beingdealt with in the only way that matters  namely  turnedinto a vision that become reality. This is what lies at theheart of this major project which we can undertake for theUnited Nations and  in the final analysis  for ourselves."
"49",2100,"ECU",52,1997,"﻿I am honoured to extend to you  Sir  on behalfof the Government and the people of Ecuador  warmcongratulations on your election to preside over thissession of the General Assembly. I am sure that yourefforts will contribute to the advancement of the activitiesof our Organization. You may rely on the constant andresolute cooperation of Ecuador.I should like to speak of several matters of interestto the international community that the United Nationshas incorporated into its working agenda. My countryfollows with interest their development within theOrganization and will act on the basis of the principlesthat guide Ecuador’s foreign policy.Ecuador believes that the search for general andcomplete global disarmament is a goal that ourOrganization should pursue indefatigably. This is not autopian ideal but  rather  a constant objective thatrequires the active participation of all States within aglobal ethical context. True to this principle  mycountry is a party to all international and regionalinstruments related to disarmament.The nations of the world have welcomed the endof the cold war and the attendant reduction of the riskof nuclear holocaust. Nevertheless  Ecuador views withapprehension the persistence of nuclear-weapon-development programmes and the continued existenceof large atomic arsenals and the risks they pose for thepeace and well-being of all. The internationalcommunity cannot relax its guard and cease to insist onthe elimination of such means of massive andindiscriminate destruction. This conviction has ledEcuador to lend its determined support to the globalnon-proliferation regimen and to the establishment ofnuclear-weapon-free zones. Thus  at the last session ofthe General Assembly  Ecuador was a sponsor of theresolution calling for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the southern hemisphere andadjacent areas.Furthermore  Ecuador supports the work of theConference on Disarmament in drawing up a draft textfor a convention on the control of fissionable material which is to be submitted to the General Assembly  andfully agrees with the working document submitted bymembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countriesconcerning the universal nature of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.With regard to weapons of mass destruction disarmament has particular significance for the whole ofthe international community. However  we cannotoverlook the fact that the subject of conventionaldisarmament is equally sensitive and that it is an issuethat must attract the full and determined attention of theUnited Nations. For this reason  Ecuador welcomes theDisarmament Commission’s decision to include in itsagenda an item on guidelines for control  limitation anddisarmament in connection with conventional weapons with special attention to the consolidation of peace withinthe context of General Assembly resolution 51/45 N.Ecuador also supports the convening in 1999 of thefourth special session of the General Assembly devotedto disarmament  in accordance with the decision taken atthe Assembly’s last session. My country is especiallyinterested in including in the agenda of that specialsession such relevant issues as the effective reduction ofconventional forces and weapons  the relationshipbetween disarmament and development  and confidence-building measures among States.Because of their humanitarian cost  I must refer to aspecific type of conventional weapon: anti-personnellandmines. Ecuador is a contracting party to severalinternational agreements that ban and restrict the use ofsuch weapons  and we urge all countries  whethersignatories to those treaties or not  to observe them andscrupulously respect their terms.My country is convinced that the community ofStates must persist in its efforts to reach agreement onthe total prohibition of the use  production  stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Ecuador thussupports the Ottawa process  which is to conclude inDecember 1997 with the signing of a binding agreementon a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.Humankind has painfully come to realize thatinternational peace and security cannot be based onatomic equilibrium  arms races or mistrust and mutualsuspicion. On the contrary  genuine peace must be basedon respect for the rule of law  on the acceptance of thesolidarity and interdependence of all States and on thecommon desire to move dynamically forward towards thesolution of the critical problems of dire poverty  disease unemployment  illiteracy and economic and socialinequality among peoples and nations. In order to makeprogress  we must recognize and live by universalethical principles and seek peaceful solutions to ourmultilateral and bilateral problems through peacefulprocesses  through dialogue and reconciliation.The countries of Latin America  and Ecuador inparticular  are concerned by the fact that economicdevelopment is not accompanied by social development.It is ironic that in an ever wealthier world development-cooperation resources have fallen20 per cent in real terms in recent years. How  then can the international community fulfil the commitmentsentered into at the World Summit for SocialDevelopment?We  the developing countries  assume ourresponsibility in fighting poverty  providing betterhealth and education to our people  reinforcing ourdemocracies and consolidating our institutions.However  it is essential that international cooperationfor development be continued  since this will result in amore just  stable and peaceful world.There is no doubt that in recent years the worldhas changed dramatically. We have moved from aninternational society where political and militaryconfrontation weighed heavily on relations to a systemwhere cooperation and dialogue among the greatPowers have gradually eased the fear of a nuclearholocaust. In this new environment of internationalrelations  in which economic questions have becomeglobal in nature  the United Nations must also modifysome of its previous patterns of conduct andmanagement.What do we want from the United Nations in thetwenty-first century? The Secretary-General hassubmitted a comprehensive programme for the reformof the United Nations system  a programme that mustbe profoundly and carefully analysed by all MemberStates  and Ecuador will actively participate in thedebate on this subject.It must be pointed out that this world body mustconfront the great challenges to mankind  such as thepromotion of economic and social development alongwith the needed preservation of the environment; themaintenance of international peace and harmony; theachievement of total and complete disarmament; thepromotion of human rights; and the strengthening ofcooperation among all nations to eradicate poverty.2Since its establishment  the United Nations hasfulfilled a number of the purposes for which it wascreated. It is true that the Organization  for variousreasons largely attributable to Member States themselves has not fulfilled some of the high expectations of theinternational community. It is worth noting that one ofthe most accurate phrases ever uttered in this forumrecognizes that the United Nations is exactly what itsMembers want it to be. The successes and failures of theOrganization are the successes and failures of the Statesthat make it up. I do not wish to start listing past errors but we should not forget them  because they can serve asuseful lessons. We must above all be aware that todaythere are new challenges  and that we must look aheadand face them.We must design an Organization which  throughpractical mechanisms  leaves rhetoric aside and assumes adynamic role in the solution of world problems. This willrequire substantial reform of the working methods of theUnited Nations. Furthermore  it will require a newattitude by Member States in order to create a just andequitable international society based on the authentic democratically expressed will of the internationalcommunity.For the Organization to respond more effectively tothe challenges now facing the international community these reforms should not be restricted to a single sectorwithin the institutional structure. Let me mention thereform of one of the most important organs of the UnitedNations: the Security Council. Ecuador attaches particularimportance to the reform of that body as part of thestrengthening of the United Nations. We believe that theultimate objective of these efforts must be to develop amore democratic  transparent and truly representativeworking system for the Council.The reform of the Security Council must not belimited to a mere discussion of the number of membersor of how many delegations should represent eachregion — although here we believe that the number ofSecurity Council members must be increased in the lightof the new world realities  to obtain a more significantpresence of developing countries in accordance withequitable geographical distribution. We also believe thatreal reform of the Security Council should aim above allat ensuring that decision-making machinery and processeshave the transparency  effectiveness and pluralism thatmust characterize every democratic institution. Thisincludes  among other specific measures  the limitation ofthe veto power of the Council's permanent members  andtimelier and more effective action to preventinternational conflicts at the request of any StateMember of the Organization.As we approach the end of the United NationsDecade of International Law  I would like to reaffirmour hope that its objectives will be fully met particularly those relating to the promotion of andrespect for the principles of international law and to thebroadest possible recourse to ways and means for thepeaceful settlement of disputes between States. Weknow that complex international disputes cannot besettled solely by legal mechanisms  but it is no less truethat any settlement must be based on legal instrumentsand must follow formal procedures.An essential element of Ecuador's internationalpolicy is the search for a just and permanent solution tothe Ecuador-Peru territorial issue. With the valuablehelp of Argentina  Brazil  Chile and the United Statesas guarantor countries  talks between Ecuador and Peruare currently under way in Brasilia on the remainingimpasses that affect our common border  in accordancewith the commitment of both countries to find apeaceful and final solution to these issues. Ecuador willcontinue to participate in these talks  motivated by atrue spirit of peace  because we desire a global  final honourable and realistic solution that reflects thelegitimate expectations of our people  which  togetherwith the other peoples of the Americas  are seeking tocreate a future of mutual benefit and constructive andpeaceful cooperation. The efforts of the Ecuadorian andPeruvian peoples are aimed at finding a definitivesolution to this dispute.International interest in the progress of the Brasiliatalks and the immense prospects that would open forboth countries in the new millennium are factors thatshould encourage our Governments to make all effortsnecessary to settle this age-old historical controversy and thus respond to the just aspirations to peace anddevelopment that we all share. Our country longs forpeace and wants peace; it does not want war. We areconvinced that there is no victory in a war  onlydifferent degrees of defeat owing to the incalculableconsequences that can affect the political  moral  socialand economic life of our countries.The Charter of the United Nations states thatworld security is not limited to the significant issue ofthe prevention and settlement of violent conflicts. Asafer world is also a world where general prosperity3eliminates the causes of most conflict and humansuffering. The United Nations should continue to be aforum for the discussion of critical issues concerning thesearch for the economic development of more than threequarters of the world's population.To be sure  Ecuador is aware that economic growthper se is not enough to generate adequate social justiceand an equitable distribution of income. My Governmenthas designed programmes and plans aimed at coveringthe needs of the marginal populations of Ecuador. Withthe assistance of the World Bank and the United NationsDevelopment Programme  we have established a nationalsocial development plan that includes government actionin line with the commitments assumed by theinternational community during the World Summit forSocial Development.The socially oriented philosophy of my Governmentleads me to join those who suggest that the eradication ofpoverty throughout the world should be the main goal ofthe international community's coordinated efforts in thecoming years. The globalization of the economy cannotbe limited to the use of cheap labour in the developingworld  the proliferation of profitable investments and theexploitation of certain markets. It should also aim atproviding coordinated and systematic assistance toimmense populations whose only experience ofglobalization has been their eternal poverty andfrustration.Since time immemorial  the inhabitants of Ecuadorhave had special devotion to nature. My country  whichhas one the greatest biodiversity reserves in the world has a deep sense of respect for nature and an awarenessof its value  which are deeply rooted in our traditionalculture. Ecuadorian indigenous communities  for example possess ancestral knowledge concerning the rationalmanagement of resources and the preservation of theecosystem.Ecuador is aware of the difficult dilemma faced byevery society when it comes to choosing betweeneconomic progress and the preservation of theenvironment. Given the basic value that the naturalenvironment has for the Ecuadorian people  we havededicated all our efforts to preventing  or at least limitingto the greatest extent possible  the degree of destructionof nature caused by economic progress.As it did during the special session of the GeneralAssembly held last June  my Government would like toreiterate its strong commitment to the implementationof Agenda 21 and to reaching the Agenda's goals ofsustainable development. The efforts of developingnations will be successful only if they can secure theeffective support of developed countries throughcompliance with the commitments assumed at theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the Rio summit. There can be nouniversal environmental preservation without a genuinechange in the unsustainable consumption patterns thatbring about the increasing deterioration of the globalenvironment  without adequate financial assistance fordevelopment in percentages proportional to grossdomestic product  and without adequate facilities toaccess modern technologies.The establishment of new trade and financialregimes and the urgent need to restructure oureconomies give rise to enormous challenges fordeveloping countries. We believe that we shouldredouble our efforts in order to meet the requirementsof globalization  in such a way that our nations can alsobenefit from the new international economic vigour.Unlike developed countries  for developingcountries the globalization process is not only a way toreactivate productive growth  maintain an upward trendin stock market indicators or increase business profits.For developing countries  the economic aspect of theso-called globalization should be an opportunity toaccelerate the sustainable development of their peoples particularly with regard to social issues.It should be recalled that developing countrieshave made spectacular efforts to adjust to the neweconomic realities. Trade adjustment and liberalizationprogrammes have had strong short-term impacts insignificant sectors of our society. Several States haveadopted severe economic measures  hoping that in theend they will have positive results for all. However  wecannot help but feel that this attitude contrasts with thebehaviour of some industrialized countries.In trade matters  for example  although somedeveloped nations insist on the liberalization of trade they persist in keeping various barriers against tradeflows originating in the South. We are not opposed tothe moderate liberalization of markets regulated byinternational trade in order to prevent negative effectson sensitive sectors of local economies  but we areopposed to those who preach freedom of trade for someand then systematically avoid it for themselves as they4see fit. Developing countries demand a fair  equitable andtransparent environment for international trade that willallow us to reap the benefits of economic globalization.On the other hand  many developed countries withinfluence in financial decision-taking circles maintain apurely economic perspective — as opposed to a widersocial vision — of the financial difficulties affecting thedeveloping world. They continue to associate a nation'seconomic health with the vigour of its macroeconomicindicators alone. In fact  no nation can have a healthyeconomy if a significant sector of its population lives inextreme poverty or if internal growth indicators do notguarantee a sustainable and continued development in thefuture. Foreign debt still weighs heavily on my countryand prevents us from reaching the objectives of sustainedeconomic and social development and environmentalprotection. With the same constructive spirit as thatwhich guides our trade policies  we are convinced thatthe institutions of the international financial systemshould support developing countries' efforts to facilitatetheir economic advancement and fulfil the commitmentsof the Earth Summit.International trade and finance  disarmament andsecurity  environment and development are issues thatcannot be considered separately from one another. Weknow that all the issues in the international agenda areinterrelated and we address them separately just forconvenience of consideration. In any case  we must neverlose sight of the principle of globality and interrelation inthe international agenda  or we may run the risk ofhaving an utterly limited historical perspective andobjectivity.Accordingly  Ecuador shares the view of the UnitedNations Secretary-General on the importance of humanrights in the modern world and that all relevantprogrammes implemented by the Organization must befully integrated within the scope of activities of theUnited Nations.In the case of Ecuador  I am pleased to inform theAssembly that one of the principles of my Administrationis to enforce a policy of absolute respect for humanrights. I have the ethical conviction that modern civilizedlife is impossible without individual guarantees andtolerance for diverging opinions. The Ecuadorian State iscommitted to following this line of conduct and topromoting and protecting all human  civil  cultural economic  political and social rights  including the rightto development. We are also committed to encouraginginquiry procedures in cases of violations of such rightsand to punishing those found liable for them.The battle against corruption is one of the essentialobjectives of the National Government in order toensure that government institutions can recover theirrespectability and the trust which our people is entitledto place in them.I wish to refer to a specific aspect related to thehuman rights issue: the establishment of an internationalcriminal court to punish the most serious crimes  suchas genocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes.Ecuador strongly supports this initiative. We share theview that this court should be established byinternational convention. We therefore urge all States toshow the necessary political will to overcome theremaining technical difficulties in order to convene theconference of plenipotentiaries charged with approvingthe court's statutes.To conclude  as President of the Republic ofEcuador  I have the pleasure to bring the message offriendship and brotherhood of the Ecuadorian people tothis forum  in which all the nations of the world arerepresented. Our people has consolidated its democracyand balanced its economy and is moving boldly forwardto build its future. It is a people that sincerely aspires toensuring that international mechanisms understand therealities of developing countries. Above all  at thismoment in our history  in the face of any potentialnatural disaster  such as the El Niño phenomenon  wewould like to count on the timely  effective and directcooperation of the United Nations and the variousrelevant international institutions. I wish to extend onceagain our message of friendship and fraternity  as wellas my country's commitment to the lofty ideals thatguide the efforts of the United Nations in theinternational sphere."
"50",2145,"EGY",52,1997,"﻿Mr.President  to you and your friendly country  I am pleasedto extend my warmest congratulations on your election tothe presidency of this session of the General Assembly.Your expertise on United Nations and world issues willundoubtedly assist you in wisely discharging the work ofthe General Assembly.At the same time  I wish to express our appreciationto your predecessor for the efforts he exerted in connectionwith the discussions relating to United Nations reform.The world is currently passing through highlyinterwoven and complicated circumstances  where progressand its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangerswhile humanity takes pride in such achievements aseconomic progress and the development of technology andinformatics  it is still suffering from the practices ofterrorism  drug trafficking  organized crime  the spread ofcorruption  the overflow of refugees  the challenges posedby war criminals  crimes of genocide and mass murder  andthe negative effects of racism and religious discrimination.All this gives rise to a situation which requires theinternational community to cooperate and becomeinterdependent in its endeavours in a manner that helps itlive in security and to progress confidently. This cannottake place unless the United Nations become the focal pointand the centre of its concerted actions.This prompts us to accord priority in Egypt's statementto this session to the issue of United Nations reform. Theoutcome of this session  and probably subsequent sessionswill constitute a true litmus test of the credibility ofdetermination and the objectivity of resolve regarding thepresent and the future of the United Nations.Evolution of the United Nations relies on a number offacts and requisites. The principles of democratization andmultilateralism are widespread  market economymechanisms are growing  and scientific progress andinformation technology are accelerating. This necessitatesreaching agreement on and drafting new rules forinternational conduct.It has been shown that the end of the cold war in noway sufficiently guarantees the non-eruption of conflicts tragedies and wars. By the same token  the risksemanating from the outbreak of rampant internationalconfrontations have not disappeared. The root causes ofnational and international disputes still persist. On theother hand  weapons of mass destruction are readilyavailable and are even on the rise. In addition to theabsence of any substantial progress in the field of nucleardisarmament  there exist clandestine military nuclearprogrammes not subject to any international supervisionin strategically sensitive areas such as the Middle Eastregion.While globalization is a rapidly growingphenomenon  and given its impact on the security andprosperity of various societies  national legislation andregulations are finding it difficult to cope with thisphenomenon and to regulate international relationsaccordingly. Most of the developing countries do notpossess the same capacity as the developed ones tospeedily effect the necessary psychological  cultural andlegislative adjustments. Therefore  the United Nationsrepresents the proper mechanism for the formulation of aninternational consensus on the rules governing all thesedevelopments  and the provision of necessary assistanceto the developing countries to meet and regulate theirrequirements.While we agree on the need to change the UnitedNations and increase its effectiveness  we might not be asagreed on the means to achieve that objective. In thiscontext  I wish to state Egypt's view of the mainprinciples and points on which the United Nations reformprocess should be based  in addition to a preliminarycomment on some of the Secretary-General's recentproposals in this respect.It is important that the United Nations reform takeplace in conformity with the purposes and principlesenshrined in the Charter and the mandates accorded toeach of the United Nations principal organs. The GeneralAssembly  representing the general membership of theUnited Nations  has to adopt clear decisions which reflectthe general consensus with regard to the proposals13contained in the Secretary-General's report. Such consensusshould be built through serious intergovernmental dialoguecharacterized by maximum transparency and sense ofresponsibility.We concur with the Secretary-General's position thatreforming the United Nations administrative machinery isnot a substitute for the political will of the Member Statesto enhance the role of the Organization. Thus  the first steptowards reform is the formation of a clear collective will tostrengthen the United Nations system through acomprehensive approach in the interest of all.While we would generally welcome mergingdepartments with similar activities as well as slashing anumber of posts if the General Assembly so decides  wewish to stress that rationalizing expenditures must not bedone at the expense of efficient performance.Administrative reform should not diminish theOrganization's capacity to fully implement the programmesadopted by the Member States. Nor should it adverselyaffect the equitable geographic distribution in thecomposition of the Secretariat.We are also in agreement with the Secretary-General'sdiagnosis of the real threat facing the United Nations namely the non-payment by some major Powers of theirassessed contributions  be they to the regular budget or tothe budget of peacekeeping operations. Since these arrearsare part of the Member States' obligations under theCharter  their payment should be made in full  immediatelyand without conditions. Any attempt to make paymentconditional will only complicate the entire reform process.The sharp and steady decline in the resources allocatedto development  coupled with the absence of enthusiasm onthe part of some for the fulfilment of their obligations  havenegatively affected the implementation of manyprogrammes adopted by Member States. This impels us toreview the funding modalities of the United Nationsoperational activities for development so as to ensure theireffective performance.We concur with the Secretary-General on theimportance of achieving the system-wide integration ofUnited Nations programmes that deal with development.We still look forward to hearing concrete ideas on how toachieve more comprehensive coordination throughout theUnited Nations system as well as on how to decentralizethe working methods of the regional economiccommissions. These commissions play a cardinal role inimplementing the Organization's priorities  such aspoverty eradication.Lastly  some of the other measures proposed by theSecretary-General  particularly those relating to how toaddress the financial crisis  should be studied further witha view to reaching arrangements which would enjoygeneral consensus and help overcome this crisis.Therefore  we invite the General Assembly to studythe important proposals made by the Secretary-General.The Assembly should then come up withrecommendations that clarify the Member States'aspirations and the modalities of implementing theirspecified priorities in the medium-term plan  together withmeans of promoting the vital role of the Organization inthe coming decades.In the course of reforming the United Nations  theSecretary-General touched upon the elaboration of a newconcept and structure of the Trusteeship Council. This isa matter that requires extensive discussion and study toclarify the impact and dimensions of the proposedconcept  as it is totally different from the current mandateof the Council. Besides  it is imperative to discuss thesignificance of  and the need to put under collectivetrusteeship  topics set forth by the world community inwell-established international agreements that express thewill of the international community as a whole. Underthose agreements  mechanisms and organs have alreadybeen set up to oversee their implementation.Also  within the context of changing the role of theOrganization  we note that the Secretary-General'sproposals entrust the United Nations High Commissionerfor Human Rights with many additional responsibilitiesand competencies at the expense of the functionsentrusted to the Centre for Human Rights. In our view this is not in line with what is important in themanagement of the human rights field. Here we recallsome recent sagacious appeals for updating the approachand legislation of the international community in the fieldof human rights in order to better reflect the diversecontributions of various cultures and civilizations in ourcontemporary world to the promotion and enrichment ofthese rights and the protection of the freedom ofindividuals and societies. Although some politicalconsiderations stood in the way of including the valuablecontributions of some of those cultures and civilizationsin the main human rights instruments — foremost amongwhich is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights —these sagacious appeals reflect the desire to enhance the14contribution of various world cultures in the protection ofhuman rights. Such enhanced and diverse contributions  inthe framework of a world consensus  could spare theinternational community any accusation of negligence double standards or bias towards a single cultural concept.In the field of disarmament  I should point out that for50 years  the United Nations has given due regard todisarmament issues. It has given high priority to mattersrelating to weapons of mass destruction in general andnuclear weapons in particular. A consensus on this highpriority emerged in the first special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament and has been reiteratedever since. Egypt remains faithful to this high priority.I now turn to the Security Council. Past Assemblysessions  especially the fifty-first  witnessed protracteddebates on the reform and restructuring of the SecurityCouncil. Undoubtedly  reaching agreement on this issue isone of the main pillars on which reform of the UnitedNations must be built.In this regard  Egypt reiterates its emphasis on andcommitment to the key principles adopted at the ministerialmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi  aswell as the elements adopted by the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) Summit in Harare in connection with theCouncil's enlargement and the need for full conformity withthe relevant provisions of the Charter.Therefore  first  there should be no partial or selectiveexpansion or enlargement of the membership of theSecurity Council. Secondly  efforts at restructuring theCouncil should not be subject to any imposed time-frame.While recognizing the importance of treating this issue asa matter of urgent attention  no effort should be made todecide this issue before general agreement is reached.Thirdly  efforts should be made to rationalize the exerciseof the veto. Fourthly  the improvement of the workingmethods of the Council should be given equal importance.Fifthly  any resolution with possible Charter-amendmentimplications as to the size  the composition or the allocationof the Council seats must be adopted in strict conformitywith the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter. Sixthly it is important to study the principle of rotation and to agreeupon the eligibility criteria for it in connection with theproposed expansion in the permanent-membership category.Such an agreement could help avoid the divisions and feudsthat have begun to surface. Lastly  if there is no agreementon the expansion of permanent membership  expansionshould be limited to the non-permanent category.As to eligibility of States for permanent membershipin the Security Council  and with a view to ourcommitment to what will be agreed upon within the OAUin connection with a system of rotation  we propose thatthe criteria for eligibility should include the degree ofpresent and future economic development  historicalweight  geographic location and size of population. Theyshould also give due regard to the role played by acountry in the maintenance of global and regional peaceand security  including its ability to contribute topeacekeeping operations. Further  similar regard should begiven to such a country's endeavours to preserve theinterests of the region to which it belongs.Egypt's regional and international contributionswithin the framework of Africa  the Arab and Islamicworlds and the Middle East region  as well as among thedeveloping countries and emerging economies undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities ofpermanent membership in a new  expanded SecurityCouncil providing balanced and equitable representation.However  Egypt will remain committed to the Africanconsensus in this regard. I listened carefully to thestatement made by the Foreign Minister of Singapore  andI suggest that the points he raised should be studied andgiven due attention by the General Assembly and thecommittees working in the field of the reform andexpansion of the Security Council.The non-aligned countries called for areconsideration of the veto power  which contradicts theprinciples of democracy that must characterizecontemporary world order and prevail both among andwithin States. As a first step towards that goal  wesuggest that the use and scope of the veto power shouldbe restricted to specific actions such as those which relateto threats to international peace and security and whichare taken under Chapter VII of the Charter. We can alsoagree on excluding specific matters from the use of vetopower  such as provision to the Council of theinformation necessary for exercising its competence;humanitarian issues  including respect for instruments ofinternational humanitarian law and ceasefire resolutions;and the selection of the United Nations Secretary-General.Security Council reform and the improvement of itsworking methods require a re-evaluation of the sanctionsregimes imposed by the Council  including their routineperiodic review  their lifting and whether the regime in itscurrent form achieves the goals for which it wasinstituted. If sanctions are intended to influence thebehaviour of certain States so that they abide by15international legality  it would be only logical to amend theway these sanctions are currently implemented in order totake into account the related humanitarian aspects and thesufferings inflicted upon the peoples. And after compliance these sanctions must be lifted.In all cases  it is important to consider setting specifictime-frames for sanctions so that they do not end up being in effect  a people's punishment. Discussions in this respectunder “An Agenda for Peace” and the initial agreementreached thereon can be a viable basis for starting seriousdeliberations with a view to effecting positive changes inthe current sanctions regime.I turn now to the situation in the Middle East  wherethe peace process faces a serious crisis. The most apparentmanifestation of this crisis is that the concept  principlesand bases of the peace process are being completelyshattered and squandered. The vision spawned in thepeoples' minds of the sort of peace  as agreed upon at theUnited Nations and in Madrid  has started to dissipate.Trust has been replaced by doubt  and hope by frustrationand despair in a tomorrow where justice will materializeand peace will prevail.The peace process is based on governing principles namely the implementation of Security Council resolutions242 (1967) and 338 (1973). At the heart of these principlesare the land-for-peace formula and safeguarding the rightsof the parties according to the balance struck by theSecurity Council and affirmed at the Madrid PeaceConference. This certainly applies to the three tracks ofnegotiations between Israel on the one hand and Syria Lebanon and the Palestinians on the other. The Oslo accorddid not deviate from the same principles  nor did itchallenge their terms of reference or binding nature. On thecontrary  it led to the recognition that the Palestinian peopleare a people with legitimate national and political rights.It also recognized that the only way to establish peaceand security in the region is through peaceful coexistencebetween the Palestinian and Israeli peoples  based onequality  justice  and  of course  Israel's withdrawal fromthe occupied Arab territories and the establishment ofnormal relations between the States in the Middle East.These principles and concepts gave rise to a processof building bases for peace and its possibilities. In spite ofthe obstacles and the problems which confronted theprocess of negotiations  the credibility of the search for apeaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict still existed.This quest for peace had become a strategic choicecharacterizing the policies and orientations of the region'sGovernments  impelling the peoples of the region toenvision a future Middle East under a just andcomprehensive peace. Various methods and mechanismsfor cooperation which would enable the region to achievethe requisite levels of development and progress werediscussed. Despite the frequent diversity of views andtheir conflicting nature at certain times  that trendrepresented a healthy phenomenon: it indicated that thepeoples of the region are already convinced of the peaceconcept. The only thing that remained was how toreinvigorate the method of achieving it.Alas  confidence was lost  credibility was shaken andthe peace process lost much of its momentum. For this and for the present serious situation  the current IsraeliGovernment' policy is responsible. Settlement activities as well as Israel's reneging on agreements andcommitments reached; making a mockery of legalaccords; challenging the two sponsors of the peaceprocess; pushing for confrontation; and giving rise to anoverall feeling of despair could not but result infrustration and destruction. This will lead to a catastrophewhose responsibility  we hasten to underline here andnow  lies squarely with the current Israeli policies.This serious crisis inflicted on the peace process bythe Israeli policies was recently considered by the Councilof Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the States members ofthe League of Arab States. The Council adopted thefollowing points  which constitute a unified Arab positionon the current situation.The first point is a rejection of the IsraeliGovernment policies designed to undermine the peaceprocess  its denial of the principles and bases of thisprocess  its evasion of the implementation of thecommitments  undertakings and agreements reachedwithin the context of the peace process  and its unilateralmeasures aimed at imposing a fait accompli in Jerusalem the West Bank and the Golan  along with its aggressionagainst southern Lebanon.The second point is the upholding of a just andcomprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objectiveon the basis of the principles of the peace process  and inparticular of the relevant Security Council resolutions  theprinciple of land for peace and the attainment of thelegitimate political rights of the Palestinian people  and areaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with thisposition.16The third point reiterates that Israel's breach of theprinciples and the bases of the peace process  itsbacktracking on the commitments  undertakings andagreements reached thereon and its procrastination inimplementing these commitments have resulted in thecurrent setback of the peace process. These Israeli policieshave also led to a reconsideration of the steps takentowards Israel within the framework of the peace process.Full responsibility for this lies with the Israeli Governmentalone.Fourth  negotiations on the three bilateral tracks shouldbe resumed. On the Syrian track  negotiations should beresumed from wherever they ended. The two parties shouldcommit themselves to what has already been achieved. Onthe Lebanese track  negotiations should centre upon theimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).And on the Palestinian track  negotiations should beresumed on the basis of implementing the contractualagreements reached  including the commitments of theinterim period. Parallel to that  final status negotiationsshould start in order to lead to the Palestinian people'sexercise of their right to self-determination and to theestablishment of their independent state.Fifth  the Council welcomed the American position ascrystallized during the visit paid by the United StatesSecretary of State to the region this month. There wasconsensus regarding cooperation with United States policyas expressed by Mrs. Albright in her statement of 6 August1997 to the National Press Club in Washington. Thatpolicy  which was reiterated during her recent visit to theMiddle East and contacts with the States of the region reaffirms the terms of reference of the Madrid PeaceConference  in particular the principle of land for peace  theimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions the realization of the legitimate political rights of thePalestinian people  and the commitment to abstain fromtaking unilateral measures that undermine the permanentstatus negotiations. We stress the need to build on thispositive position on the part of the United States  and callon Israel to respond positively to it. In this context  thesteps that the Israeli Government is required to take tofoster the peace process should be within the framework ofkey issues  not that of issues of a secondary or formalisticnature.Sixth  the European role played in support of thepeace process is welcome and the importance of itsrevitalization should be stressed.Seventh  international legality in the context of theUnited Nations Security Council resolutions should beupheld and implemented.A stable and just peace must be built on a strongbasis of comprehensive security arrangements that takedue account of the apprehensions  concerns andviewpoints of all parties. This can materialize only whenIsrael accedes to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  as it is the only State in theregion that has not yet done so. We should proceedforthwith with the implementation of President HosniMubarak's initiative to free the Middle East from allweapons of mass destruction and their delivering vehicles.It is a source of regret for us that so far no practical stepshave been taken to rid our region of the threat of nuclearweapons. This might lead to the proliferation of suchweapons. Consequently  I call upon the General Assemblyand the NPT depositories to take the necessary steps toensure Israel's accession to the NPT and for the promptundertaking of serious negotiations to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  in implementationof the resolution adopted by the Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the NPT held in New Yorkin April 1995. Such a nuclear-weapon-free zone could beestablished as a first step towards ridding the Middle Eastof all weapons of mass destruction.Before concluding my remarks regarding the MiddleEast  I would like to refer to the serious situation in Iraq.I would like to highlight the importance of respectingIraq's sovereignty and of ending the suffering of itspeople. Furthermore  the islands of the United ArabEmirates should be returned  and the sovereignty of theUnited Arab Emirates over these islands should berespected. The Lockerbie issue should be brought to anend in conformity with international legality. Theterritorial integrity of the Sudan should be preserved andrespected. A settlement of the problems of Somaliashould be reached. A healthy climate for relations shouldbe created in the Middle East between States of theregion and neighbouring countries  based upon mutual andbalanced commitments along with a common interest inmaintaining positive relations for the benefit of everyone.Turning to Africa  I wish to refer to the ministerialmeeting convened by the Security Council last week toconsider the sources and causes of African conflicts andhow to contain and resolve them. As I said in mystatement before the Council  Africa has come a long wayon the road of political and economic reform. What isneeded now is to revitalize existing international17initiatives in support of development and stability in Africa.Such international support is also required to solve theproblems of refugees  enhance democratization andstrengthen regional and subregional integration. Thisrequires the fulfilment of promises by the internationalcommunity to establish a true partnership between Africa on the one hand  and the United Nations system and theinternational donor institutions on the other. This alsorequires strengthening existing cooperation between theUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity inconformity with the provisions of Chapter VIII of theCharter.Since the dawn of history  the Mediterraneandimension has been an important framework for Egypt influencing and being influenced by the centres ofcivilization and enlightenment in the region. Inasmuch asEurope — Eastern and Western — has been the mainpartner with Egypt in trade transactions  tourist flows andcultural interactions  so has Egypt been and will continueto be a major active party in ensuring stability andregulating a veritable interaction between the Europeandimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterraneandimension of European security  in the full meaning of thecomprehensive concept of contemporary security.In this context  President Hosni Mubarak in November1991 presented to the European Parliament his well-knowninitiative of establishing a framework for consultation andcooperation among the Mediterranean countries. By mid-1994  this idea was crystallized when the Ministers forForeign Affairs of 11 Mediterranean countries held inAlexandria their constituent session for the MediterraneanForum  which convened its fourth session last July inAlgiers  where the ministers unanimously agreed that theForum was a unique gathering for frank dialogue and amechanism for the formulation and testing of ideas andcoordination of positions.Through its chairmanship of the cultural workinggroup of the Mediterranean Forum  Egypt looks forward tocontributing to strengthening cultural cooperation among themember countries and stressing the common culturalfeatures of the Mediterranean personality  based upon theintegration and interaction of civilizations  rather thanconflict and confrontation between them.A similar exercise is currently under way with regardto Euro-Mediterranean interaction  in the framework of theBarcelona process. The second ministerial conference convened in Malta last April  provided a good opportunityfor frankness and an exchange of views to activate andcorrect the path of this historic process that bringstogether countries of the European Union and those of thesouth and the east of the Mediterranean. In so doing  thisprocess will truly lead to the creation of a balancedpartnership among all parties  as well as the establishmentof a common zone of peace and prosperity in theMediterranean basin.In this context  Egypt follows with keen interestcurrent developments in the Balkans  a region closelylinked to the Mediterranean region  especially with regardto developments relating to the situation in Bosnia. Egyptbelieves that the only way out of tension in that region isthat of international legality  the full and speedyimplementation of the Dayton Agreements and the tryingof war criminals  which represents an essential steptowards establishing justice and stability in this region.Egypt reaffirms its partnership with the internationalcommunity  the United Nations system and the donorinstitutions in the development and reconstruction ofBosnia in order to help heal the wounds of years of warand destruction.I should not fail to address the concerns of Egyptand other developing countries regarding a number ofchallenges accompanying the process of trade andinvestment liberalization. These challenges are manifestedin the continued pursuit by some of unilateral andarbitrary policies instead of abidance by the rules andregulations of the international trading system that we allworked so hard to adopt within the framework of theWorld Trade Organization.This is in addition to the growing trend we witnesstoday on the part of some of our trading partners whoresort to covert protectionist practices  which hide behindnoble considerations such as environmental protection respect for labour norms and human rights  in order toserve some narrow self-interests  to justify the restrictionof access to markets and to impose trade sanctions.On another plane  we should be well aware that theliberalization of investment is not a panacea for everymalaise besetting our economies. Despite our interest inattracting investments  and despite our efforts to create aclimate conducive to the flow of investments  the fact stillremains that investment agreements should strike a fairbalance between protecting the rights of the investor  onthe one hand and ensuring the rights and interests of thereceiving States  on the other.18A year ago  from this rostrum  I called for concertedefforts against attempts to marginalize the role of theUnited Nations.If we are still awaiting the development of rules ofinternational conduct under a new world order that is stillevolving  we then urgently need to ensure the survival of astrong and effective United Nations that can lead the wayfor us in this nascent world order."
"51",2169,"ERI",52,1997,"﻿Allow me at the outset  Sir to congratulate you on your election as President of thefifty-second session of the General Assembly. Eritrea joinsin the expressions of recognition of your attributes byprevious speakers. You are presiding over an Assemblysession that will be remembered for focusing not only oncrucial international issues but also on the reform of ourOrganization. While wishing you success in yourleadership  I also assure you of the full support andcooperation of the Eritrean delegation.I also seize this opportunity to pay tribute to thePermanent Representative of Malaysia  His ExcellencyAmbassador Razali Ismail  for the way he conducted thework of the fifty-first session  and to thank him for his far-sighted proposal on the reform of the Security Council.Likewise  I wish to extend sincere gratitude to the newSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan for the efficient and dynamic way he is discharging hisduties.We are meeting at a critical juncture of history. Afteralmost 50 years the dark and ominous clouds of worldconflict no longer loom threateningly over the horizon.Those grim days are over. In the last few years we havetaken great strides towards making the world safer forfuture generations.The road to disarmament has been made easier withthe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) by 146 world leaders in 1996. The world has alsoaccelerated efforts to eliminate anti-personnel landmines.More importantly  there seem to be clear indications of agreat change in values  attitudes and perceptions which willfoster the creation of cooperative relationships among theStates of the world  thus promoting new perspectives ofcommon policies to solve mutual problems.True  we should  at the same time  remember that oldand new conflicts continue to plague the world. Thus destabilizing factors such as the marginalization of nationsand peoples  transnational crimes  the use of violence andthe threat of violence as instruments of national policystill haunt our planet. In addition  old and new conflictsin Europe  Asia and Africa seem to threaten or reversethe global gains achieved in the last few years. It is hopedthat these will be the exceptions rather than the rule and as relics of the past  will be swept away in the nearfuture. In this respect  it is encouraging to note that theSecurity Council held  during the second week of theGeneral Assembly  an unprecedented ministerial meetingon the security situation in Africa. This will encourage theUnited Nations to play a more meaningful and crediblerole in supporting regional initiatives to solve regionalconflicts.Thus  perhaps for the first time  there is anopportunity to undertake a common  realistic and criticalreappraisal of our involvement in world affairs and tocome to an agreement on the role of the United Nations.The Members of the United Nations  both old and new must welcome this opportunity to demonstrate theirreadiness to tackle these new global problems and the fullintent of the contribution they can make to empower theUnited Nations to become a strong and relevant force ininternational relations.In recent years  there have been persistent requestsfor a change in the structure and mission of the UnitedNations. There is undoubtedly need for reform. The mostobvious reason is the fact that today the Organizationremains essentially the same entity that was created over50 years ago in San Francisco. Its membership has morethan tripled since then  with at least two dozen new Statesjoining since 1990. Yet  its structure remains essentiallythe same. Also  the problems that face the world are soradically different that there is a dire need for thereorganization of priorities in the Organization’s mission.Although it is true that different States  or groups ofStates  will have different perceptions of what needs to bechanged  the following are  in the opinion of mydelegation  the most important issues that must be takeninto consideration if change is to be meaningful andcredible.First  there are only two major challengesconfronting the world today: development and security.These are  of course  interdependent. It is evident thatthere will not be any development without peace. Yet without development that improves the livelihood ofpeople  the task of guaranteeing peace will be extremelydifficult. The assaults on these two problems must bemade simultaneously  and all of our actions should be9taken with an eye to solving both. Hitherto  emphasis hasbeen on security to the detriment of development  withcatastrophic results. Since the reason for this disparity namely the cold war  no longer exists  it should not be toodifficult to put a little more emphasis on development.Lately  however  there has been a growing emphasis on thepolitical rather than the economic aspects ofdevelopment — that is  on democracy and human rights.True  people everywhere are clamouring for the right to befree from dictatorships and to participate meaningfully indecisions which affect their lives  and they must be stronglysupported in this. However  it must also be realized that themeaning of human rights and democracy is beingchallenged and questioned  and they are being givendifferent interpretations. Whatever the case  any effort toapply standards of democracy and human rights  howeverdefined  will not be successful unless the root causes ofunderdevelopment and poverty are effectively addressed.Any reform of the United Nations should  therefore empower it to promote sustained economic growth indeveloping countries even more energetically. Only this willhelp to develop good governance  that is  democracy andhuman rights and stability  and will militate against inter-and intra-State conflicts.Secondly  the United Nations belongs to all of itsMembers. Thus  the increased participation of all of itsMembers in its activities is a right that must be exercisedto safeguard against the arbitrary abuse of its powers andfunctions. Such a development would enhanceimmeasurably its effectiveness as a guarantor of peace. Itis hardly possible to speak sincerely of a universalorganization whose major decisions  taken by a few  will bebinding upon the rest of the world. It is no longeracceptable to the rest of the world that a relatively smallnumber of States  even after the proposed increase ofmembership in its major decision-making organs  should  inthe name of international peace and security  dictate theagenda of the United Nations or impose a system ofinternational conduct. Indeed  it is sad to note that the samecountries that make democracy a condition in their foreignpolicies are adamant about maintaining an elite club ofStates in the consideration of Security Council membership.In any case  any future system must eschew cold-wardoctrines and principles and give equal emphasis to socialjustice. Peace and justice are interrelated and cannot bemutually exclusive. There is thus no longer any excuse todeny equitable representation in the major organs of theOrganization and undemocratically to deprive States of theopportunity to participate in the making of decisions whichwill affect their destinies and the welfare of their peoples.The United Nations will be in danger of beingmarginalized if it does not take into account the needsand aspirations of most of its Members and does not buildtrust between its Members  big and small  rich and poor weak and strong. It can build such trust and mutualconfidence only if it makes sure that democratic normsand principles are accepted and practised by all itsMembers.Thirdly  this is the age of decentralization. Wheneverpossible  therefore  the United Nations must create theappropriate modalities to enable regional organizations toassume tasks which they will be able to execute moreeffectively. To this end  the General Assembly must takethe necessary steps to ensure a relevant role for regionaland even subregional organizations  without losing itsleadership role or eliminating its support.Fourthly  the urgency of reform is recognized  but itwould be counterproductive to rush into decisions whoseimplications we shall live to regret. Those who resent theveto power of the five permanent members of theSecurity Council would be well advised to take the time and to allow others to take the necessary time  to studyissues before they make final decisions on such weightymatters.Since its independence in 1993  Eritrea hasembarked on a course of nation-building  reconstructionand renewal. In this endeavour  we were inspired by theeternal ideas of our struggle  which enshrines justice equity  human rights and equal opportunity to all including  in particular  hitherto marginalized groups.In the last six years — for we liberated our countrytwo years prior to our declaration of formalindependence — we have taken the necessary measuresto establish a regime of peace and marked stability in aregion of the world in which they have been absent forseveral decades; consolidate our profoundly democratictradition of struggle by adopting a new constitution andholding our first democratic regional elections; create adevelopment-oriented State and government structure;ensure a corruption-free society; build schools and healthfacilities in most regions of our country; and formulate aneconomic and financial policy which fosters anenvironment that encourages investment and has thusmade our country a new frontier of widely expandingopportunities. These policies have yielded good political economic and social dividends that have enabled us tolook to the future with hope and optimism.10In our foreign relations  we have been guided by twobasic principles. The first is our deep conviction that  wherethere is goodwill  all can be resolved through peacefulnegotiation without recourse to violence. A natural corollaryof this belief is the firm conviction that all States regardless of their ideological orientation  can live togetherin peace. This tenet underlies Eritrean foreign policy andhas guided its relations with all the countries of the tworegions — the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa — in whichit is located.This has enabled it to establish an exemplary  close tieof friendship with Ethiopia  our erstwhile adversary. Theseclose relations and friendship have widely manifestedthemselves over the last four years as we have coordinatedactivities in the political  economic and social fields. It hasalso helped us to defuse conflict and to arrive at a mutualagreement to resolve the conflict between us and theRepublic of Yemen over the Eritrean Hanish-Zukararchipelago on the Red Sea by the peaceful means ofarbitration. The State of Eritrea has time and again affirmedits adherence to the Agreement of principles of 21 May1996 and expressed its commitment to abide by thedecisions of the Arbitration Tribunal. Since both partieshave committed themselves to abide by the decision of theArbitration Tribunal  my Government feels that the disputeis already solved.Unfortunately  even the best of goodwill and intentionscould not help avert bad relations with our other neighbour the Sudan  which is bent on conducting a bad-neighbourpolicy  is at odds with almost all of its neighbours and withothers beyond  and has  because of its avowed policy ofexporting terrorism abroad  become an international pariah.The second pillar of Eritrean foreign policy is anunswerving devotion to justice and equity. This policyemanates from Eritrea’s subjection to the horrors ofaggression and colonization at the height of the cold war.At that time  our pleas to the United Nations and theinternational community fell on deaf ears. Because of this we are convinced that there are no substitutes for justiceand equality for the purpose of ensuring the maintenance ofpeace in the world. These  too  have influenced our searchfor friendship and cooperation with our neighbours as wellas with other States. They have also underlined our effortsto bring peace and stability to our region and to achieve anearly end to the fratricidal conflict in Somalia  a just andfair resolution of the Sudanese conflict  and thedevelopment of economic  commercial and politicalrelations among countries of the region.The conflict that has ravaged the Sudan for abouttwo decades must be brought to an end. The absence ofpeace in the Sudan has had severe consequences for mostof its neighbours. Thus  they have a substantial interest inthe restoration of lasting peace  security and stability inthe Sudan.To this end  those of its neighbours which aremembers of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment (IGAD) have  both collectively andindividually  exerted much effort during the past sevenyears to promote an inter-Sudanese peace process. Noneof the members of IGAD has an interest other thanushering in peace in the Sudan. All have favoured andencouraged dialogue  compromise and tolerance. Theywere convinced that peace could be achieved on the basisof the Declaration of Principles formulated by IGAD aftera serious assessment of the objective reality prevailing inthe country. It is regrettable that until last month theSudanese regime had done all it could to subvert thepeace process it had willingly accepted. It has nowaccepted the Declaration of Principles. We hope it willrespect its commitment and implement the provisions ofthat Declaration. If and when it does  it will bring ourinitiative to a successful conclusion and usher in peaceand stability in the Sudan.I also wish to refer to the efforts made by IGADconcerning the tragic situation which still exists inSomalia. It will be recalled that the members of IGADhave both collectively and individually expressed deepconcern that this grave situation has continued for manyyears and that no workable solution has yet been found.Many attempts to bring the concerned parties to thenegotiating table have failed. Where they have succeeded no agreement could be achieved. Where agreements havebeen reached  they have been broken soon after.In the global context  my country is fully convincedthat international cooperation is of vital importance. Toensure sustainable development  Eritrea has been engagedin fostering regional integration and internationalcooperation because it is firmly aware of the importanceof partnership in development. Eritrea believes thatpartnership can be ensured only when independence ofchoice and recognition of equality and mutuality exist.We in Eritrea are convinced that the world willbenefit from a strong  purposeful and dynamic UnitedNations. We will therefore contribute  however modestly to the creation of the conditions necessary to make it areal force which will ensure international peace and11security that is broadly defined and premised ondevelopment.We note with great interest and welcome theSecretary-General’s proposals for reform. We are studyingthem with care. We fully endorse the values and principlesunderlying the objectives of reform  as enunciated in theSecretary-General’s address to the current Assembly particularly his reference to the new paradigms ofcooperation.Today  I assure the General Assembly of ourcommitment to the United Nations and to its new principlesand purposes and its vision of a new world  as well as itssincere commitment to promoting genuine peace anddevelopment and defending the cause of small  weak Statesand vulnerable peoples. One would think that a nation likeEritrea — which had been systematically betrayed by theUnited Nations during the past four decades — would havesecond thoughts about committing itself to theOrganization. However  we always believed that there wasnothing wrong with the message of the United Nations  andwe had subscribed to it even in our days of struggle. Surelywe cannot blame the message for the shortsightedness ofthe messengers. We urge others who share our feelings tojoin us in giving the Organization the wholehearted supportit now deserves and needs if it is going to be as effectiveas we wish it to be."
"52",2215,"ESP",52,1997,"﻿Ishould like at the outset to make two imperativeacknowledgments. The first is to congratulate AmbassadorHennadiy Udovenko on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly — and to congratulate the Assembly onthe election of an insightful and experienced politician topreside over this session — which may  for many reasons prove to be an exceptional one.The second is addressed to the Secretary-General atthis first regular session convened under his mandate. Mr.Kofi Annan is a veteran of the United Nations system which explains how  in the short time since he took up thepost of Secretary-General  he has been able to submit animportant programme for the comprehensive reform of theOrganization.I wish also to state my Government’s full support ofthe statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofLuxembourg on behalf of the European Union. Spain sharesthe commitment of the European Union to the reform of theOrganization; it is specifically upon this matter that mystatement will be focused.When we speak of the reform of the Organization  wefrequently link it with the financial crisis which the UnitedNations is undergoing. Yet I consider it important todifferentiate the two questions and to emphasize that thereform process must not be seen solely as a remedy orfactor for saving the United Nations from the financialcrisis. On the one hand  the current crisis is fundamentallya crisis of payments. I shall return to this matter later on.On the other hand  the Organization’s supposed “failures”reflect the limits of cooperation in the internationalcommunity as it exists at present.The crisis is  in any case  one of growth. The UnitedNations has to adapt and do away with the bureaucraticobstacles accumulated by the Organization during thedecades of the cold war and to develop new means withwhich to tackle the complex situations it now faces.The great virtue of the reform programme introducedby the Secretary-General on 16 July is that  building on thebetter part of the thinking of recent years  it presents acomprehensive plan to adapt all sectors of the Organization.Recent experience has shown the difficulty of implementingpartial reforms. The links among the main functionsentrusted to the United Nations is becoming increasinglyclear: international peace and security can hardly bemaintained without genuine cooperation to promote thedevelopment of the world’s States and regions  andwithout respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.I should like straight away to declare Spain’sagreement with this approach and to make clear thebacking which my country is willing to give to theSecretary-General’s programme. I will now present theviews of the Spanish Government on the main aspects ofthe overall reform process.I shall begin with the reform of the SecurityCouncil. This is undoubtedly one of the most significantquestions facing us  and its success will determine if theOrganization will be able to enhance its legitimacy and itseffectiveness in maintaining international peace andsecurity in the future. The reform of the Security Councilis a most sensitive task  involving an amendment to theCharter; it must therefore be undertaken carefully  withouthaste and on the basis of the broadest possible agreement.It must promote greater cohesion among theOrganization’s Members and not create greater tensionand suspicion among them. We should not forget: poorly-done reform could bring grave repercussions for theOrganization  which could lead to an irreparable crisis ofconfidence.An increase in the number of members of theSecurity Council  and particularly of permanent members is a much more contentious issue than the improvementof the Council’s working procedures. The category ofpermanent members of the Security Council was createdin historical circumstances which no longer apply.Furthermore  the enlargement of that category couldcreate more problems than benefits. Therefore  weconsider it wisest in the present situation to limitenlargement to the category of non-permanent members.Current proposals for enlarging the permanentmembership of the Security Council introduce formulaswhich tend to meet the legitimate interests of a fewStates  but fail to resolve serious problems raised for thevast majority of Members of the Organization  and sothey cannot be positive for the United Nations as a whole.As far as the veto is concerned  aware of thedifficulty in present circumstances of achieving itselimination  we propose that it be limited to situationsinvolving Chapter VII of the Charter. In any case proposals for the creation of new permanent seats  withpostponement of discussion as to whether those seatswould or would not have the veto  are not very realistic.22The leading role acquired by the United Nations at theend of the cold war in making  maintaining andconsolidating peace is without historical precedent.Spain unreservedly supports United Nations efforts inthe maintenance of international peace and security. In thelast year  in addition to the Spanish contingents deployed inthe International Police Task Force (IPTF) and theStabilization Force (SFOR)  forces from my country haveparticipated in the United Nations Mission for theVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with theCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on HumanRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) demobilization processand in the multinational protection force for Albania  which as the Prime Minister stressed just a few minutes ago  hashelped to avoid a serious internal conflict. Spain was alsoready to participate in the multinational force for Zaire. MyGovernment is also studying ways of enhancing theOrganization’s operational readiness  particularly byincreasing its rapid deployment capabilities.While dealing with this matter  I must refer briefly tocertain situations of special interest to my Government. Thedeterioration of the situation in the Serb Republic is a causeof special concern. We must continue to give firm backingto those in the Republic who are willing to cooperate withSFOR  the High Representative and the special envoys.Sub-Saharan Africa also deserves special attention. Ofparticular concern is the serious situation which persists inthe Great Lakes region and in the Republic of Congo. Spainsupports the efforts under way to restore peace  as well asthe holding of an international conference under theauspices of the United Nations and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU). Likewise  with reference to thesituation in Angola  Spain joins the appeal to UNITA tocomply with its international commitments and to finallyallow peace to come to this country.My Government welcomes the recent agreementsreached in Houston to unblock implementation of theUnited Nations settlement plan for Western Sahara  andaccordingly wishes to congratulate Morocco and thePolisario Front. I equally wish to congratulate the PersonalEnvoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. James Baker  on theefficient mediation work he has performed. My Governmentconsiders that the holding of a referendum  freely and withinternational guarantees  in which the Sahraqui people willexercise their right to self-determination  continues to be theonly acceptable solution to this conflict. Spain  which hasalways supported the settlement plan  considers thereforethat the extension of the mandate of the United NationsMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara(MINURSO) is indispensable. My Government trusts thatthe parties will continue to demonstrate flexibility and aconstructive spirit until the referendum is held.Spain is also following developments in the MiddleEast with the greatest concern. The peace process is without a doubt  going through one of its most difficultphases. However  this dialogue is the only possiblealternative. The European Union  in particular through itsSpecial Envoy  the Spanish diplomat Miguel AngelMoratinos  is making major efforts. I should like here toreiterate the Spanish Government’s commitment to thisprocess and to restate our willingness to continue to workactively for peace and understanding among the peoplesof the region.With the signing of the Agreement on a Firm andLasting Peace in Guatemala  a process in which Spainplayed an active role in the verification of compliancewith the accords  the way has been paved to stability  thestrengthening of democratic institutions and sustainabledevelopment in Guatemala. Spain will continue to supportthis process  through practical measures such asmultilateral and bilateral cooperation.As I have already indicated  peacekeeping hasbecome a multifaceted activity. In addition to militaryactivities  it has become essential to take into account thehumanitarian consequences of conflicts. In fact  thehumanitarian role of the United Nations is increasinglylinked to peacekeeping. Spain accordingly supports theSecretary-General’s initiatives to enhance the coordinationand rapid deployment capability of the United Nationshumanitarian response through the establishment of theEmergency Relief Coordination Office.Together with my Government’s officialhumanitarian aid  I must refer here to the commitment ofSpanish civil society to such humanitarian operations  andpay tribute to all the international relief workers andmissionaries who  generously and at risk to their verylives  are deployed in war-devastated areas. Five Spanishrelief workers and four missionaries have been killed inrecent months while performing their humanitarian tasks.Spain considers that additional measures must be adoptedto protect those participating in these humanitarianmissions  and we intend to introduce a proposal to thatend during this session.Recent experience of the conflicts in the formerYugoslavia and in Rwanda has highlighted the need to23create a judicial body to prevent impunity and to facilitatereconciliation of war-torn societies and consolidate thepeace process. The creation of an international criminalcourt is thus a matter to which the Spanish Governmentattaches great importance.Concern for the protection and promotion of humanrights  which is becoming one of the Organization’sprincipal functions  underlies all these developments. As of10 December and throughout 1998 we will be celebratingthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. This will be an appropriate time to assessthe situation and to devise strategies which will allow us tocontinue to move forward in the advancement of humanrights.As pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report the United Nations human rights programme must beintegrated into the whole range of the Organization’sactivities. Spain supports the Secretary-General’s proposalto consolidate the Centre for Human Rights and the Officeof the High Commissioner for Human Rights  and stressesthe need to increase the human and financial resourcesdevoted to the human rights programme.Spain will maintain an active policy in defence ofhuman rights and will help to ensure general respect forhuman rights and for democratic principles.Another of the Organization’s major functions iscooperation for development. Spain welcomes the proposalsput forward in this area by the Secretary-General. Inparticular  I should like to stress my support for theSecretary-General’s various initiatives aimed at ensuring therelease of more funds for operational programmes.The inclusion in development cooperation activities ofother than purely economic factors — such as social andenvironmental ones — is the expression of a concept towhich the United Nations has given primary attentionthrough a number of international conferences held underits auspices. I am referring to the subject of sustainabledevelopment.I would like to underline in this respect the importancethat the Spanish Government attaches to environmentalmatters and our special interest in the problem ofdesertification  which affects Spain so directly. I wish tonote in this context that my country is presenting thecandidature of Murcia as headquarters of the permanentsecretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification. Iam convinced that Murcia would be an excellentheadquarters  and I therefore ask Members for theirsupport.The attainment of effective international cooperationin the fight against terrorism is a priority objective for myGovernment. The phenomenon of terrorism cannot becontrolled without complete and active cooperation at alllevels. The conceptual advances made in the area ofextradition that have taken place within the EuropeanUnion must be furthered in the United Nations. TheSpanish Government participates actively in thenegotiations on the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  aimed at creating aneffective tool in the fight against terrorism that isacceptable to the largest possible number of countries.Spain also supports the Declaration on Measures toEliminate International Terrorism and the Supplement tothat Declaration adopted by the Assembly at its lastsession.In this connection  I cannot fail to mention the tragicsituation in Algeria  a country which is a neighbour anda friend of Spain and which has the solidarity and supportof my Government in its battle against the plague ofterrorism. The Algerian Government can count onSpanish backing to continue resolutely the process ofpolitical reform  in order to achieve the widest possiblebase of support among the population  ensure peacefuland lasting coexistence and to eradicate terrorism.The fight against drug trafficking is also a questionof the greatest importance to Spain  and it is one thatundoubtedly has connections with terrorism andtransnational crime. My Government therefore supportsthe creation in Vienna of an international crimeprevention centre designed to reinforce the Organization’scapacity to combat these scourges.Spain is pleased with the decisive role played by theUnited Nations in disarmament and arms control. Spainwelcomes the outcome of the Oslo Conference and willbe signing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-PersonnelMines and on Their Destruction  while promotingdiscussion of this question in Geneva at the Conferenceon Disarmament.The preparation of a protocol to strengthen theBiological Weapons Convention — particularly in thefield of verification; the negotiation of a convention toban fissionable material for the manufacture of nuclearweapons; and the improvement of control and24transparency in conventional weapons: these are alsomatters of importance.The process of decolonization has without any doubtbeen one of the Organization’s greatest successes. It maytherefore seem anachronistic to refer to this matter in astatement that deals with the reform of the United Nationsand that focuses on the present and the most immediatefuture  rather than on the past. The reality  however  is thatunresolved colonial situations unfortunately continue toexist  and our Organization still has to deal with them.With regard to these situations  Spain is affecteddirectly and painfully by the question of Gibraltar. Theexistence of this colony on our territory — the colony of aState that  like Spain  belongs  to the Atlantic Alliance andto the European Union — is an anomaly and ananachronism that we are trying to resolve within the contextof the doctrine established by the United Nations. Inresolution 2353 (XXII)  and in accordance with resolution1514 (XV)  the General Assembly acknowledged that thecolonial status of Gibraltar violates Spanish territorialintegrity and that the principle of self-determinationtherefore does not apply. The territory of Gibraltar was anintegral part of Spain  and the Spaniards who lived therewere expelled when a military base was established.Pursuant to the repeated invitations made by theUnited Nations to Spain and to the United Kingdom tosettle this matter by negotiation  my Government is engagedin the search for a solution through the bilateral channelestablished in the Brussels Declaration of November 1984.The Spanish authorities have given repeated assurances thatthe legitimate interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar willbe respected. I very recently and publicly formulated a mostgenerous offer whereby  following the reincorporation ofGibraltar into Spain  the current inhabitants of the colonywould be allowed to retain the broad outlines of theirpresent economic and legal situation. We believe that thisoffer should help us advance in the bilateral negotiationswith the United Kingdom.We all agree on to the irreplaceable nature of ourOrganization and on the need to reform it. However  ourOrganization cannot prosper  nor can the reforms be put inplace  if we Member States do not comply in full with ourfinancial commitments. As the Secretary-General himselfhas pointed out  the Organization’s present financial crisisis a payments crisis. The punctual and full payment ofcontributions is an international legal obligation that shouldbe recognized by all States that respect the internationalrule of law. It is unacceptable that any Member Stateshould place conditions on these payments or on thepayment of arrears. Such a practice would lead eventuallyto the bankruptcy of the Organization we defend.As early as 1996  the European Union introduced aproposal designed to encourage States to meet theirfinancial obligations to the Organization and to establisha fairer scale of assessments. Spain hopes that thisproposal will be carefully considered at this session.The United Nations is the main international forumentrusted with maintaining international peace andsecurity  with promoting development  human rights andfundamental freedoms and with ensuring cooperationbetween States. The indispensable nature of its role hasbecome clear in recent years.Finally  I would like to restate the SpanishGovernment’s firm commitment to the purposes containedin the Charter of the United Nations and to reassert ourunshakeable determination to continue to participate in thereform process in the firm belief that  together  we will beable to adapt the United Nations to the requirements ofthe new millennium."
"53",2241,"EST",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  first of all Iwould like to congratulate you on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at this session. We wish yousuccess in this responsible task in a year that will be ofgreat importance for the Organization.I would also like to take this opportunity to expressour gratitude to the previous President of the Assembly Ambassador Ismail  who showed exceptional commitmentto the reform initiatives throughout the fifty-first session.That recently concluded session was an important steptowards a reinforced United Nations which  with itsuniversal membership  will have to be able to deal withserious problems facing the world today.We expect the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly to be a decisive landmark in the renewal andrestructuring of the United Nations — a major endeavourundertaken by Member States several years ago. In thisrespect we would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  who presented his report on this question to theGeneral Assembly on 16 July. My Government lends itsfull support to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in hisefforts. We also note with satisfaction that part of thispackage has already been implemented.Estonia is looking forward to an agreement withinthe foreseeable future concerning a response by MemberStates to the Secretary-General’s proposals. It is oursincere hope that Members will deal with this matter in aconstructive manner and that a generally acceptablescheme for reforming the United Nations will be agreedupon. We are confident that all Member States willbenefit from the reform of the Organization.I would now like to focus my address on points ofspecific relevance to present needs in the reform package.The aim of reform as a whole is to adapt the Organizationto its new challenges  to make it more effective andefficient  more manageable and modern in every way. Weare now remodelling this Organization to make itcompatible with the twenty-first century. The world haschanged — the United Nations has to change with it.Having criteria for the appraisal of performance seems tobe of crucial importance. Result-based budgeting shouldassure a strengthened linkage between intergovernmentalmandates and their efficient implementation. Enhancedcost effectiveness envisaged for 1998-1999 is also anencouraging sign.Estonia lends strong support to the idea of cuttingthe number of agenda items for future sessions. We alsofind the idea of consolidating the representation ofdifferent United Nations funds and programmes inMember States on common premises and under one flag tobe very attractive. United Nations Houses would enhancethe visibility of the Organization and provide a valuablesource of information about it and its activities. I wouldlike to note the positive experience Estonia has gathered incooperation with the local United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) country office. Many programmesvital to Estonia have materialized owing to the support ofthe UNDP. We highly appreciate this cooperation and hopethat the future United Nations House will be able to usethat valuable expertise.The financing of the United Nations is a question thatinterests all of us. Without adequate financing  theOrganization would not be able to fulfil its mandate. Thisfifty-second session of the General Assembly must assessthe impact of the Secretary-General’s proposed reforms onthe programme budget for 1998-1999 and define a newscale of assessments for its Member States. Estoniasupports the Secretary-General’s reform measures aimed atenhancing the Organization’s effectiveness and betterimplementation of its programmes by reducing excessiveand unnecessary expenditures.With regard to the new scale of assessments  Estoniawould like to see a more transparent scale based on thefundamental principle of capacity to pay to be adopted. Allmeasures should lead towards putting the Organization ona sound and predictable financial footing. We believe thatthe main prerequisite for achieving this goal is that MemberStates clear their arrears to the regular as well as to thepeacekeeping budgets. Estonia is committed to doing so.We welcome the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson former President of Ireland  to the position of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights. Estonia supports the planfor the consolidation of the Centre for Human Rights andthe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rightsinto one office. We would also like to stress the importancethat we attach to adequate financing of the Organization’shuman rights machinery.Two major events have occurred in the past year inthe field of economic and social cooperation. The first ofthem was the adoption of the Agenda for Development.Estonia shares the perception of the importance ofdevelopment issues for the United Nations. Health andeducation should also be high priorities. The second suchevent was the nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly  the aim of which was to review theimplementation of Agenda 21  the global plan of action forsustainable development adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.Although the special session acknowledged the positiveresults which have been achieved since Rio  it alsoexpressed concern over worsened overall trends forsustainable development. In this regard  we expect thefifty-second session of the General Assembly to givefurther political impetus to the implementation of themandates and tasks defined at the session.In Estonia  we believe that our task today is toprovide the present generation with the safe  good-qualityliving environment and resources needed to promote astrong and diversified economy without compromising theneeds of future generations. For that reason  over the lastfive years Estonia has signed  ratified and acceded tomore than 40 bilateral and multilateral environmentagreements and conventions. We have also established theGovernmental Commission on Sustainable Development led by the Prime Minister. Estonia is working closelywith the countries in the Baltic Sea area to develop aBaltic region sustainable development strategy.I would like to stress the importance that we attachto the consideration of economic and social issues by theGeneral Assembly. With this in view  the work of theSecond and Third Main Committees should berationalized in order to avoid any overlap and duplication.One of the central areas of the reform concernsrenewing the Security Council. This year  Member Statesmust continue efforts to achieve the goal of making theCouncil more representative and to improve its workingmethods. Estonia elaborated its position in cooperationwith a group of smaller like-minded countries. Wesupport enlargement in both existing categories. We alsoview Germany and Japan as potential new permanentmembers of the Council. The developing countries ofAsia  Africa and Latin America should also berepresented on a permanent basis.Disarmament has been one of the United Nationspriority goals since its founding. In fact  disarmamentefforts have yielded considerable progress. The conclusionof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last yearwas an important step forward.One of the important responsibilities of the UnitedNations is managing conflicts — acting rapidly in theface of crises. Peacekeeping continues to be an importantactivity of the Organization. In recent years  we havebeen witnessing a change in the role of United Nationspeacekeeping missions. United Nations peacekeepers have2been facing the challenge of dealing with internal conflictsthroughout the world.Estonia is continuing to take part in United Nationspeacekeeping. An Estonian company has recently completedits successful deployment in the United Nations InterimForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Together with Latvia andLithuania  we are looking forward to contributing abattalion of peacekeepers to the United Nationspeacekeeping operations. The battalion  called BALTBAT will be operational from the beginning of 1998. I wouldlike to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all MemberStates of the Organization that have been participating inthis project. The initial experience of Baltic peacekeepersin United Nations peacekeeping missions has shown howregional cooperation evolves into global cooperation. TheBaltic preparedness to merge as a joint battalion is anelement strengthening regional security. It proves ourreadiness to assume responsibility as well as our right tochoose our own means of security. Estonia is currentlycontributing civilian police officers and military observers.We have also joined the United Nations peacekeepingstandby arrangement.We strongly believe in the cooperation of the UnitedNations with regional organizations in all parts of theworld. Reliance on the expertise and capacities of theseorganizations would allow us to avoid duplication andallocate scarce resources in the most effective manner. Wedo have examples of fruitful cooperation with regionalentities. In Europe  we have been witnessing joint UnitedNations actions  in particular with the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation (OSCE) in Europe and with theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).We would like to note that the structure andcomposition of regional organizations is changing. TheEuropean Union and NATO are gradually opening to newmembers. This is a very important phenomenon in theprocess towards enhancing stability and security in ourregion. Estonia associates its future with full membershipin both of these organizations.In conclusion  let me express my sincere hope that onthe eve of the twenty-first century mankind is willing toreverse its classical interpretation of the past so eloquentlyexpressed at the dawn of this century by the Englishnovelist and poet Thomas Hardy:“War makes rattling good history; but Peace is poorreading.” [Thomas Hardy  The Dynasts  pt. II  SpiritSinister]"
"54",2287,"ETH",52,1997,"﻿I wish first of all tocongratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession. There is no doubt that your election to this highposition is an acknowledgment of your personal competenceand of the commitment of your country  Ukraine  to theUnited Nations and to the principles enshrined in itsCharter.I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali  who discharged his responsibilitieswith great wisdom and dedication.Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for the great efforts he is making toensure the revitalization of the United Nations. In hisreport (A/51/950) to the Assembly entitled “Renewing theUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform”  theSecretary-General has proposed measures that MemberStates may take to democratize the United Nations and toenhance its effectiveness as an instrument with which todeal with the challenges facing us as we enter the twenty-first century. I wish to assure the Secretary-General ofEthiopia’s full support for his initiative.Ethiopia strongly believes that the reform andexpansion of the Security Council  which is long overdue is at the heart of the United Nations reform process.Broad consensus has been established that the reform andexpansion of the Council must reflect the realities of theworld we live in today. The African position on the issuewas articulated at the thirty-third Summit of the Heads ofState or Government of the member States of theOrganization of African Unity  held in Harare in June thisyear. Ethiopia fully supports the African position.This annual occasion affords us the opportunity toreiterate our commitment to the United Nations  to whatit represents and to all efforts designed to address ourcommon challenges.For obvious reasons  some of the common dangers wehave faced have receded. The cold war  which bycommon consensus represented a threat to the verysurvival of humanity  is more or less behind us. Thereshould therefore be far greater opportunity today foreffective international cooperation in many spheres  andespecially for real and tangible steps towards therealization of genuine partnership in the fight againstpoverty and to enable those determined to remove theobstacles to their development to achieve their goals andfulfil the dreams and the hopes of their peoples.Peace and security can hardly be made durable andsustainable when conditions faced by the majority of12peoples in the developing countries generate hopelessnessand when deprivations suffered today are made all the morepainful because existing trends  instead of providingconsolation  promise more of the same  or worse. There isno more appropriate time than now  when we are preparingto celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  to renew our commitmentand to rededicate ourselves to the realization of full respectof human rights in all their dimensions — civil  political economic and social rights  including the right todevelopment and to be free from the shackles of poverty.For Ethiopia  the eradication of poverty and thepromotion of human rights are the cornerstones of thecountry’s development strategies and democratic reforms.In the immediate human rights programme  the FederalParliament plans to establish  as stipulated in the EthiopianFederal Constitution  a national human rights commissionand an ombudsman early next year.I wish to take this opportunity to bring to the attentionof this Assembly the fact that leading members of therepressive military regime that ruled Ethiopia in the 1970sand 1980s are being tried for war crimes and crimes againsthumanity. These public trials are the biggest sinceNuremberg. However  Ethiopian courts have been deniedthe opportunity to bring to justice all the perpetrators ofthese crimes because many of those who should be tried inEthiopia are given safe haven in other countries  incontravention of the provisions of the Convention on thePrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Wecall on the States concerned to cooperate with Ethiopia andto take appropriate measures  in accordance withinternational humanitarian law  to ensure that those who areresponsible for crimes against humanity are brought tojustice.International cooperation and the benefits that aredrawn from it  whether through bilateral or multilateralmeans  cannot be a substitute for what individual countriesmust do to ensure that sustainable development is achievedand economic growth is realized. The responsibility toextricate our countries from the miseries of poverty  in thecase of those of us to whom this applies  lies with us. Aidalone  whatever its nature or quantity  would not do  evenif it were to be made available.But it is critically important that the internationaleconomic environment evolve towards providing an evenand level playing field  most particularly for those who  forvarious reasons — whether on account of their ownmistakes or because of complex historical reasons  some ofwhich are not of their own making — have stayed behindand have failed to put their countries on a track ofsustainable development.In this regard  we cannot but admit that not enoughis being done  although much is said and promised. Theold divisions might have been consigned irrevocably tothe past  but we cannot pretend that  though we continueto talk about our common humanity and the commonvillage we occupy  the other divisions in the world arebeing addressed  let alone bridged. It would suffice just tolook at the situation of poverty in the world today and thelukewarm effort to combat and to eradicate itinternationally. The prediction that the level of povertywill continue to grow in Africa is a challenge to theinternational community  as it is a reflection of the direcondition of the continent.The need to ensure food security for all should byno means be an impossible task to achieve for the worldwe live in. Here as well  individual countries facing thisproblem have to assume their responsibility in the firstinstance  but the international community should alsohave a role to play  including in the fight againstcorruption — a disease which  as we all realize  has aninternational aspect in its grand dimension  and istherefore not amenable to solutions taken at the nationallevel alone. We in Ethiopia have made important progressover the last few years in building the basis for foodsecurity for our peoples. But  as should be obvious  noguarantee can be secured on food security as long asproduction is totally dependent  as is the case in Ethiopia on rain-fed agriculture and when for a variety of reasonsthe available water is not utilized for irrigation purposes.It is in this connection that the equitable utilizationof transboundary rivers becomes an issue that should beaccorded the utmost urgency. Regional cooperation oninternational rivers will remain impossible if calculationsbased on a zero-sum outcome favouring one side oranother govern the attitude of parties that could otherwiseobjectively benefit from even-handed cooperation. Withrespect to the question of the Nile waters  which affectsEthiopia directly and regarding which there has been noeffective cooperation among the riparians  we wish to callon those involved to commit themselves to real andgenuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-winperspective  ensuring outcomes that are fair  equitable andjust. A status quo which is unjust cannot endure; nor canit serve as a basis for building genuine cooperation.13We are fully aware that at the level of the UnitedNations  there have been a number of initiatives designedto help address the economic and social problems faced bydeveloping countries and to mitigate the effects of povertyand the impact of those conditions hindering the realizationof sustainable economic development. However  despitegood intentions  their practical implementation has alwaysbeen half-hearted and  at best  less than satisfactory andtherefore a source of disappointment. This applies to theUnited Nations Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries for the 1990s  to the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s(UN-NADAF) and to other initiatives. It is our hope thatthe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africawill not meet a similar fate.This should not be regarded as criticism aimed at theUnited Nations. The Organization has no life and noactivity of its own independent of Member States. It is weMember States that have not sufficiently seized theopportunity opened up by the end of the cold-war divisionof the world and the international tension engendered bythat state of affairs.Not only within the United Nations but in general both in the bilateral and the multilateral areas  theinternational cooperation being made available to thedeveloping world today is not commensurate with thechallenges faced by those countries  nor does it do justiceto the tremendous effort made by those countries  includingmany in Africa  to make their economies business-friendly.A growing number of countries on our continent including my own country  Ethiopia  have taken decisivemeasures to liberalize their economies  to cut Governmentspending  to institute sound macroeconomic policies and toenhance the role of the private sector and civil society.Because of these serious efforts at belt-tightening andmonetary and fiscal discipline  there have been someencouraging developments over the past four years withregard to economic growth in a number of Africancountries  including Ethiopia. In my own country  for thefirst time in more than two decades  the economy hasbegun to grow  with a growth rate of over 10 per cent ingross domestic product having been achieved in 1996. Theaverage rate of growth over the past five years has beenover 7 per cent.In the area of governance and democratization  thereis little doubt that  despite some setbacks  we in Africaseem to have made substantial progress over the past sevenor so years. These gains need to be consolidated andenriched at a pace that can realistically be sustained  inconformity with the principles of indigenous ownership.On the other hand  it would be stating the obvious tosay that our economies have been slated to go onoperating in an international economic environment thatis hardly friendly to growth and sustainable development.The obstacles are diverse  and they are the same ones aswe have been reiterating in gatherings such as this andwhenever other opportunities have presented themselves.The challenges we face involve market opportunities forour commodities  and they are also related toprotectionism  unfavourable terms of trade and thedifficulty associated with attracting a sufficient level offoreign direct investment. But most of all the challengeswe face involve issues related to the debt overhang and todebt-servicing obligations. If there is one majorimpediment to the development of countries such asEthiopia  that impediment must be identified as the debtoverhang  which continues to necessitate the diversion ofso many resources from productive activities that couldotherwise have accelerated growth and development.We cannot  of course  be oblivious to the manyproposals for debt relief and to the number of positive albeit inadequate  steps that have been taken in thisregard. We recognize and appreciate the efforts made bythe Group of 7  the latest being the steps taken and thepromises made at the Lyon Summit and since mostparticularly the promise made in connection with debt-relief measures for the Heavily Indebted Poor CountriesDebt.But even then  we cannot ignore the irony and theparadox we encounter with respect to debt relief. Moreoften than not  to qualify for some of these debt-reliefmeasures countries are expected to fulfil and meetconditions that are not absorbable even by economies thatare far more advanced.There is little doubt that one of the key prerequisitesfor sustainable economic development is ownership ofone’s economic programme. However  the conditionalitiesthat accompany debt- relief measures have beenundermining ownership  thereby causing the loss ofpossibilities of adopting policies based on a realistic andappropriate assessment of local and specific conditions.Thus  those condemned to a huge debt overhang whichhas become unbearable are faced with a Hobson’s choice:debt relief with renunciation of ownership  or ownershipwith no relief.14What we need in this day and age are genuinepartnership and international cooperation based at least oncommitments to a level playing field and to conditions thatdo not require those in the developing world to faceimpossible choices. We are indeed hopeful that some of thelatest initiatives that countries are in the process of takingbilaterally and the emerging trends encouraging renewedfocus on Africa  such as the ministerial-level meeting of theSecurity Council convened last week  will help to increasethe international community’s sensitivity to the developmentchallenges of Africa.Genuine partnership is required to make sustainabledevelopment a reality in Africa. We hope that theSecretary-General next his report to the Security Counciland the General Assembly next February  will forwardconcrete recommendations that would spare us a repetitionof past disappointments.It may not always be appropriate to see an immediatecausal link between poverty and lack of economicdevelopment  on the one hand  and conflict and lack ofsecurity  including terrorism  on the other. But there is littledoubt that the despair  hopelessness and malaise engenderedby poverty and economic and social difficulties provide thefuel for ensuring the degeneration into all-out fratricidalwar of political frictions  whatever their sources  withconsequent social breakdown and the implosion of societies.We have seen too many times that once societies haveimploded and State institutions have disintegrated  pickingup the pieces becomes extremely difficult and a nearlyimpossible task. Look at Somalia.But even so  Africa has made some progress. Thenightmare in Liberia is over  thanks to the immensesacrifices made by the members of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS). New hopeis also generated by the demise of the Mobutu regime andby the entry onto the scene of the Democratic Republic ofCongo  whose Government and people need the support andthe solidarity of the international community and of theUnited Nations. Despite some setbacks in Burundi  thecountries of the region and the facilitator  Mwalimu JuliusNyerere  continue to persevere in their efforts to help bringabout a resolution of the conflict in that country.We are pleased and encouraged that the effort beingmade by Mr. James Baker in Western Sahara is showingsome important progress  and we are hopeful that the daymay not be too far off when it will be possible to hold afree and fair referendum in Western Sahara. I wish toassociate myself with the Secretary- General incongratulating the parties to the conflict on the positiveresults they have achieved so far towards finding adurable solution to the conflict. In the same spirit  Iwould like to call on them to continue direct dialogue andto speed up the implementation of their agreements.With respect to the situation in the Middle East  weare profoundly disappointed with the increasingcomplications that the peace process has encountered. Itis our ardent hope that the confidence which had emergedearlier will be rekindled and that the troubled region willfind durable peace on the basis of justice for those towhom it has been denied and security for all.Apart from the conflict in southern Sudan  regardingwhich the member States of the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD) have continued toprovide their assistance for the peaceful resolution of theproblem and the reversals of the gains in Sierra Leoneand the Comoros  the major conflict in Africa which hasremained intractable is the one the people of Somalia arefacing. Here too  important progress has been made andthe opportunities for making a real breakthrough havebeen created which the Somalis can ill afford to squander.The framework for such a breakthrough has been madepossible by the creation of the National Salvation Council which is now preparing to hold a national reconciliationconference soon.We all recall how many resources were spent by theUnited Nations for peace in Somalia. Now  with a smallfraction of the resources and the efforts deployed earlierby the United Nations  the international community canposition itself to assist the realization of nationalreconciliation and peace in that war-torn country. Theprocess of peacemaking in Somalia is at a very criticaljuncture. The international community and the UnitedNations should not keep their distance from the effort forpeace in Somalia.The IGAD countries are determined to see to it thatthis process succeeds. The support of the Organization ofAfrican Unity and of our partners has been indispensablein this exercise  particularly in connection with the effortto ensure that those like Mr. Hussein Aideed are broughton board the peace process. It is our firm view that noone should be allowed to preempt and scuttle this process and the unequivocal support of the United Nations for theongoing peace process spearheaded by IGAD is indeedcritical at this stage.15We all recall how the proliferation of initiatives forpeace in Somalia created complications in the past andhow  as a result  it was difficult for the internationalcommunity to speak with one voice for peace in thatcountry. There is today a much improved situation which however  needs to be maintained and consolidated  forwhich close coordination between the United Nations  OAUand the IGAD countries is an absolute necessity.Since the countries of the region have been made byproximity to see no luxury in the continuing lack of centralauthority in that country  they have chosen to work on thebasis of the maxim that a less than good Government isbetter than none at all in Somalia. The consequence of theabsence of central authority in Somalia has been the growthof forces  including from outside the region  bent onensuring that chaos is continued and even expanded in thecountry and in the region — all the more reason  therefore for the United Nations and the international community todo more to help the countries of the region and IGADsucceed in the effort they are making for peace and nationalreconciliation in Somalia.In this regard  I wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the steps he has taken to revitalizethe United Nations role in Somalia and for the initiative hehas taken to find ways of maximizing the support of theinternational community and of the United Nations for theongoing peace process in Somalia. It is our hope that thesteps that will be taken on the basis of therecommendations of the Secretary-General’s Envoy willensure greater support of the international community forthe IGAD peace initiative and bring about a more effectivecoordination between the external actors. We stronglybelieve that the Secretary-General’s proposed trust fund forSomalia will go a long way towards providing support tothe peace process.In this connection  I wish also to mention theOAU/IGAD joint mission to Somalia scheduled to takeplace this month. The explicit aim of this joint mission isto make the Bossaso Reconciliation Conferencecomprehensive and all-inclusive by encouraging all partiesto participate and to convey a clear and unequivocalmessage that no group has the veto power over peace inSomalia.Our subregion  the Horn of Africa  has been one ofthe regions of the world most affected by the consequencesof war. The damage inflicted has been immense. Our regionneeds a respite and a peaceful period to make up for thelost time. Because it is a region in which deadly andprolonged wars were conducted  weapons are easilyavailable and landmines strewn all over the place. InEthiopia alone  it is estimated that there are over 1.5million anti-personnel landmines  which continue to killand maim innocent people  including women andchildren. In this connection  we attach great importance tothe adoption by the recent Oslo Conference of the drafttreaty on the ban on anti-personnel landmines. We appealto those who remain outside the Ottawa process to signthe draft convention in December this year  so that it canbe an effective instrument for getting rid of these deadlyweapons.As a founding Member of the United Nations Ethiopia has always been unreserved in fulfilling itscommitment to the Organization and in upholding theprinciples of its Charter. My country has also been abeneficiary of various programmes of the United Nationssystem. Accordingly  the increasing effectiveness of theOrganization in all areas and the realization of universalpeace and security are goals we cherish deeply.I wish to conclude by expressing the hope that theUnited Nations and the international community will notmiss the opportunities that have been created since thebeginning of this decade for fostering effectiveinternational cooperation  eradicating poverty andrealizing sustainable development in those regions of theworld that have not yet achieved it."
"55",2333,"FIN",52,1997,"﻿Let me extend to you Mr. Vice-President  my warmest congratulations on yourelection.The Foreign Minister of Luxembourg  Mr. JacquesPoos  spoke on behalf of the European Union. I fullyassociate myself with his statement.The reform of the United Nations is inevitable. Thenew imperatives of globalization and interdependencemust be recognized. Business as usual would inevitablylead to the marginalization of the United Nations in worldaffairs. I fully agree with Secretary-General Kofi Annanthat we should see these changes as an opportunity  notas a threat.Reform is in the interest of all Member States whether big or small  whether industrialized or developingcountries. Where else but at the United Nations can wedeal with the truly global issues such as the new securitythreats of uncivil society  environmental degradation violations of human rights and poverty? Given the natureof these issues  unilateral  bilateral or even regionalefforts are of course good  but not enough. Not even themost prosperous and powerful nations on earth can8successfully solve them alone. Only the United Nations hasa global mandate and global legitimacy.The Secretary-General’s proposals are well attuned toour thinking in Finland. The General Assembly shouldconsider these proposals as a coherent whole and give theSecretary-General the authority to act on them during thissession. For our part  we  the Member States  must shoulderour responsibility for those reforms that require action byGovernments.Human rights must become an integral part of allUnited Nations activities. We very much welcome theSecretary-General’s comprehensive approach in this regard.The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights next year mustproduce practical results. The celebration is an opportunityto emphasize that human rights are universal rights thatbelong to all individuals  irrespective of culture or politicalsystems. The duty of Governments is to promote  secureand protect these rights. Therefore  the internationalcommunity has the authority to deal with human rightsviolations wherever they may occur. There is no differencebetween big or small States in this respect. Europe is by nomeans an exception. The common standards must be valideverywhere. The United Nations has a unique role to playbecause of its global reach. I personally respect and supportregional arrangements and efforts to this end  but they mustbe in accordance with common United Nations standards.There is a genuine and growing demand for UnitedNations action in the field. The United Nations responsetoday is hampered by inadequate resources. I pledge myGovernment’s full support to Mary Robinson  the newlyappointed High Commissioner for Human Rights  in herimportant and challenging task.We in Finland are very serious people. We try topractise what we preach. Promoting human rights  includingminority rights  is an integral part of our domestic policyand naturally extends to foreign policy. As a new feature the Government intends to submit an annual report toParliament on the human rights situation in the world. Wehope such reports can and will contribute to a more regularand informed public debate on human rights issues.The United Nations has extensive experience in crisismanagement and peacekeeping. Lessons have been learned.One key lesson is the need to prevent emerging conflictsrapidly and coherently. Rapid decision-making is imperativeboth in the Security Council and at the national level. Oncethe political decisions are made  they should beimplemented effectively and without delay. That is whywe strongly support the establishment of a rapidlydeployable mission headquarters. Finland has contributedto it financially and is also ready to make personnelavailable. We urge the Secretary-General to establish theheadquarters without further delay.The recent local elections in Bosnia and Herzegovinawere undoubtedly a success. The implementation of theirresults is the challenge for the coming weeks and months.The Dayton peace process is advancing  but at adisappointingly slow pace. Restoring normal livingconditions will require major efforts by all the parties inthe region. The international community  the UnitedNations and other organizations will have a tremendoustask in assisting people to help themselves in thisdevastated region. The High Representative for theImplementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia andHerzegovina  Mr. Carlos Westendorp  deserves our fullsupport in securing the implementation of the Sintraagreements. There is also a need for the continuedpeacekeeping presence of the Stabilization Force (SFOR)or its successor force.Africa is the one continent most ravaged by violentconflicts and human suffering. The special session of theSecurity Council on Africa at the ministerial level istherefore a timely initiative. Crisis prevention andpeacekeeping capabilities in Africa should be developedas a priority. We welcome the efforts already under waywithin the Organization of African Unity (OAU) andother regional and subregional settings. However  theseefforts need wider international support. Finland isprepared to continue to do its part by providing assistancein training. We are also organizing in Helsinki  Finland together with the OAU  a broad-based internationalconference of non-governmental organizations to promotetheir international involvement in strengthening peace-building in Africa.In the Middle East  events over the past year havetaken a dangerous turn for the worse. Fulfilment of theobligations of the Oslo accords  and with it realimprovement in the daily lives of the Palestinians  is stillthe best hope the parties have for a just and lasting peace.A turn for the better is first and foremost for the partiesthemselves to achieve. We urge them to exercise restraintin actions and in words. Finland  together with itsEuropean Union partners  is prepared to continue to playits part in supporting the peace process  but clearly the9parties themselves must play theirs for there to be a processto support.The hopes for the peace process should not bebetrayed in the face of provocation  humiliation orfrustration. Terrorism is unacceptable. It only benefits theextremists on both sides.In disarmament  the focus is shifting from weapons ofmass destruction towards conventional arms  includingsmall arms  as so many colleagues of mine have alreadymentioned here. The suffering caused by indiscriminate useof landmines is high on the United Nations agenda  andrightly so.Finland welcomes the Ottawa convention. It is a steptowards a truly global and effective ban on anti-personnellandmines  a target which my Government stronglysupports. The Ottawa process contains a promise  but it isclear that much work is still needed. Participation in a totalban  particularly by those who are major possessors producers and exporters of these weapons  must be securedthrough negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament.Finland will continue to participate actively in theConference’s efforts to stop the further spread of anti-personnel landmines through a global and effective treaty.The positive trend in disarmament andnon-proliferation has been strengthened by the entry intoforce of the Chemical Weapons Convention and thebilateral commitments made by the Russian Federation andthe United States regarding nuclear disarmament at theHelsinki summit. To assure further progress  thesedevelopments should now be followed up by Russianratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and theSTART II agreement.Finland has consistently advocated a strong UnitedNations  mandated and capable of addressing socio-economic and development issues in an effective andcoordinated manner. In today’s world  globalization of theeconomy  trade liberalization and the information revolutionhave created an environment of interdependence. Poverty the root cause of so many other ills  can be eliminated onlythrough sustainable development.Finland  together with the other Nordic countries  haslong spoken for a more unified United Nations system  bothat Headquarters and at the country level. The Secretary-General’s proposals go in the right direction. The creationof the United Nations Development Group is an importantfirst step. Full integration at country level of all UnitedNations activities  including those of the specializedagencies  must remain the goal.The Economic and Social Council and the web oforganizations and committees operating within it need tobe united in purpose and in action. The proposed reformsdo not suffice. The coordinating role of the Councilshould be made real. To achieve this is the responsibilityof the Member States. If we do not take action  theCouncil will sink into irrelevance.Similarly  a more coherent United Nations responseis required to provide protection and humanitarianassistance to the victims of disasters  whether made byman or nature. The Emergency Relief Coordinator mustensure coherence and coordination in disaster relief. Inthat role  the Coordinator must receive the full support ofall the humanitarian agencies.On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of thisOrganization  I remember  more than 150 Heads of Stateor Government pledged their resolve to bring an end tothe United Nations financial crisis. Today  two years later only 89 Member States — I checked the figure today —have paid their dues in full and without conditions  andmany of them did so late. More than half of themembership have not. Yet there are very few MemberStates whose non-payment stems from circumstancesbeyond their control  the only waiver known to the UnitedNations Charter. Non-payment is  in our view  a seriousthreat to the future of the United Nations  not onlybecause of the unfair burden put on Member States thatdo pay  such as my country  but because it underminesthe commitment and the solidarity that we as MemberStates share towards our common Organization andamong ourselves.Finland understands the motivation behind theSecretary-General’s proposal for a revolving credit fund.However  such a fund — as we have understood it —would use voluntary contributions to cover unpaid legaldues. The United Nations might gain some respite  but sowould the countries in arrears. Finland is not opposed toexploring this proposal if others so wish and if theestablishment of such a fund is accompanied by realsanctions in case of non-payment of assessedcontributions.Yesterday  we heard the Secretary-General in hisstatement ask the Governments assembled here to makethe fifty-second session of the General Assembly a10“Reform Assembly”. This is a challenge that we and ourOrganization cannot afford to fail."
"56",2377,"FJI",52,1997,"﻿My country and mydelegation warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. Your election to this high office is a tributeboth to you and to your great country  Ukraine. I wish toassure you of my delegation's fullest cooperation duringyour tenure of office.It also gives me great pleasure to convey our profoundgratitude and appreciation to the outgoing president of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session  AmbassadorRazali Ismail of Malaysia  who presided over the sessionwith such consummate skill  expertise and diplomacy  anddistinguished himself by his firm management of thesession through his dedication to and thoroughness in thedischarge of his assignment.I am also pleased to extend our sincerestcongratulations to the new Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Kofi Annan. My delegation is convinced thatMr. Annan will make an outstanding contribution to therole and responsibilities of the United Nations ininternational affairs and to the management of theOrganization. We wish to reassure him of our fullestcooperation during his tenure of office.The greatest challenge facing our world today iseconomic development  specifically the promotion ofsustained economic growth with equitable socialdevelopment  particularly in the developing countries of theworld. For small island developing States like Fiji  and formany developing countries of the world in general  we needan international economic environment that is buttressed byeconomic justice. We need an international economicenvironment that ensures a better life in all the countries ofthe world and not in just a few. The slow pace of economicdevelopment and even the lack of such development inmany countries of the world  circumscribed by the evils ofunemployment and poverty  are threats to internationalpeace and security.This greatest challenge is growing more and moreacute as economic development is being retarded by anumber of policies  trends and unilateral actions whichpervade our world today. Our development policies  plansand programmes are being seriously eroded by difficultiesin accessing the markets of the developed countries worsening terms of trade  inadequate capital flow forinvestment  spiralling debt burdens  protectionisttendencies  ambivalence in the transfer of technologiesand exchange-rate volatility. Small countries like mine and indeed all developing nations  have no real influencein these matters  except as victims.The Charter of the United Nations calls for thepromotion of the international economic and socialadvancement of all peoples. Implicit  if not explicit  in itis embedded the principle of economic justice. AsMembers of the United Nations  we have a collectivemoral and humanitarian obligation to help and assist eachother. We have a collective duty to make our world abetter place to live in. The time has come for thedeveloped nations of the world  and all internationalorganizations which can help  to cooperate and ensurejustice by enabling developing countries in their ownefforts towards the acceleration of sustained economic andsocial development.There are a number of ways in which the developingcountries can be assisted towards achieving sustainedeconomic and social development. Developing countries even those endowed with natural resources  arehandicapped by a lack of capital to mobilize theseresources to their advantage. Developing countries needcontinuous foreign-direct-investment capital flows tostimulate and sustain economic growth. Both foreigndirect investment and private-sector investment are neededto help diversify and increase economic activities especially where industrialization is an option.Through the diversification of our economies we canproduce more for export and trade. In fact  trade is thebest means for sustained income generation anddevelopment. The present globalized international trade isideally aimed at ensuring an open  secure  equitable transparent and predictable multilateral system wherein allparticipants can benefit.The reality we face is very different from thisespoused ideal. We do not live in an ideal world  but inthe real world  where international trade is dominated bythe industrialized  developed nations. Fiji and otherdeveloping and least-developed countries of the world15have to compete for markets with industrial giants. Theinternational-trade playing field is not level  despitefrequent statements to that effect. In reality  there is noeven playing field. It is in truth marked by inequalities ofpower  influence and resources  with steep and almostinsurmountable heights constraining small nations like ours.In order for small countries like Fiji to survive and todevelop  we must be allowed to retain special arrangementsfor our essential exports  which give our people social andeconomic security.My country firmly believes that globalization is thephenomenon of today's international trade. Thetransformation of international trade rules from the UruguayRound to the World Trade Organization (WTO) has beenmarked by rapid changes that can marginalize smalldeveloping countries like mine.The appellate body of the WTO has significantlynarrowed the scope of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT)/WTO waiver to the EuropeanCommunity in respect of the Lomé Convention. Fiji isamong other African  Caribbean and Pacific countrieswhich will be adversely affected by these new arrangementsif the arrangements of the Lomé Conventions are eroded.Furthermore  it has opened up room for policies andactions  leaving weak developing countries unprotected andexposed to economic stagnation.While the WTO is insisting on a level-playing-fieldapproach  peculiarities that pose problems for small islanddeveloping countries persist. As for Fiji  our smallness remoteness and inaccessibility to foreign markets remainour biggest hurdles in international trade. Annual naturaldisasters  a consequence of the climatic conditions in ourlocation  continue to be a big drain on the Government'ssavings in terms of rehabilitation projects. Such angryseasonal visitations of nature can wreak havoc on budgetplans and our scarce resources.Small island States like Fiji have a very limited rangeand volume of exports and they cannot and will notdominate and overwhelm any sector of trade commodities.In that context  my delegation is extremely disappointed atthe recent decision of the World Trade Organization appealbody against banana exports from Caribbean countries tothe European Union.We are not asking for favours. We are merely makinga plea for a sensible and reasonable transition period toenable us to adjust. This cannot be done overnight; thus special arrangements must remain to allow us theopportunity to find means for accommodation andreplacement.The blind pursuit of free trade  resulting in direconsequences for small nations and leading to the loss ofother fundamental freedoms  will not serve the purposesof eradicating poverty and eliminating social andeconomic inequalities. We seek an equality of opportunityin a world dominated by inequalities of resources andeconomic might.The World Trade Organization must bring a sense ofequity and justice in its deliberations and decisions  andconsciously eschew paths which disadvantage even furtheralready disadvantaged developing nations. We seek anequality of understanding for the position of the weak andthe small. We seek the creation of genuine freedom intrade  for trade remains the best means for sustaineddevelopment for developing nations.The access of developing countries to new environmentally sound technologies is also pivotal toeconomic development and sustained economic growth.There is a need for developing countries like Fiji toparticipate in  benefit from and contribute to the rapidadvances in the technologies of developed  industrializedcountries. Developing countries should be facilitatedaccess to reliable information on environmentally soundtechnologies and helped in institutional development andcapacity-building to accommodate the transfer of suchtechnologies. Accessibility to knowledge for developmentis a right  the right of all nations  not merely of apowerful few to retain as a monopoly for their ownselfish ends.Official development assistance is an importantcatalyst for development  yet its value remains unrealized.Only four countries have met or surpassed the officialdevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product. A renewed commitment to this target isessential in order to fulfil the imperatives established bythe Charter of the United Nations. At this stage of ourdevelopment  it is a much needed catalyst to our ownefforts.External debt repayments continue to be a majorconstraint on economic development and sustainedeconomic growth in major developing countries.Burdensome debt repayments not only cause economicdevelopment to stagnate  but stifle social development aswell. I call for the adoption of an effective and equitabledevelopment-oriented solution to the debt problem  so that16it ceases to be a burden yet remains a useful tool forsustained development.I have emphasized economic growth for sustaineddevelopment as the direction we must pursue. My countryand Government are fully committed to this goal. Yet  foreconomic growth to be sustainable  as well as beneficialand of quality  the environmental factor must be brought tothe forefront in all our development efforts.Despite the convening of the recent special session ofthe General Assembly for the purpose of an overall reviewof the implementation of Agenda 21  there are still no clearcommitments on the part of many developed countries towork towards achieving such environmental goals as  forinstance  the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions tointernationally specified levels. The South Pacific Forumisland countries are among the most vulnerable to climatechange in terms of sea level rise and global warming. It istherefore imperative that all members of the internationalcommunity should strive for a firm political commitmentbefore the next Kyoto Conference  to adopt a strongerprotocol to strengthen the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change.In this connection  my delegation joins others inexpressing our appreciation to the private sector and civilsociety for the supportive interest they have shown in thesearch for an acceptable international solution to suchglobal concerns. A most welcome demonstration of this isthe recent donation of $1 billion by the Turner Foundationin support of certain crucial activities of the United Nations.We need more of such assistance to further sustain andstrengthen the work of the United Nations in achieving itstargets.I would now like to turn my attention to the issue ofinternational security. Today we are witnessing a mostsignificant period of change in our world  a change whichbodes well for permanent and lasting peace and security.The cold war has been over for some time now and thetensions and threats to peace and security which itgenerated are behind us. As a consequence  and with theadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT)  we have moved a step further towards nucleardisarmament. While this is gratifying  there is much moreto be done to achieve the objective of our Organization toturn our swords into ploughshares and our spears intopruning hooks.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty hasadded to the impressive list of political and legalinstruments intended to de-escalate the production andstockpiling of nuclear weapons. We have come a longway in our efforts to prevent a nuclear holocaust on ourplanet  but the existence and improvement of nuclearweapons still leaves the threat over us. The currentinternational situation creates a favourable condition forthe international community  and particularly nuclear-weapon States  to take steps towards eliminating nuclearweapons from our planet. While the CTBT is a step inthe right direction  it lacks a clear time-frame for theremoval of all nuclear weapons from our midst.My delegation urges the international community tobegin negotiations as soon as possible on a treaty to haltand prohibit  with acceptable verification  the productionand development of all nuclear weapons. My delegationfurther urges the nuclear-weapon States to destroy allstockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons  withacceptable international verification  and thereby rid theworld of nuclear weapons  once and for all.My delegation warmly welcomes the finalization inOslo last week of a draft treaty prohibiting thedevelopment  production  acquisition  stockpiling retaining or transferring of anti-personnel landmines. Wecall on all nations of the world to sign and ratify thetreaty.In the achievement of all these objectives  whetherthey relate to sustained development or disarmament  theUnited Nations has a crucial role. It must possess adynamism to be effective. It cannot be cumbersome unwieldy and partial. To meet new challenges  the UnitedNations must be streamlined. A meaningful internationalorganization such as ours must adapt to changes enhancing its relevance and competence. The entireinternational community  including my country  has beencalling for the reform of the United Nations. It has takensome time  but at last our new Secretary-General haspresented his recommendations for a restructuredOrganization that can carry us over the threshold into thenew millennium. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive  constructive and coherentrecommendations.My delegation will carefully study the bold and far-reaching recommendations for reform  and we endorse theproposals in principle. I make a plea that in theimplementation of these reforms there must also bepositive benefits for the small Member States  includingtheir increased participation in the United Nations system.I am particularly pleased that the Secretary-General has17identified economic and social affairs  as well asdevelopment cooperation  as core activities. His proposalsare congruent with the high priority which my delegationplaces on economic growth for sustained development. Ihave already stated that the United Nations must play aconstructive and catalytic role  within its macroeconomicpolicies to facilitate economic growth for sustaineddevelopment  thereby enabling developing countries  whichconstitute the vast majority of the Members of theOrganization  to have an equal share in the opportunities forwealth creation.I fully support the submission that peacekeeping willremain an indispensable instrument of the United Nations.My country  small though it is  has played its part ininternational peacekeeping programmes in virtually everytheatre of the world since we joined the United Nations in1970. In fact  in terms of size of population  Fiji ispresently among the largest troop contributors to UnitedNations peacekeeping programmes. In the process  severalof our peacekeepers have lost their lives. But as a nationwe remain committed to the goal of permanent and lastingpeace in our world. I might add here that it is a cause ofgreat pride  but pride tempered with humility  that one ofour nationals  Major-General Jioje Konrote  has beenappointed Force Commander of the United Nations InterimForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). It reflects the degree andextent of the commitment of our small nation of fewer thana million people towards the peace and security of ourworld.The proposals for the reform of the United Nationsencompass new management and efficiency measures whichshould reduce administrative costs  but the financialpredicament of our Organization will not be resolvedentirely by cost-cutting measures. It can be resolved ifMember countries pay their contributions promptly. We callon all Member States which are in arrears to settle thosearrears promptly  fully and without conditions.As we press ahead with the reform of the UnitedNations  it becomes incumbent on us to ensure that thisextends to the Security Council. My country continues toadvocate that the Security Council should be expanded toreflect an equitable geographical distribution  taking intoaccount the substantial increase in the membership of theUnited Nations. Reforms affecting the Security Councilshould encompass opportunity for participation in itsdecisions  transparency in its work  a constructiverelationship with the General Assembly and the limitedscope and use of the veto power.On the issue of expansion  my country wishes toreiterate the recommendation it made to the GeneralAssembly last November with regard to the membershipof the Security Council  especially its non-permanentmembership. We strongly favour an equitable and widerrepresentation of non-permanent members  by whichregions and subregions would adopt a rotation system including a prohibition on immediate re-election.I further submit that in the same way that theCaribbean forms a special subregion of the LatinAmerican Group  the South Pacific region comprising 14independent island States  eight of which are members ofthe United Nations  and Australia and New Zealand should become a special subregion  ensuring continuousmembership from our region.These changes are prerequisites for a dynamicUnited Nations with credibility in the next millennium.Now more than ever  our international communityneeds a system of preventive diplomacy that can respondpromptly  positively and peacefully to potential conflictsand threats of genocide. My country continues to call fora special United Nations division or unit to undertakepreventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and conflictresolution. The division should have the capacity toreceive  collate  analyze and interpret intelligenceinformation and reports  with a view to early detection ofpotential conflicts and early reaction to minimize  containand resolve such conflicts in collaboration with therelevant Member States. May I reiterate that in such adivision  adequate representation of skills and expertisefrom small States must be mandatory  for the divisionmust not become a device or a creature of the powerfulto impose their will on their own terms.Speaking as the head of Government of a smallisland developing country  I totally support the principleof capacity to pay as a fundamental criterion and a firmbenchmark on which the contribution of membercountries to the United Nations should be assessed. Mycountry therefore fully supports the recommendation ofthe Committee on Contributions that the scale ofassessments for all Member States whose share ofadjusted national income is below the current floor rate of0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share ofadjusted income. We also support the recommendedminimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent. We furtherurge that the ceiling should not be lowered any furtherbecause a reduction will negate the effect of reducing therecommended minimum floor rate.18My delegation supports the establishment of aninternational criminal court. Recent crimes againsthumanity  including genocide  have made it incumbent onthe international community to take stern action againstthose who perpetrate such heinous acts. It is our sincerehope that the current efforts by the international communitywill be crowned with success and that come next year weshall be in a position to adopt a treaty establishing theinternational criminal court.My country strongly emphasizes that the protectionand security of small States should remain a central concernof the United Nations. Increasingly  elected Governmentsand the sovereignty and security of their States arethreatened by transnational networks of crime  narcotics money-laundering and terrorism. These scourges areexpanding  and international cooperation and action areessential to counter them.The Middle East continues to be a cauldron aboil withconflict  tension  violence and early death  the latter sadlyreaching tragic proportions since last year's session of theGeneral Assembly. We call upon all parties involved toengage in genuine negotiations towards a just and lastingpeace in the Middle East. We call upon the internationalcommunity  too  to contribute towards a just and lastingpeace.Last year  I commended both the People's Republic ofChina and Taiwan for their efforts toward reconciling theirdifferences. I wish to renew my plea to them to worktowards unity. We in Fiji enjoy excellent relations withboth of them  though we adhere firmly to our One Chinapolicy. We in the Pacific continue to enjoy their generosityand their concern for the welfare of the people of the SouthPacific. Both the People's Republic of China and Taiwanenjoy our friendship and trust. Fiji and the other 15 membercountries of the South Pacific Forum welcome theirparticipation in the annual post-Forum dialogue andconsultation with each of them. It is our fervent wish thatthey will  together  find a solution for their common future.Likewise  I urge South and North Korea to negotiatea solution that will bring lasting peace and unity to thepeople of Korea.Fiji is an oceanic State. As in many island countries our progress and development depend as much on our landterritory as on the sea around us. We are  therefore concerned that the seas are utilized in a manner that isenvironmentally sound and that the development of marineresources is orderly and sustainable so that they can servethe present and future generations. We insist on thisapproach at the national level and strongly support similarefforts at regional and global levels.In the past decade  our region has adopted a numberof treaties and declarations that address the issue of bettermanagement of oceans. More recently  following adecision of the heads of Governments of the South PacificForum  the region has taken the initiative to negotiatewith distant-water fishing States the establishment of aregional fisheries management organization in order togive effect to the provisions of the 1982 Convention onthe Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to theConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocksand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. This is an importantinitiative which is designed to promote sustainable use ofthe region's valuable fish resources to the benefit of boththe coastal States and distant-water fishing nations. Welook forward to a successful outcome to thesenegotiations.As Fiji was the first State to ratify the Conventionon the Law of the Sea  in 1982  I feel gratified that thanks to the efforts of many  including my own country in resolving the outstanding problems  the Conventiontoday enjoys universal support and near universalparticipation.All States benefit from the stability and certainty thathas been achieved in the new regime of the Law of theSea. By defining the jurisdiction of States in marine areas and by setting out the rights and duties of States  theConvention represents an important contribution tointernational peace and security.The institutions established under the Convention namely the International Seabed Authority and theInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  and thework being done with respect to the oceans in the UnitedNations itself  require the support of the internationalcommunity if the achievements of the Convention are tobe consolidated and its promise of benefits to the peoplesof the world is to be realized.Last year  I lent my strong support to an earlyadoption of the draft United Nations declaration of therights of indigenous peoples. I renew my call here.We are informed in the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme's Human Development Report 1997 about thebleak future for indigenous people in almost all societieswhere they are to be found. It is a great tragedy indeed19that indigenous people have seen their values and customsdestroyed by incoming population. They face discriminationin employment and disparities in education and they fareworse in the non-income dimensions of poverty.The observation of the International Decade of theWorld's Indigenous People  the programme of activitiesassociated with it and the efforts of the internationalcommunity to prepare a draft United Nations declaration onthe rights of indigenous peoples  will mean little or nothingif the indigenous people remain a disadvantaged people inour world. The United Nations Voluntary Fund forIndigenous Populations  however meaningful  is a meredrop in the ocean of what is required to really facilitate thedevelopment of the indigenous people. The World Bankprogramme to assist indigenous people is too limited inscope and application. The Member States of the UnitedNations and the international community should do more.The survival of the indigenous people is at stake.My own country is the home of two indigenousgroups  Fijians and Rotumans  but it is also the home ofothers who came into our country more recently. Thesenewcomers represent nearly half the population of mycountry. A major challenge for us has been to accommodatethe interests and aspirations of these citizens and toreconcile them with the sensibilities  perceptions andpre-eminent status of our indigenous people. We areensuring peaceful co-existence and cooperation withsecurity and respect for the fundamental rights of all ourcitizens.It gives me great pleasure to address briefly recentdevelopments in my own country  Fiji  before thisAssembly. Our delegation has kept the Assembly up to datewith political developments in our country  in particular ourefforts to formulate a new Constitution that is acceptable toall the ethnic communities in the country. Our currentConstitution  the 1990 Constitution  was promulgated tosecure adequate representation in Parliament for theindigenous people in order to guarantee  protect andenhance their future in their country. That Constitution wasreviewed by a Commission last year. Following thesubmission of the report of the commission  a ParliamentarySelect Committee comprising representatives of all thepolitical parties in our Parliament gave due consideration tothe report and reached a consensus to amend the 1990Constitution. The changes were written into the ConstitutionAmendment Bill of 1997 which was unanimously approvedby the House of Representatives and the Senate and signedinto law by our President on 25 July 1997. The amendedConstitution comes into effect on 27 July 1998.I do not intend to provide all of the details of thenew Constitution  except to say that it contains anentrenched Bill of Rights guaranteeing and protecting theequal rights and fundamental freedoms of all individualsand groups  irrespective of race  religion  gender oreconomic status. In addition to an independent judiciary citizens will also have recourse to an ombudsman and ahuman rights commission in the protection of their basicrights. The Constitution continues to enshrine the fullright of self-determination of the indigenous Fijian andRotuman people  including their right to maintain aseparate system of administration to safeguard theirinterests and welfare.A unique feature of the Constitution is the inclusionof a Compact which recognizes certain principles including the following: the preservation of the ownershipof land  including the ownership of indigenous Fijian landaccording to Fijian custom; the right of all persons topractice their religion freely and to retain their language culture and tradition; and a commitment by all politicalparties and their leaders to cooperate in the formation ofa broadly based Government to ensure that the interestsof all communities in Fiji's multi-ethnic and multi-culturalsociety are taken fully into account.Indeed  an innovative feature of our newConstitution is the provision for the formation of a multi-party Government. This is to allow for the representationin Cabinet of all political parties that secure seats inParliament through general elections. We have nodoubt - in fact  we are very confident - that with thecommitment  goodwill and cooperation of all  thispioneering approach of bringing all communities togetherin national decision-making  in government and inParliament  is the best way of consolidating andpromoting enduring peace  unity and progress in our littlecountry of Fiji. From our ethnic and cultural diversity  weare determined to build a strong nation with the fullparticipation of all citizens and communities in it.We are the world. We who are gathered hererepresent the Governments and peoples of the world. Wehave it in our power to facilitate economic developmentand sustained economic growth that include the full andequal participation of the developing countries of theworld. Let us make it an international imperative.Today I call on all of us to rededicate ourselvesanew to our commitment to the United Nations. Upon thehigh principles of mutual love  justice and care on whichit was established  let us together make our world a betterplace in which to live."
"57",2424,"FRA",52,1997,"﻿May I first say  Sir  how pleased my country is at yourelection as President of the fifty-second session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. I should also like to sayto the Secretary-General that France welcomes the action hehas already taken and assure him that he has our supportand confidence.I shall begin my statement by expressing a convictionon behalf of my country: the world needs the UnitedNations more than ever. No  the United Nations did notlose its raison d'être with the end of the cold war  the endof the arms race between the two blocs and the head-onclash of differing ideologies.On the contrary  the need for a universal regulatingbody has never been so apparent. The reasons are known toall. Without regret  we left the era of bipolar confrontationto enter  in 1991  a new  global  evolving world in which185 States cooperate  make alliances with one another orcompete in stable or  conversely  unstable combinations.In this world  States are no longer the sole players. Thegiant conglomerates  the financial markets  the media opinion groups and non-governmental organizations allplay an increasing role. Because of this  there is anoverriding need for clear  fair and predictable groundrules to establish a framework for settling conflicts ormere differences. For  nowadays  no serious problem canbe resolved by one country  even the most powerful entirely on its own.Unless we take care  unless we manage to build aworld in which the rule of law prevails among all States a world in equilibrium between its major centres ofpower  other scenarios will ensue: the absence of acounterweight will encourage the predominance of asingle Power  and  inevitably  that Power will be temptedto engage in unilateralism; for want of organized regionalentities  globalization will exacerbate the economic — andsometimes political — struggle of each against all; Stateswill find themselves further weakened  and some willimplode under the effects of aggressive nationalism which is often contagious. Fierce competition will rendervirtually impossible environmental conservation  howeverurgent  however vital in the true meaning of the word  aswell as the fight against drugs and crime; greater respectfor human rights will be compromised.Our common task must be to forestall such dangersand  at the same time  to consolidate  together  theachievements of recent years. For this  regional groupingsare one of the best possible foundations. Europe  whichhas been the crucible of so many wars  has been showingthe way for half a century. The growth rates achieved bymany countries in Asia  in Latin America and now inAfrica  announce the emergence of new centres of powerand prosperity. Political and economic entities are beingorganized and institutionalized: South-East Asia meets inthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN);in Latin America  the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR) is developing  as are the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) in southern Africa andthe Economic Community of West African States19(ECOWAS) in the west of that continent. To some extent one might also include cultural and political entities  suchas the Commonwealth and la Francophonie. This is asensible way to adapt to globalization.However  at the global level we need a coherent effective United Nations with the resources necessary tocarry out its missions. It is the task of this body to facilitatethe smooth organization of international relations and todetermine universally recognized rules of law. To be sure other organizations exist in various sectors  and these havetheir own  very important areas of authority. But none ofthem can take the place of the United Nations in giving theworld of tomorrow a set of comprehensive rules. True to itstradition  France will support all the Organization's effortsto that end.I come now to the main object of the session which isbeginning. To carry out the major role we expect of it  theUnited Nations must retain or reacquire the means to takedecisions and to act. For this  we must resolve two matters:United Nations reform and the financing of theOrganization. The ability of the United Nations to act in theyears ahead will depend on the solutions we find together.France approved of the move by the new Secretary-General at the outset of his mandate to continue the studyinitiated by his predecessor  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.The main lines Mr. Kofi Annan has proposed for the workand the impetus he has given to the process of revampingthe Organization have received France’s full support  asupport shared by France’s partners in the European Union.The remarks made from this rostrum by its currentPresident  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg illustrate this. I should like to comment more specificallyon three points: the Security Council  financial reform andrestructuring.The current composition of the Security Council nolonger accurately reflects the political geography of today’sworld. Clearly  it has to be reformed — that is to say enlarged — to become more representative.In this connection  we must take into account theSecurity Council’s indispensable role in peacekeeping andthus elect countries able to contribute to this task  whetherthey are from the North or the South.Accordingly  my country is in favour of the accessionof Germany  Japan and three countries from the South topermanent seats and the establishment of newnon-permanent seats. For a Security Council composedsolely of the principal countries of the North would notbe representative. Nor should we forget that  once it isenlarged  and hence more representative  the Council willstill have to be effective. That is essential.The proposals that have been submitted to us shouldmake it possible to move forward. However  we are allaware that no consensus has yet been reached and thatdebates on this matter will be difficult. National interestsand the concerns of regional groups must be given dueconsideration. In any event  I welcome President Razali’sperseverance throughout the fifty-first session of theUnited Nations General Assembly  which made it possibleto draft a solid working basis from which we must nowproceed to work to find a solution.Furthermore  financial reform of the United Nationsis a particularly complex issue. It is shocking that theUnited Nations should be in a precarious state andtherefore in a situation of financial and budgetarydependence with respect to its debtors. I believe that wewill be able to move towards a solution on the basis ofthree principles: what is owed to the United Nations mustbe paid in full  on time and without conditions. Finally the payment of contributions should not be a way ofexerting pressure on the Secretary-General and the otherMember States.With these rudimentary principles as a basis  Franceis open to discussion on all aspects of the problem. Wewill have to decide on the scale for apportioningassessments among all States. There is no perfect scale but some are not as bad as others. The concept of eachState’s ability to pay  which has enjoyed consensus sincethe outset  still seems simple  logical and fair today. Onthat basis  a solution can be found that takes account ofthe needs and interests of each State. France will do itsutmost to facilitate the settlement of the financial crisis.We can be both imaginative and conciliatory — like theEuropean Union’s plan. But our efforts will succeed onlyif there is respect for the rules I have just recalled  whichreflect our Organization's impartiality and credibility. Ifthe United Nations were forced to comply with theunilateral demands of one among us  in regard both to itsfinancing and its functioning  then how could it convinceanyone in the future that it is impartial and faithful to theprinciple of the equality of all under the Charter  andgenerate respect for its decisions?I come now to restructuring. The Secretary-Generalhas undertaken to restructure and regroup theOrganization’s institutions. France appreciates the logic of20this approach. It therefore welcomes the establishment inVienna of a centre to deal specifically with combating newtransnational dangers such as organized crime  drugtrafficking and terrorism  problems that we must fight withever-increased vigour. It is also very much in favour ofintegrating the Office of the High Commissioner for HumanRights and the Centre for Human Rights into a single entityin Geneva where the main humanitarian aid services arealready established. It also hopes that the main issuesinvolving disarmament can continue to be addressed inGeneva.From this rostrum  I applaud the appointment ofMrs. Mary Robinson to the post of High Commissioner forHuman Rights. Her very strong personality iscommensurate with the challenges her task entails. Thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  starting on 10 December thisyear  will provide an opportunity to reaffirm  in the face ofpersistent violations and ever-recurring acts of barbarism the universality of these rights. But we will also have to askourselves  in addition to making the usual declarations thatare still necessary  what political and economic actions areneeded to make real headway  in specific situations towards respect for human rights  and how the emergenceof democracies can be encouraged from outside.The United Nations  while adapting  must remain thepreferred instrument for taking action in the interests ofpeace. At this time  the United Nations is really the onlyorganization that can try to bring order to an internationalsociety which is becoming fragmented and globalized at thesame time. The United Nations is faced with both aresurgence of every kind of micro-nationalism and thestrengthening of regional entities. Most conflicts are nownot between States but within them. Given these newchallenges  the United Nations has already demonstratedhow adaptable and flexible it is. But we must continue. Toensure the lasting settlement of conflicts  consciences haveto be assuaged and justice needs to be done to put an endto the endless cycle of revenge. The perpetrators of themost serious crimes must be tried impartially  with respectfor the rights of the defence  and after an exemplaryinvestigation which reveals the facts in full. This is whyFrance supports the action of the international criminaltribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  and hopesthat the forthcoming conference on an international criminalcourt will be a success.Since the beginning of the decade  the Organization’sactions to promote peace and international stability havechanged radically. The time has passed when large-scalepeacekeeping operations were mounted solely under theblue flag of the United Nations  in Cambodia and theformer Yugoslavia for example  in order to take onmassive challenges alone. Today  the United Nationsintervenes more and more frequently in conjunction withother organizations or by authorizing the action ofregional actors. In Europe  the United Nations is poolingits efforts with those of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization in sensitive theatres of operation  and evenwith those of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe. In Africa  for the first time  theSecretaries-General of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) have in the pastyear appointed a joint special representative in the personof Ambassador Sahnoun  in the Great Lakes region. It isgood that these two organizations are working together.This development must be encouraged. We must also helpAfrican States and organizations to strengthen their ownpeacekeeping capabilities. To this end  countries outsidethe African continent must pool their efforts and notmultiply the number of rival and sometimes redundantinitiatives. For instance  the Government of France  theUnited Kingdom and the United States recently agreed toact together with all those who wish to do so tostrengthen the peacekeeping capabilities of Africancountries  under the auspices of the United Nations  ofcourse  and in cooperation with the OAU.But  in France's view  encouraging Africa to becomemore involved in resolving crises certainly does not meanthat the international community should relinquish itsother responsibilities with regard to the African continent.It is therefore essential that the United Nations be ready once the declared conditions are met  to act in Congo-Brazzaville. By the same token  the many recent tragediesin the Great Lakes region make sustained internationalinvolvement indispensable. This United Nationscommitment to promote peace and development must alsoserve to further human rights. That is why it is importantfor the humanitarian investigative task force in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo to be able to carry outits mission. I might add that by spending too much timetalking about crises in Africa  one might forget theessential point  namely that the African continent is takingoff in quite an unprecedented way. My country believesin this.We are all still mobilized by the situation in theMiddle East. The peace process  set in train on theinitiative of clear-sighted and courageous men on bothsides  raised tremendous hopes. We can clearly see theincreasingly tragic consequences to which the current21stalemate would lead  were it to last. The peoples of thisregion are once again stuck in an impasse  in a situation ofhumiliation  resentment  and the fear of terrorism. Newefforts are therefore necessary so that these two peoples Israeli and Palestinian  which are matched in terms ofinsecurity and fear of the future  can together find justiceand security. France gave its full support to the action bythe American Secretary of State  who recently went to theMiddle East. Indeed  the United States has a specialresponsibility and special means to attempt to reinvigoratethe peace process and effectively combat the deadly acts ofextremism. France and Europe are ready to take part in anyconstructive move to this end.What can the United Nations do? It cannot take theplace of the parties concerned  which have the primaryresponsibility. It is up to the Organization to state  orrestate  the law and to recall the principles which must bethe basis for any peace if we want it to last. I refer here tothe resolutions adopted by the Security Council on theconflict in the Middle East  not forgetting resolution 425(1978)  which deals with the integrity of Lebanon inparticular.Many other crisis situations where the wounds havenot healed could be mentioned from this rostrum — sodiverse is the work of the United Nations. In particular  Iam thinking of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina where security has been restored but where the constructionof a State with viable democratic institutions remainsuncertain; and of Albania  where the new stability  thanksto resolute European action authorized by the UnitedNations  is giving rise to new hopes. I am also thinking ofthe tenacious efforts of the United Nations to contain ordefuse the crises in Haiti  Cyprus  Georgia  Afghanistan Tajikistan and elsewhere.Finally  let us not forget  now or ever  much-neededdevelopment assistance.Of course  the insertion of emerging economies including the former underdeveloped economies  into theglobal economy is an excellent thing; indeed  past efforts inthis regard have proved to be well founded. But this mustnot be a selfish excuse for the rich countries to give uptheir effort to provide development assistance  which isequally necessary. In any event  this is very much animperative for the leaders of the member States of theFrancophone community. The summit of these States inHanoi in November will attest to their interest in morebalanced development and also to their commitment torespecting the multiplicity of cultures and languages.I will say no more  however — other than to drawone single conclusion. While the world has changed somuch over the past 50 years  and even more over the pastsix years  its inhabitants still voice the same needs. Therule of law must be continually consolidated and thedemocratic ideal put into practice  faced as we are withthe temptations of oppression and the use of force  forwhich new pretexts are constantly being invoked. Howcan we be sure that the factors that make for war andchaos are banned for ever from all continents  includingEurope?At this moment of our Organization's reform  let usnot forget the lessons of history. Only internationaldialogue  the common management of crises  beginningwith their prevention  and the wise conservation of theearth’s resources make it possible for the voice of reasonand peace to prevail and for confidence in progress to berebuilt. The United Nations is the right and the onlylegitimate forum for such international discussions  andthe only one where they are universal. Our Organizationis an irreplaceable framework and a vital necessity for usall. In the past  it has often been able to deter  address resolve and prevent. Let us reform it so as to make iteven more useful."
"58",2492,"GAB",52,1997,"﻿At the outset I should like to convey to you  Sir  thewarm congratulations of the Government of Gabon and ofmy delegation on your outstanding election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. Ishould also like to congratulate the other members of theBureau.In selecting you  Mr. President  our Assemblyacknowledged your country’s role in world politics and above all  your personal qualities  which augur well forthe success of this session. I am indeed convinced thatunder your guidance our work will be directed towardscontinuing our discussions in greater depth  takingcommon positions on important issues and adoptingresolutions with the broadest possible consensus.14I should like to express our appreciation to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Razali  for the excellentwork he did during his presidency.This is also the first opportunity I have had to expressmy heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  on his election as head of ourOrganization. I assure him of Gabon’s full support for allthe efforts he will need to make to ensure the success ofthe action he takes in the service of the United Nations.It is often said that the international context haschanged  that the fields of activity of the States that werepresent are being subjected to attacks on all sides asscience and technology progress. The globalization of oureconomies  based on the proclaimed virtues of liberalism has not yet yielded all that it could.The new world order that we have so long hoped forhas not yet arrived  because so many contradictions arewoven into the fabric of international relations. Yet no onecan fail to see that it represents both the matrix and thesupport essential to carrying out the reform of the UnitedNations so that it can better serve peace among nations andthe development of their peoples.I should like first to speak about peace  the chiefwealth of nations  and I shall do so  of course  in the lightof our own experience.In Gabon our understanding of peace underlies all thepolitical developments we have experienced and are stillexperiencing today. The organization of successive local legislative and senatorial elections in a calm political andsocial context at the end of 1996 and early this yearprovided proof of the fundamental role of the democraticlegitimacy sorely needed today for the exercise of politicalpower.This same perception underlies all the activities ofwhich we are the beneficiaries and which have madeGabon  through the personal presence of its President Omar Bongo  a country that enjoys the great friendship andtrust of other members of the international community especially its neighbours.In fact  Gabon has contributed in a substantial andsignificant manner to easing the tension in many parts ofAfrica.Gabon  together with Chad  Burkina Faso  Senegaland Mali  sent almost 300 soldiers as part of an Africanpeacekeeping force to restore institutional stability in theCentral African Republic.On behalf of my country I should like to pay tributeto the Inter-African Mission to Monitor theImplementation of the Bangui Agreements  established bythe Security Council.Given the very disturbing situation in Congo(Brazzavile)  and at the request of the Congolese parties Gabon agreed to take charge of the internationalmediation committee  under the leadership of HisExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  assisted by the jointUnited Nations/Organization of African Unity SpecialRepresentative  Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun. Asimilar request had already been made to President Bongoby our Congolese brothers during earlier crises  in 1992and 1993. The current crisis  which erupted in early July1997  is the longest and the most bloody — the officialdeath toll is 4 000 to 5 000 — and the most complex.Despite the many obstacles that this mediation effortis encountering  Gabon is doing its utmost to find apositive solution to this conflict. It is essentially apolitical and internal conflict  but it must be clear toeveryone that the situation could drift out of control  withrepercussions at the subregional and international levels.Even so  as the French writer Beaumarchais said “As success becomes more difficult to achieve  theneed for action becomes more pressing.”In this connection  I am pleased to note theencouraging reaction of the international community ingeneral  and more specifically  of the European Union andFrance  which have voiced their support and renewedtheir expression of trust in international mediation and inthe Head of State of Gabon  and have urged him tocontinue his efforts.To give the Assembly an idea of what has beendone  I would just like briefly to mention that PresidentBongo has proposed  on the one hand  a ceasefireagreement and  on the other  a political agreement tocover the transitional period from now until thepresidential elections.The draft political agreement is the fifth oneproposed since the negotiations began. It is based on theidea of power-sharing and the balanced participation of all15political forces in terms of holding power during thetransitional period. The breakdown is as follows.Mr. Lissouba will remain as President of the Republic andHead of State. To counterbalance this  as it were  a PrimeMinister  the Head of Government  will be appointed by thePresident from among the members of the Opposition. Inaddition  three Vice-Presidents of the Republic are to beappointed by the Head of State.We were unable to finalize this draft agreement duringthe discussions. Things started to happen quickly inBrazzaville: fighting continued; Mr. Kolelas  the Mayor ofBrazzaville  who had been heading the national mediationefforts  was appointed Prime Minister; and a Governmentwas set up. Of course  all this has meant that negotiationsare on hold.Against this background of uncertainty  PresidentBongo invited nine Heads of State of Central and WesternAfrica to a special meeting on the Congo which was heldin Libreville on 14 and 15 September 1997. PresidentLissouba was unable to join his colleagues but he sent hisPrime Minister  Mr. Kolelas.The Libreville summit reaffirmed support forinternational mediation efforts led by President Bongo. Italso made an urgent appeal to the warring factions to stopfighting and resolutely to continue with negotiations to tryand find a political settlement to the crisis. So far  I haveto say  the appeal has not met with the reaction on theground we had hoped for. But we are still hopeful thatdiscussions will soon be resumed  for this is the only waywe are going to find a lasting and constructive settlement.Faced with this situation  what have we done here inthe United Nations? I should remind the Assembly that verysoon after international mediation began  the President ofthe Republic of Gabon called for a commitment from theinternational community in terms of deploying aninternational force to separate the warring factions in Congo(Brazzaville).Several African countries in a commendable upsurgeof solidarity  responded favourably  expressing theirwillingness to provide troops for the international force.President Bongo brought the matter before the SecurityCouncil  which said it accepted the principle  but whichimposed various conditions that  when analysed  leave onewith the impression that if they were met there would bepractically no point in sending the force.Time is passing. Time is of the essence. Congolesepeople are still dying; others are fleeing their country; andthousands more are still wandering  distraught anddesperate  in the forests of the Congo  seeking makeshiftshelter.Can we really continue calmly to sit in Manhattan orin the offices of our capitals and discuss what is goingon? We know that in the recent past in other parts of theworld the same cunning preventive measures — I wasgoing to say the same procrastination — did not prevail.No  we must do something for the Congolese people.They are citizens of the world  our world  as well.I must emphasize this: the impact of armed conflictsis so great that it is more necessary than ever to stressspecific measures to prevent them. For developingcountries  like mine  that cannot and must not afford theluxury of high military expenditure  the maintenance ofinternational peace and security must be provided for“upstream” on the basis of preventive measures. It isbecause we believe deeply in this principle that the Statesin our subregion  Members of the United NationsStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions inCentral Africa have been cooperating and taking actionsince 1992 to strengthen mutual trust and security at thesubregional level.These contacts have led  inter alia  to the signing inYaoundé in July 1996  by virtually all the members ofthis Committee — except one — of a non-aggressionpact  which is an important measure to strengthen peace.More recently  at its ninth Ministerial Meeting  lastJuly in Libreville  attended by four out of fiverepresentatives of the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil  we adopted a major plan of action whose mainthrust is: the establishment of an early-warningmechanism as a way of preventing conflict in CentralAfrica; the organization in the medium term of a regionalconference on democratic institutions and peace in CentralAfrica; and training seminars for law enforcementpersonnel on peacekeeping operations  with the goal ofpreparing countries of the subregion to participate  withUnited Nations assistance  in possible future peacekeepingoperations.In my capacity as Chairman of the Bureau of thatCommittee  I should like to draw the keen attention of allexecutive bodies operating under the aegis of the UnitedNations and the European Union  and our partners in the16subregion  to the benefits of effectively establishing thisearly-warning mechanism before the end of 1997.Still in that capacity  I wish to appeal to all MemberStates and to the international community as a whole tocontribute to the Trust Fund set up by the Secretary-General to finance the work of the Committee.Looking at the crises that have erupted recently inCentral Africa  I have to say that today the subregion isfacing the possibility of many conflicts flaring up  involvingpopulations beyond our national boundaries  threatening thestability of our States and even calling into question theprinciple of the inviolability of borders — a principle thatthe Organization of African Unity has held dear since itsinception. The danger is real. We must ward it off.Through me  Gabon welcomes the United Statesinitiative to convene a special meeting of the SecurityCouncil on the situation in Africa  the first of its kind. Weare grateful for the fact that on that solemn occasion  on 25September 1997  the Security Council reaffirmed itsprincipal responsibility for the preservation of peace on ourcontinent.But how can we forget that United Nations files arebursting with piles of reports  declarations and resolutionson Africa  all of them equally relevant?Everyone here will recall that some 10 years ago theGeneral Assembly held a special session on Africa. Yes  Iknow — they say that now that the cold war has endedAfrica is no longer of prime strategic importance. Too badfor us! For my part  I would say “So much the better forus”  because we Africans have no reason to cry over thefall of the Berlin Wall. That was a tremendously importantevent for us too; it opened up new prospects. Today however  the African peoples  just like others  are no longerwilling to be paid in words and slogans. They thus expectconcrete measures to emerge from the special meeting thatwas held by the Security Council last week.Although Africa is no longer of prime strategicimportance  is Africa not today  where the United Nationsis concerned  its real challenge  I might even say its guiltyconscience — because of the Organization’s underlyingphilosophy and vocation?Looking beyond Africa  Gabon is also greatlyconcerned over the blockage in the Middle East process and we invite all the parties there to resume the dialogue with the support of the whole of the internationalcommunity  for there  as elsewhere  no lasting solutioncan be achieved through force.The wars and conflicts we all deplore are madepossible by the devastating force of weapons. We musttherefore patiently and resolutely succeed in disarming thenations of the world.Thus  we welcome the progress made in this area bythe entry into force of the Convention on the prohibitionof chemical weapons  which demonstrates the will of theinternational community to eliminate that category ofweapons of mass destruction.In the same connection  my country supports theOttawa process aimed at a complete ban on anti-personnellandmines. The recent Oslo Diplomatic Conference onthat subject worked along the lines we had hoped itwould. We regret  however  that some countries wereunable to join in the powerful and promising consensusthat emerged there. We trust that in the near future theywill be able to do so. The representative I sent to Oslotold me that some of those present had tried to establishfor those weapons a special category that they would beable to retain  a category of what they called “intelligent”anti-personnel mines. I do not know what that means.Intelligent or stupid  anti-personnel mines kill  and theyoften kill the innocent. They must therefore be banned. Ifwhile playing in a field your child’s leg is torn off by aso-called intelligent mine  you would find no consolationin the thought that the mine was an intelligent one.In any event  Gabon urges all United NationsMember States to bend all their efforts towards adoptinga plan of action for general and complete disarmament.Humanity will be the better for it.We are not sufficiently aware of the human sufferingthat underlies armed conflicts  particularly the suffering ofthe victims  and especially of women  the elderly andchildren  for killing them means killing the life  the pastand the future of the human race. In that connection  onecan only employ the word “abominable” in describing thegrowing use of children in conflicts.Over the past decade a million children have beenkilled  6 million have been seriously wounded orhandicapped for life  more than a million have beenorphaned or separated from their families  and millions ofothers are suffering serious psychological damage. Thisdark picture is even darker in Africa than in othercontinents. That is why Gabon  a party to the United17Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and asignatory of the Charter of the Rights and Welfare of theAfrican Child  joins the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF) in condemning the use of children as soldiersand urges Governments and all combatants on thebattlefield to halt a number of particularly shamefulpractices  namely  the recruitment of children into thearmed forces  the participation of children in combat  andviolations and abuses to which they are often subjected.In another area  the Gabonese authorities are deeplyconcerned by the struggle against the scourges of crime anddrug proliferation  which are other sources of humansuffering. We have taken a number of initiatives to combatthem  including the reorganization of our security servicesand the creation of an interministerial commission tocombat drug addiction. However  combating thosephenomena clearly calls for resolution and determined actsof solidarity and cooperation at the international level.Turning now to the question of development  I shouldlike to recall that the final goal of government is the well-being of peoples.Against that background  the international communityhas evidenced its will to improve the human condition byorganizing various workshops  seminars and conferences. Iwould just mention the Rio Conference on the environment the Vienna Conference on human rights  the BeijingConference on women  the Cairo Conference on population the Copenhagen Conference on social development and theStockholm Conference on the sexual exploitation ofchildren  as well as the very latest special session of theGeneral Assembly devoted to the mid-term review ofAgenda 21.However  even after all those meetings that arousedsuch hopes  it looks as though our community is not trulydetermined to fulfil the obligations it has freely enteredinto. It seems to be difficult to translate proclaimedintentions into action.Gabon therefore hopes that there will be greatermovement towards action at the forthcoming KyotoConference on climate change  which will be a test of theindustrialized countries’ commitments to sustainabledevelopment.Similarly  we would encourage the InternationalSeabed Authority to continue its work  particularly on theelaboration of a balanced mining code that takes intoaccount the interests of all States as well as environmentalquestions.The importance of the eight most developedcountries and their real ability to have an impact on theinternational economy give us ground to hope that thecommitments entered into at the recent Denver summitwill enable us to work towards strengthening aninternational economy at the service of humanity.This may sound like a litany of ills  but until thesituation improves we must continue to repeat that Africais suffering from very serious structural problems. Theseconsist  inter alia  of economies  often based on a singlecrop  that are dependent on the outside world;deterioration in the terms of trade; reverse finance flow;the lowest level of development; the largest number ofleast developed countries and of displaced persons andrefugees.However  I think it is important to highlight the factthat in addition to its potential  which it owes to rawmaterials  Africa also represents an effective market ofmore than 700 million inhabitants.We know that if it is to develop  our continent mustfirst and foremost rely on itself. Yet there is so much tobe done. We are familiar with the slogan  “Trade  notaid”. It is not entirely untrue. But would it be outrageousto say that it is not completely true either  because it isobvious that in Africa there exist countries whosedevelopment level is already allowing them to cherishsome legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on theinternational market as well as countries that still requireassistance  at least in certain areas  and particularly in thesocial area. To the latter countries  it would be better tosay: “Trade and aid”.It is in that spirit that Gabon will attend the ninthsummit of the African  Caribbean and Pacific States(ACP) associated with the European Union in the contextof the Lomé Convention. My country will have thehonour of hosting this summit in its capital on 6 and 7November 1997. I take this opportunity to say to the ACPcountries — and all of them are here at the GeneralAssembly — that we are ready to welcome them nextmonth and that we await them all.Gabon is a beneficiary of the international economicenvironment  and I would therefore like to share with theAssembly our experience in this area.18Since mid-1995  Gabon’s economic performance hasimproved considerably. The rate of growth has increasedsignificantly; inflation has been reduced to a very low level;and our situation outside the country has been strengthened.Structural measures and administrative reform areaccelerating. The Government is stepping up theliberalization of the economy and the cleaning up of thebusiness environment. A vast programme of privatizingpublic enterprises has already been put into effect. It beganwith the Gabon Water and Energy Company. Theprivatization was carried out in very orderly and transparentconditions — to the surprise of not a few — and theprogramme will be continued in other spheres.Aware of the decisive role the private sector has toplay in Gabon’s prosperity and in increasing the standard ofliving of its people  our Government is trying to establisha legal and regulatory environment which will facilitateprivate investment and open up various sectors of theeconomy to competition. We sincerely state that Gabon isopen to all private investment. As President Bongo likes tosay  “Gabon is not the private reserve of anybody”.The Gabonese authorities are making sure that ourcommitments in the area of loans and repayments arerealistic and viable. They call for appropriate treatment inrespect of our foreign public debt  because the strictdeadlines for repayment often hamper our efforts torevitalize our economy.Finally  partnership in all areas must be strengthenedand the transfer of technologies encouraged  so that thenational capacities of our countries can be revitalized.In his speech to the General Assembly  the Secretary-General expressed the hope that this session will be knownas the Reform Assembly. Indeed  the world today is notwhat it was in 1945. Our Organization must adapt to thenew realities. Gabon therefore welcomes therecommendations of the Secretary-General for the reformof the Organization.The current discussions must result in consensusmachinery that will safeguard the various interests of theMember States. But it remains true that no reform plan canbe successful until the financial situation of the UnitedNations is cured.My country recalls that we attach great priority to therecommendations formulated by the Organization ofAfrican Unity at its last summit  in Harare  and to theproposals made by the Non-Aligned Movement at itsMinisterial Conference in New Delhi in April 1997.President Bongo spoke as long ago as 1977 on thequestion of an increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil  and I had the occasion to repeat his positionbefore the General Assembly in 1995 and 1996. Let merepeat it one more time. Gabon suggests that we canreconcile the seemingly contradictory requirements in thisway: by eliminating the geographical imbalance in theSecurity Council so as to consolidate its legitimacy andeffectiveness; by making the decision-making process inthe Council more democratic; and by allowing for a fairerrepresentation of Africa. Africa calls for two permanentseats  with the same rights the other permanent membershave; the seats would be rotated in accordance withprinciples that the African Group will submit in due timeto the General Assembly.Gabon reaffirms here its commitment to theprinciples of universality and the sovereign equality ofStates. These should underlie all the thinking in regard toreform.It is my hope that this session of the GeneralAssembly will enable us to take another step towardsstrengthening the ideals we all share.This transition towards a more humane world willnot be without perils. We will have to combatsimultaneously the upsurge of selfishness and thedevelopment of false solidarity  which can lead ourpeoples to fratricidal struggle.I am convinced that  united  we will take up thechallenge to build a better world."
"59",2539,"GBR",52,1997,"﻿We inhabit a modernworld in which we must accept change as the normalcondition of life. Communication around the globe isbecoming faster. The distance between our countries isbecoming shorter. I travelled to New York at twice thespeed of sound and I landed before I took off. Every wordI say to the Assembly today will be sent to London downa telephone line and within minutes it will appear on theWorld Wide Web.Our countries today are intertwined as never before ina market place that is global. And our people have learnedthat their purchasing decisions have an impact on jobs andpay across the planet — from the fruit they buy at thesupermarket to the fuel they use in their cars. Changes tothe environment in one continent can produce changes tothe weather in another continent. Our countries areincreasingly interdependent  and the challenges we eachface are global challenges — challenges that we must facetogether: poverty  conflict  climate change  internationalcrime and the drugs menace. These are all internationalproblems that require us to behave as a united nations notjust in name but in reality.And so the United Nations should have a bigger rolethan ever before. If it appears to be less relevant  it is notfor want of challenge but for want of reform. The UnitedNations must modernize. It must be able to confront thenew global challenges that all its Members face. It willneed flexibility  competence and efficiency to meet thecomplex needs of the twenty-first century because theUnited Nations cannot give leadership to a changingworld if we ourselves refuse to change.The outstanding leadership shown by the Secretary-General is an important start. His proposals forinstitutional reform will retain what is best in the UnitedNations system but give it the flexibility and theefficiency it needs to respond rapidly to the newchallenges of a new century. The member countries of theUnited Nations must support his commitment tomodernization. We must each stop measuring eachproposal for reform in terms of narrow self-interest and instead  recognize that we all have a greater interest insupporting reform.Britain’s Labour Government is firmly committed tothe United Nations. We demonstrated this commitment assoon as we were elected by rejoining the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) and by confirming our intention to stay in theUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization(UNIDO). We were elected because we offered Britainmodernization to succeed in a new century. We pledgeourselves to back modernization of the United Nations.We do so because we know that our country  like allother Member States  will benefit from a United Nationsthat is efficient  representative and properly funded.Let me take each of those in turn. Efficient does notspell cheap. But we do want to see the United Nations dothe most it can with what it has got — a United Nationsthat no longer spends $150 million producing 2 500 tonsof documents every year. We thoroughly welcome theSecretary-General’s commitment to reduce the number ofdocuments by 25 per cent by next year. We want to seean end to the duplication between United Nationsagencies  and I give my wholehearted support to theSecretary-General’s proposal for a Special Commission tolook at the division of labour right across the UnitedNations system.15Another way in which the United Nations is out ofdate is its Security Council. We are all agreed in thisChamber that what was appropriate in 1945 is not what isright in 1997. The world has changed. Most of thecountries represented here today did not even exist whenthe United Nations was formed. The Security Council mustmove on if it is not to lose its legitimacy. Japan andGermany should both be included in an expandedpermanent membership  and there should be a new balancebetween developed and developing countries in amodernized Security Council. We are all agreed on theneed for change; we have been discussing it for four years.It is time that we agreed that a proposal for change whichhas the backing of the vast majority of Members is betterthan a status quo which has the backing of none.It is not just all the countries of the United Nationsthat must be properly represented  but all the people ofthose countries. More than half those people are women.Britain welcomes the United Nations willingness to putgender perspective into all areas of its work. The newLabour Government attaches particular importance tostrengthening the rights of women. Women do more thanhalf the world’s work. They should have equal status in theinternational organizations of the world.Let us also put the United Nations finances on a soundbasis. Speaker after speaker yesterday referred to the needfor us to cooperate to defeat those who make fortunes fromorganized crime and to contain the drugs trade  second onlyin value to the oil trade. We cannot defeat those well-resourced menaces to the modern world through a UnitedNations that staggers from year to year on the verge ofbankruptcy.We need a solution based on the ability to pay. Themost equitable means of sharing the burden is to basecontributions on share of global gross national product. Butthat measure will only be accepted as equitable if it isupdated regularly to reflect the rapid changes to the worldeconomy. And it is not equitable that some Members paytheir contributions while other Members do not. Britainpays in full and on time. Britain expects every MemberState  however large or however small  to do the same.These three issues — institutional reform  SecurityCouncil reform and financial reform — are critical to theUnited Nations future. Let us commit ourselves to progresson all these issues by the end of 1997 and solutions by thistime next year. Next time we meet  let us celebrate amodern United Nations that can face the future withconfidence  rather than looking back on another year ofagreeing about all the questions but not being able toagree on any of the answers. And then the United Nationswill be able to get on with its job.There are three key areas in which the UnitedNations has a vital job to do — promoting sustainabledevelopment  promoting peace and promoting humanrights. Those are not separate challenges  but differentfaces of the same challenge. There can be no real andsustainable development or respect for human rightswithout peace. And there will be no permanent peacewhere there is only poverty and injustice.During every speech this week another 300 childrenwill die before their first birthday  most of them deathsthat could be easily and cheaply prevented. If the UnitedNations is to be relevant to its Members  then more thananything else it must enable people to lift themselves outof poverty.Britain supports the United Nations aid target. AsBritain’s contribution to achieving it  the mew LabourGovernments has committed itself to reversing the declinein the British aid budget. Britain has also consistentlyurged faster action in tackling the problem of debt  and atthe Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting inMauritius last week  British Chancellor Gordon Brownlaunched a new initiative to cut debt that will benefit 300million of the world’s poorest people and help developingcountries escape from the debt trap.But aid will not alone eliminate poverty. We need tocontinue breaking down the barriers that deny the poorestcountries access to the world’s most lucrative markets.We need to make sure that producers in Africa areallowed to sell their goods to Europe and to America aseasily as their producers can sell their goods to Africa.Sustainable development will do more than justreduce poverty. Poverty is also one of the greatest threatsto the environment. If we want to preserve the planet forfuture generations  we must make sure that developmentrespects the environment and does not destroy it. TheUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Developmenthas made important progress towards this goal. But it isnot a task any country can subcontract to the UnitedNations. We are all in this together. No country can optout of global warming or fence in its own private climate.We need common action to save our commonenvironment.16The new Labour Government has set itself theambitious target of reducing Britain’s emissions ofgreenhouse gases by 20 per cent by the year 2010. At thethird session of the Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change  inKyoto  the nations of the world must sign up to bindingtargets and then they must keep to them.The second key goal is peace — preventing conflictsbefore they happen  helping to end them when they dohappen and helping to rebuild lasting peace after conflict.Each of these contributions to peace is equally vital.But it is the United Nations peacekeeping operationsthat have the highest profile  and with good reason. Theblue berets have prevented worse conflict across the world from Eastern Slavonia to the Western Sahara. Many havelaid down their lives  not in the conduct of war but in thepursuit of peace. The death of a dozen internationalpolicemen and envoys  among them a British diplomat  inthe United Nations helicopter that crashed in Bosnia lastweek  was a grim reminder of the risks we ask our peace-builders to take. I pay tribute to their courage and salutethem for their professionalism and their skill.The last area in which the United Nations must focusis human rights. As the world becomes smaller  and newsand ideas travel faster  so the principle that certain rightsare universal becomes even more compelling. TheUniversal Declaration of Human Rights sets out the right tofreedom from the fear of violence and the right to libertyfrom the threat of unjust imprisonment. Those are rights towhich every citizen of the world irrespective of race  creedor colour. They must not be limited to any one culture orany one continent. As the Secretary-General has pointed outSecretary-General has pointed out  the mothers from everyculture weep when their sons and daughters are killed ormaimed by repressive rule.Nor do human rights hinder economic development.The past two decades have demonstrated that politicalfreedom and economic development are not in conflict butare mutually reinforcing. Free societies are efficienteconomies. Authoritarian rule more often produceseconomic stagnation. That is why Britain supports theSecretary-General’s proposals to integrate human rights intoall the work that the United Nations does.This is my first General Assembly. I attend it withboth hope and with anxiety — hope that  if it modernizes the United Nations can help us face the global challengesof the future; anxiety that  without modernizing  theUnited Nations will lose legitimacy and its effectiveness.We must not let that happen. There are too manychildren stunted by poverty  too many mothers fearful ofwar  too many people whose basic human rights are beingabuse. The United Nations offers them hope. Let uscommit ourselves this week to achieving a modern reformed United Nations that will turn hope into reality."
"60",2563,"GEO",52,1997,"﻿I should like to begin by congratulating theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  on his election as President of GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session. This is a compellingacknowledgment of the high international esteem in whichUkraine is held and of Mr. Udovenko’s personal qualitiesand extensive experience. At the same time  I should liketo express gratitude to the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session  Ambassador RazaliIsmail  who made a significant contribution to thesuccessful guidance of that session.It is particularly important for us to be making thisstatement today from this lofty rostrum. Five years havepassed since Georgia became a full-fledged Member ofthe United Nations. I believe that the time has come toassess the development of Georgian statehood  as well asthe results of our full-fledged participation in and activecooperation with the United Nations.In this five-year period our country has travelledfrom civil war  chaos  economic collapse and rampantcrimes to ever increasing stability  the establishment ofdemocratic institutions and tangible economic progress.The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignityfrom the most critical phase in our independentdevelopment is  to a large extent  to the credit of theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies  whichprovided Georgia not only with moral support but withspecific and timely financial and technical assistance. Weshall always remember that with particular gratitude.We understand what a responsible task the UnitedNations has as it“strives to articulate an inclusive vision: communityamong nations  common humanity among peoples the singularity of our only one Earth.” (A/51/950 para. 1)The criterion for the formation of such a vision is thedestiny of each people and every State  including Georgia whose recent history fully and clearly reflects all thevirtues and flaws of the present world order. Georgia canthus serve as a model with regard to the need toimplement long-awaited changes and radical reformswithin the United Nations system. It is precisely on thissubject that I wish to share my views.The global post-confrontational developmentfollowing the end of cold war has not  unfortunately  been20as simple as had been expected. We have stressed onnumerous occasions  including from this rostrum  that theglobal confrontation between two systems has given way toequally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carrywithin them the potential for enormous destruction  therebyposing the same global challenge to international security.One of the manifestations of this dangerous trend is theaggressive separatism that has plagued my country andseveral other newly independent States. We have alsopointed out that the United Nations and other internationalorganizations should act in a manner that takes account ofthese changes. Unfortunately  our recent experience showsthat  as a result of somewhat entrenched attitudes  theserealities are frequently misunderstood.The main obstacle to the strengthening anddevelopment of our statehood and to the fullimplementation of economic reforms continues to be thelack of a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and theTskhinvali region. The situation in Abkhazia is particularlyworrying. About 300 000 refugees and displaced personsfrom Abkhazia are still unable to return to their homes.These people  whom fate has not treated kindly  are alreadybeginning to lose hope for a peaceful settlement of theconflict. We are obliged to note that  regrettably  theconflict in Abkhazia has become a kind of touchstoneexposing the inadequacy of United Nations efforts. Wetherefore continue to insist on the need to find a newapproach that can give a new impetus to the dialogue. Wewelcome the vigorous steps being taken to strengthen therole of the United Nations in settling the conflict inAbkhazia  Georgia.We have embraced with hope and optimism the newinitiatives put forward by the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations. We would like to stress in particular thatwe attach importance to the resumption of the Genevanegotiations between the parties to the conflict  under theauspices of the United Nations and with the participation ofthe Russian Federation as facilitator  the group of Friendsof the Secretary-General on Georgia and the Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We areconfident that the Geneva process will not only promote asettlement of the conflict  but will also reveal thetransformational role that the United Nations can play underthe new conditions. Here I must express deep gratitude tothe President of Ukraine  His Excellency Mr. LeonidKuchma  who  from this lofty rostrum expressed support forthe efforts of the United Nations in Abkhazia andreaffirmed Ukraine’s readiness to participate directly.The establishment of a United Nations standby forcewould be very useful in developing the potential forUnited Nations peacekeeping operations to prevent theescalation of conflicts in a timely manner. Such forceswould be on constant standby. We believe that such asystem must include a technically well-equipped andappropriately staffed headquarters. It would be responsiblefor the evaluation and assessment of emerging conflictsituations. On the basis of such assessments UnitedNations rapid-reaction forces  which have yet to beestablished  could be quickly sent to zones of conflict. Weare confident that  had such forces existed five years ago the tragic development of the conflict in Abkhazia couldhave been prevented. As the vicissitudes of the conflict inAbkhazia  Georgia  have shown  there is still a need forclearly coordinated joint actions between the UnitedNations and regional and international organizations forthe settlement of conflicts. The absence of such a practiceconsiderably reduces the effectiveness of thepeacekeeping efforts of our community.Georgia’s experience provides a positive example ofcooperation between the United Nations and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.This cooperation includes the joint United Nations-OSCEoffice for monitoring human rights in Abkhazia and theprogramme for the economic rehabilitation of theTskhinvali region  proposed and implemented by theUnited Nations Development Program. I also believe thatwe should seriously consider the proposal of the actingChairman of the OSCE  by which the State chairing thatOrganization would automatically join the group ofFriends of the Secretary-General on Georgia  therebypromoting and increasing cooperation between the UnitedNations and the OSCE. We believe that there is a need towelcome the process of cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional international organizations  whichhas already begun.We should also reconsider the important concept ofpost-conflict peace-building. We are sometimes prisonersof stereotyped notions of a phased approach to settlingconflicts  and as a result we sometimes fail to notice howthin the line is between establishing peace andpeacekeeping itself. In the process of conflict settlementit is more effective to use elements of post-conflict peace-building  including them in the strategy of peacekeepingoperations. Elements of post-conflict peace-building suchas social and economic rehabilitation of conflict zonesand the establishment of a basis for their furtherdevelopment would facilitate confidence-building betweenthe parties involved and create a favourable social and21economic environment for the achievement of a finalpolitical settlement. We believe that the United Nationsshould remain actively seized of this matter.The creation of a special fund would allow the UnitedNations potential for post-conflict peace-building to bestrengthened. “Development dividends” could provide onesource of revenue for this. On the other hand  the fundcould also consider the economic interests of the parties tothe conflict  and on that basis develop relevant projects thereby assisting in conflict prevention.The uniqueness and indispensability of the UnitedNations as a central and multilateral mechanism ofcooperation in the post-confrontational world must first andforemost be manifested in its leading role in the creation ofa qualitatively new comprehensive system of security stability and development. The most important role heremust be played by a global system of economic security the formation of which should run parallel with thedevelopment of the process of world integration.A characteristic feature of today’s world is thatformerly isolated historico-geographic regions are graduallyovercoming their isolation and are cooperating to create ashared global infrastructure of human activities. Therefore regional economic unions should be viewed as a drivingforce of the mechanisms for building such an infrastructure.For example  the Caucasus region clearly demonstratesthe potential of the so-called graded model of globalintegration. I refer  in the first place  to subregionalcooperation within the framework of a given region and further  in the light of the geo-strategic situation of theCaucasus  to its role as a link for interregional cooperation namely between Europe and Asia.Such a structure for integration  such a global modelis in keeping with the realities of our day. We believe thatthe coordinating role of the United Nations in this processcan be very effective.Such a vision of the role of the Caucasus region hasalready been embodied in the concept of the Euro-Asiancorridor  a kind of Silk Road for the twenty-first century.This historic conduit for trade  the importance of which iscontinuing to grow and gain in recognition  is alreadyworking and proving its effectiveness.Similar corridors present a unique opportunity for theestablishment of new material and cultural values and forbringing economies and cultures together. On this basis they must — and  unquestionably  will — also play animportant role in the establishment and strengthening ofstability in the region.Georgia has been called upon to actively promotethe implementation of this concept. Even a superficialglance at a map shows the strategic importance ofgeopolitical and geo-economic dimensions of this centralconduit for world trade. Therefore  we express ourreadiness to cooperate with all those who are interested inmaking it a reality.The broad functions of the United Nations as auniversal organization are the basis for the initiativesspelled out by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme forReform”. First and foremost  we believe there is a needto focus on the treaty defining the international legalprofile of today’s world order: the Charter of the UnitedNations. Conceived under specific circumstances  itprovided a mechanism that was aimed  for the most part at prevention and settlement of conflicts between States.As a result  the United Nations has often reactedinadequately to such challenges as the numerous conflictsoccurring within States. The principles that constituted thebasis for traditional peacekeeping operations  in particularthe concept of consent of the parties  are often untenablein cases of so-called ethnic conflict. This leads us to theidea that the Charter to a great extent needs to berethought and made to conform to current realities.In this regard  Georgia supports the creation of aministerial commission to study the necessity offundamental reforms in the Charter and in those legaldocuments that define the mandates of the United Nationsspecialized agencies. Georgia also supports the proposalfor the appointment of a First Under-Secretary-Generalwho would be called upon to play a special role inensuring the success of programmes and plans of thevarious functional sectors of the Secretariat.Undoubtedly  the crux of the United Nations reformsis the enlargement of the Security Council and theimprovement of the activities of the General Assemblyand of the other main bodies. Also important is thequestion of the optimal reallocation of authority betweenthe General Assembly and the Security Council. In thisrespect  we reaffirm our unwavering position concerningthe inclusion of Germany and Japan among the permanentmembers of the Security Council and also concerning theenlargement of the Council  including adding one seat forthe Eastern European countries.22We favour growing transparency in the work of theSecurity Council. From our point of view  it is importantthat concerned States be able to participate in informalconsultations of the Council  at which substantivediscussions take place and decisions are taken.The international community should also be equippedwith reliable tools of justice to enable it to react not only tounlawful actions of States but also to those of individualswho have perpetrated crimes against humanity. In thisconnection  we call upon all the Member States to do allthey can to conclude successfully the diplomatic conferenceand to adopt a treaty on the establishment of aninternational criminal court by 1998.In closing I would like to recall the initiative of theSecretary-General to hold a special session of the GeneralAssembly in the year 2000  as a “millennium Assembly”.Very little time remains before mankind enters the newmillennium  and we must do everything we can to see tothat the reformed United Nations becomes a genuinely newUnited Nations for the world order of the coming century.I am confident that Georgia  together with other States  willoccupy a worthy place in it  as a democratic and prosperouscountry."
"61",2610,"GHA",52,1997,"﻿The delegation of Ghanacongratulates His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko onhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session. His long experience in the affairsof this Organization and the great qualities which he bringsto this high office assure us that under his wise guidancethe work of this session will be fruitful and constructive. Tothat end my delegation pledges to him its full support andcooperation.My delegation also wishes to pay a special tribute tohis distinguished predecessor  His Excellency Mr. RazaliIsmail  who conducted the business of the fifty-first sessionwith remarkable zeal and efficiency. The promptitude andenergy with which he discharged his responsibilities asPresident has left an enduring imprint on the work of thisOrganization.To our distinguished Secretary-General and mycompatriot  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  we wish toexpress our deep appreciation for his sterling qualities ofleadership. The people of Ghana are indeed grateful to theworld community for having chosen a son to head this veryhigh and important body. Barely nine months afterassuming his onerous responsibilities  Kofi Annan hasdemonstrated an indefatigable energy and commitment tothe reform and efficient management of the Organizationto enable it to measure up to the purposes and objectivesof its existence. We pledge to him our continuedunflinching support.At the fifty-first session  Member States warmlywelcomed the conclusion of the Pelindaba and BangkokTreaties establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africaand South-East Asia respectively. We also welcomed theadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which has since been signed by the vast majority ofStates  including my own. We view these as progressivesteps on the road to nuclear disarmament. We thereforerenew our call on the nuclear-weapon States to cooperatewith the rest of the international community for thecommencement and early conclusion of multilateralnegotiations on a universal and binding conventionprohibiting the development  production  stockpiling anduse of nuclear weapons  and mandating the destruction ofthe existing stockpiles.We make these appeals not as an annual ritual butbecause of our deep conviction that the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction  including nuclear  chemicaland biological weapons  will go a long way to promoteinternational peace and security  a principal purpose forwhich this Organization was established.While weapons of mass destruction deserve thepriority attention accorded them by this Assembly  thequestion of conventional weapons cannot be ignoredeither. The illicit transfer and use of this category ofarmaments are a source of great concern  since theyconstitute a threat to the stability of States and fuel thenumerous conflicts which bedevil the world today particularly in Africa. They also provide terrorists  drugbarons and other criminals the means with which topursue their illegal activities. We must adopt all availablemeans to curb the illicit traffic. In the same vein  wesupport ongoing international initiatives to conclude atreaty banning the production  transfer and use of anti-personnel landmines  which continue to kill and maiminnocent people and disrupt the economic and social lifeof millions  long after the end of the conflicts in whichthey were laid.Though the end of the cold war has greatly reducedthe threat of another global war  which twice in thiscentury brought untold sorrow to mankind  intra-countryconflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in17several countries  with resultant loss of lives  destruction ofnational infrastructure  displacement of innocent personsand outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries. InAfghanistan  Cambodia  the former Yugoslavia  Somalia Angola  Liberia and Sierra Leone and the Republic of theCongo  we see the havoc caused by this new trend and itspotential threat to regional and subregional security.We in Africa are all the more concerned. For whilethe international community is prompt to react to conflictsin regions of economic or geo-strategic interest to the richand industrialized world  conflicts in some developingcountries  particularly in Africa  I am sorry to say  fail toelicit the same degree of response. Thus  peacekeeping which is a primary function of this Organization  has alsofallen prey to geo-strategic parochial considerations. Wehasten to warn that such double standards threaten theconcept of collective security which constitutes the veryfoundation of this Organization.In the West African subregion  we have endeavouredto fill the gap left by international inertia and selectivity.After nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) intervention in Liberia countries of the subregion  with only the limited assistanceof the international community  finally succeeded insupervising the conduct of presidential and legislativeelections in the country in July 1997  under conditionsgenerally acknowledged to be free and fair.We are happy to welcome the worthy representativesof the elected Government of Liberia to this Assembly. Fortrue and lasting peace in that country  we urge theinternational community to stand by the people of Liberiaas they set out on the difficult road of nationalreconstruction. We are proud to have been part of theprocess to restore peace and legitimacy in Liberia  and praythat the Liberian Government and people will continue onthe path of national reconciliation in order to consolidatethe hard-won peace  which is vital for social and economicdevelopment.While we applaud the return of peace to Liberia  wedeplore the onset of violence  disorder and destructionfollowing the unjustified overthrow of the democraticallyelected Government of President Tejan Kabbah in SierraLeone. We call on the leaders of the coup to heed theunequivocal condemnation of their act by the internationalcommunity and cooperate with the efforts of ECOWAS torestore constitutional order in Sierra Leone.In recent years  my delegation has had cause toexpress its concern and regret at the continued impositionof unjust sanctions on Libya by the Security Council  indefiance of the expressed wish of the vast majority ofStates represented in the League of Arab States  theOrganization of African Unity and the Non-AlignedMovement. We note that Libya has fully met therequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992)and is willing to cooperate with the other partiesconcerned in the dispute. We urge the Security Council torevisit the issue and ensure a peaceful solution of theconflict and an end to the sanctions.We also reiterate the call of the Non-AlignedMovement and other States on the United States ofAmerica to put an end to the economic  commercial andfinancial measures and actions unilaterally imposed onCuba  in contravention of the United Nations Charter andall principles of international law.We urge the people of Korea to work together inpeace to realize their aspirations. Since the end of thecold war peace on the peninsula has needlessly beenunder threat on a number of occasions.On the question of Western Sahara  we maintain ourconfidence in the power of direct dialogue  under theauspices of this Organization  as the best means by whichthe Settlement Plan can be revived to enable the Sahrawipeople to exercise their right to self-determination through a free  fair and impartial referendum. The newsthat the Secretary-General’s personal envoy  in the worthyperson of His Excellency Mr. James Baker III  hassucceeded in brokering a compromise agreement throughsuch direct talks is reassuring  and we hope that verysoon  this long  drawn-out conflict will be amenable tosuccessful resolution.May I also avail myself of this opportunity toexpress my Government’s regret that the Middle Eastpeace process has been put in grave jeopardy by theactions of the Israeli Government  which  defyinginternational outcry  continues its settlement activities inEast Jerusalem. For these are the very actions whichencourage extremists among the Palestinians to organizeterrorist acts against the Israeli population. We would alsourge the Palestinian leadership to continue moreassiduously in its efforts to achieve the objectives of theirtreaty with Israel through non-confrontational means.Many a representative has drawn attention to thecontinued and widespread growth of the global economy18as we move towards the close of the century and to thebroadening of the reach of economic growth in developingcountries to include an increasing number of low-incomecountries. Indeed  many African countries have achievedstronger growth of output and incomes in 1996 and 1997.This encouraging trend has been achieved through theadoption and pursuit by Governments of policies andmeasures aimed at ensuring  among others  macroeconomicstability  inflows of foreign direct investment  open and freemarkets and stable and transparent legal and regulatoryframeworks.However  it is pertinent also to point out that despitethese efforts  many African countries  and especially theleast developed countries  continue to face important policychallenges  particularly in the areas of enhancing resourcemobilization and allocation  strengthening savings andinvestment and financing development. The difficultiesinherent in these challenges are compounded by the adverseimpact of globalization and liberalization. These countrieshave not participated in  nor benefited from  globalization.On the contrary  they have become even more marginalizedin the global economy for the very simple reason that theylack the physical  financial and human resources as well asthe institutional infrastructure necessary for effectivecompetition and integration in the international markets.In specific terms our countries  despite variousstructural reforms  have been unable to attract in sufficientquantities the necessary capital inflows for investment  andare confronted at the same time with domestic supply-sideconstraints which limit our export potential  anunsustainable debt which swallows a great part of ournational income  and declining levels of officialdevelopment assistance  among others. The “prosperity-poverty” gap  or gulf  between the haves and the have-notsis ever more yawning.Under these circumstances  what we need is a newdevelopment strategy based on genuine partnership betweenthe developed and developing countries and which takes aholistic view of development  combining within itself allthe tools of development  including trade and investment aswell as official development assistance and South/Southcooperation. Such a strategy will also necessitate thedemocratization of international relations  particularly in theeconomic sphere; the establishment of open  equitable andtransparent international regimes; the creation of fairopportunities for all; and the protection of the weakestmembers of our community.It is in this context that we welcome the successfulconclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development which is intended to serve as an initial framework forrenewing and strengthening the partnership fordevelopment on the basis of mutual benefits and genuineinterdependence. While acknowledging and affirming ourcommitment to the primacy of national policies andmeasures to achieve our development goals  we wish tostress the importance of the fulfilment by all parties of theglobal commitments aimed at supplementing nationalefforts. In this connection  we express the hope that thecommitments and internationally agreed targets reached atrecent major United Nations conferences will be fullyimplemented by all parties. It is also our view that theUnited Nations must be strengthened and adequatelyequipped to carry out its important role in development.In seeking to achieve our goals  we the countries ofthe developing world need to cooperate more amongourselves as a means of strengthening our self-relianceand complementing international developmentcooperation. We therefore need to strive to enhancecooperation at all levels — bilateral  subregional  regionaland interregional — in the important areas of trade investment  finance  science and technology  environment human resources development  and information andcommunications. This  in the view of my delegation  willconstitute an important strategy for facilitating theeffective participation of developing countries in theglobal economy.The review and appraisal of the implementation ofAgenda 21 last June revealed worsening trends forsustainable development  as well as the continueddeterioration of the state of the global environment as aresult of the failure of the international community tofulfil the commitments it undertook in 1992. This is a sadstate of affairs. But even sadder still was the failure of thereview session to make any significant progress on thecritical issues of Agenda 21  owing to the unwillingnessof Member States to establish time-bound and quantifiedcommitments. It is absolutely necessary that we allrecommit ourselves to the global partnership establishedat Rio in 1992 and to the fulfilment of the obligationsvoluntarily assumed under Agenda 21.Ghana has in various forums indicated its support forthe establishment of an international criminal court. Weare gratified that the Preparatory Committee for theestablishment of the Court made significant progress inthat direction at its last two sessions. We hope that withthe same determination and spirit of compromise which19has characterized the work of the Preparatory Committeesince its inception  the establishment of the Court will soonbecome a reality. We wish to recognize the usefulcontributions of the various non-governmental organizationswhich have worked closely with governmental delegationson several difficult aspects of the proposed internationalcriminal court.Progress on the Law of the Sea also deserves mention.With the establishment of the Commission on the Limits ofthe Continental Shelf  all institutions envisaged by theConvention have now been put in place. It is our hope thatadequate resources will be made available to theseinstitutions to enable them fully to attain the objectives forwhich they were set up. It is also our hope that cooperationbetween the appropriate United Nations agencies anddeveloping countries in the sphere of the Law of the Seawill be intensified to enable developing countries fully toutilize the benefits conferred on them by the Convention onthe Law of the Sea.The critical financial situation of the Organization isa major source of concern to my delegation  as it places ourOrganization in jeopardy at a time of challenge and ofopportunity to promote the objectives and purposes of theOrganization. It is regrettable that a number of countries including some of the largest contributors  are neitherpaying their contributions nor making good on their arrears while some even wittingly aggravate the situation byattaching unacceptable conditions or benchmarks to thedischarge of their Charter obligations in this regard. Mydelegation strongly believes that support for the UnitedNations must be demonstrated not only by an eagerness topromote reforms but more importantly by the willingness ofMember States to pay all their assessed contributionspromptly  fully and unconditionally to ensure that theOrganization is financially sound and can meet its mandatesand other commitments.Ted Turner  an individual with no obligationwhatsoever to support the United Nations  has demonstratedsupport in a dramatic and yet effective manner. He hasoffered to pay the United Nations $1 billion over 10 years.What excuse has any country got  then  to say  “We willnot pay”  or “We will pay only if ...”? On behalf of HisExcellency the President of Ghana and of the people ofGhana  I say thank you to Ted Turner for showing us theway  for pricking our consciences and for being such agood citizen of the world.Today at the fifty-second session  perhaps more sothan ever before  the General Assembly is confronted withthe complex problem of the reform of our Organization.On the threshold of a new millennium  the United Nationscannot continue to conduct its business as usual. It has toadopt bold and imaginative measures to overhaul itsstructure and working methods with a view to removingthe obstacles that impede its effectiveness not only as aninstrument for promoting international peace and securitybut also as an indispensable agent for resolving theworld’s socio-economic problems.It is in this context that Ghana has carefully studiedthe Secretary-General’s wide-ranging and far-reachingproposals presented to Member States for theirconsideration and reaction. We warmly congratulate theSecretary-General on his bold initiative. The Secretary-General has thrown a momentous challenge to all of us and we should do everything possible to measure up tothe test by manifesting the necessary breadth of visionand objectivity of outlook. The United Nations remainsthe only international body available to us in our searchfor peace  progress and prosperity as well as in theresolution of differences among nations.For us as a nation  we are particularly interested inthe new sense of purpose and dynamism that theproposals seek to inject into United Nations developmentactivities to make them more coherent and output-oriented. We support the setting up of an effectivemachinery to study the various proposals and how toimplement them  and we stand ready to participate in anysuch effort."
"62",2656,"GIN",52,1997,"﻿I extend to the President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session the sincere congratulations of thedelegation of the Republic of Guinea on his election. At thesame time  I have the pleasant duty to transmit to him thewarmest greetings of the people and Government of Guineaand  in particular  of the President of the Republic  GeneralLansana Conte.Mr. Udovenko’s wealth of experience in multilateraldiplomacy  to which he has devoted a major part of hislife  together with his outstanding personal qualities ensures the success of our deliberations. As Vice-President of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession  and because of the long-standing and excellentrelations of friendship that link my country with his —Ukraine — I assure him of the full cooperation of mydelegation.Furthermore  I should like to express the deepappreciation of my delegation for the effectiveness andcompetence shown by his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Razali Ismail  in conducting the debates of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session.I should also like to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on the outstanding work he hasaccomplished since the beginning of his term  and on thesubmission on 14 July this year of his programme forreform. I should like to assure him of the confidence andsupport of the Republic of Guinea.In addition  I wish to pay tribute to the formerSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whodeserves credit for beginning consideration of the subject.Some have wished to call this fifty-second sessionthe Assembly of reform  and we are in agreement. Thedocument (A/51/950) submitted for debate  “RenewingThe United Nations: A Programme for Reform”  has beenexamined extremely carefully by my Government. Wemust admit that the United Nations in its current form isa long way from corresponding to the geopoliticalrealities of today’s world. Since its creation 50 years ago and in particular since 1989  the world has changedgreatly. We cannot fail to change along with it.It is true that results in the area of peacekeeping andinternational security have been extremely positive. Manymajor treaties and conventions have been concluded including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyand the Chemical Weapons Convention. The internationalcommunity has also made a firm and prompt commitmentto the Ottawa process on banning anti-personnellandmines  a process in which the Republic of Guineatook a particularly active part.We should also welcome the implementation ofpeacekeeping operations in many parts of the world and an extremely positive sign  an improvement in publicadministration  increased democracy and the strengthening17of the ability of nations to promote human rights in theinterests of better governance.But  in spite of this considerable progress  manyimbalances remain  major challenges are still before us andthe nascent globalization is not  as a spirit of internationalsolidarity would demand  benefiting developing countries which have tended to fall by the wayside on the road toprogress. Many countries are still labouring under theburden of debt  which is crippling their economies andthereby compromising their development efforts. In fullview of the international community  thinly disguisedprotectionism prevents our products from gaining access tobuoyant markets. When  taking one year with another  someof our products manage to overcome these barriers  theyoften succumb to prices stemming from rules that aresometimes fixed unilaterally or flouted with impunity. Thisis compounded by the harmful effects of the decline inofficial development assistance in spite of the Riocommitments.So-called small arms are proliferating on our bordersand are posing serious threats to the peace  security andstability of many countries.This short list does not nearly cover all the defects wehave to correct.Courageous and consensual reform of the UnitedNations could help us to do away with these ills  which arecompromising  through uncertainty  the future of manynations represented here. We must reassure our peoples  notjust by drafting new standard-setting instruments that arelegally binding on us all  but  above all  by taking drasticaction  channelling our will and joint efforts to change thesituation on the ground.The spirit of the Marshall Plan  which the UnitedNations should espouse  should not die with the centurythat saw its birth.For all these reasons  the Republic of Guinea approvesthe reform proposed by the Secretary-General. For all thesereasons it is also deeply involved in the debate that willmake it a reality. We will not go into all the positiveaspects here; we will simply confine ourselves to a fewpoints  especially those that directly affect developingcountries.I begin with the economy  the new cornerstone of thesystem after disarmament. Several economic measures goin the right direction. We support the initiative to create aUnited Nations Development Group  an Office ofDevelopment Financing and a new system for multi-yearpledges for development cooperation thanks to savings onadministrative expenses  the first fruits of reform.The same applies to strengthening the role of theEconomic and Social Council and promoting dialoguewith the technical ministries of our countries to giveimpetus to macroeconomic policies. We also set greatstore by the proclamation of the International Decade toEliminate Poverty and especially in concrete measures toeradicate the evil of poverty.The Republic of Guinea puts women and children atthe heart of its development  and welcomes the attentiongiven to the promotion of women and children.In the same vein  Guinea supports theimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and the UnitedNations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.My delegation supports other aspects which areequally important for the restructuring underconsideration  especially the merger of institutions in theOrganization with similar activities  such as the creationin Vienna of a single Office to combat transnationalcrime  drug-trafficking and terrorism  evils we should allfight against wherever they may rear their head  and theamalgamation of the Centre for Human Rights with theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights.The problem of the environment knows noboundaries. If we are not careful  this may be the greatestdanger we face  since many perils are lurking smouldering beneath the surface of the anarchy in thismatter. It should be the sacred duty of the internationalcommunity to ensure the lasting health of our planet forourselves and for future generations. This is why wewelcome the organization of a special session on theenvironment and development.We have presented the proliferation of small arms asa subject of concern to African countries. These weapons which unfortunately lend themselves to all types ofconflict  large or small  pose a real danger. We thereforestrongly support the idea of creating a Department forDisarmament and Arms Regulation. If it is to be fullyeffective  it should be given adequate resources andgenuine power to monitor the cross-border movement ofthese weapons.18What is true of the Organization as a whole is evenmore true of the Security Council. The times we live inhave made its reform essential. Nevertheless  when we dealwith this important and delicate issue  we should avoidconfrontation between regions and different groups and trynot to resort to useless polemics. On the one hand  weshould perhaps understand that we will not be able to doeverything at once  or else we will stymie the debate. Ourmain goal should be significantly to change a status quowhich we all feel has had its day. On the other hand  if weput ourselves in the shoes of those who are enjoyingpermanent seats and the right of veto  we should recognizethat it is difficult  even human  but not impossible  to agreeto give up  without a fight  the considerable advantages wonafter the war after a brave struggle.But  once peace has been achieved  it would bepointless if time were not able  after half a century  to healthe wounds of defeat and cast out the memories of war.Security Council reform must be one of the major proofs ofa reconciliation patiently achieved. This is only one aspectof the issue.If the desire to disarm is sincere and universallyshared by all members of the international community  asdecisive progress could lead us to hope is the case  then theconcept of power should no longer be measured by acountry’s mass destruction capabilities.After the cold war  the end of the arms race and of theconfrontation of ideologies  the struggle — perhaps weshould say “competition” — is shifting to other arenas particularly the economic arena and ensuring people’shappiness. In the process  many countries which not longago were considered small because of the size of theireconomies are outstripping nations which have seen theirformer glory fade.The formidable progress in communications hasinexorably reduced distances and gulfs separating the levelsof knowledge and development in the different parts of theworld.Together  let us square up to these new realities  withjustice and democracy as our point of reference but aboveall  with a clear view of humanity united on the basis of afruitful and trusting partnership  ensuring progress and well-being for all. And let us courageously decide now on whatis possible  even if it means postponing matters until theyear 2000  when we can put the finishing touches to whatwe will not have done today.In the debate this session  Africa  in its constantquest for consensus  has modest ambitions. We wouldconsider two permanent seats in the Security Council with the same rights for all  pursuant to the resolutions ofthe summit in Harare  as positive results. The delegationof the Republic of Guinea will fight for this during whatit hopes will be a calm and constructive debate.The United Nations is essential for today andtomorrow. If it did not exist  we would have had to inventit.The United Nations  as a special and irreplaceableplace for 185 States to meet  work together and cooperate must lay down rules of law recognized universally by allso that international relations can continue in a coherent equitable and efficient manner.Structural reform  however perfect  cannot be fullyeffective without adequate financing of the Organization’soperations and  above all  of its activities.Reform must necessarily be accompanied byconsistent funding. Without reducing this important aspectof the question solely to the payment of the contributionsowed by many countries  the delegation of Guinea wishesto state that its reaction to the statement by the Presidentof the country that is the largest contributor was apositive one. Nevertheless  in keeping with the principlethat the rules that have hitherto governed the Organizationare still in effect  the payment of arrears by all MemberStates must precede the opening of negotiations to workout a new scale of assessments satisfactory to all.While bearing in mind that our common destinyshould be the background to our statements before theAssembly  I would like to point out that each region andsubregion comes to this rostrum with its own pressingconcerns.The subregion of western Africa  to which mycountry  the Republic of Guinea  belongs has been shakenby two fratricidal conflicts in Liberia and in Sierra Leone.In Liberia  the recent democratic and transparentelections held on 19 July 1997 under the aegis of theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  with the support of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  the United Nations and suchfriendly countries as the United States of America  theNetherlands  Denmark and France  have been crownedwith success. We welcome the Ministerial Meeting of the19Special Conference on Liberia that is taking place today inthe Trusteeship Council Chamber  and we hope that it willlead to the mobilization of substantial resources for therebuilding of that fraternal country. The consolidation ofpeace and stability there is at stake.The Republic of Guinea  faithful to its policy of peaceand good-neighbourliness  has worked unflaggingly for thesuccess of such efforts. For the record  it will be recalledthat this is the first time that an African subregionalorganization  determined to shoulder its responsibilities  hasmanaged to initiate  lead and successfully carry out apeacekeeping operation.We would also like to salute here the support beinggiven by the international community to ECOWAS for therestoration of constitutional legitimacy in Sierra Leone which was the victim of a coup d’état on 25 May 1997.The consequences of the conflicts in Liberia  whichlasted for seven years  and in Sierra Leone  which has beengoing on for six years  have weighed heavily on theRepublic of Guinea. These are two neighbouring countriesthat share hundreds of kilometres of frontiers with Guinea.We have had to take in hundreds of thousands ofrefugees and displaced persons. The Republic of Guinea  acountry of 7 million inhabitants  has up to 650 000refugees  or one tenth of its population. In taking in therefugees it has had to pay a heavy price and makeenormous sacrifices. In the border areas the environmentand infrastructures have deteriorated under the demographicpressure. Schools have been closed to serve as shelters forrefugees. We have also had to cope with many healthproblems of all kinds.Because of this exceptional situation the members ofECOWAS  meeting at Conakry on 26 June 1997  launchedan appeal for emergency assistance for the Republic ofGuinea. That appeal is beginning to be heeded by manycountries and international organizations.Here we wouldlike to thank most warmly the People’s Republic of China the State of Kuwait  the United States of America  France Canada  Qatar  Italy and the Organization of African Unity which have already demonstrated their solidarity with us.I would be remiss if  out of a desire to inform theAssembly of the problems of western Africa  I failed togive due attention to conflicts tearing other Africancountries and other regions of the world asunder.With regard to the Great Lakes region  mydelegation would encourage all initiatives to establish aclimate of peace and stability in that area.Similarly  we would like to voice our concern at thedeterioration of the situation in the Congo. While urgingthe parties to the conflict to observe the ceasefire andpersevere in their efforts at negotiation  we reaffirm oursupport for the tireless efforts being made by all those ofgoodwill to reach a settlement of that crisis.Turning to Western Sahara  the Republic of Guineawelcomes the appointment of a new Personal Envoy ofthe Secretary-General for Western Sahara and hopes thatthe personal input of that diplomat will foster the peacefulimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan.Other parts of the world are also experiencing unrestthat threatens international peace and security. We shallconfine ourselves here to the situation in the Middle East.The Republic of Guinea encourages the efforts beingmade to find a just and lasting settlement in the MiddleEast. Notwithstanding current difficulties  we mustpersevere. Peace  a just and equitable peace betweenIsrael and its Arab neighbours  is essential. Peace willremake that region in the interests of all its peoples andturn it into a magnet for all the nations of the world. Theonly way to achieve that is through negotiation.In the prevention  management and resolution ofconflicts  Africa is increasingly shouldering its ownresponsibilities. This new approach is in keeping withcurrent developments  and the international communityshould encourage and support it.The Republic of Guinea  which pursues a policy ofpeace and economic development under the leadership ofa man of peace and tolerance  the President of theRepublic  Brigadier General Lansana Conté  will beprepared  as in the past  to bear its share of responsibilityfor solving African problems.A dark cloud always has a silver lining.It is comforting to note that life on the Africancontinent is not confined to crises and conflicts. Thestruggle of African peoples to emerge from poverty hasmade striking progress in recent years. The needs ofeconomic development have compelled all Africancountries to adapt their State institutions and redirect theirpolicies to cope with the changes of the new era.20Today  there are many bilateral and multilateralinitiatives to help Africa get off the ground. Most of thoseinitiatives draw on the lessons of the past and  happily avoid the imposition of patterns or stereotypes; they takeinto account the real needs of the African people  who areincreasingly involved in the choice of development plansand programmes. Measures to convert  suspend or write offdebts are part of that process.We face major challenges  whose diversity andcomplexity concern us and call for urgent solutionscommensurate with the expectations and aspirations of ourpeoples. The Republic of Guinea is confident that thecurrent session will produce decisions enabling ourOrganization fully to carry out its noble mission as weapproach the third millennium.I conclude on that note of hope and optimism."
"63",2695,"GMB",52,1997,"﻿Allow me first of all to extendmy delegation’s whole-hearted congratulations on theunanimous election of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko to thehigh office of President of this session. His skills as astatesman are excellent qualifications for the presidency and I wish to assure him of my delegation’s support andcooperation at all times during the proceedings of thissession.My delegation’s appreciation also goes to thePresident of the fifty-first session  His ExcellencyAmbassador Razali Ismail  for the impressive work heaccomplished during his presidency. His efforts toimprove the work of the General Assembly andstrengthen the role of the United Nations in internationalaffairs have increased the momentum of the UnitedNations reform process. My delegation congratulates himon a job well done.On behalf of my delegation  I also wish to extendour congratulations to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan. Since he assumed office inJanuary this year  he has been engaged in commendableefforts to reform the United Nations Organization. Thepresentation of his two-tracked proposals and measures21constitutes a bold and far-reaching reform programme which is expected not only to revitalize the United Nationssystem but also to make it better suited to execute itsmandates in the years ahead in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.The fifty-second session of the General Assembly istaking place at an important period during the internationalcommunity’s effort to evolve an atmosphere of viable andequitable international cooperation in the areas of economicdevelopment  social advancement and the recognition of theimportant need for the maintenance of a balanced globalecosystem.The recent holding of the nineteenth special session ofthe General Assembly  on the overall review and appraisalof the implementation of Agenda 21  is one of the manyfactors and activities that symbolize the importance of thisperiod and that mark our collective effort to shape a moremeaningful atmosphere of international cooperation. Thespecial session reaffirmed the international community’seffort to ensure that the blueprint for internationaldevelopment and the preservation of the environment  asenunciated in Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration five yearsago  are translated into concrete realities.The successes and constraints so far recorded in oureffort to achieve sustainable development clearly point tothe difficulty of creating a framework for internationalcooperation characterized by the full and continuedcommitment of both developed and developing countries.As stated by Her Excellency the Vice-President of theGambia during the special session “The difficult and protracted negotiations and theintellectual  expert and statesmanlike efforts that madethese agreements possible reflected the goodwill andgood faith of all Governments ...“... the constraints cited as obstacles to implementationduring this review session tend to indicate thepersistence of the contentious and also cross-cuttingissues of additional financial resources  technologytransfer  information sharing  training and institutionalcapacity-building and the unfulfillment of ourdifferentiated responsibilities under these provisions”.[See Official Records of the General Assembly Nineteenth Special Session  Plenary Meetings  9thmeeting]I wish to inform the General Assembly of the politicalevolution taking shape in my country  the Gambia. Sincethe Gambian delegation addressed the Assembly last year we have successfully completed a two-year transitionprogramme to democratic civilian rule with the entry intoforce of a new Constitution for the Second Republic inJanuary this year. Successful free and fair presidential andNational Assembly elections were held earlier  inSeptember 1996 and early January 1997. Most of theinstitutions provided for under the new Constitution arealready in place and have started to play their legitimaterole in the promotion and entrenchment of a genuinedemocratic culture that is commensurate with the hopesand aspirations of all Gambians. Throughout the transitionprocess  the people of the Gambia have been regularlyconsulted; their views and aspirations have guided theprocess. In this exercise we have been faithful to ourwishes. The Gambian National Assembly  which isplaying its important role in our nation-building  has beenreadmitted to the Commonwealth ParliamentaryAssociation  where we will continue to participateactively.Alive to the fact that genuine democracy can neitherthrive nor be nurtured and sustained in the midst ofpoverty  deprivation  hunger  ignorance and ill-health  theGambia Government embarked on an ambitious socio-economic development programme during the two-yeartransition period  which focused basically on buildingschools  health facilities  roads and other infrastructure aswell as on boosting agricultural development in order toensure food self-sufficiency by the year 1999. The mainobjective of this programme was to lay the basis for agenuine and sustainable democracy that is in consonancewith our own social and other specificities as a nation.The successful completion of the transition periodintensified our Government’s determination to continuethe effective implementation of measures and programmesdesigned to promote and achieve the sustained socio-economic development of the Gambia. In order toaccomplish this task  the Government of the Gambia  incollaboration with the private sector  has embarked on theimplementation of a national development programme totransform the country economically and socially over a25-year period into a developed  economically viableState. The blueprint for this socio-economic developmentis called Vision 2020. The overall orientation of thisdevelopment blueprint  as enunciated in its missionstatement  is:“To transform the Gambia into a financialcentre  a tourist paradise  a trading export-orientedagricultural and manufacturing nation  thriving on22free market policies and a vibrant private sector sustained by a well-educated  trained  skilled  healthy self-reliant and enterprising population  andguaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decentstandard of living for one and all  under a system ofgovernment based on the consent of the citizenry”.It is obvious from that mission statement that we inthe Gambia have opted for a holistic development strategythat is human-centred and export-oriented  and founded onfree market principles. As rightly pointed out by HisExcellency President Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh in hisforeword to Vision 2020 “This means that the production base of theeconomy will be strengthened and diversified to caterfor the needs of an export-oriented industry. In pursuitof pragmatism  Vision 2020 will build on the soundmacroeconomic policies of our recent past whilelaunching a new partnership contract between thepublic and private sectors to spin faster growth withequity.”In this connection  the Gambia has embarked on asustained effort to enhance bilateral and multilateralcooperation with all friendly countries and institutions inorder to ensure the realization of our development goals asenshrined in Vision 2020. In pursuit of these goals  we willnot relent in our efforts to develop and enhance intra-African cooperation and solidarity in all vital sectors for theattainment of sustained economic growth. It is in fact theGambia’s firm belief and conviction that it is only throughsuch cooperation  founded on self-reliance and hard work that African countries can adequately rise to the dauntingdevelopment challenges facing them.To complement our own efforts at the national subregional and regional levels  no effort will be spared todevelop and enhance cooperation with all traditionaldevelopment partners as well as new friends in conformitywith the underlying principles of the Gambia’s foreignpolicy objectives  which are predicated on openness peaceful coexistence  genuine respect for each other’s pointof view and full equality in international intercourse withall countries. We strongly believe that it is only throughdialogue and the constant quest to understand the points ofview of others that we can aspire to attain world peace mutual trust and understanding.Here  I would like to underline again that thecentrepiece of the Gambia’s foreign policy is the promotionof African solidarity and self-reliance and the enhancementof world peace. That is why we are friends of allcountries of the world irrespective of ideological orpolitical differences. This policy is predicated on ourstrong belief that the world is one family  and that it paysno dividends to isolate any member of that great family because any member of the family which feels isolatedquickly becomes intransigent and hostile in its dealingswith the rest of us. It is therefore paramount for us tomaintain lines of dialogue between ourselves  which canonly promote understanding.On global economic issues  we note that the worldeconomic outlook continues to be influenced strongly bythe forces of economic globalization and tradeliberalization  which in themselves are not negativetrends  provided they are underpinned by a genuine desireon the part of all concerned to promote partnership  in anenvironment where equality reigns supreme.The persistent slow rate of development in Africacan be traced to certain factors and impediments. Africa’sforeign debt crisis remains a major impediment to growth.The international community’s effort to resolve Africa’sexternal debt problem continues to fall short of thedesired result. The Heavily Indebted Poor CountriesInitiative  recently adopted by the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and the World Bank  while complementingthe global effort  also fell short of the expected target ofcomplete cancellation of the debt stock of developingcountries. Unless this is done  the debt burden willnaturally continue to have a negative impact on theavailability of existing resources to finance Africa’seconomic recovery and social development.Also  the growth and expansion of the incidence ofpoverty in Africa has contributed to the failure to achievesustainable development on the continent. The sombreconclusions on the increase of poverty reflect  in a widersense  the seeming lack of the required commitment bythe international community to promote social progressand the qualitative improvement of the human condition as recommended by the World Summit for SocialDevelopment.Here I want to state that my country  the Gambia has embarked on a bold national plan of action for theeradication of poverty  and I want to commend the UnitedNations system  the World Bank and other bilateralpartners that are actively assisting us to achieve our goalsin this domain. We thank them for their continuedsupport. Poverty  we all agree  is a global problem thatneeds to be addressed by all of us.23The pursuit of global peace and security remains afundamental responsibility of our Organization. It is however  regrettable that the international community’seffort to achieve international peace and security has beenconstrained by continued conflicts and other forms oftension between States and communities.In our own subregion of West Africa  the situationevolving in Sierra Leone remains of grave concern  notonly to us but also to the international community. Failureto resolve the problem and restore stability  security andconstitutionality in Sierra Leone can only prolong the ordealof the innocent and peace-loving people of that country.Therefore  we all hope that the initiatives embarked uponby the Economic Community of West African State(ECOWAS) within the framework of the Committee ofFive will yield the anticipated results. I am pleased to notethat the approach adopted by the Committee of Five to finda solution to the Sierra Leone crisis has the support of theUnited Nations Security Council and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU).It is hoped that the restoration of constitutionaldemocracy in Liberia following the national elections heldon 19 July 1997 will lead to a permanent peaceful solutionto the country’s crisis  paving the way for sustainednational reconstruction. All of us in the subregion aregiving our material and moral support to the sister Republicof Liberia to help it stay on the path of nationalreconciliation in order to recover fully from its tragedies ofthe recent past.With regard to the Middle East  despite the significantprogress of the past few years in the Middle East peaceprocess  especially since the signing of the Oslo accords we note with concern the erosion of the peace dividendaccumulated in the international community’s effort toachieve durable peace there. The recent escalation oftension between Israel and Palestine over the extension ofIsraeli settlements in East Jerusalem constitutes a seriousthreat to peace and security in the region.The adoption by the General Assembly of resolutionES-10/3 of 15 July 1997  as well as other peace initiativesby the international community should  however  providethe basis for a peaceful and permanent solution to theconflict.On a more general note  we in the Gambia stronglybelieve that the containment of tension and conflict globallycan be enhanced by transparency  the restoration of mutualtrust and confidence and respect for the rights of peoples communities and nations in the execution of the role andmandates of the United Nations. As I indicated earlier  itis only through genuine dialogue and the desire and willto understand each other that we can achieve globalpeace.In this regard  my delegation strongly supports theaspiration of the 21.3 million people of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan to exercise their right to share andparticipate in the activities of intergovernmentalorganizations on international cooperation by joining thiscomity of nations. The legitimacy of their aspirations both legal and national  has been reinforced by similaractions and measures taken by the United Nations on theissue of parallel representation  which now serve as usefulreminders and examples. The Taiwan question is also atest of the international community’s interpretation ofdemocracy. As we are all aware  the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan has existed  physically  legally and politically since the foundation of the United Nations. MyGovernment therefore believes that our Organization willdo itself a great service by admitting Taiwan into ourmidst  in the true spirit of the application of democraticprinciples. The presence of the Republic of China onTaiwan among us can only enrich our Organization. Inthis regard  we therefore believe that resolution 2758(XXVI) adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly  needs to be reviewed.Concerning the legal dispute surrounding thebombing of Pan Am flight 103  the Gambia supports theresolution on the matter adopted by the OAU Heads ofState or Government in Harare last May as providing aviable framework for resolving the present impasse.With regard to Cuba  it is incomprehensible to usGambians why a whole people  a whole nation  should bemade to suffer the denial of the basic necessities of lifesimply because it chooses to live under a differentpolitical ideology. Therefore  in the present climate ofgreater international cooperation and reconciliation  thepeople of Cuba and their Government deserve the supportand assistance of the international community in theircontinued efforts to engage in more meaningful nationaldevelopment in order to achieve greater socio-economicprogress. We fully support the measures being taken bythis body to provide this support. In doing so  ourOrganization will only be upholding the principle ofrespecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.It is in this same spirit that we call on theinternational community to continue to preserve the24dignity and security of the people and the Government ofKuwait and to support the full implementation of therelevant Security Council resolutions on payment ofreparations and compensation  release of prisoners of warand other conditions imposed on Iraq for its internationallycondemned act of aggression against Kuwait. Therefore while we encourage greater United Nations intervention inbringing solace to the suffering  innocent Iraqi civilianpopulation  we strongly urge the Government of Iraq tocomply with the provisions of these Security Councilresolutions  in order to alleviate the suffering  especiallythat of the children.That catalogue of conflicts and misunderstandings hasprompted my Government and people to formulate thefollowing wish  which we want to express to theinternational community: we want the United Nations andthe international community to make a solemn pledge toensure that all conflicts are peacefully resolved by the year2000. In order to achieve this noble aim  we propose  first that 1998 be declared a year for the resolution of allconflicts between Member States; and  secondly  that 1999 as it is on the eve of the twenty-first century  be a yeardevoid of conflicts and misunderstanding  to become theyear of reconciliation.This  we believe  will enable humankind to enter thetwenty-first century as a united  peaceful family that canproudly bequeath to ensuing generations a developed peaceful world  where democracy  justice  freedom andequality are guaranteed to everyone  irrespective of origin race  religion or political ideology. That is what the Gambiawants to bequeath to coming generations  and we stronglybelieve that all it takes is tolerance  mutual respect  love patience and understanding.With regard to global trade relations  we followed withhigh expectation the conclusion of the Uruguay Round ofmultilateral trade negotiations and its implementation.While encouraging globalization and liberalization  itdeprived developing countries  particularly those in Africa of the opportunities and benefits predicted during itsimplementation.We note  however  that the liberalization of trade andinvestment policies has yet to foster internationalcooperation for the achievement of economic developmentand genuine partnership among all nations. Developingcountries in general  and African and the least developedcountries in particular  are yet to be effectively integratedinto the world economy. The commitments agreed in theFinal Act of the Uruguay Round have not been fullyimplemented.International cooperation has  however  continued toflourish in other equally important areas. The promotionand expansion of South-South cooperation continues toreceive greater support among developing countries.These cooperation initiatives have resulted in theProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States  among many otherinitiatives. Within the context of promoting South-Southcooperation  Japan has successfully held the TokyoInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD I) and it is now planning to host a follow-upconference  TICAD II  next year  in an effort to developa practical  achievable and sustainable developmentprogramme for Africa.It is indeed commendable that this Japanese initiativeis not restricted to Africa  but also includes the evolutionof a new development strategy responsive to the presentinternational development climate  and is providing themotivating force for a concerted global effort. Wecommend Japan for these initiatives  including financialcontributions which serve as a practical demonstration ofSouth-South cooperative interaction and application.It should  however  be pointed out that thepromotion and application of South-South cooperationwithin the context of technical and economic cooperationamong developing countries can only succeed as animportant aspect of international development cooperationif both the South and North remain committed to its fullrealization.Intra-African economic cooperation and integrationhave also been growing. Regional activities are nowdirected to the socio-economic transformation andintegration of the economies of African States. Theadoption and implementation of the Abuja Treaty  puttingin place economic integration arrangements  is a positiveeffort in building an African Economic Community. Theinaugural session of the African Economic Communitywas held during the thirty-third summit of Heads of Stateand Government of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) in June this year. We in Africa are becomingmore and more aware of the paramount importance ofself-reliance. Any assistance from development partnersmust be seen as a complement to what we can or shoulddo by ourselves.25Within the context of subregional cooperation  theGambia hosted the twelfth summit of Heads of State andGovernment of the Permanent Inter-State Committee forDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS)  held in Banjul from11 to 12 September 1997. The summit unanimously electedHis Excellency Colonel Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  Presidentof the Republic of the Gambia  as chairman of theorganization for the next three years. These meetings andactivities testify to the importance attached to the issues ofdrought and desertification  not only in Africa  but also inother parts of the world  and to the urgent need for asustained collaborative effort to combat the twin menace. Inthis regard  the Gambia is fully and actively participating inthe ongoing Rome Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Convention to Combat Desertification in ThoseCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification  Particularly in Africa. In fact  we shouldredouble the resources provided and the measures so faradopted to combat drought and desertification and improveour environment in accordance with the provisions of theConvention  and also of chapter 12 of Agenda 21  adoptedat the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment. In furtherance of these targets we intend toachieve  as President Yahya Jammeh stated  sustainabledevelopment and food security through research into theunderlying phenomena of drought  desertification andecological instability and by designing and implementingprogrammes for natural resource management and theimprovement of agro-food sectors in the Sahel  as well asthe sustainability of farming systems.I will conclude with the subject of reform of theUnited Nations system  a subject very dear to the hearts ofGambians. The reform of the United Nations systemcontinues to engage our collective attention. Reformactivities — including the restructuring and revitalization ofthe United Nations in the economic  social and relatedfields  especially the work of the Economic and SocialCouncil; and the efforts of the High-level Open-endedWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United NationsSystem in formulating innovative mechanisms to enhancethe role and functions of the General Assembly and itsmain Committees  as well as of the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council —continue to attract wide debate  both at the United Nationsand in other forums. These include OAU  which at thesummit of Heads of State and Government held in Hararein June adopted a Declaration on the reform of the SecurityCouncil to which the Gambia remains firmly committed.It is my Government’s firm belief and convictionthat there is an urgent need to democratize the UnitedNations  and especially the Security Council  to make itmore responsive to the hopes and aspirations of all itsMembers for a world devoid of intolerance  injustice andinequality. There is therefore a need to curb the use of theveto  which is exercised by some Powers in the SecurityCouncil against the wishes of the vast majority of theMembers of our Organization. The geopolitical andhistorical considerations that were at the heart of thepresent composition and mandate of the Security Councilno longer prevail. The composition of the SecurityCouncil should therefore be reflective of the realities ofour times  and the powers of the individual MemberStates therein seen in the same light.We also firmly believe that it is necessary to ensurethat United Nations resolutions and  indeed  decisions bythe International Court of Justice are respected  obeyedand implemented by all countries. It is not fair that whilesome countries are chastised for violating United Nationsresolutions  others seem to violate them with impunity.With regard to the Secretary-General’s Track 2reform proposals  the report (A/51/950) entitled“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme forReform” includes bold and far-reaching measures andproposals. The Gambia generally supports the Secretary-General’s reform proposals  in particular the following.First  we have that of creating a dividend fordevelopment. The effectiveness of this initiative woulddepend on Member States meeting their financialcontributions to the Organization on time. Moreover  theinitiative should serve as a catalyst for donors to providegreater support for development by meeting the agreedtarget contribution of 0.7 per cent of their gross nationalproduct.Secondly  the creation of the post of DeputySecretary-General is timely  given the increasingmandates of the Organization. However  it is expectedthat the role of the Deputy Secretary-General would gobeyond mobilization of funds for the Organization toincorporate administrative coordination. The length of stayin office of the incumbent should be determined.Thirdly  restructuring and regrouping of organs andagencies to facilitate their effectiveness and productivityshould be guided by agreed principles  procedures andoperational objectives to prevent a reduction of their26usefulness while enhancing the achievements of theirspecific goals.Fourthly  the fiscal measures  including zero growthand personnel cuts  are necessary. It is expected that thiswill not impair the Organization’s capability to fullydischarge all its responsibilities.Fifthly  the putting into effect of “UN House” — thecommon premises system for all United Nations agenciesserving in one country — is necessary and timely  given thesubstantial savings to be derived from the sharing ofcommon services. Additionally  maintaining a commonidentity and location in a country would enhance the UnitedNations presence as a world Organization  as well as itsaccessibility in terms of speed and effectivecommunication. It will also minimize confusion  wasteand duplication of efforts.Suffice it to say that the Gambia will continue tostudy the Secretary-General’s reform proposals and theirbroad implications for the Organization and MemberStates in the years ahead.Lastly  as we continue with the reform of the UnitedNations system after over 50 years of operations  so mustwe also continue to address the weaknesses  inequalitiesand inadequacies inherent in the international economicand social system  global trade  finance and investment international development and so on in order to achievemore meaningful international cooperation and globalpartnership  the promotion and preservation of humanrights and fundamental freedoms  the right todevelopment  good governance and economic growth —all cherished hallmarks of sustainable development andhuman achievements."
"64",2735,"GNB",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on behalfof my country  Guinea-Bissau  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly and to reiterate ourconfidence in your ability to conduct the work of thissession successfully. You can rest assured of thewillingness of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau to cooperatewith you.I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute toyour predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the innovative and constructive manner in which hecarried out his task.Congratulations are also due the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who  since his assumption of theOrganization’s highest office  has shouldered his importantresponsibilities with great resolve  inter alia with regard toUnited Nations reform. We encourage him to continue hiswork with the same dynamic spirit in order better to adaptour Organization to the current and future needs of aworld in flux.The General Assembly is meeting at a time when theOrganization is going through a period of complextransition that has brought several questions to the fore.Guinea-Bissau is nevertheless convinced of the ability ofthe Organization and of Member States to define newpolicies and to develop suitable structures to deal with thenew challenges that are being posed by internationalproblems.During the observance of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations the leaders of the entire worldsolemnly reaffirmed the irreplaceable nature of theOrganization’s role as well as the need to reform andmodernize the United Nations. The historic Declarationadopted at that time should continue to form the basis ofthe Organization’s work  laying down as it does aframework for global action based on the principles andideals of the Charter.Accordingly  we welcome the important initiativesfor reform taken by the Secretary-General  which in mydelegation’s view are deserving of the support of MemberStates.My delegation believes that the expansion anddemocratization of the Security Council are also prioritymatters. That important body must reflect  both in itscomposition and in its decisions  the concerns of allMembers and should have a more transparent basis anda more equitable geographical representation.Therefore  in keeping with the Harare Declaration ofHeads of State and Government of the countries membersof the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  we believethat Africa should have two permanent seats in the SecurityCouncil  with the same privileges as the current members.Similarly  we believe that the candidacies of Japan Germany and Brazil to be permanent members of theSecurity Council deserve the serious attention of Guinea-Bissau  without prejudice to other proposals before us forconsideration.The United Nations has played a decisive role ininternational affairs since its founding. However  thechallenges we are facing at the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury are unprecedented and call for greater efforts fromthe Organization and all its Members  particularly inseeking the solution to financial problems  a sine qua nonfor effective progress in the reform process.Despite the Organization’s commitment tointernational peace and security  conflicts and fratricidalwars continue in various parts of the world  causing loss oflife  massive displacements of population and floods ofrefugees. Africa  unfortunately  continues to furnish tragicexamples of such scourges. The seriousness of these criseson our continent prompted the Security Council to devotea ministerial meeting to such problems on 25 September ofthis year in an effort to analyse their causes and proposesuitable solutions.In addition to conflicts in Angola  Burundi  Rwandaand Somalia  there are new tensions and crises in SierraLeone  the Republic of the Congo and the Central AfricanRepublic.In respect to Angola  a country with which Guinea-Bissau enjoys a relationship of deep friendship  wewelcome the progress made there towards restoring peaceand achieving national reconciliation  and we encourageUNITA to make the efforts necessary to bring tocompletion the tasks set forth in the Lusaka Protocol.In Burundi  the Republic of the Congo  the CentralAfrican Republic and Somalia dialogue must prevail in thesearch for solutions to the problems that affect thosecountries.In Sierra Leone  the United Nations — the SecurityCouncil in particular — must support the efforts of theEconomic Community of West African States and OAU torestore the democratically elected Government.In Liberia  we welcome the holding of free and fairelections and the return to peace. We urge theinternational community to continue to provide aid forreconstruction and the consolidation of peace anddemocracy in that country.Turning to Western Sahara  Guinea-Bissau welcomesthe recent agreement concluded between the variousparties and hopes that this new understanding will lead toa definitive solution to this question through the holdingof a referendum on self-determination.The sanctions imposed on Libya by the SecurityCouncil in 1992 seriously affect innocent people. Guinea-Bissau encourages the parties concerned to seek  throughnegotiations  a just solution to that question. The jointproposals of OAU and the League of Arab States meritthe attention of the international community.Recent events in the Middle East have weakened thepeace process. We urge the State of Israel and thePalestinian Authority to continue their dialogue to restorea climate of confidence  which is so essential to theestablishment of a just  lasting and comprehensive peacein the region.We are also concerned at the slow pace of theimplementation of the peace agreement in Bosnia andHerzegovina  and we appeal to the various parties to showgreater determination to resolve the conflict.In East Timor  we continue to support thenegotiations conducted under the auspices of theSecretary-General to find a just and definitive solution tothis question.The embargo imposed on Cuba continues seriouslyto affect that country’s people and development process.We appeal to the parties to take the necessary stepstowards a definitive and satisfactory solution to thisproblem.On behalf of our Government  we should also liketo reiterate our conviction that the Republic of China onTaiwan deserves to regain its rightful place in the UnitedNations on the basis of respect for the principle ofuniversality and the sovereign equality of States. TheRepublic of China on Taiwan  a democratic country ofover 20 million people that has made enormous progressin the economic and social field and with regard torespect for basic human rights  is today a reality thatcannot be ignored. The readmission of the Republic of2China to the United Nations and to all its specializedagencies would be an important factor for peace  stabilityand international cooperation.Mindful of the fact that the United Nations  and theSecurity Council in particular  play an essential role in themaintenance of international peace and security  we attachspecial importance to regional bodies with respect toconflict prevention and resolution.In our subregion  the Economic Community of WestAfrican States has  with unprecedented success  beenmanaging the crisis in Liberia through the establishmentand deployment of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group. Thesteps undertaken through the Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) deserve specialmention. Given the magnitude and complexity of theproblems to be resolved  that organ needs increased supportfrom the international community to complete its mission.In this context  we believe that any approach tostrengthening the capacities of African countries to prevent manage and resolve conflicts must be supported. Thus  wewelcome with interest the joint initiative of the UnitedStates  France and Great Britain in this area under the aegisof OAU.Guinea-Bissau welcomes the adoption in Oslo of adraft convention for the complete elimination of anti-personnel landmines and urges all countries to accede to itso that it may enter into force as soon as possible.The intolerable persistence of poverty in the world particularly in Africa  requires the ongoing mobilization ofthe international community and the elaboration withininternational bodies of coherent policies to confront themajor problems of development. Given the fact that Africahas more least developed countries than any other continentin the world  the General Assembly’s recent adoption of theAgenda for Development is of the greatest interest to us.Africa continues to suffer the negative effects of theproblems of external debt  deteriorating terms of trade difficult access for its products to international markets anddecreased investment. Moreover  the effects of theglobalization of the economy and the drop in officialdevelopment assistance have reduced the capacity ofAfrican countries to tackle socio-economic problemssuccessfully. The initiatives of the Paris Club  the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund to provide debtrelief — initiatives that have already benefited someAfrican countries — meet our concerns and we hope thatGuinea-Bissau will soon be able to profit by them.Respect for and the full exercise of fundamentalhuman rights are factors for freedom  peace andguaranteed internal stability. Guinea-Bissau  whichrecognizes the importance of good governance  pluralisticdemocracy and a state of law  continues to work for thepreservation of values intrinsic to the dignity of theindividual and his full  harmonious development. In thisregard  we wish to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson onher timely nomination to the post of United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. We wish her everysuccess in the performance of her duties and call on allMember States to lend her the support she needs.The rational use of our world’s natural resources andenvironmental protection are responsibilities which  tovarying degrees  fall to all mankind. Guinea-Bissau has together with its partners  defined a strategy forsustainable development that respects ecological balances.The disappointing results of the review of theimplementation of Agenda 21 at last June’s specialsession of the General Assembly is clear proof that theinternational community must be much more committedto defining agreed policies for environmental protection.The achievement of the ideals of the United Nationsto which our peoples aspire  the need to reform andmodernize our Organization  and international cooperativeefforts are all the subjects of our collective thinking andthe inspiration of our ongoing commitment. Indeed  giventhe challenges of the late twentieth century  ourOrganization continues to embody the greatest hopes ofour peoples for a future of progress  well-being  socialjustice and understanding among all peoples.As Mr. João Bernardo Vieira  President of theRepublic of Guinea-Bissau  said during the celebration ofthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary:“I would call for greater ... coordination of ourefforts in order to forge a world Organizationcapable of preserving future generations from thescourge of war and to give the poorest and mosthelpless true reasons for hope  thus safeguarding thecommon interests of mankind.” "
"65",2774,"GNQ",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  it is a pleasurefor me to join preceding speakers in congratulating you onthe high distinction bestowed upon you and your countrythrough your election to preside over this regular session ofthe General Assembly  to which we have all come imbuedwith our shared aspirations for the future of mankind. Onceagain  we come to this forum to convey the warmestgreetings of solidarity  peace and hope of the people andGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and  inparticular  to express my country’s views on the issues tobe debated at this session.We are three years away from a new millennium.This waiting period is an opportunity to think deeplyabout the challenges it has in store for us. We havemoved in a very short time from a bipolar world  markedby the cold war and both strategic and ideologicalconfrontations  to the new dynamics of globalization andthe interdependence of States in their relations within theinternational system.Indeed  when we consider that the millennium isabout to end and that our Organization has now been inexistence for more than 50 years  we must admit that agreat deal has been achieved in terms of progress formankind  particularly in the spheres of economic scientific and technological development. Unfortunately however  there are still grey areas of uncertainty asregards the future of mankind and the possibilities ofestablishing peace and security throughout the world.In third world countries such as ours  for example the lives of millions of people have been affected by ahalt to progress and development as a result of extremepoverty  wars and armed conflicts and of the resurgenceof mercenary activities and organized crime. In brief  thepeople are subjected to wanton violence  and as a resultsocial  political and economic systems are breaking down.We believe that the burden placed on our peoples istoo great and that their problems require a lasting andstable response from the United Nations  to include theelimination of neo-interventionist practices; the preventionof conflicts; the reduction of poverty; the elimination ofneo-protectionist barriers in world trade; and help in thefight against terrorism  fundamentalism and anachronisticnationalism. The preservation of the environment and thefight against drug-trafficking and the consumption ofillicit drugs must also be prime objectives of ourcollective action. These problems are not restricted to theterritory of a single State  and therefore their solutiondemands the involvement and solidarity of all nations theworld over  in a context of consensus and morecoordinated international cooperation.This  in turn  creates the need to ensure democraticreform of institutions and organizations of a global scope.The division of the world into categories must become athing of the past  although we agree that some among us7must shoulder special responsibilities vis-à-vis mankindsince they  in a sense  are the ones responsible for certainthreats that face us: the nuclear threat  the large-scaleproduction and sale of armaments  the deterioration of theenvironment and the exercise of absolute power over theeconomy  finance and advances in science  technology andinformation. For if a third world exists today  it is onlybecause someone exploited it to create a first world. We donot intend to wait for the emergence of a fourth worldwhose means and resources we can exploit to becomedeveloped. The point is to make sure that the resourcesamassed by the first world  the countries of the North  aretoday made available to the developing countries. For thatto happen  the international trading system must be fair poverty must be reduced  the social development andscientific and technological advance of developing countriesmust be fostered and the debt problem must be alleviated.In short  the differences in the quality of life that separatethe citizens of the North from those of the South must bedrastically reduced  in a spirit of open solidarity that willwork for the progress and development of all countries.All these aspects are the real issues to be discussed aswe strive to attain lasting world peace and sustainabledevelopment in the coming millennium. The United Nationsmust therefore become a much more global and democraticworld Organization so that it can take a dynamic approachto the problems weighing on mankind. It must bemodernized  brought up to date and in tune with the newtimes  able to express the common will of all nations.Therefore  it must be restructured.In this connection  Equatorial Guinea feels  as domany others  that it is time to reform the decision-makingbody of the United Nations  the Security Council. Withregard to reform  we do not know whether it is the numberof the Council’s members that has prevented the UnitedNations from functioning with greater flexibility andefficiency. Nor are we sure that an increase in the numberof permanent members will make for a more representativeUnited Nations. What we must attempt to gain is morevoices expressing the will of the peoples to see a moreprosperous  peaceful and lastingly stable world. If thiscannot be achieved by returning to the General Assemblyits legitimate rights  it would be reasonable to have moremembers of the Security Council representing the regionsand to ensure that the rules governing the use of the vetotake into account the interest of the majority.Equatorial Guinea is interested in ensuring that wehave a properly functioning mechanism for agreement thatreflects  above all  the spirit of equity and justice within theUnited Nations. For Equatorial Guinea  which is a smallcountry in terms of both area and population  thedemocratic functioning of the United Nations provides aguarantee of security and stability in internationalrelations and  above all  ensures scrupulous respect forevery nation’s right of sovereignty.It is no idle claim that countries like ours do notreceive appropriate treatment in relations between States.This applies  for example  to the vague demands relatingto the universal principle of respect for fundamentalhuman rights  which include political  economic andsocial rights.In the specific case of Equatorial Guinea  it isneither understandable nor acceptable that  despite ourgreat efforts to achieve a participatory democracy andrespect for human rights  international public opinion isstill being manipulated by some in order to project a falseimage of our country to the outside world for reasons thatare inconsistent with this universal principle. We do notbelieve that anyone has a monopoly on values and virtuesin this respect.However  some years ago my country reached theconclusion that respect for human rights comes from acontinuous process and not from an immediate responseto criteria and demands imposed by groups or individualswith partisan political interests. It is in this context thatthe Government of Equatorial Guinea  of its own freewill  is participating in and cooperating with all theinitiatives of the United Nations and certain friendlycountries to consolidate respect for human rights in thecountry. To that end  working with the United NationsCommission on Human Rights and the United NationsCentre for Human Rights  we have already organizedvarious training  educational and information programmesrelating to human rights.My country is also proud to be one of the fewcountries in the world that  of its own free will  hasagreed with another country — in our case  the UnitedStates of America — a technical and financial assistanceprogramme for measures aimed at the better exercisewithin our society of all human rights. In the context ofthis programme  far-reaching legal reforms have been setout to regulate this exercise of rights  as well as toachieve better administration and governance by the State.All these measures will be free from political interferencebased on ideological or partisan interests.8From this rostrum  therefore  I should like to confirmto international public opinion that in Equatorial Guineahuman rights form an integral part of the priorities of theGovernment and of all the political forces of the nation andthat we are critiquing and continuously assessing ourprogress. We do not  therefore  need either the approval orthe guidance of any other society or institution in order toevaluate this tangible reality. Nor do we need anyfavourable or unfavourable propaganda from internationalmedia that may be linked to interests and pressure groupswith hidden agendas.We certainly agree that the same degree of pressurethat is brought to bear with regard to the political rights ofpeoples must also be brought to bear in order to bringabout more concrete support for the right of peoples todevelopment and the progress of nations. It is ourunanimous desire that in the third millennium the millionsof men  women and children of the world will have theright to health services  education  decent housing  drinkingwater  electricity  food and clothing. But this objectivecannot be achieved through restrictive measures andpolicies or through discriminatory economic blockades. Wealso wish to note that even these policies are not appliedequitably throughout the international community.Nevertheless  thanks to our strong conviction that wemust play the principal role in our own development  todaymore than ever Equatorial Guinea is being targeted bycertain forces and is becoming a strategically andeconomically significant zone in the subregion of centralAfrica. At the economic level  our country has just attainedthe status of oil-producing country  and attempts are beingmade to destabilize it for purposes of hegemony and forstrategic reasons. Exactly five months ago  thanks to thespirit of African solidarity demonstrated by our sisterrepublic of Angola  my country was saved from anattempted invasion by mercenaries  which was organizedand financed by certain foreign political groups with murkyand undisclosed designs on our nation.Instability in the subregion of central Africa is todaythreatening the security of the region and the continent.Plans  strategies and machinery for destabilization are beingfashioned from outside the region that are capable ofdestroying the present incipient democratic regimes in theregion. Powerful communications media are activelyinvolved in systematically distorting  disinformation and themisrepresentation of everything that is happening in theregion. The situation in Angola  the Republic of the Congo Rwanda and Burundi  as well as the recent conflicts in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  have been presentedto international public opinion as Dantesque and apocalyptic.We ask the United Nations to follow up oneverything that is taking place in this region  particularlyin the area of the Gulf of Guinea  from the Niger riverdelta to the enclave of Cabinda  as well as in the GreatLakes region.In the specific case of the Republic of the Congo  asister country with which we share common interests  theGovernment of Equatorial Guinea fully supports theinternational mediation efforts of the President of theRepublic of Gabon  Mr. El Hadj Omar Bongo and of thespecial representative of the United Nations and of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU).We have the feeling that a new cold war is beingwaged in Africa based on cultural and linguisticinfluences. The fact that English  French  Portuguese andSpanish languages are spoken should only serve to enrichour values and capacities in terms of internationalcooperation and should be not a factor for confrontationand antagonism based on hegemony. This phenomenonhas a serious adverse effect on our ability to achieve unityat the continental level in Africa for the peacefulresolution of conflicts. We therefore appeal to the UnitedNations and the OAU to initiate consensus-based actionsthat will lead to the reduction of such differences.In this context  my Government is making efforts tomaintain an internal and regional balance by developinga policy based on dialogue  consensus and good-neighbourliness  which are indispensable tools forensuring peace and security in the continent.In this process of political and economic changethere have been setbacks and difficulties  but we havekept determinedly to the upward path that will enable usto leave behind a past that produced severe economicregressiveness and a breakdown of democratic principlesand values. We want Equatorial Guinea to be includedfully within the dynamics of change and globalization.We want to ensure that we are incorporated into theregenerative trend of free market economy with a strongsocial component and dialogue based on patriotism flexibility and tolerance among all the political forces andthroughout civil society in our country.Indeed  we have just held  from 8 to 13 September1997  a national economic conference designed essentiallyto bring about a national dialogue to achieve a definition9of a consensus-based strategy involving all political forces civil society  non-governmental organizations and religiousassociations  with the participation of international agenciesof the United Nations system  the World Bank  theEuropean Union and African regional and subregionalorganizations  as well as friendly nations  aimed atimplementing structural reforms in the economy andsustainable development of the country  through the rationaland transparent use of oil  forest and fishing resources.In the political field  we will proceed with the free andtransparent reform of laws regulating the exercise ofdemocratic liberties to achieve better governance for ournation. We have the firm political determination to attainthese objectives and to meet our commitments  and weappeal for international solidarity.I cannot conclude without expressing  on behalf of theGovernment of Equatorial Guinea  our warmestcongratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan on his wise and sound suggestions for reforming the bodiesof the United Nations.Equatorial Guinea will continue to support thoseefforts  aimed at achieving more dynamic and flexiblemechanisms and structures for peacekeeping and thepromotion of balanced and sustainable social and economicdevelopment in the world."
"66",2820,"GRC",52,1997,"﻿Before I begin my speech may I associate myself with the final appeal made byPrince Albert of Monaco  who preceded me at this rostrum.Perhaps this Organization can be instrumental in achievingan Olympic truce for the Olympic Games of 2000 and forthose of 2004  which we will host in Athens. I think thatthis is an initiative that the Organization should takeseriously.Allow me to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection. Your qualities and skills augur well for theprogress of this session. Moreover  I am especially pleasedto salute in your person a representative of the Ukraine  acountry with which Greece maintains long-standing friendlyrelations. I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail  for the effective manner inwhich he performed his functions.The Greek Government is impressed with the way thenew Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has beendischarging his duties. His great experience warrants thehope that his ongoing endeavours aiming at the reform ofthis Organization will be crowned with success.On this occasion  I would like to express myappreciation to the United Nations membership at largefor electing Greece to one of the positions of Vice-President of the General Assembly.Earlier this week  the Foreign Minister ofLuxembourg  in his capacity as President of the Councilof the European Union  delivered a statement to whichmy Government fully subscribes; we subscribe as well asto the Union’s memorandum  which has been submittedto the Assembly. I would like  however  to elaboratefurther on some issues of particular interest to mycountry.As the millennium draws to a close  Greece  locatedat a crossroads of countries and civilizations  is strivingto free the twenty-first century from the scourges of thepast  thus offering to our region prospects of progress andprosperity. We are the only member of both the EuropeanUnion and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) in our region  and we thus we function as thelatter’s link to Europe  guided by our firm belief thatconflicts and prejudices have to be overcome throughrespect for international law and the principles of theUnited Nations.In this context  we believe that Greece is able toplay an important role in the Security Council and aretherefore seeking election to that body  to one of the twonon-permanent seats allocated to the Group of WesternEuropean and Other States for the biennium 1999-2000.Deeply dedicated to the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter  we are ready to take our share ofresponsibility for international peace and security. Indeed Greece has been actively participating in severalpeacekeeping operations as a troop-contributing country.This year  we became a member of the SpecialCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations. We haveadvocated the Committee’s expansion as a positive stepforward  and we support any effort aimed at improvingthe peacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations.Furthermore  Greece has confirmed its willingness toparticipate in the stand-by arrangements system and hasjoined other Member States in the continued efforts to4enable the Organization to react more quickly and moreefficiently to future peacekeeping requirements. As Ireaffirm our palpable commitment to peacekeeping  I wishalso to express my country’s deep appreciation for thecourage and dedication shown by peacekeeping personnelin confronting challenges to peace and security.Comprehensive reform and restructuring of the UnitedNations system  including the size and working methods ofthe Security Council  must be attained with a view tomeeting the changing needs of the world community as itmoves into the next millennium. The reform packagepresented by the Secretary-General in July is a response tothis necessity and constitutes a welcome step towardsmodernizing and strengthening the United Nations. Greecewill contribute in a constructive and positive way to thesuccess of the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-Generalthrough his proposals.We live in a world characterized by globalization andthe introduction of new technologies; hence  the UnitedNations is called upon to pursue a broader set of objectivesfocusing on democratic development  sustainabledevelopment and higher living standards for all citizens ofthe world. The political commitment of its Member Statesand their contribution of adequate resources constitute thetwo fundamental prerequisites for the success of the UnitedNations. In this context  we welcome the determination ofall Member States  in particular those that play a major rolein the Organization’s decision-making process  to fulfil theirfinancial obligations on time and in full.Greece  a State Member of the United Nations since1945  will continue to honour its obligations to the UnitedNations  gradually increasing its annual contribution to thepeacekeeping operations budget  moving from group C togroup B on its own initiative.The nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly  on the overall review and appraisal of theimplementation of Agenda 21  held last June  gave us theopportunity five years after the United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development  the Rio Conference  torenew and reinforce our commitment to sustainabledevelopment. Greece  with one third of the coastline of theentire Mediterranean basin and almost 3 000 islands  has aspecific interest in promoting the management of coastalzones  sustainable tourism  sustainable water managementand policies to combat desertification and deforestation.We have been uninterruptedly implementing a long-term strategy for the protection of the environment whilesharing with the international community the belief thatAgenda 21 can be implemented only through a sense ofcommon responsibility. However  the majorenvironmental problems of our planet cannot besuccessfully tackled if socio-economic ills such as povertyare not combatted and eradicated.Since the last session of the General Assembly  theprospect of a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprusproblem has  regrettably  remained elusive. For 23 yearsnow Turkey has maintained more than 35 000 occupationtroops on the island  blatantly defying international law.At the same time  the Turkish Cypriot population  for theprotection of which the invasion was allegedlyundertaken  has dwindled dramatically since 1974  due topolitical oppression coupled with the massive influx ofsettlers from mainland Turkey.The Government of Greece aims at a reunitedCyprus  a common home to all of its inhabitants. Wemaintain that a settlement on the basis of the resolutionsof the United Nations and the high- level agreements of1977 and 1979 can bring peace and reconciliation to theisland. Such a settlement should provide for a bizonal andbicommunal federation with a single sovereignty andinternational personality and with its independence andterritorial integrity safeguarded through effectiveinternational guarantees. There is no doubt that afunctional solution of the Cyprus problem wouldeliminate a source of instability in the region andcontribute to the improvement of Turkish-Greek relations.The main obstacle  however  remains Turkey’s aimof legitimizing the status quo. Ankara’s negative stanceand lack of political will were once again displayedduring the direct talks recently held under the auspices ofthe Secretary-General at Glion-sur-Montreux. As thePresident of the Security Council pointed out in aninformed briefing to the press “substantive progress at this time was impeded bythe attempt to bring preconditions to the table by theother party  and here of course I mean the TurkishCypriots.”On the other hand  the constructive stance of the CypriotPresident  Mr. Clerides  at the talks was praised by thePresident of the Council in the same statement. Hisproposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus must retainour thorough attention.5Greece unwaveringly supports the process of Cyprus’saccession to the European Union  which will commence atthe near future. We believe that its accession will benefit allthe island’s inhabitants. It could also act as a catalyst forthe solution of the political problem. We sincerely hope thatTurkey will eventually realize the benefits of the accessionof Cyprus to the European Union  especially for the TurkishCypriot population  and will change its present stance.Our relations with Turkey have taken an additionaldownturn since 1996  when our neighbour added directterritorial claims to the existing policy of demands  threatsof war and constant pressure  in an attempt to subvert theterritorial status quo established more than 70 years ago byinternational law and treaties. Its attempt to back theseclaims by military means in January 1996 resulted in acrisis that just fell short of war.Greece  while determined to protect  by all legitimatemeans  its sovereign rights stemming from internationallaw  sincerely agrees that there is a need to establish normalgood neighbourly relations  based on the principles ofinternational law and respect for international treaties —something which Turkey seems determined to ignore.It has been a consistent policy of our Government thatGreek-Turkish relations should be addressed in a context ofrespect for international law and treaties. Greece has madeit its policy to channel such relations through accepted rulesof behaviour and the principles recognized in internationallife. The Madrid Joint Statement  signed by Turkey'sPresident  Mr. Demirel  and the Greek Prime Minister Mr. Simitis  provides a welcome initiative which mightcontribute to a gradual improvement.The problems that really exist must be dealt with bylegal means provided for by international law  andspecifically through the International Court of Justice. Sucha step would open possibilities for a gradual build-up ofgood-neighbourly relations and the establishment ofconfidence and cooperation in every field. In this sense  weare waiting for a move by the new Turkish Government towork in this direction — away from statements and actswhich confuse the issue and relate to a past that we musttranscend by means of those principles of international lawthat are enshrined in the United Nations Charter  and thatour gathering here pledges to serve.In the Balkan Peninsula  the area where Greece itselfis located  the situation is gradually improving. My countyhas played an active role within the framework of variousinternational activities designed to promote peace stability  good neighbourliness and development in the area.Greece values its historical relations with Albania. Itis committed to continuing to work for the strengtheningof cooperation between the two countries in all fields andto extending assistance for the rehabilitation of thecountry  in particular after the recent crisis. Ourcontribution to Operation Alba and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) presence hasbeen essential and prompt.The Greek minority in Albania will remain animportant factor of friendship between the two peoples actively contributing to the progress of their country.Greece fully supports the process initiated with theDayton Agreement. Maintaining excellent relations withall actors in the Yugoslav drama  we contributesubstantially in keeping the peace. We have sent outmassive humanitarian aid from governmental and non-governmental sources alike; we have deployed oursoldiers with the Stabilization Force (SFOR); we havesent observers both on the European Community MonitorMission and OSCE teams; and we are actively engaged inreconstruction work in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I amproud to report that we are among the few not only to putforward the money pledged at the 1996 Donors'Conference  but actually to have brought to completionthe programmes we undertook to fulfil. Furthermore  weare increasing our contribution for 1997  by 35 per cent.All this  I must note  took place while we were massivelyengaged in stemming both the Albanian crisis and thedeterioration of the financial situation in Bulgaria.Persistence in implementing the Dayton Agreement encouraging democratization and opening up to themarket economy and to the international community willprovide guidance for all on ways to overcome presentdifficulties and will enable all actors to normalize theirrelations with each other  the United Nations and theinternational community in general.Honouring the Interim Accord with the formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)  we continuetalks under the auspices of the Special Envoy of theUnited Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Vance  about thefinal name of that country. We hope that the SkopjeGovernment will realize the need for an early solution tothis issue.In the multilateral field  we have persistentlypromoted the process of cooperation and good6neighbourliness in southeastern Europe  activelyparticipating in such regional schemes as Royaumont  theSoutheast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI)  BalkanCooperation  and Black Sea Economic Cooperation. TheDeclaration adopted in Thessaloniki on 10 June 1997 by theMinisters of Foreign Affairs of countries of southeasternEurope has given a substantial impetus to this process.In the same spirit  in early November Greece will hostin Crete a summit of countries of southeastern Europe.The situation in the Middle East continues to concernus. In fact  recent terrorist actions like those in Jerusalem as well as the tragic situation in the West Bank and Gaza constitute the tangible consequences of the stagnation of thepeace process. Revival of both the peace process and thepeace hope requires adherence to and full implementationof the relevant United Nations resolutions and internationalagreements. The parties have to live up to theircommitments. Real peace is a just and global one — inIsrael as well as in Lebanon  where the need to implementSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) continues to bepainfully felt. Greece supports any efforts which could havepositive results  and hence we encourage those undertakenby the European Union's Special Envoy in the Middle East.Moreover  our country is willing to offer any assistanceaimed at the strengthening of peace and stability  security and economic and social progress  as well as theestablishment of confidence among all parties to the MiddleEast problem  in favour of the peoples of the area.Greece is following with particular interest the recentdevelopments in Africa  auspicious or ominous as theyappear. Indeed  an increasing number of African countriesare adopting pluralism as a form of Government and open-market principles for their economy. It is Greece's beliefthat on the eve of the twenty-first century the internationalcommunity must encourage and assist African countries topromote pluralism  respect for human rights and a free-market economy. Important developments will take placeduring this century in Africa.Latin America  with which Greece has traditional tiesof friendship  is consolidating the pace of development ofrecent years. Also  through successful regional integration the countries of the region are assuming a stature on aworldwide scale that truly reflects the importance of theprogress the region has achieved.Last June's Bucharest Meeting between the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation Council and the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR) is a telling example.Greece  both bilaterally and as a member of the EuropeanUnion  is looking forward to an increasing comprehensive and substantial dialogue with the LatinAmerican countries  to the benefit of internationalcooperation  trade liberalization  and stability.The United Nations remains mankind's best hope forjointly solving the problems that collectively beset theworld community. We therefore fully support the call forthe reform of the United Nations. However  we stronglybelieve that any decision regarding the future form andfunction of our Organization should be taken byconsensus and should reflect the needs and aspirations ofall Member States — big and small  rich and pooralike — in whose hands and political will the destiny ofthe United Nations lies. Greece is prepared to shoulder itsshare of responsibility in this ongoing reform process."
"67",2861,"GRD",52,1997,"﻿In my address to this nobleAssembly last year  I drew attention to the significance ofvirtue and  furthermore  to the enhancement of the release11of the power which resides in virtue  through the supply ofappropriate means. Moreover  I invited reflection on thequintessential sameness of all humankind and urged thatthis  together with a genuine commitment to virtue  beadopted as the guiding principles of the General Assemblyas it addresses and deliberates upon the realities of humaninteraction in our contemporary world.As it is for any individual society or nation  so it is forthe international global community. Ethics is the sciencewhose aim is to produce the good man and woman  whilepolitics is the science which aims at fashioning the goodsociety. Thus  politics must be founded upon andunceasingly informed by ethics.Doubtless this is an ideal. Nonetheless  it is an idealwe must constantly strive to achieve if we are to realizepeace within and among our nations — peace  which wasdescribed by Thomas Aquinas as the tranquillity of order.In this era of accelerating change in so many areas inevery portion of our diverse global community  it is ofsingular importance to the well-being of each of ourindividual national communities  as it is for the overallinternational global community  that we recognize  observeand be faithful to those values and principles which inherently  are unchanging.One such unchanging value is that of right — moralright: what Plato conceived of as the virtue of justice  andwhat in Roman law was characterized as the jus  or morallaw. Indeed  it is rather significant that Plato perceived thewhole function of education as being to elicit the bestthings that are latent in the soul  and to do so by directingthe soul to the right things.I am highly honoured and deeply pleased to address on behalf of the Government and the people of Grenada this Assembly at its fifty-second regular session  during thecourse of which change must be a transcending theme  asalso must be the initiation  institution and prudentmanagement of change in the pursuit and conduct ofinternational affairs.On behalf of my delegation  I express to thisAssembly the warm greetings of the Government and thepeople of Grenada. I also express our sincerecongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his accession to theoffice of Secretary-General  as well as on his manner ofaddressing the duties deriving therefrom. We rejoice in hisdemonstration of virtue  and we believe that his profoundknowledge of the United Nations augurs well for hisleadership in pursuance of international peace andsecurity.My Government is heartened by his commitment tothe reform of the Organization and is reassured by hisefforts to fashion a more effective and efficient UnitedNations system. We are hopeful that one of the benefitswhich will accrue from such an improved system will bethe enhancement of the economic viability of smalldeveloping States  such as ours; and we further hope thathis efforts to realize the system envisaged will not befrustrated by the withholding of the substantial overallpayments which are due.My delegation joins me in extending warmcongratulations to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine onhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session. We commend Mr. Razali Ismailof Malaysia for his exemplary conduct of the proceedingsof the fifty-first session.The rapidly changing global environment presentsgrave challenges to small States  especially small islandStates such as Grenada. It also does so for the UnitedNations  whose very institution was prompted by theadoption of the ethic of a confraternity of nationsinformed by a common subscription to the concept of theempowerment of virtue through the furnishing of adequateand appropriate means in order that right might prevail inthe international community.In this latter regard  attention is especially invited tothe notion of global trade and liberalization as it iscurrently regulated by the World Trade Organization(WTO)  with its inherent inconsistencies  which operateto the disadvantage of the smaller economies. The WTOrules relating now to the products of agriculture and agro-industry bear testimony to the injustice inflicted uponthose of us who live and labour within the confines ofsmall economies — witness the recent ruling on bananas which underscores the insensitivity displayed by way ofthe challenge which triggered it.Moreover  the Uruguay Round Agreements requirea massive legislative agenda on Grenada’s part — as theyundoubtedly do for most developing countries. Ournational laws in the areas of trade in goods and servicesas well as intellectual property must be reviewed andextensive legislative changes made. Thus we must acquirethe necessary legal expertise to work on this project untilimplementation is fully accomplished - and all this by theend of the year 2000.12We shall  of course  make full use of the assistancethat is available through WTO as well as that offered byinternational bodies such as the World Intellectual PropertyOrganization (WIPO).Nonetheless  it must be explicitly stated that  inGrenada’s view  the Uruguay Round Agreements havecreated for small developing States significantly moreburdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bringunder the banner of global free trade — at least now  andfor the foreseeable future  unless corrective measures aresoon instituted.My Government continues in its efforts to restructurethe Grenada economy and is pursuing a programme ofeconomic diversification. This involves broadening andenhancing sectors such as agro-processing  lightmanufacturing  crafts  services — including offshorefinancial services — tourism and agriculture.Nevertheless  my Government is deeply aware that thesuccess of its economic policies will depend significantlyon the support of the multilateral financial institutions andalso of friendly countries in respect of training and thedissemination of knowledge and skills  as well as thesetting up of enterprises and facilities that are strategic tosecondary economic growth.Accordingly  my Government is pleased to haverecorded in the annals of the Assembly  its gratitude for and appreciation of  the assistance which Grenada has sofar received  as well as that which we are currentlyreceiving  from the European Union through the LoméAgreement  and from other friendly countries.Despite constraints such as I have referred to  as wellas others  my Government continues in its efforts tostimulate employment and enhance employability. In thelatter regard  we are now in the process of institutionalizingon-the-job training for our unemployed youth  whilstexpanding our formal programmes for skills training. As forstimulating employment  special emphasis is being placedon self-employment — and this by way of fostering thesmall enterprise and micro-enterprise sectors. For we areconvinced that the development of these sectors is crucialto our preferred process for national development. Webelieve that through such endeavours our people will growin dignity and self-reliance.My Government will continue to provide an enablingenvironment for the private sector to thrive and expand.And we seek the active partnership of the multilateralinstitutions as well as of the international community through joint ventures  technological transfers andfinancial and technical assistance to provide the impetusto sustained economic growth.Democracy and good governance can flourish onlyin an environment of peace — an environmentcharacterized by the tranquillity of order; not an order thatis imposed  but an order which springs from mutual trustand mutual regard amongst the individuals who composethe particular society; an order which is constantlyrevitalized and continually enhanced by mutual love; anorder which resonates to the truth that “My origin is theirorigin  my conscience is their conscience  my contentionis their contention  and my pilgrimage is theirpilgrimage”. In this context  we invite attention to theapparent emergence recently of terrorism in the Caribbeanregion  with the bombings in Cuba.The kind of order referred to would inherentlyinvolve individual social and economic well-being: trueprosperity  individual and societal.At the international global community level  suchorder is realizable only by way of a concept and praxisfor a new global human order such as was enunciated bythe late President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana andcorroborated by the leaders of the Group of 7 countries intheir communiqué “Making a Success of Globalization forthe Benefit of All” (A/51/208  annex II).The pursuit of true politics in relation to thefashioning of the confraternity of nations requires that westrive to institute such a new global human order.Within the compass of such a global human order there inevitably would be the eradication of the cripplingand strangulating debt burden which afflicts sodevastatingly the very poor and so dehumanizingly thepoorest countries of our world. So also would be actionagainst environmental degradation  and towardssustainable economic development  especially in thepoorer countries and particularly in small islanddeveloping States.Similarly  as to the eradication of povertyworldwide — and  in this regard it is fitting that I repeathere the observation of the Right Honourable Clare Short United Kingdom Secretary of State for InternationalDevelopment:13“A world that has one in five of its people livingin abject poverty is certainly not just and it is alsodangerously unstable”.Natural disasters  particularly in small island States require special concern on the part of the confraternity ofnations. The devastation recently experienced in Montserrattrumpets the need for a United Nations programme to dealwith the aftermath of such natural destruction.Grenada welcomes the recent United Nations initiativein respect of Haiti  and salutes every country participatingin this noble endeavour  as well as the United Nations andits officers  whose vision informed that initiative.We welcome also the steps towards achieving peacebetween parties in countries in Central America  and weapplaud them. Indeed  as the current Chairman of theAssociation of Caribbean States  Grenada rejoices in suchaction. For  through the Association  we in the Caribbeanregion seek to widen and deepen the process of integrationamongst the island States of the Caribbean and thosemainland States whose shores are lapped by the CaribbeanSea — and this includes Cuba.My Government is acutely mindful that poor States arepeculiarly vulnerable to the violation of their territorialintegrity  since they can ill afford the wherewithal to ensurenon-encroachment in the vicinity of their borders. And thelarger such poor continental States are  the greater thatparticular vulnerability.Similarly  for small island States  in particular those ofthe Caribbean  where the threat is not so much to territorialintegrity but to security  that threat is posed by thoseengaged in the illicit business of narcotics trafficking  bothby way of buying and selling. Our small island States ofthe Caribbean have become primary and secondarytransshipment centres en route from the large producers tothe commensurately large consumers. My Governmenttherefore asks earnestly that this noble Assembly addressthis matter in accordance with the ethic of the true politicsrelating to the overall international community ofhumankind.The current United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme is indeed commendable  and Grenada is pleasedto be actively participating in it at the pace we can bestafford.Nonetheless  it cannot but be admitted that thisProgramme does not offer  much less provide  theprotection which is needed for our people — particularlyour youth — against the ravishment of drug use and theblight which eventually afflicts the small-scaletransporters  or so-called mules. Surely this process oftransshipment can be severely curtailed  if not completelyeradicated  through planned  concerted internationalaction.My Government’s concern for youth and children isnot confined to Grenada. Nor is it limited to our brothersand sisters in the Caribbean Community or in theAssociation of Caribbean States. Our concern embracesyouth and children everywhere. Accordingly  we condemnthe exploitation of youth and children in any form. Wesay no to the abuse of children for pornography andprostitution.My Government welcomes the recent conclusion ofthe Convention on the comprehensive banning of anti-personnel landmines  and we urge a significantacceleration in the controlled destruction of those mineswhich are relics of campaigns of war of one scale oranother.In relation to the Security Council  Grenadaunequivocally supports its expansion in a manner such aswould facilitate the realization of true politics in theoverall international community. This  we believe  wouldinvolve an increase in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership.Both such increases  in our view  should becharacterized by a significant presence of developingcountries. For  in Grenada’s view  what is required in thereformed Security Council is not more of the same kindof distribution of perception  but more equity among thecomponent parts of the spectrum of perception.The very notion of equity inevitably calls forth thenotion of justice. In the context of justice in the UnitedNations  there arises quite effortlessly the case of theRepublic of China on Taiwan. To all who subscribe to theprinciple of the right of a people to self-determination  thecase for membership in the United Nations for theRepublic of China on Taiwan is a compelling one.Indeed  it is incontestable. For  some 50 years ago  thesepeople chose self-determination. They voted with theirfeet as they moved from their homes on mainland Chinato the island of Taiwan  and today 21.3 million peoplepractise democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan.Their economic achievements are well and widely known 14as is their willingness to participate in the internationalcommunity as a Member of the United Nations.What more is required for the Republic of China to beadmitted to United Nations membership? One may wellask. My answer: justice. The mention of justice evokesrecollection of two very insightful observations whichdeserve to be shared in this noble Assembly. First Reinhold Niebur  in his Foreword to “The Children of Lightand the Children of Darkness”  offered the followingcomment on justice:“Man’s capacity for justice makes democracypossible; but Man’s inclination to injustice makesdemocracy necessary.”Well might we enquire as to the origin of thisinclination to injustice. But the success or failure to identifythat origin notwithstanding  an effective manner of dealingwith that inclination is provided by Plato’s construct foreducation  which is centred on exposure of the soul to theright things.And second  in his Foreword to Allan Bloom’sthought-provoking study on American higher education —the number-one bestseller of its time  one decade ago  SaulBellow offered a view that is particularly pertinent to thenotion of exposure of the soul to the right things. SaulBellow contends that:“In the greatest confusion there is an open channel tothe soul ... The channel is always there  and it is ourbusiness to keep it open  to have access to the deepestpart of ourselves — to that part of us which isconscious of a higher consciousness ... The soul has tofind and hold its ground against hostile forces sometimes embodied in ideas which frequently denyits very existence  and which indeed often seem to betrying to annul it altogether.”The Assembly may well ask  “How does the soul holdits ground?” My reply: through virtue and constantexposure to the right things. Let right prevail.May God bless the President of  and everyoneparticipating in  this fifty-second regular session of thisnoble Assembly  which through His grace will be atransforming blessing to our world."
"68",2908,"GTM",52,1997,"﻿It is a great honour for me  as the representativeof the people of Guatemala and as President pro temporeof the Central American Integration System  tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your well-deservedelection to preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-second session.We wish to thank the President and the Secretariatfor their understanding in allowing us to alter protocoland to address the Assembly in the form of a jointpresentation. We Central Americans deemed it necessaryand timely to do so because we wish in this way tohighlight the importance  the scope  the depth and theextent of the changes that are taking place in Central18America after years of confrontation and suffering for ourpeoples and our region.We bring good news. Central America is undergoingremarkable changes  and the Central American leaders wishto share together here in this world forum the progressachieved in our region. We bring news of peace  democracyand development  news of understanding and cooperation news of accord and unity. Our region is leaving behindyears of internal war and authoritarianism to move into aconstructive stage of political  economic  social  culturaland ecological strength  one that will enable us to enter thenew millennium with new hopes and achievements by ourpeoples. And this new stage is being constructed with therespectful participation and responsible support of theinternational community.We must recall that barely 12 years ago we CentralAmericans were on the verge of a regional war and that ourcountries were experiencing the with full intensity of beingone of the last settings of the so-called cold war. But thennegotiation prevailed over conflict and we found CentralAmerican roads to peace  which led  10 years ago to theEsquipulas II Accords  embodying the procedure for a firmand lasting peace in Central America.The processes of dialogue and reconciliation movedforward along difficult and complex roads. The heat ofbattle was replaced by the warmth of debate. Weapons werelaid down  and we began the difficult but unpostponablemarch towards reconciliation  towards a return to the ruleof law  towards democratic strengthening and towardspeaceful and constructive coexistence.As may be recalled  at last year’s session I camebefore the Assembly anticipating peace in my country. Inless than 10 months during 1996 we were able to completenegotiations on seven specific peace accords in Guatemalawith the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca(URNG) and thus  on 29 December of last year  we arrivedat the signature of the final Agreement on a Firm andLasting Peace. Thus we did put an end to the 36 years ofinternal armed conflict that had torn at the very vitals ofmy country.As many here know  the process of complying withthe accords has advanced with firm steps. Thanks to thewill of the parties and the timely and determinedcollaboration of the international community  in barely threemonths the demobilization of the former guerrillacombatants was completed  with the assistance of a militaryVerification Mission of United Nations Blue Berets approved by the Security Council.Without going into undue detail  I can reaffirm whatwe reported a few days ago in my country: the process ofcompliance with the peace accords is going forwarddecisively with regard to all fronts and commitments. Thejoint commissions envisaged in the accords have alreadybeen established  thus creating the broadest and mostdiversified structures of citizen participation in ourhistory. The commitments on investment and publicexpenditure on health  education  justice and security forthe people are already reflected in detail in the budget fornext year  not only increasing the ratio of socialinvestment to levels unprecedented in our history but alsochanging their orientation in order increasingly to favourrural areas. The National Congress is ready to discuss theagreed constitutional amendments. Similarly  the agreedinstitutional reforms have begun to be implemented in allareas. The process of the return of refugees from theneighbouring brotherly country of Mexico will becompleted before the end of this year  and the guerrillaorganizations that formed part of the URNG  having beendemobilized  are returning to legality and are becoming apolitical organization that will participate in futureelections.All of these important changes in my country arebeing verified and supported by the United Nations  forwhich we are deeply thankful. All these changes can beadded to others that have already taken place in ouristhmus and that are enabling us to rediscover ourregional agendas of democratization and development.Indeed  while peace negotiations were progressing andmaturing in Nicaragua  El Salvador and Guatemala  weonce again undertook to revitalize our regional integrationprocess. Following the finalization of the series of peacenegotiations  that process of integration and regionaldevelopment has taken on a renewed vigour anddynamism and has recently received a further importantimpetus. It gives us real pride and hope to be able toshare with the Assembly a brief summary of our advancesin that process and of the important decisions that wehave recently taken.Fully aware that the region is going through a rarehistorical moment  one characterized by the existence ofpopularly elected Governments in all of the countries ofCentral America and a situation of peace  we deem itessential to design and implement regional and unifiedresponses to the demands of our peoples and thechallenges of globalization.19During the past three years we have madeextraordinary progress in our integration efforts  whichextend from a new conceptual horizon  one that has becomebetter balanced and more inclusive with the creation of theAlliance for Sustainable Development and the establishmentof innovative regional projects to increase regionalcompetitiveness by means of joint efforts on the part ofGovernments  academic centres and sectors of production.We replaced the former common market in 1991 witha new legal framework that created the Central AmericanIntegration System (SICA). However  as we were alsoconvinced of the need to go beyond mere governmentalcooperation in our regional integration efforts  a few weeksago  in Panama  we took an important step towardsstrengthening  deepening and developing our regionalcooperation. We agreed on the broadest possible review andmodernization of our regional institutional framework  aswe were convinced that the benefits of development towhich our people are entitled cannot be tapped by eachcountry separately — they are attainable only to a regionalcommunity  because of the dynamics of today’sincreasingly interdependent environment.For the first time  at our most recent meeting inManagua  all the Governments of the area agreed that weneed to look beyond economic integration and clearly showthe will and resolve needed to direct our efforts towards apossible regional political union  a community ofindependent nations that pool their capabilities withoutlosing their individuality. And that is how we agreed tobegin the gradual and continuing process of setting up theCentral American Union  as a higher expression ofcommunitarian partnership stipulated in the 1991 Protocolof Tegucigalpa.Thus  we have taken the first step in a broad andcomplex process that can bring us closer to the vision of aCentral American Union  with the ultimate goal ofproducing the concrete results sought by our populations:overcoming poverty  creating opportunities  increasing thenumber of jobs  activating our production capacity increasing our competitiveness  equitable and unifiedparticipation in the benefits of development  genuinedemocratization  equitable access to an efficient system ofjustice and the legitimate enjoyment of peacefulcoexistence.We have redoubled our efforts to ensure that CentralAmerica is more united and better prepared to face theenormous challenges of its development and to respondcreatively and dynamically to the international demands ofour contemporary and ever changing world. We  theCentral American leaders  have come together to thisforum as genuinely united nations to demonstrate ourcommon aim of regional unity and the efforts we aremaking to that end. We reiterate our deep appreciation forthe support and cooperation of the internationalcommunity to date  and I offer my best wishes for theprosperity of all as the new millennium dawns."
"69",2951,"GUY",52,1997,"﻿For some time now theUnited Nations has been engaged in a process of reformand restructuring with the aim of improving its capacityto address the many challenges which the world nowfaces. It has been an arduous and time-consumingexercise which  if truth be told  has diverted us  tosome degree  from our primary task of promotingglobal peace and development. Yet the exercise is anecessary one if we are in fact to enhance theOrganization's efficiency and effectiveness and to gearit for service to the international community in thecoming years.My delegation is confident that  under the ableleadership of the President  we will be able to makeprogress in our endeavours. His wide diplomaticexperience  together with his intimate knowledge of the14Organization  will serve  I am sure  to orient andaccelerate our efforts. We congratulate him on hisunanimous election and vouchsafe to him our readycooperation to make this fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly a significant turning point in the lifeof the Organization.To the President's distinguished predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  we convey ourdeep and sincere appreciation for the determination anddynamism which he brought to bear on the work of thelast session. To his great credit  he laboured tirelessly tofind general agreement on the steps which must be takento revitalize the United Nations. His exemplary leadershipwill no doubt inspire us to fulfil the task at hand withoutundue delay.I also wish to acknowledge with appreciation thenotable contribution which our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  has made to the reform process sincetaking office. In keeping with the promise made to theAssembly  he has presented us with a set of interestingproposals for the reshaping of the Organization forservice in the twenty-first century. This comprehensiveand constructive document requires our seriousconsideration. I intend  therefore  in the time allocated tome  to make a few comments which I trust  despite theirbrief and preliminary nature  will provide an indication ofour thinking at the present time on the ways and meansby which the Organization can be reformed.Let me first say that we share the vision which theSecretary-General has set forth for the future role of theUnited Nations. The Organization has proved its capacityfor preventing major wars and forging internationalconsensus on important aspects of international relations.It is now poised to explore the many possibilities ofmultilateralism. Increasingly  Member States  large andsmall  are seeing it in their interest to cooperate with theUnited Nations to maximize their ability to deal withseveral international concerns. There is increasingrecourse to its machinery in order to deal with suchissues as development  the environment  disease  drugtrafficking and terrorism  to name just a few. Many ofthe special agencies  such as the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF)  the United NationsDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM)  and otherstoo numerous to mention  cater to the needs of the mostvulnerable sections of our population — the aged women  children and our indigenous peoples.Built on the pillars of multilateralism  the UnitedNations offers Member States a unique forum in whichthey can come together for their common good. Itsgrand design  elaborated some 50 years ago  remains byand large a useful chart for promoting internationalcomity. It is important  therefore  as we plan for a newera  that we hold fast to the founders' abiding visionlest we be dashed against the rocks of isolation and leftto survive as best we can.The effective translation of this vision into realityrequires strong and dynamic leadership. History hasshown that  much too often  our most worthwhileaspirations have been left unfulfilled because ofinadequate political commitment and direction. Statesoften see the world only through the prism of narrowself-interest and are blind to the virtues of concertedaction. However  the challenges of our times  when nosingle nation  however rich and powerful  can hope tobe entirely self-reliant  require the highest level ofinternational cooperation. For it is only by unity ofpurpose that we  the United Nations  can hope toachieve the aspirations so loftily declared in theCharter.We are pleased to note that the Secretary-General as the Organization's chief administrative officer  hasdemonstrated vision and leadership in outlining hissuggestions for reform. Of particular satisfaction to usis the fact that in setting his priorities for theOrganization's future work he has accorded highimportance to its development activities. At a timewhen financial support is weak  it is imperative thatappropriate strategies be developed to eradicate worldpoverty and restore economic and social prosperity particularly in small developing countries.We therefore welcome the Secretary-General'sintention to strengthen management capability withinthe Secretariat to provide for full coordination of effortand for forward planning. We recognize the need foreconomy  but hope that this will not be to the detrimentof clear mandates of Member States and to thefundamental nature of the Organization. It would be agrave pity if  in reducing costs  the United Nations wereto be starved of substance.We certainly approve of the idea initiallypropounded by the Government of Japan  andsubsequently endorsed by the G-7 countries  calling foradministrative savings to be channelled intodevelopment activities. This dividend  although15presumably limited in quantity  may be significantenough to serve as a catalyst for financing thedevelopment account that the Secretary-General proposes.Like the rest of the world  we welcome the generous giftof the Chairman of Turner Communications  who hadparticipated in the 1994 World Hearings on Developmentand has now seen fit to come out in support of thiscause. One can only hope that such philanthropy will beemulated by others in the private sector.The recently concluded Agenda for Development together with the joint strategy for development of theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) and the Development Assistance Committee(DAC)  provides a basis for moving forward in the fieldof economic and social cooperation. Both documentsaccept the fact that while private investment flows havean important role to play in development  they are because of their high selectivity and generalunpredictability  insufficient to guarantee the developmentof small disadvantaged countries. For those countries —and here I include my own — development assistance debt relief  capacity building and increased trade willremain crucial to our progress.At the macroeconomic level  we will continue tolook to the United Nations to play a more central role inthe concertation of development policies. The Secretary-General has said “The promotion of economic and socialprogress is one of the United Nations primaryobjectives  enshrined in the Charter.” (A/51/950 para. 68)It cannot  consequently  be marginalized in thedevelopment process. Instead  it must be its principalgenerator.Accordingly  both its structure and operation mustbe such as to provide “a more integrated collaborativeapproach”. (ibid.  para. 72) Greater coordination ofdevelopment activities  both at Headquarters and at theregional and local levels  is essential. As has beensuggested  the creation of a new development group anda United Nations development-assistance frameworkcould possibly provide the necessary focus and direction.We should be careful to ensure  however  that thestrengths of individual actors and agencies are not lost inany merger.We fully support the proposal for a closer andmore cooperative relationship with the World Bank andother international financial institutions. Over time those bodies  although connected with the UnitedNations  have moved away from their original mandatesand developed quite independently of the Organization.It is time that those bodies concentrate on humandevelopment as distinct from the means ofdevelopment. We should therefore seek to bring theminto line with the main organs of the United Nations.To that end  we encourage the Secretary-General totake whatever steps are needed to achieve thatharmonization of the development efforts. We will alsohave to consider at some stage how to strengthen therelationship of the World Trade Organization (WTO)with the United Nations.At the same time  we must complement theseefforts by giving to the Assembly and the Economicand Social Council the direct and overarchingresponsibility for leading the development enterprise. Inthe past  those organs have been sadly left behind in thedevelopment process. Although useful as forums fordialogue and consensus building  they have failed toengage the key players. We should therefore strive totransform them so that they can provide a strongerpolitical impetus for development and ensure effectiveglobal macroeconomic management.We hope that from this debate will come a clearindication of proposals and recommendations that areconsidered desirable and feasible. There will be some of course  which  like the conversion of the TrusteeshipCouncil into a forum for dealing with issues such as theglobal commons  will require further study. Theseproposals may be explored in informal working sessionsof the Assembly and then taken up formally as apackage for approval and subsequent implementation.With diligent cooperation on the part of all  there is noreason why such reforms cannot be agreed upon earlyin the new year.Institutional tinkering alone  however  will notguarantee development. The most important dynamicremains the political will of States. The severalstrategies that we have forged and the manydeclarations we have issued over the years remainlargely unfulfilled. It is no wonder that poverty is todaythe single most important threat to global peace andsecurity.16The reduction and eventual elimination of worldpoverty is an imperative which the United Nations cannotignore. At the special mid-term review of the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development(UNCED)  held in June of this year  we came close toagreeing to achieve this target by the year 2015. Thisyear  at the Kyoto session of the Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change  and later  at the mid-term review of theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  we willhave other opportunities for the further promotion ofsustainable development. We should not fail to takeadvantage of these in our continuing efforts to create apartnership for the benefit of all States.For its part  my Government remains dedicated tothis end. In demonstration of our seriousness of purpose we have honoured the obligations that have been deemednecessary to national development. As suggested by theWorld Bank in its publication entitled Partnership forSustainable Growth  we have sought to promote“global governance in all its aspects  includingensuring the rule of law  improving efficiency andaccountability of the public sector and tacklingcorruption as essential elements of a frameworkwithin which economies can prosper.”We have created a truly democratic society in whichdevelopment is a fundamental human right. The fruit ofour policies has been a constant annual growth rate ofover 6 per cent. Today  all sectors of our society including private enterprise and peoples' organizations are fully involved in the development process and arefired by the optimistic confidence that  as a nation  wewill overcome the problems that currently beset us.In a few weeks  our nation will conduct anotherdemocratic election  open again to the scrutiny ofinternational observers. Out of this exercise will come afresh popular determination to continue along the pathleading to economic and social progress. To facilitate thispursuit  the Government has prepared a nationaldevelopment strategy based on a fully participatoryeconomy. Involved in its preparation were experts fromboth the public and the private sectors  who haveprepared a draft text for wider public consultation andapproval. In our view  this provides a useful policyframework which  by establishing needs and priorities can serve to mobilize assistance from the internationalcommunity  including donor Governments andinternational development agencies.However  as was clearly recognized by our latePresident  Mr. Cheddi Jagan  the hopes and aspirationsof developing countries such as ours will not fullymaterialize over the long term until the internationalenvironment is made more congenial to our needs.Accordingly  he continuously advocated in his lifetimethe creation of a new global human order premised onsustainable economic development  equity and socialand ecological justice  and based on the creation of aseparate global development fund for assistance to boththe North and the South. This new North-Southpartnership must be fashioned in a search for morepositive and innovative ways to cope with the vagariesof globalization and liberalization  which aremarginalizing millions of people and even manynations.Guyana has openly embraced the 20/20 initiativeadopted at the World Summit for Social Developmentas a means of sparking international cooperation fordevelopment. In addition  we have called for agreementon some forms of international taxation  which  likenational revenue at the country level  would provide thefunding necessary to promote global development. Thusfar  some developed countries have been reluctant tocontemplate such innovative means of resourcemobilization. But in circumstances of ever increasinginternational obligations and decreasing developmentassistance  where will the necessary financing comefrom? The answer to this question is key to the futureof the United Nations  for unless the Organization isendowed with predictable and adequate resources  itwill be incapable of satisfying the many requirementsplaced upon it by Member States.In my delegation's view  the time has come to dealwith this issue. The Economic and Social Council hasbroached the question in recent high-level discussions but we are a long way from testing the feasibility of themany ideas that have been advanced to find new andadditional ways of financing multilateralism. Initialstudies done by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and other development agencieshave revealed that some of the mechanisms proposedare indeed feasible. Why  then  are some Statesunwilling to entertain any meaningful discussion oftheir introduction? Is it that they are afraid of losingcontrol of the United Nations? Or are they not serious17about their proclaimed adherence to the concept of theinterdependence of States?Assuring the financial stability of this Organizationmust be seen as essential not only to development but topeace. Invariably  instability and conflict within andamong States are due in great measure to economic andsocial instability leading to intense competition forlimited resources. An investment in development musttherefore be seen as an investment in preventivediplomacy and in the building of peace.Admittedly  these are costly tasks  but there can beno doubt that the expenditure involved is much less thanthat resulting from conflict. The international communityshould therefore be prepared to adequately fund activitiesin this field to enhance the prospects of their success.Apart from financial support  there is also a need formore competent supervision by the Security Council. Noreform of the United Nations will be complete withoutreform of the Council  which is the organ primarilyresponsible for the maintenance of international peaceand security. Unfortunately  despite the most intensivesearch  we are yet to find general agreement on the basisfor restructuring that important body. We must persevere however  in the fulfilment of our mandate to devise amore effective  open and representative Council fullycapable of performing the functions assigned to it underthe Charter.Guyana  as a member of the Non-AlignedMovement  believes that this aim can best be served byan appropriate expansion in the non-permanent category.However  in a spirit of compromise  we are prepared tocontemplate enlargement also in the permanent category providing a balance can be found between developed-and developing-country representation and agreementreached on the limitation of the use of the veto and onthe concept of periodic review. We are ready to continueour work in this direction until a solution is found.Meanwhile  we are happy to see the progress beingmade towards the creation of an international criminalcourt  which will be able to deal effectively with severalcrimes against humanity.Last  but by no means least  we wish to see in thecampaign for peace more active interest and participationby this Assembly in the disarmament process  so that theweapons of war may be converted into tools ofdevelopment. Although we have yet to see any significantpeace dividend from the ending of the cold war  webelieve that a reduction in arms expenditures on bothnuclear and conventional weapons can only benefit thewelfare of all peoples. The Assembly must thereforeencourage the Committee on Disarmament to intensifyits efforts in this field and must itself take whateveraction it deems necessary to prompt the conversionfrom arms production to more peaceful pursuits.Disarmament is too important an issue to be left to themajor military Powers. The international community asa whole must therefore exert continuing pressure on theprocess to achieve the desired results.At the same time  we must intensify theOrganization's role in bringing peace to those countriesand regions of the world where conflict or the threat ofconflict persists. Upheavals in the Great Lakes regionof Africa and the tenuous situation in places such asAfghanistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina still defyresolution.In the Middle East  the peace process seems tohave atrophied. The Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict continue to hamper the progress of thatentire area. In Cyprus  where tensions are restrainedonly by the continued presence of United Nationstroops  the danger of violence is ever present. On theKorean Peninsula  peaceful reunification is still anelusive goal. The international community has nochoice but to do whatever it can to help the partiesinvolved in conflict everywhere to work peacefullytowards an amicable settlement of their particulardisputes.The world wants peace and development. It alsowants the United Nations to help in the achievement ofthese goals. Governments have a duty to heed thesesentiments and to increase their support of theOrganization.The United Nations itself must in turn reach out tobenefit from the valuable reservoir of goodwill whichexists towards it among the peoples of the world.Public information is key to securing widespreadsupport for its activities and to expanding its role ininternational affairs. We therefore urge that thedissemination capacity of the Department of PublicInformation be enhanced in developed countries  whereawareness of the Organization's potential is less than itshould be.18As we approach the major milestone marking thestart of the third millennium  we must have a clear visionof what we want the United Nations to be and of whatwe want it to do. Only with such clarity can we be surethat the reform process will result in a change for thebetter. It is therefore my delegation's hope that thisgeneral debate will engender a common sense of purposeamong its Members and a willingness on their part topress forward in the revitalization of an Organizationwhich is so necessary to both our survival and ourdevelopment."
"70",2997,"HND",52,1997,"﻿At the outset  I would liketo extend to you  Sir  my sincere congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of this session of the GeneralAssembly. Your election is well-deserved recognition ofyour great personal qualities and a tribute to Ukraine. Wewish you success in the exercise of your duties.23My delegation would also like to extend itsappreciation to the Permanent Representative of Malaysiato the United Nations  Mr. Razali Ismail  for his excellentwork during the previous session of the General Assembly.We also extend our sincere thanks to Mr. Kofi Annan who in carrying out his mission as the Secretary-General ofour Organization has demonstrated a remarkable spirit ofhard work and commitment during a particularly difficulttime for the United Nations in the maintenance ofinternational peace and in the complex task of restructuringand strengthening of this institution.The most noticeable feature of the world as the end ofthe century approaches is the generalized spread ofdemocracy. Almost all the nations of the world share thisway of life  thereby giving the end of the century acharacter which has no parallel in past centuries. We arefinally living in an era of democracy after a long night ofdictatorship and totalitarianism in various parts of the globe.But this universalization of democracy goes hand in handwith something which — for lack of a better name — wemight call the malaise of democracy. Dissatisfaction can beheard everywhere; this political system is being called intoquestion in the name of development and prosperity.Democracy with extreme poverty is not the model we seek.Representative government is a political gain of themodern age  but it is only the halfway point on the road tofull human development. It must be accompanied by otherelements which are essential to a life of dignity: wellbeing justice  involvement and a full understanding of the humanbeing as both the root and the fruit of all our efforts.If there is one thing which we will have to do in thefuture  particularly in forums such as the GeneralAssembly  it is to find formulas that can provide for aworkable relationship between democracy and development between prosperity and equity  and between growing wealthand disappearing poverty.The United Nations faces challenges and expectationswith regard to this serious matter of the viability ofdemocracy. There is perhaps today no more important task.If freedom  the essence of this political system  isdisparaged in the name of growth without values  then theloss of generations sacrificed on the battlefields in thistortured century will lose all meaning. That danger doesexist  and those of us who know from our own painfulexperience the crimes that can be committed in the name ofprogress have a duty to alert everyone to it.In recent years  five successive Governments havecome to power legitimately in Honduras through freeelections. This is unprecedented in our history and itallows us to say that we are indeed practising democracy which is a lesson we never finish learning. Ourexperience shows once again that free elections  whilebeing the basis of Governments  are not in themselvessufficient to consolidate the system or to guarantee thecomplete satisfaction of the people.Since 1994 we have been trying to involve ourpeople more in major national decisions and we havebeen trying to pay more attention to their needs throughan open dialogue. This is part of our belief that it isessential to move forward from formal democracy to realdemocracy  if we want it to be more than a constitutionalexpression and become part of the living culture of ourpeople.Democratic culture as a way of life requires constantvigilance to bolster its credibility and to legitimize itsexistence every day. This is why in our part of CentralAmerica  Honduras  we have regarded it as essential toback up this form of government with an ongoingreaffirmation of its ethical values and a resolute campaignagainst all forms of corruption  which is one of the worstand most vexatious enemies of democracy.In late November this year  Honduras will holdanother election to change its Government. I am pleasedto be able to report to the international community thatthis process will be free and transparent and that onceagain the people will decide the Government for the nextfour-year term.Economic indicators provided by national andinternational institutions agree that at the end of ourmandate there has been a significant improvement in theHonduran economy. We are pleased to be able to handover to the new authorities a country that is in bettershape than it was when we began our term. This couldwell be the real meaning of democracy: constantimprovement in living conditions and moving from onelevel to another through successive Governments — withthe free vote of the people being the final judge of whatis to be done.The Honduran way of finding common ground inorder to reach agreement on the kind of country we wanthas been to establish permanent interaction between thegovernors and the governed.24These last four years of government have to a largeextent been an ongoing debate with civil society  thehealthy results of which confirm  on the one hand  theadvantages of participation and  on the other  the capacitiesof Government. This is what democracy teaches us  itsmost valuable lesson.Much indeed remains to be done  but we are on theright track. We have established solid juridical bases. Wehave made tangible progress and are building a dynamicState respectful of the law  dependable in justice and  aboveall  conscious of the enormous needs of the Honduranpeople and their inalienable right to be the principal focusof development. The social expenditures of the HonduranState in 1998 will account for over 30 per cent of ournational budget. This is a clear message to our people.It is well known that Honduras is part of the greatCentral American family. We were united in the colonialperiod and we were united when we attained independence.Separation and fragmentation have simply been a longparenthesis  occasionally interrupted by fleeting attempts atunity. What is important  however  is the will of ourcountries  repeatedly expressed  to come together again andtheir demonstrated desire for union  which has alwayssought new forms of expression and can be wiped outneither by the passage of time nor by setbacks of any kind.From 1994 to today  two major events have markedlife in Central America. The Alliance for SustainableDevelopment (ALIDES) was signed in 1994 and anagreement was reached to initiate the gradual andprogressive establishment of the Central American union asthe higher expression of the community association laiddown in the 1991 Tegucigalpa Protocol  contained in theNicaragua Declaration of 2 September 1997.The Alliance represents a radical change in theintegration agenda of Central America  a new concept ofdevelopment  making it integral to and indivisible from thebenefit of the human individual. Sustainable development as advocated by ALIDES  is a recognition that growth maybe pursued while protecting the future — we can growtoday without jeopardizing the development of generationsto come.It is also an alliance with nature  a new relationshipand a revaluation of our resources. It seeks to avoid thenegative consequences of a short-term approach and to lookto the lasting prosperity of our peoples. Lastly  it exploitsour new competitive advantages: our situation as anisthmus  our long coastlines  our inter-ocean facilities  ourmagnificent biodiversity and the beauty of the Caribbeanregion. We are committed to building ALIDES. It isfitting to acknowledge that the originality of our approachhas been recognized at the world level and is beingendorsed by important entities.The main content of the Nicaragua Declaration thatI have just mentioned is the agreement on CentralAmerican union. While we have been working onregional integration  the absence of a political lodestar haswrought a lack of coherence at the regional level. We arenow resolved  however  to deal with this lodestar and thispolitical dimension in a gradual and progressive approachthat does not run roughshod over history. This will bringus together and define us  giving substance to the visionof Central America shared by the rest of the world.Our decision is neither utopian nor romantic although we are such stuff as dreams are made on  asShakespeare says. We are not talking here of utopias orromanticism. Our decision is simply an act of maturity  arealistic recognition of the needs created by our internaldevelopment and by external demands which  if we are tosurvive with dignity  will require us to make enormousefforts that  in our case  transcend our capabilities asdivided  individual States.We have established a working committee to draftthe bases and principles for Central American union. Bythe end of the year  we should have the relevantdocuments. The process will culminate in the signing ofthe formal commitment to political unity.Those who are familiar with Central Americanhistory and aware of our current efforts in the variousfields of integration know that Central American union isnot simply an act of faith; it is  rather  a work ofengineering  an enormous undertaking that  taking intoaccount the unique qualities of each of our States  is thekey to the exercise of joint sovereignty.The peoples of the United Nations must be informedof this important decision. That is why the five CentralAmerican Presidents are here  in this highest world forum spreading the good news of this political decision.Through the representatives here  we wish the world tolearn of this great decision and to accept our aspirations which are shared by other regions of the world. In thiscontext  my country reiterates its endorsement of the rightof the Republic of China to become a Member of theUnited Nations family. We support the work of that greatnation  which is seeking ways to participate fully in this25and in other international forums without any form ofexclusion or hegemony.I wish now to refer to Honduras’s support for theprocess of deep-rooted change in the United Nations  bothin its various fields of operation as well as in its internaldecision-making organs. The world in which the UnitedNations was created was not what it is today and we musttherefore keep up with the times.On the question of the Security Council  we wouldrepeat what was said at the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly and reiterate our belief that a solution tothe question of the size of the Council’s membership cannotbe rushed. Moreover  my country endorses the statement onthe strengthening of the United Nations and SecurityCouncil reform adopted at the eleventh Summit of the RioGroup. This stated that the Latin American and Caribbeanregion must be taken into account in any proposal relatingto an increase in the Security Council’s membership.We are pleased at the mine-clearance work that hasbeen carried out with international support. In the case ofHonduras  this work is particularly important because of thelives taken and mutilations caused by this inhumanepractice that is now receiving universal condemnation  acondemnation that we firmly and decidedly support.Finally  we would like to express once again howpleased we are at the regional and world treatment of thesubject of corruption. As the world becomes aware of howthis scourge affects the development and peaceful existenceof peoples  we will finally make progress towardsvanquishing it in the various parts of the world."
"71",3021,"HRV",52,1997,"﻿It is a special privilege andhonour for me to address the General Assembly at thebeginning of its fifty-second session.At the outset I would like to extend my sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  as the new President of theGeneral Assembly  confident that your extensive andproven diplomatic experience and skills will play animportant role in the work of the Assembly.I should also like to express our gratitude to thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail  whose devoted andvigorous work has shown that United Nations reform ismuch more than mere rhetoric  and who set a new standardof performance in the General Assembly.As a Central European and Mediterranean country Croatia highlights as its strategic priorities overall stabilityin the region  full integration into Euro-Atlantic institutionsand the assertion of its position in the new post-cold-warEurope. Hence the special attention my Government paysto the policy of good neighbourliness and the developmentof stable relations with all neighbouring countries  basedon the principles of full respect for the existinginternationally recognized borders  for minority rights andfor the peaceful resolution of existing and possibledisputes in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. TodayI can point out with satisfaction that Croatia hasconcluded dozens of bilateral agreements with itsneighbours  and relations with each of our immediateneighbours are being fully regulated and are steadilyimproving.Croatia hosted two large-scale United Nations peaceoperations: the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) and the United Nations ConfidenceRestoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO). The UnitedNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES)  in theDanubian area  and the United Nations Mission ofObservers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) are still present. Croatiahas also played an important role in facilitating theStabilization Force (SFOR) operation in Bosnia andHerzegovina.I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate myGovernment’s sincere gratitude for all the efforts thatwere made by the United Nations to stop the war inCroatia and alleviate its consequences  as well as toexpress my country’s sincere sympathies to the familiesof the “blue helmets” who have fallen while attending totheir lofty duties.I am very grateful for the opportunity to express ourappreciation and thanks to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his peace efforts in Croatia.As a United Nations official in the field and as Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations he madea major personal contribution to overcoming the crisis.Our great thanks go to UNTAES and Mr. Jacques Klein until recently Transitional Administrator in EasternSlavonia  Baranja and Western Sirmium  whose vigorouswork  leadership skill and successful cooperation with theCroatian Government have been instrumental in thepeaceful reintegration of these areas into Croatia.During the many months of the United Nationspresence in Croatia and elsewhere in the area of theformer Yugoslavia  my country had a chance to see foritself all the potential and the weaknesses of peacekeepingoperations. It has been proven beyond any doubt that apeace operation can be successful only if its mandate isclearly defined  in terms of its goal as well as its time-frame  and if it is actively and fully supported by the12Security Council and the Secretary-General  andspearheaded by an uncompromising leadership explicitlydetermined to use all means required for the completion ofits mission.This knowledge has been gained at a high political material and  worst of all  human price  so it is to be hopedthat it will be wisely exploited in the future. For its part Croatia is anxious to step out of its role as a countryhosting peacekeeping operations and instead assume therole of an active participant in such operations elsewhere.Here and now I can confirm the readiness of my country tojoin the roster of United Nations Member States whosetroops participate in international peace endeavours.The fifty-second session of the General Assembly istaking place against a background of great obligations andequally great expectations regarding the reform of theUnited Nations system. The timely and far-reachingproposals put forward by the Secretary-General haveopened the door for reforms. Croatia gives its firm supportto his proposals  and we are ready to render any assistanceneeded in introducing the kind of changes we owe both tothose who laid the foundations of this Organization and tofuture generations. As for the need to rationalize the workof the General Assembly and reduce its huge agenda Croatia has put forward a proposal to delete the item on theGeneral Assembly’s agenda entitled “The situation in theoccupied territories of Croatia”  as its title and topic nolonger correspond to the situation on the ground  whichmakes it obsolete.In view of the geopolitical realities  Croatia advocatesan increase in the number of Security Council members both permanent and non-permanent. Half a century of oldstereotypes ought to be phased out. Croatia supports theidea of granting permanent member status to Germany andJapan  with the right to permanent membership being keptin mind for those parts of the world  primarily Africa which for more than 50 years  without any justification have been deprived of permanent Security Councilrepresentation. Furthermore  my country supports the ideaof assigning one more seat on the Security Council to theEastern European Group.Croatia strongly supports the reaffirmation and fullimplementation of the universality of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My countrywas pleased to note that during this year’s NPT PreparatoryCommittee sessions some progress was achieved withregard to the principle of non-first use  especially againstnon-nuclear-weapon States  and it calls on the nuclearStates to give due consideration to proposals to have thisprinciple codified in a legally binding document.In May 1996  the Review Conference of the StatesParties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictionson the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which MayBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or To HaveIndiscriminate Effects amended Protocol II on landmines.Croatia  which has played an active role during theOttawa process from the beginning  and which hasalready put in place its own unilateral moratorium onlandmines  fully supports all the efforts which ultimatelyled to the decision at the recent Oslo conference to adoptthe text of a global treaty banning anti-personnellandmines.Croatia’s preoccupation with the global landmineproblem is also motivated by personal affliction. Millionsof mines laid in the formerly occupied territories ofCroatia during the war continue to pose a direct threat especially to the most vulnerable: civilians. It is also agreat impediment to the reconstruction of war-affectedareas. The clearing of mines in these areas is apainstaking process  and  in spite of our best efforts  itwill take many years to complete. Unfortunately  a lackof specialized equipment means that the process cannotmove any faster. Having said this  allow me to take thisopportunity to express my gratitude to all those who havethus far provided financial and other aid towardsalleviating the landmine problem in my country  and tomake a further appeal for any aid — material  financial orprofessional — which could help us expedite the mine-clearing process. In this context  I would like to expressmy Government’s appreciation for the efforts of theUnited Nations Mine Action Centre in Zagreb and theUnited Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs fortheir efforts in helping us launch this process.Quality of life  today and in the future  will greatlydepend on success in the protection of human rights itboth international and national levels. Protection andpromotion of human rights — a cause in which theUnited Nations has played an indispensable role — isnecessary in order to guarantee international stability andsecurity. The Office of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights has successfully enhanced the role of theUnited Nations in this important field and  at thisjuncture  I would like  on behalf of the CroatianGovernment  to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson uponher appointment to this post. Because of her excellentqualifications and personal integrity  we are confident thatshe will perform her duties admirably.Croatia’s own human rights situation should beevaluated in the context of the exceptional circumstances ofits recent history. Despite the trying circumstances of itsinception  the Republic of Croatia has managed to build thefoundations of a democratic society based on respect forhuman rights. In this regard  I can announce that in thecoming month of October Croatia will ratify the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights. There are  of course  manyoutstanding issues  largely stemming from the war ofaggression waged against Croatia. These include the returnof displaced persons and refugees; identification of missingpersons; the rights of ethnic Croats in neighbouring States;and the return of all Croatian Serbs who left Croatia at theinstigation and under the orders of their leaders and whowish to return to Croatia. The Government of the Republicof Croatia intends to continue to deal with all these issuesin keeping with its international human rights obligations aswell as its legitimate concerns for the security of the Stateand the safety and welfare of all its citizens.As a victim of aggression  Croatia advocates theneed — and has even come up with its own initiatives —to set up an international tribunal for the prosecution of warcrimes committed in Croatia and Bosnian and Herzegovina.Croatia has been cooperating with the InternationalCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia since itsfoundation. The Tribunal’s Office has opened in Zagreb.The Croatian Government has established its own Officefor Cooperation with the Tribunal and appointed observersto the Tribunal. Moreover  the Constitutional Law onCooperation with the International Tribunal has beenadopted. Croatia’s principled position is to cooperate withthe Tribunal within its obligations as defined ininternational law and in accordance with the relevantresolutions and the statute of the Tribunal adopted by theSecurity Council.However  Croatia cannot be completely satisfied withthe work of the Hague Tribunal to date. The charges raisedso far  and the ethnic composition of the persons being triedin The Hague at present  do not properly reflect theresponsibility of the sides involved in the conflict or theextent of the war crimes committed. On the other hand  bytrying to subpoena the States and their high officials  theTribunal has gone beyond its own statute and internationallaw.Current peace operations in the territory of Croatia —UNTAES and UNMOP — are considered successful by myGovernment. Under the Basic Agreement signed betweenthe central authorities of the Republic of Croatia and theSerbs from the Croatian Danubian region  and pursuant torelevant Security Council resolutions  the two-yearUNTAES mandate expires on 15 January 1998. Croatiaholds that at this moment there are no reasons whatsoeverfor any prolongation of the UNTAES mandate beyond 15January 1998. We are also firmly convinced that thismission will be fully completed on time and will go downin history as one of the most successful United Nationspeacekeeping operations.The results achieved under the auspices of theUnited Nations and with the full cooperation of theCroatian authorities can be described as highlysatisfactory. Demobilization has been completed. Localelections have been held through which the CroatianDanubian region has been reintegrated into the legal andpolitical system of the country. Local Government haslargely been transferred to the newly elected andconstituted bodies.Rules have been defined and designed in cooperationbetween the Republic of Croatia  UNTAES and UNHCRto enable a dignified  safe and organized return ofdisplaced persons and refugees to their homes in and outof the Croatian Danubian region. So far a total of 1 500displaced Croats have returned to the Croatian Danubianregion  and a total of 8 000 Serbs have returned from theregion to their homes elsewhere in Croatia. The return ofdisplaced persons and the international presence willcontinue after the departure of UNTAES. At the invitationof the Croatian authorities  the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has undertaken tomonitor the developments in the Croatian Danubianregion after 15 January 1998.The reintegration of the Croatian Danubian regionhas never been an easy or simple process. The Republicof Croatia and all its citizens  especially the population ofthe Croatian Danubian region  including the personsexpelled from it  owe a debt of gratitude to UNTAES andall the States whose troops have participated in this highlysuccessful operation.The mandate of UNMOP  which has been given thetask of monitoring the demilitarization of the area fromboth sides of the southernmost border between theRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  has been helpful in stabilizing security in thatarea and in creating conditions for a lasting settlementthere through bilateral talks. The Republic of Croatia hasshown full understanding for the interests of the Federal14Republic of Yugoslavia with regard to the security of theBoka Kotorska Bay  while being concerned for its ownsecurity in the Dubrovnik hinterland. In this regard UNMOP has played an important role  but it will not bepossible to deal with the outstanding problems throughendless prolongations of the United Nations mandate.With relief and satisfaction  Croatia welcomes theeasing of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and remainsfirmly committed to the principles and implementation ofthe Washington and Dayton Accords. My Governmentgives its active support to preserving the integrity of Bosniaand Herzegovina  as well as to the consolidation of thefederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a foothold andframework for the survival and well-being of the Croatianpeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The role of the international community  especiallythat of the United Nations and the countries participating inSFOR  in the creation of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovinais irreplaceable at this stage of the peace process. Too mucheffort  resources and prestige have been invested in peacein Bosnia and Herzegovina  and too much suffering hasbeen experienced by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to allow any risk which may undermine what has beenachieved in Dayton and in its wake. Croatia will persist andpersevere in its role as an active peace agent in the region expecting other parties involved in the peace process tofulfil their obligations.Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords andcontinuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovinaas a community of two equal entities and three constituentpeoples have to be confronted with the sameuncompromising determination of the internationalcommunity  and  if required  with the same measures aswere earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina  whichproved to be entirely necessary and productive. Theeconomic reconstruction of the country — in which theinternational community should play an even more vitalrole — is also of special importance.The agenda of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly is extensive  and a great deal of work lies aheadof us. There is also an opportunity before us to have thissession of the General Assembly recorded in the annals ofthe Organization as a landmark in the Organization'sdevelopment. Croatia will be only too glad to help makethis come true."
"72",3066,"HTI",52,1997,"﻿At the outset  I wish to convey the pleasure of the Haitiandelegation at faithfully attending this great annual meeting which always has a particular importance for us. It is yetanother opportunity to participate in the discussions on thegreat questions before us and to seek better solutions in ourquest to preserve international peace and security andpromote economic and social progress.The consideration of various subjects will certainlyentail difficult debates  but Mr. Udovenko’s long experienceand solid understanding of international problems are sureguarantees for the successful outcome of our meetings. Incongratulating him on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session  I wish himevery success in his guidance of our work.I take this opportunity to express our gratitude toAmbassador Razali Ismail for the achievements of thefifty-first session.To our new Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  Iconvey our satisfaction at the dynamism with which hehas infused the Organization since he assumed office.Three weeks ago  the wreck of a passenger boat which killed more than 100 of my compatriots  threw thecountry into grief and the entire world into dismay.Messages of sympathy arrived from every corner  as didassistance that helped us to cope with this tragedy. Onbehalf of the Haitian people and Government  I wish toexpress our deep gratitude to the international community which  yet again  has demonstrated great solidarity withmy country.For some time  the gist of statements made in thisOrganization about Haiti was a plea for the restoration ofa state of law and an end to the violence and brutalauthoritarianism. Today  I am pleased to convey themessage that the Haitian people has been greatly relievedby the reestablishment of democratic institutions  assistedby the international community  and the United Nationsin particular.I wish to highlight some of the progress that hasbeen made in the political sphere and the efforts exertedto consolidate the gains of the new democratic deal whose rules of play are being increasingly respected. Thetransition of power has been recognized and accepted asa cardinal principle of political life. The state  quasi-stateand civil institutions are being further strengthened.Socio-professional associations and pressure groups areplaying an ever more active role.In the field of human rights  no effort has beenspared to end the repressive practices that characterizedthe former dictatorial regimes. Arbitrary arrests  summaryexecutions and abuse have practically disappeared. Thestructures of oppression have been dismantled andreplaced by institutions sensitive to the need to respectcitizens’ rights. This is the case with the National Policeforce that has replaced the Haitian Armed Forces  whichwere the main perpetrators of human rights violations inthe country. Created barely two years ago  this Policeforce continues to acquire the experience necessary tocarry out its responsibilities for keeping the peace andpublic safety. It is already gearing up to ensure securityand stability throughout the country when the mandate of17the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti ends in lateNovember.The judiciary  for its part  has enjoyed specialattention  given the desire for justice expressed by thepopulace. Parliament is currently considering a bill that willallow the necessary deep-rooted reforms to be undertakento improve the administration of justice.While the political situation in the country hasstabilized  economic and social performance has laggedbehind. The gaps created by the crisis of 1991-1994 haveyet to be breached. Democratic institutions are up andworking  it is true  but they remain fragile because certainneeds of the public have yet to be fulfilled.Nonetheless  efforts are being undertaken to revitalizethe economy. For example  it has been decided tomodernize public companies. Hence  the creation of theCouncil to Modernize Public Companies. Cooperation withParliament has already led to the creation of legalinstruments aimed at maximizing the potential of thesecompanies to the great profit of users and the consumers ofthe goods and services they produce. Similarly  the fiscaland financial system is being reformed and tradeliberalized. A bill on customs tariffs is currently underconsideration by Parliament.In order to invigorate national production  an agrarianreform programme has been launched that aims atbestowing ownership on the peasants of their means ofproduction. It works on three levels: access to land  accessto credit and availability of technical training. TheGovernment believes that agrarian reform will facilitate thesocial integration of citizens who have long beenmarginalized.This programme falls within an anti-poverty campaignled by the Government in order to assist the poorest sectorsof society. As can well be imagined  the democratic processin Haiti is being pursued  but it remains fragile because ofthe precarious situation and the great poverty of the people.It is quite obvious that  if it is to be viable  it must bemaintained  nurtured and supported by sustainabledevelopment.The Heads of State and Government who met hereduring the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations two years ago committed themselves toenabling the Organization to carry out its mandate properly.Consequently  the Secretary-General is now proposing aprogramme of reforms to strengthen the role of theOrganization and to give it a new impetus. We thank theSecretary-General for this initiative  to which we give ourfull support. This bold and innovative proposal willenable the Organization to become more effective andcarry out its mission fully.Some of the measures presented have drawn ourparticular attention. For example  there is the idea ofregrouping the activities of the United Nations aroundfive major themes: peace and security  economic andsocial development  development cooperation humanitarian affairs and human rights. However  we mustensure that development issues  which are crucial for themajority of Members  are given the same attention asother themes — if not more. Any reform must givedevelopment the priority  resources and politicalcommitment it deserves.The question of Security Council reform  which isstill being studied  is another matter on which we mustmake progress  given the Council’s role in themaintenance of international peace and security. Haiticontinues to call for more transparency and participationin the Council’s work  so that the views of States whichare not members of the Council are considered in thedecision-making process. Any expansion of the SecurityCouncil should be carried out in a way that guarantees afair and equal geographical representation. Everythingshould be done so that the universality of the inhabitantsof our planet is recognized in the United Nations system.However timely they may be  reforms alone will notmake the Organization more efficient if it does not haveadequate financial resources to carry out its activities. Weare convinced that the financial crisis of the UnitedNations may reduce its capacity to cope with the seriousproblems it faces.We need a strong and efficient United Nations capable of finding solutions to current problems andfacing the challenges of the next century. It is through theorchestrated  collective action of the United Nations thatwe will be able to overcome our numerous currentproblems  which threaten international peace and securityand compromise the well-being of our populations.There we refer first to the many armed conflictswhich are raging in all regions of the world  some ofwhich seem to resist any attempt at a negotiatedsettlement. Haiti encourages the use of regional andmultilateral mechanisms to solve these conflicts.18Likewise  the existence of vast arsenals of weapons ofmass destruction is a grave threat to our collective security.The progress achieved in the area of disarmament —especially the opening for signature last year of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the entry intoforce of the Chemical Weapons Convention — isencouraging. However  we urge the countries concerned tomake further efforts to achieve complete and truedisarmament.The Republic of Haiti welcomes the recent adoptionof the text of a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.This is an important step in the battle to eliminate thesedeadly devices  which have caused so much suffering andwhich continue to take a toll among civilian populations especially among women and children.The illicit use of drugs and drug trafficking are alsoproblems which the international community must face withdetermination. They are  in fact  a threat to the internalsecurity of small States because of the violence andcriminality with which they are often associated.Furthermore  drug use affects the most vulnerable stratumof society: young people. International cooperation isabsolutely necessary to overcome this scourge.Since 1960 several summits and conferences devotedto poverty and development have been organized.Recommendations have been formulated and measures havebeen contemplated. Nevertheless  poverty continues to gainground. According to the 1997 Human Development Report more than 1.5 billion of the planet’s inhabitants live in astate of extreme poverty  particularly in African countriesand less developed countries  which see themselvesincreasingly marginalized.The eradication of poverty  especially in the leastdeveloped countries  should go beyond simple speeches orresolutions. It requires a strong political will  adequateresources  well defined strategies and the implementation ofappropriate programmes. It also requires the sincere supportof the international community  especially the support ofinternational institutions and the leaders of the industrializedcountries  namely  those who possess technology andwealth. The battle against poverty must also be a strugglefor human dignity  sustainable development and peace.With a view to strengthening international peace andsecurity  the Republic of Haiti has pursued a policy of goodneighbourliness which has enabled it to come closer tocountries in the region. It has established with theDominican Republic a mechanism for consultations througha joint Haitian-Dominican Commission. This is anexcellent tool for cooperation and working together tofind a solution to the various problems of the island. Wewould like to see this important forum continue  as itrepresents a necessary stage towards greater mutualunderstanding between the Haitian and Dominicanpeoples.Likewise  Haiti recently rejoined the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM). By getting the train ofintegration under way  my country intends to contributein a significant manner to the realization of the objectivesof the Community  because Haiti is aware that a strong open-ended  united CARICOM will largely determine thesocio-economic performance of the Caribbean region. Inthis context  we urge the international community tocontinue to support the reconstruction of Montserrat.Fifty-two years ago at San Francisco we undertookto work for the progress and happiness of our peoples ina world where peace and security would reign. We shouldtherefore work to realize their dreams and meet theirexpectations and aspirations."
"73",3112,"HUN",52,1997,"﻿I am very pleased to see theForeign Minister of neighbouring Ukraine assume the12prestigious post of President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session. In fulfilling your challenging tasks youmay rest assured of the support and cooperation of thedelegation of Hungary.Our tribute and thanks are also due to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  whoserved us with distinction and innovative spirit.In the post-cold-war era  international organizationsare undergoing a profound adaptation process. Here  in theUnited Nations  we are only at the beginning of a bumpyroad. Whether the United Nations can find its place in thenew international political environment of the twenty-firstcentury depends on our foresight  realism anddetermination. If our decisions are underpinned by astrongly shared joint commitment to tackle the globalagenda  we can make the United Nations relevant for thenext millennium.The reform proposals presented by Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan are guided by the urgency of the task  soberrealism and healthy idealism as well as personalcommitment to change. We welcome the intention of theSecretary-General to proceed to the early implementation ofconcrete organizational measures within his own areas ofcompetence.The package of proposals which require action by theMember States themselves truly captures those areas ofUnited Nations activities where agreements are necessary atthis stage. The suggestions to ensure the desired coherenceof United Nations efforts in development cooperation  tobolster its institutional capacity to combat internationalcrime  drug-trafficking and terrorism  or to integrate humanrights concerns into all principal United Nations activitiesand programmes deserve our full support and need swiftand concrete action. Let me add the voice of my delegationto all those who have called for approval at this session ofthe package as a whole  which will have to be followed bypractical steps in order to translate it into meaningfulaction.In its foreign policy Hungary continues to serveinternational peace and stability  with special regard to itsown region. The tragic events in former Yugoslavia  thecrises and convulsions on the territory of the former SovietUnion and elsewhere  the emergence of aggressivenationalism as well as populism in Central and EasternEurope  as an appealing “remedy” for political problems economic difficulties and social tensions  are vividreminders of the critical  sometimes lethal  nature of thesechallenges. They underscore how important it is that theinternational community act with appropriate means andin a timely manner.Hungary supports the efforts of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and of othermultilateral regional organizations to help prevent newconflicts  to initiate  where needed  peacekeeping andpeace-building activities  to solidify the rule of law and topromote cooperation in the OSCE area. My country isseeking to consolidate genuine good-neighbourly relationswith all the countries of its region  especially withcountries bordering it  and to launch regional initiativesand enhance regional cooperation to better respond to thenew challenges threatening regional stability. It is in thisspirit that we have been active in the creation of  andhave sought to expand  various forms of regionalcooperation  such as the Central European Initiative  theCentral European Free Trade Agreement and the South-East European Cooperative Initiative  involving a largenumber of countries in the region  or have moved aheadwith trilateral  more tailor-made  cooperative schemeswith a number of our immediate neighbours. Regionaland cross-border cooperation is a valuable asset forregional stability and security  and has to be utilized to itsfull potential.As we look forward  from the invitation we receivedfrom the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit inMadrid to the winding up of the accession talks with theAlliance  and in the expectation of the commencement ofnegotiations on our entry into the European Union nextJanuary  we wish to develop further such regionalactivities of dialogue and wide-ranging cooperation inorder to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines andto assist all the countries of the region in their drive tojoin the mainstream European developments. We are alsoconfident that Hungary  through the structures of Euro-Atlantic integration  will become an even more activepartner and supporter of the United Nations.The post-cold-war era has brought to the forefronturgent questions. These include issues related to thefuture operation of the United Nations conflict-management capacity. The debate unfolding on theseproblems has political  legal and  quite often  emotionaldimensions as well. We welcome the proposals of theSecretary-General geared towards enhancing the rapidreaction capabilities of the United Nations.13It is in this context that in recent years Hungary hasincreased its participation in United Nations mandatedpeacekeeping operations in a variety of ways  includingboth infrastructural and logistical support and thedeployment of military and police personnel  an example ofwhich is the Hungarian contribution to the ImplementationForce and the Stabilization Force and the considerableincrease in the number of Hungarian peacekeepers servingin the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. Weare pleased that the performance and professional skill ofmy compatriots engaged in various such operations allacross the globe are considered positively.The issue of the functioning and the size of theSecurity Council has been extensively dealt with at severalUnited Nations forums. Legitimacy and efficiency are bothimportant premises for any pattern of Security Councilreform. The general view is that  once the Security Councilis enlarged  its size and composition should be not animpediment  but  rather  an asset for effective decision-making and action  enjoying the widest possible supportand cooperation of the membership at large. Agreement onSecurity Council enlargement is a fundamental pillar of theUnited Nations reform process. We have to make sure thatwith a future Security Council comprising Germany  Japanand countries each from Africa  Asia and Latin Americaand the Caribbean as permanent members  and alsoadditional non-permanent members  we preserve andenhance the purpose-oriented character of this importantbody.The financial reform of our Organization is anindispensable prerequisite to ensure its viability andrelevance. Payment of assessed contributions is anobligation under the United Nations Charter. Hungary hasmade serious efforts to meet all its outstanding financialassessments  and now we belong to the yet small  but hopefully  growing group of Member States which pay alltheir contributions to the regular as well as peacekeepingbudgets in full and without conditions.To solve the financial crisis  we must find a way thatis acceptable to Member States and is good for theOrganization. The delegation of Hungary stands ready tojoin in further constructive efforts along the lines of theproposal presented by the European Union with a view toarriving at a comprehensive compromise solution.After the demise of the political structures of the coldwar  international protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms can no longer be relegated to somedistant corner of United Nations activities. As a legitimateconcern of the international community  human rightsissues should be given their due weight in all UnitedNations activities  in a well coordinated manner. Thismust be reflected in the provision of adequate funding.Today  human rights are violated on a massive scaleworldwide  and we all must stand up in their defence andhold violators accountable wherever abuses occur. We areaware that there exist regional  cultural and otherspecificities in the field of human rights. We believe however  that these should not stand in the way ofconsistency in promoting universal respect for humanrights and should not allow complacency to surface inattitudes towards human rights violations.We are pleased with the Secretary-General’sexcellent choice of Mrs. Mary Robinson to serve as thenext High Commissioner for Human Rights. We will lendher assistance to make the United Nations more effectivein responding to human rights challenges  including thosestemming from ethnic discrimination. As recentdevelopments have shown  these represent a threat toregional and international stability and security.Development and environment are questions of theutmost importance for the future  and even the survival of humankind. United Nations activities in this sphereshould lead to the elaboration of a comprehensiveprogramme for sustainable development acceptable to allnations. We wish to voice our concern about theinsufficient progress achieved in this domain. We lendour full support to efforts aimed at seeking solutions tothe burning questions of underdevelopment and atstopping the processes of degradation of the ecologicalhabitat of our planet.Armed conflicts continue to take their toll sometimes decades after the cessation of hostilities  dueto the presence of anti-personnel landmines. The plight oftens of thousands of innocent victims has been a growingsource of international concern in no small part as a resultof effective advocacy by human rights groups andhumanitarian organizations. Hungary stands for the totalban of these devices. My Government has supported theOttawa process from its very inception; it welcomes thesuccess of the Diplomatic Conference held on this issueat Oslo and intends to become one of the first signatoriesof the new Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-PersonnelMines and on Their Destruction. This is an importantmilestone in the development of internationalhumanitarian law and in the endeavour to put an end to14the immense human suffering caused by the proliferationand indiscriminate use of these weapons. At the same time in our view  the remarkable achievements of the OsloConference do not diminish the role that other forums including the Conference on Disarmament  can play inpromoting the objectives of the new Convention.The horrible atrocities and genocidal acts committedduring recent conflicts have speeded up negotiations onestablishing international criminal jurisdiction on warcrimes and crimes against humanity. By establishing the adhoc tribunals on former Yugoslavia and on Rwanda  theinternational community reaffirmed an important principle:all those having committed war crimes or crimes againsthumanity are to be held personally responsible andaccountable. It is our legitimate expectation that all personsindicted by the tribunals will be brought to justice andmoreover that failing to cooperate fully with the tribunalswill not remain without consequences.The experience gained from the functioning of thesetwo ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wideracceptance of the idea of an international criminal court thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for theestablishment of individual criminal responsibility withregard to war crimes and crimes against humanity. We arecommitted to pursuing vigorously the negotiations at thissession to enable the finalization of the statute of the courtat the diplomatic conference to be held next year.At this session  we have to focus our efforts onpreparing the ground for practical steps to make the UnitedNations a viable and dynamic body. We must maintain themomentum for change if we want to ensure a decent futurefor the human experiment."
"74",3159,"IDN",52,1997,"﻿It gives me great pleasureto offer Foreign Minister Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukrainethe felicitations of my delegation on his assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession. I am confident that  under his experiencedleadership  we will achieve substantive progress in ourwork.I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Razali Ismail  for the skilful manner in which heguided our deliberations during an extraordinarily busyyear. His purposeful and decisive stewardship secured thesuccess of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.I join other members in commending our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his report “Renewing theUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform”. His initiativedeserves our praise and the recommendations in the reportmerit our serious consideration.Since we met last year  world developments havecontinued to show a mixture of bright promise  new7challenges and pervasive uncertainty. The post-cold-war erahas opened up new possibilities for the solution ofpersistent problems and conflicts and the pursuit of a globalagenda for peace and development. In various parts of theworld  protagonists have shown a desire to resolve theirdifferences through dialogue and negotiations. Globalizationhas raised the hopes of mankind for equitably sharedprosperity.Yet  intra-State conflicts continue to rage in manyparts of the world even as the international communityfaces a multitude of new and unpredictable threats andchallenges. Despite significant strides in limitingarmaments  the destructive power of nuclear weaponscontinues to pose a threat to all life on Earth. Poverty andbackwardness hold dominion over vast areas of thedeveloping world  while the developing countries areincreasingly marginalized in international economicdecision-making.We cannot hope to rid the world of these systemicproblems unless we can devise an effective system ofglobal governance capable of managing the impact ofglobalization and interdependence  fulfilling the interlinkeddemands of peace  security and development  andreconciling the competing interests of a constantly wideningrange of actors in international affairs. For that system ofglobal governance to be effective and universally accepted it must have for its central mechanism and source oflegitimacy a United Nations revitalized through a processof judicious reform and democratization.My delegation has therefore welcomed the UnitedNations reform package that the Secretary-Generalpresented to the General Assembly last July. We supportthe endeavour to transform the leadership and managementstructure of the Organization so that it can address thechallenges of the new millennium with a greater sense ofpurpose  effectiveness and efficiency. We commend theproposal to promote sustained and sustainable developmentthrough  inter alia  the creation of a “developmentdividend” by shifting resources to development activities especially those for poverty alleviation.We attach great importance to the proposed measureto overcome the financial crisis of the Organization throughthe creation of a revolving credit fund pending theattainment of a permanent solution to the crisis. Just ascrucial is the idea of enhancing the effectiveness of theUnited Nations in disarmament activities by establishing anew department for disarmament and arms regulation  to beheaded by an Under-Secretary-General. That newdepartment  however  should squarely address thequestion of nuclear disarmament as a priority issue andnot only the non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction.We also welcome the efforts to improve theOrganization's ability to deploy peacekeeping and otherfield operations more rapidly  enhance the United Nationscapacity for post-conflict peace-building  strengtheninternational efforts to combat drugs  crime and terrorism and bolster international response to global humanitarianneeds. The reorganization and restructuring of the humanrights secretariat is also timely and appropriate. However the idea of extending human rights activities byintegrating them into all United Nations activities andprogrammes entails careful study. Hence  Indonesia standsready to participate constructively in the detaileddiscussions on the proposed reform package which willtake place during this Assembly.Of equally vital concern is the question of thereform and expansion of the Security Council so as toreflect the realities of today and to accommodate the basicinterests of the developing countries which comprise theoverwhelming majority in the Organization. On theexpansion of membership of the Council  our view is wellknown: that new permanent members should be chosennot only on the basis of equitable geographicrepresentation  but also on the basis of a set of criteriasuch as political  economic and demographic weight; theircapability and their track record of contributing to thepromotion of peace both regionally and globally; and theircommitment to assume responsibilities inherent topermanent membership. And we should first discuss andagree on this set of criteria before we determine whorepresents which region or which group of Membercountries. We should not put the cart before the horse.In this regard  predetermined numerical limitationswould unduly restrict and possibly distort therepresentative value of the expansion of the SecurityCouncil. The African Member countries have indicatedthat they would like to have two permanent seatsrepresenting their region. By the same token  we believethat it is legitimate that the new composition of theSecurity Council should have two new permanentmembers from among the developing countries of theAsian continent.As emphasized by the Ministerial Conference of theMovement of Non-Aligned Countries  held last April inNew Delhi  there should be no partial or selective8expansion of the membership of the Security Council to thedetriment of the developing countries  and efforts torestructure the Council should not be subject to anyimposed time-frame  for although the issue is urgent itshould not be decided before there is general agreement.The Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement alsostressed that the use of the veto should be curtailed with aview to its eventual elimination  and that the improvementof the working methods of the Council should be givenequal importance.While we are deeply engaged in this process of reformwe must not lose sight of the fundamental goals thatimpelled us to undertake it in the first place: to enhance theOrganization's ability to foster development and to addressthe root causes of poverty and conflict. Reform should notbecome a euphemism for budget slashing or an excuse forcertain Member States to renege on their financialobligations to the Organization. When reforms are in place they could indeed ensure optimum use of resources andgenerate savings. But they could become meaningless if due to insolvency  the United Nations were renderedincapable of fulfilling its mission.Much of the insecurity in the world today stems fromthe fact that the international community has not been ableto abolish nuclear armaments. The Non-Proliferation Treatyhas been indefinitely extended  but without any guaranteethat the commitment to nuclear disarmament will behonoured. We are also dismayed that the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty does not effectively prohibitnuclear testing in all environments and for all time  withoutloopholes or exceptions.Nevertheless  we signed the Treaty in the hope that thenuclear Powers on their own would refrain from testingthrough simulation. That hope has been shattered by thesub-critical tests announced recently by a nuclear-weaponState. Although these sub-critical tests do not legally violatethe CTBT  they make a travesty of the spirit of the Treaty.The nuclear Powers should desist from conducting suchtests  as they could lead to the resumption of the nucleararms race and its attendant risk of global disaster.Meanwhile  in South-East Asia  the South-East AsiaNuclear- Weapon-Free Zone Treaty came into force earlierthis year. We hope that the nuclear-weapon States will alsocontribute to regional security by their timely accession tothe relevant Protocol of the Treaty.In the Middle East we are witnessing a continuingescalation in Israeli provocative acts. Israel's encroachmentson East Jerusalem  especially in Jabal Abu Ghneim  haveplunged the peace process into deeper crisis and triggeredunrest and tension on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.Israel persists in its illegal construction activities  inblockading Palestinian territory and besieging Palestiniancities and towns and in withholding funds belonging tothe Palestinian Authority.The imposition of a harsh regimen of collectivepunishment contravenes all international legal norms andprinciples and violates the fundamental rights of thePalestinian people. We must therefore vigorously supportall efforts to restore the momentum of the peace processand to bring about the resumption of negotiations basedon the provisions of the Declaration of Principles and theprinciple of land for peace. And we must continue topress for progress on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks of the peace process  for without suchprogress a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastquestion is not possible.In Cambodia  the recent regrettable turn of events which resulted in a significant change in the governmentalset-up and political situation has threatened to plunge thecountry back into factional strife and instability. Theinterests of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) and Cambodia are inextricably linked  and thestability of Cambodia is essential to the stability of theSouth-East Asian region. Therefore  while ASEANreaffirms its commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  it standsready to contribute its efforts to help restore politicalstability in Cambodia. Accordingly  ASEAN has proposedthe immediate cessation of all armed hostilities and actsof violence throughout Cambodia and called on theconflicting parties to resolve their differences amicably.Indonesia believes that a principled solution can onlybe reached through dialogue  with the aim of preservingthe coalition Government that reflects the power-sharingarrangements resulting from the elections of 1993  heldunder the auspices of the United Nations. Furthermore free and fair elections should be held as scheduled nextMay  with the participation of all Cambodian parties andpolitical forces as an important element of its success.Indonesia welcomes the convening of the four-partytalks among the Republic of Korea  the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea  the United States and thePeople's Republic of China. We believe that a positiveoutcome to these talks will pave the way for theestablishment of a permanent peace mechanism and that9the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization(KEDO) will facilitate endeavours towards a lastingsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.In Bosnia and Herzegovina the implementation of thePeace Agreement has entered a critical phase. Keyprovisions of the Agreement remain unimplemented.Refugees and displaced persons continue to be denied theirright to return to their pre-war homes. Freedom ofmovement has not been restored fully  and discriminationand harassment are still prevalent. Challenges remain in thefunctioning of the common State institutions that are sovital to unity and reconciliation.The unravelling of the Peace Accord would havedevastating consequences for Bosnia and Herzegovina andits neighbours. All concerned should therefore join ranksand work together to ensure the irreversibility of the peaceprocess and the full implementation of the Peace Accords.It is encouraging to note from the World Economicand Social Survey and other authoritative sources that theglobal economy is basically healthy  that growth rates haverisen for the third consecutive year and that such progresshas been more widespread than before. However  we haveno illusions that the global economy has fully recoveredfrom a protracted period of decline during the past decade.The echoes of the recession in the 1980s are stillreverberating. Millions in the developing world are stilllanguishing in wrenching poverty. And this new growth hashad little impact on rates of unemployment and under-employment. In fact  it would take another 10 years ofsimilar growth just to recover the gross domestic productper capita levels of the early 1980s.Globalization has indeed brought about anunprecedented surge in international trade  investments andinformation flows  but it has also accentuated the inequitiesand imbalances of international economic relations. Onlythe developed economies have fully benefited from it. Thedeveloping countries as a whole continue to suffer itsnegative impact while being marginalized from internationaleconomic decision-making processes in which they couldotherwise seek redress from the inequities weighing downtheir development efforts.Even developing economies that have attained somemeasure of dynamism are not immune to the perils ofglobalization and liberalization. Given the sharp fluctuationsof international financial flows and currency manipulationby speculators  economies built through years of patient sound and solid fiscal and monetary policies could becrushed overnight in the anarchy of the globalized marketplace. Globalization should  therefore  be managed so asto soften its impact on vulnerable economies.Indonesia welcomes the adoption by the GeneralAssembly of An Agenda for Development  a majorinitiative designed to restore the theme of development tothe centre of the operations of the United Nations. TheAgenda provides a comprehensive framework ofprinciples and measures designed to promote developmentas a vital preoccupation of the international community.It also seeks to restore the centrality of the UnitedNations in the pursuit of international cooperation fordevelopment.Perhaps the greatest constraint to development todayis the dearth of financial resources for development.While there is an increased emphasis on foreign directinvestment  and this is welcome  the fact remains thatofficial development assistance constitutes the principalsource of development financing for the majority of thedeveloping countries. Regrettably  official developmentassistance is in sharp decline  and has today reached itslowest level since target levels were adopted in 1970.Because many developing countries are unable to attractadequate volumes of foreign direct investment  theconstriction of official development assistance has takenan enormous toll on their social and economicdevelopment  particularly in their efforts aimed atreducing hunger  illiteracy and child mortality. Wetherefore support the proposal in the reform packagesubmitted by the Secretary-General for the creation of anOffice of Development Financing that will pursue thisendeavour full-time in tandem with the proposed“development dividend”.The problem of chronic external indebtednessconstitutes another debilitating impediment todevelopment. Despite various debt relief initiatives in thepast  many developing countries remain crippled by theirdebt overhangs. My country has always advocated a once-and-for-all approach that entails a reduction ofindebtedness to a level that will allow resumption ofdevelopment. We therefore support the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Initiative of the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and the World Bank  as it would help someof the poorest countries escape the vicious cycle ofindebtedness and deprivation and once again take the roadto development. In this context  Indonesia has pledged  asa concrete expression of this support  $10 million to theWorld Bank's Trust Fund for the debt relief of the heavilyindebted poor countries. We also urge that these10initiatives be implemented expeditiously and withflexibility  and that they cover other heavily indebtedcountries that are also in dire need of development.In this era of trade liberalization  and in spite of thepresence of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  thedeveloping countries are finding their comparativeadvantage rendered meaningless by an array of non-tariffbarriers  preference-erosion and the misuse of anti-dumpingmeasures and countervailing duties. Moreover  thepersistent attempts of developed countries to linkinternational trade issues with extraneous issues  such aslabour standards  amount to a new form of protectionism.Such insidious obstacles to free and open trade have to bedone away with so that the global economy can benefitfrom an equitable  transparent and rule-based multilateraltrading system  with the World Trade Organization as itsembodiment.Our common aspirations for global economic andsocial development will never be realized until all forms ofdiscrimination are removed from society and opportunity isafforded equitably to all humanity. The Programme ofAction for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and RacialDiscrimination (1993-2003) should be the vehicle of ourendeavours to end all forms of racism and racialdiscrimination. The Beijing Declaration and Platform forAction  adopted at the Fourth World Conference onWomen  must be vigorously implemented at all levels.Likewise  implementation of the Copenhagen Declarationand Programme of Action is essential for the attainment ofa positive environment for enhancing the human condition.As to the environment  it is regrettable that the specialsession of the General Assembly devoted to the review ofthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment and Agenda 21 has revealed that thecommitments to the Rio Conference and to the Agendahave not been substantially fulfilled. The internationalcommunity  particularly the countries that have thetechnological and financial resources  must summon thepolitical will to bring positive action to support Agenda 21.Vigorous measures should also be taken in defence ofour human resources and social values against the thrusts ofinternational crime  drug trafficking and drug abuse. Wetherefore remain committed to support the mechanisms ofthe United Nations anti-crime and anti-drug programmes.We look forward to the convening of a special session ofthe General Assembly in 1998 to assess the situation and todevelop further ways and means of combating theseinternational social evils.In the area of human rights  the United Nationsshould continue to strengthen its role as the architect ofa common plan based on a holistic approach toward thepromotion of  and respect for  the inherent dignity of thehuman being. At all levels  we must work with allinterested parties  maintain constructive relationships andfoster dialogue and cooperation as the most effectivemeans of advancing human rights. In this regard Indonesia stands ready to cooperate with the HighCommissioner for Human Rights. We also support allinitiatives promoting a more balanced approach to humanrights. In this context  we note with interest the 19-pointUniversal Declaration on Human Responsibilitiesproposed by the InterAction Council. We agree withformer Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser  theInterAction Council Chairman  that  if adopted by theinternational community  the Declaration on HumanResponsibilities  together with the Universal Declarationof Human Rights  could serve as twin pillars providing anethical base for a just world. Indeed  freedom withoutacceptance of responsibility can destroy freedom itself whereas when rights and responsibilities are balanced freedom is enhanced. We have always held that althoughthe individual should not be sacrificed in the name ofsociety  neither should society be allowed to disintegrateto accommodate the individual. Without this fine balance neither rights nor responsibilities can meaningfully exist.Allow me to take this opportunity to express thegratitude of my Government to the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for the singular honourit recently bestowed on Indonesia by formally citingHis Excellency President Soeharto and the people ofIndonesia for“outstanding accomplishments and commitments tothe significant reduction and continued eradication ofpoverty in Indonesia and for making povertyeradication an overriding theme of nationaldevelopment efforts.”This is an honour that Indonesia holds in trust for alldeveloping countries endeavouring  in spite of theirconstraints and adversities  to attain a better life for theirpeoples while still contributing to the making of a betterworld. With developed and developing nations workingtogether within the framework of a revitalized UnitedNations  we can indeed before too long achieve the finalconquest of the most formidable and tenacious enemy ofhumankind  poverty.11"
"75",3206,"IND",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  it is a particularpleasure for me to see you presiding over the GeneralAssembly. As Ambassador to the former Soviet Union forfive years  I had a long association with Ukraine  and Iretain the fondest memories of my several visits to yourbeautiful country. You preside over an Assembly that willdeliberate on crucial issues before the world community on which your experience and guidance will beinvaluable. I would also like to congratulate yourpredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  on theengagement with which he acted during his presidency tocarry our work forward. I am delighted also to see theSecretary-General here.We are celebrating in India the fiftieth anniversaryof our emergence as a free nation. The constitutionalmoorings and the democratic forms which the new nation-State has accepted and adopted rest on the vast foundationof civilizational experience and ethos. This explains thestability  coherence and creative unity of the vast Indiansociety  which is a world in itself. The experience haswrought in us the deep conviction that  while there areuniversally shared values and striving  there can be norigid prescriptions. We see the United Nations in thisimage  as a crucible in which we meld together ourindividual contributions to a world civilization  yet6recognizing the variety of historical and cultural experienceswe bring to it.The cold war cast an early shadow on theOrganization  creating a situation of ideologicalpolarization. The Non-Aligned Movement rejected thisimposition of rigidity  representing an independent andresponsible alternative to the world view. This remains true and the Non-Aligned Movement retains its validity andrelevance  even after the disappearance of bloc rivalries.Non-alignment was not a by-product of the cold war. Then it expressed the overwhelming need of previously colonizedand disempowered nations to a voice  a perspective and anagenda in a politically and economically unequal andinequitable world. Today  it remains a voice of reason andconstructive engagement for the times ahead  which demandcommon purpose and contribution from all sides towards aconvergence of intent on vital  even fateful  globalconcerns.Since the creation of the Charter of the UnitedNations  the world should have changed far more than ithas in the half century that has elapsed. Decolonization isalmost complete  but the scars of colonization are still withus. The present bears a heavy burden of the past. SouthAfrica is free  but racism rears its ugly head amidst us often laced with xenophobia. Development and growth —and even human dignity — remain for much of the worlda distant dream. We must insistently ask ourselves what wecan decisively do at the United Nations to make the dreamsof the hundreds of millions come true  how we can makethe United Nations a more vibrant organization for theworld community as a whole  at a time when we need itmore than we ever have  a United Nations that is betterequipped to fully respond to the challenges of the nextcentury.As an organization  the United Nations must alsoevolve and adapt itself to a rapidly changing environment the better to serve the core needs of the world community.As a country which sets very great store on the capacity ofthe United Nations to contribute to international peace andsecurity  and to development — the two crucial prioritiesbefore the world community — India  like others  has avital interest in a United Nations that continually makesitself more responsive to the needs of its Member Statesand prepares itself to serve them better. This  we believe is the objective of reform. We are hence very pleased thatthe Secretary-General  immediately after taking office made reform one of his priorities and we congratulate himon this commitment. Within the first seven months of histenure  he has produced a series of proposals of impressivebreadth and scope. These are before us  and many havedescribed this session as a reform General Assembly. Inthis connection  I extend my good wishes to you Mr. Secretary-General.We judge the agenda for reform by the measures Ihave described. We are supportive of all proposals that in our view  will carry forward  or improve  theSecretariat’s ability to respond to the mandates of theinternational community. We will express our thoughtsconstructively with the aim of strengthening the processand direction of reform to the collective advantage of theglobal community and the Organization that represents it.We do not see reform simply as an exercise to trim thebudget of the United Nations. Instead  reforms shouldcontribute towards strengthening the United Nations andits capacity to respond effectively to the prioritiesidentified by the overwhelming majority of itsmembership.The crisis that confronts the United Nationsmanifests itself in many ways. A financial crisis hasresulted from the inability of some to fulfil their Chartercommitments  and from the laying down of pre-conditionsto meet them. The United Nations does not have themeans to execute programmes that respond to the feltneeds and priorities of its membership  precisely at a timewhen such programmes are sorely necessary. As a result the United Nations is in danger of being marginalized asthe global forum where decisions can be taken that trulyrespond to the challenges of globalization. The solutionlies not in piecemeal reform but in building trust betweennations  and in an acceptance that in internationalrelations democratic principles should be the norm  just asthey are being increasingly accepted in nationalgovernance.In our view  international peace and security anddevelopment are inextricably linked. The one isimpossible to achieve without the other. Over the last sixor seven years  there has been a growing emphasis on thepolitical aspects of the tasks of development  such asdemocracy and human rights. Unless the underlyingcauses of underdevelopment  poverty and social alienationare effectively addressed and removed  this emphasis willremain unrealized. Therefore  the single most importanttarget that the United Nations should set itself is thepromotion of sustained economic growth in thedeveloping countries that will lead to the eradication ofpoverty  and erase the tensions and pressures that haveled to the collapse of governance and social order inseveral States  and to conflicts between others.7International peace and stability will be enhanced onlywhen all countries enjoy a minimum standard of economicself-sufficiency and well-being. Therefore  we believe thatthe thrust of any reform proposals in the United Nationsshould make the promotion of sustained economicdevelopment the principal cross-sectoral issue for theSecretariat’s programmes. We believe that there are enoughintergovernmental mandates to permit the Secretariat totailor programmes towards this end.The universality of human rights  to which we allcommitted ourselves almost five years ago at Vienna expresses itself at one level in the international norms forthe promotion and protection of human rights and ourcollective efforts to foster respect for these standards. On ahigher plane  this universality stems from the search indifferent civilizations for ways of protecting the humandignity of every individual. Next year  as we celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  we will reflect on whether the ideals enshrined inthe Declaration have become a reality for people in all partsof the world. As we do so  we must build confidence in aprocess that encourages introspection and self-criticism dialogue and consultation  rather than confrontation andjudgement. The Declaration calls for the advent of a worldorder in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speechand belief and freedom from fear and want as the highestaspirations of the common people. It recognizes theimportance of economic  social and cultural rights as wellas their interdependence with civil and political rights. Thefull realization of all these rights is what will give truemeaning to the quest for human dignity embodied in theUniversal Declaration.India’s approach to the observance and promotion ofhuman rights is inspired by the holistic vision of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the IndianConstitution. A strong constitutional framework  mutuallyreinforcing safeguards  both within and outside thisframework; a policy of transparency and responsiveness tocivil society; and cooperation with the human rights systemof the United Nations — in particular with the treatybodies — are the main elements of this approach in theareas of civil and political rights. Equally important  if notmore so  are the assault on poverty and underdevelopment;the promotion of awareness of rights; and a policy ofaffirmative action for the uplifting of socially andeconomically vulnerable sectors of society.This is a complex task  especially in a country ofIndia’s diversity. Many times  when the State has falteredcivil society has stepped in. In India  as elsewhere individuals have wrought miracles by working outside theestablished systems and going beyond traditional ways ofthinking. In recent times  the most moving example hasbeen that of a frail  sari-clad woman: Mother Teresa. Herfathomless compassion and soothing touch will be missedby millions in India. I would like to pay tribute to thisapostle of mercy who rendered service and brought hopeto millions of poor and suffering people  not only in Indiabut all over the world.While development must be our supreme objective we also need peace  stability and security in order toachieve it. The dangers that threaten us have becomeincreasingly more frightening during the last 50 yearsthan any that have cast their shadow over mankind in itsentire history. The development of nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons has made it possible to destroy wholepopulations. As the international community  we havedecided to outlaw the production  possession and use ofchemical and biological weapons.However  with regard to the weapons of massdestruction capable of the total annihilation of humancivilization  the global community has lived for too longon a diet of empty promises. The pretexts cited in favourof clinging to nuclear arsenals  while always questionable have now vanished. Mere non-proliferation treatiespromoted as disarmament measures only serve to entrencha nuclear monopoly. No credible steps towards striving torealize a nuclear-weapon-free world are contemplated much less taken  by those who should be showing theway. No justifications can be proffered  as they wereduring the cold war.The patience of the world community — asexpressed by the International Court of Justice  by theenlightened voices of those who formerly believed indeterrence  by political and general opinion and byweighty voluntary initiatives — is starting to wear thin.Nuclear-weapon Powers owe it to the world to answer thequestion why they need nuclear weapons. Global opinionwants a nuclear weapons convention — as has alreadybeen outlined for the class of biological and chemicalweapons — and will not rest until it is achieved. Weappeal to nuclear-weapon States to align their policieswith what the world wants. We see the United Nations asthe forum in which the international community mustcontinue to demand universal nuclear disarmament  andwe therefore expect that the Secretariat's programmes willsupport this intergovernmental objective.8Under the Charter  the Security Council wasconstituted as a body on which the general membershipconferred primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  acting on its behalf. Inrecent years  the Security Council has been able to play amore active role in discharging its responsibilities.However  there is often a perception that the Council’sactions have not always reflected the sentiments of thegeneral membership. Therefore  it is imperative — and thetime has come — for the Security Council to take on aspermanent members developing countries which areequipped to make important contributions through theirworld views and historical experiences and the values oftheir civilizations. In this way the decisions of the Councilwill truly reflect the wider membership of the UnitedNations. Otherwise  the Council’s actions will be seen asprogressively less representative precisely at a time when itis being called upon to act far more frequently than beforeon behalf of the world community.India has let it be known in the General Assemblysince 1994 that it is prepared to accept the responsibilitiesof permanent membership. We are the largest democracy inthe world  with a civilization replete with ancient valuesand achievements  as well as a world view based on auniversalist inspiration  participatory governance  respect fordiversity and pluralism  and a readiness for constructiveengagement in the world’s affairs. These strengths  webelieve  would be an asset to an expanded Security Council.India’s standing as one of the leading economies of theworld will be progressively strengthened  and we areprepared to bear fully the responsibilities of permanentmembership. India’s long-standing participation in UnitedNations peacekeeping operations testifies not only to thededication and professionalism of Indian soldiers  but alsoto the political will of the Government to activelycontribute to these operations.The core of our foreign policy is our keenness topursue close ties and build confidence and cooperation withour neighbours  while recognizing fully that we are thelargest country in the region  in terms not only of size andpopulation but also of economic capabilities. We extend ourhand of friendship not in a spirit of mere reciprocity but ingood faith. Where we do expect reciprocity  unrelated tosize and capacity  is in mutual respect for each other’sterritorial integrity and sovereignty. We seek to advancecohesion  synergy and mutual goodwill in ourneighbourhood so that together we can fully participate inand derive benefits from the dynamic changes the world iscurrently witnessing. Our approach has contributed to thesetting in motion of a trend towards cooperation in ourregion.As a large and diverse economy  we are developingnew partnerships that go beyond the region and revitalizethe old cultural and commercial links. Politically  this isexpressed in the active interest that we have taken insupporting the Middle East peace process — our ties withthe Arab world reaching deep into history — and ourstrong fraternal ties with developing countries in generaland with Africa in particular. In our largerneighbourhood  with which we have a shared history  wehave enhanced our engagement with the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a full-dialoguepartner and as a participant in the ASEAN RegionalForum.While maintaining our traditional relationships withthe United States  Russia  the European Union and Japan we have also been strengthening global trends in regionalcooperation by actively promoting cooperation amongcountries of the Indian Ocean rim and trying to recoverthe cultural and commercial connectivities that haveexisted since time immemorial and which were snappedin the colonial era.Global society is seeking to find an equilibriumbetween the opposing pulls generated by the forces ofglobalization  nationalism and sub-nationalism. Indeed  itis difficult to see just how they can be balanced  yet theymust be or else the potential for internationalconflagration will be immense. Hence  the absolute needfor extreme caution to prevent established nation Statesfrom being destabilized either through too hasty a pushtowards globalization or through the pull of sub-nationaldemands. We see this as a challenge which we will haveto face collectively as well as individually.A global menace that threatens international peace and to which open democracies are particularlyvulnerable  is terrorism. It takes innocent livesindiscriminately  brings fear into the lives of others andshatters the peaceful existence and the normal growth ofentire communities. Terrorism should be anathema to theinternational community because it is the antithesis ofevery ideal that the United Nations Charter enshrines. Itsmain vehicle is violence; its aim is destruction rather thandevelopment; its doctrines are founded on intolerance;and  in the means it uses and the effect it has  it destroyshuman rights utterly.9Incitement to terrorism and complicity andparticipation in terrorism across borders undermine theinternational system. And even though very few societiesare free from its clutches  we still have not developed aglobal strategy to defeat this evil. The resolve is absent. Itis important that we find it  not least because terrorism hasa global web  spanning all countries and continents andquickly building links with the other global menace: drugs.We in India see in our region just how deadly a poison thismix of terrorism and drugs is. The United Nations shouldtake the lead in determined global action to root out thesescourges.The protection and preservation of the environment isan area to which all of us attach the highest importance.The commitment to global partnership for preventingfurther degradation of the environment  made at the RioSummit in 1992  was reiterated and the need for effectiveimplementation of Agenda 21 reaffirmed during the specialsession of the General Assembly in June this year. All theelements of Agenda 21 have to be implemented in full andwe need to accelerate the process of such implementation.Any partial or non-comprehensive implementation will bedetrimental not only to international cooperation in thisarea  but also to the threatened stability of the Earth’sfragile environment. In this connection  it is our hope thatthe spirit of the Convention on Climate Change and theBerlin Mandate will be fully encompassed by the protocolor legal instrument to emerge from the Kyoto Conferenceto be held in December 1997.What has been touched upon represents hugechallenges beyond the capacity of any country to face on itsown. This is why it is so vital for the United Nations  nowmore than ever before  to be a forum where we can poolcreative ideas and lessons from our experience and to assistus in understanding and coping with these challenges. Thisis the ultimate rationale of reform. We will be ready towork with other countries to rebuild the United Nations inthe image of our collective aspirations and as our trustedinstrument to meet the challenges of the approachingcentury.Addressing the General Assembly at its fifteenthregular session  I recall India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru  saying here in 1960:“The main purpose of the United Nations is tobuild up a world without war  a world based on thecooperation of nations and peoples. It is not merely aworld where war is kept in check for a balancing ofarmed forces. It is much deeper than that. It is a worldfrom which the major causes of war have beenremoved and social structures built up which furtherpeaceful cooperation within a nation as well asbetween nations.” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fifteenth session  Plenary Meetings 882nd meeting  para. 117)It is in this spirit that we should approach the tasksbefore us. I do hope and pray that  under your guidance Sir  and under the spirited leadership of the Secretary-General  these objectives will be achieved."
"76",3252,"IRL",52,1997,"﻿I would like to offer ForeignMinister Udovenko of Ukraine my warmestcongratulations on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session. His skilland experience will serve us well in directing the vitalwork to be undertaken at this session. Ireland  and you Ambassador Campbell as Vice-President of the GeneralAssembly  will spare no effort in assisting the Presidentin the important tasks of his office.I also wish to thank Ambassador Razali Ismail forthe energy and commitment he devoted to guiding theAssembly at its last session.My colleague Foreign Minister Poos ofLuxembourg  speaking on behalf of the EuropeanUnion  set out clearly in his speech to the Assembly theagenda for action by the United Nations and itsMember States in facing the challenges of the worldtoday. Ireland associates itself fully with his remarks.This session is a crucial one for the UnitedNations. Decisions must be taken to make the UnitedNations more effective in meeting its real objectivesand priorities in future years. The Secretary-General haspresented us with a considered  balanced and substantialpackage of proposals for United Nations reform. Thispackage marks a turning point in the reform andrevitalization process. The Secretary-General hasrecognized that the future of the United Nations can besecured only by a clearer focus and better coordinationof effort  expertise and resources on the keypriorities — real peace and security  sustainabledevelopment  equitable economic and social progress humanitarian action and  underlying all of these  thesafeguarding of universal human rights.Ireland welcomes in particular the proposals for amore concerted effort in the economic and socialdevelopment sector. Together with our European Unionpartners  we have been developing our own contributionin this area. Our aim is a more effective and coherentUnited Nations effort which would finally make realinroads  particularly in the least developed countries  inthe fight against poverty and underdevelopment. Wewelcome the intention of the Secretary-General tochannel the resources saved in this exercise todevelopment programmes of the Organization.I know that some will feel that the proposals donot go far enough in one direction  and others inanother. It is not possible to accommodate fully allconcerns. But there is enough in these proposals tomake the start on reform that we have all been lookingfor. I therefore earnestly appeal to all Member States tojoin this broad consensus of support.We should also  at this session  work to achieve asolution to the difficult questions of the financing of theUnited Nations and of the enlargement and workingmethods of the Security Council. Ireland  my country has declared its candidacy for the Security Council inthe year 2000. We shall do everything possible to earnsupport for our candidacy.24Living through times of dramatic change is rarelyeasy. Globalization and liberalization of the internationaleconomy have brought significant benefits to manycountries and are changing the shape of our world. Somedeveloping countries have benefited from these processesand made significant economic and social strides. Others especially in sub-Saharan Africa  have become even moremarginalized from the world economy  and this isunacceptable.Ireland has been increasing its official-development-assistance budget over a number of years. MyGovernment is committed to making steady progresstowards achieving the United Nations target of 0.7 percent in our development-cooperation assistance.Specifically  we are committed to having Irish aid reach0.45 per cent of gross national product by 2002.Some critics contend that development cooperationhas not succeeded. The best response to this is to point towhat it has already achieved. In regard to the mostfundamental of all human rights  life expectancy aroundthe world has increased by a third in the past threedecades; infant mortality has been cut in half. These arenot small achievements.In our present globalized and increasinglyinterdependent world economy  we need to seek a newpartnership between developed and developing countriesto address those issues which affect the entireinternational community. In this the United Nations hasan indispensable role to play  and we pledge our fullsupport to assist the Secretary-General in his task.In June 1998 the General Assembly will meet inspecial session to address the drugs issue  both at thenational and international levels. I had the honour  asMinister of Justice and in the role of President of theCouncil of Ministers of the European Union  to addressthe General Assembly on this question in 1990. TheAssembly has regularly considered further action to dealwith this menace. But the action that has been taken sofar has clearly been inadequate. We must redouble ourefforts. Drugs are an international cancer which threatenthe lives of the present and future generations particularly our young. For all our people  they pose areal threat to the very fabric of society.Last week saw the conclusion of negotiations inOslo on a global Convention banning landmines  withoutreservation  without exception and for all time. Thismajor step forward will be particularly welcomed bythose countries which have suffered so much as a resultof the use of these barbaric devices. Those countriesnot present there and not yet ready to sign in Decembermust take account of the widespread internationalsupport for this agreement. We appeal to them to helpensure the maximum degree of adherence to theConvention. The international community must nowwork together with ever greater determination toprovide for the clearing of mines already placed and forthe care and rehabilitation  as well as the social andeconomic reintegration  of mine victims.In 1961  when the then-Foreign Minister ofIreland  Mr. Frank Aiken  introduced a resolution at thesixteenth session of the General Assembly calling forthe conclusion of an international agreement that wouldprevent the spread of nuclear weapons  he launched aprocess which the Irish Government firmly believedwould eventually lead to total nuclear disarmament.Then as now  our conviction was that genuineinternational peace and security can never be achievedas long as nuclear weapons remain part of thearmouries of States.We welcome the achievements of recent years whether bilateral or multilateral: the START Treaties the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the globalban outlawing chemical weapons and present efforts tostrengthen the ban on biological and toxin weapons.These show that with the necessary will progress ispossible.Now is the time for serious consideration of anintegrated approach  encompassing both bilateral andmultilateral negotiations  culminating in an internationalagreement on a total ban on nuclear weapons. We mustinject a real sense of urgency into translating the goalof the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons into amore concrete reality. My plea is for reflection on thepart of all; for compromise and for cooperation  and fora flexible rather than a dogmatic approach. I believethat we can offer no better vision  courage andleadership in the service of peace than to take up thischallenge.While we can look forward one day to a worldfree of nuclear weapons  no time should be lost inagreeing how the peaceful uses of nuclear energy canbest be managed. We in Ireland live in close proximityto a nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant which poses aconsiderable threat to us because of the ever-presentrisk of a major accident at the plant. In many countries25today  nuclear energy is viewed with alarm andapprehension. Public resistance has persuaded someGovernments to renounce the nuclear option because thebenefits of nuclear energy have failed to convince asceptical and questioning public.The impact of accidents involving nuclear-powerreactors can cross international frontiers. The legitimateinterests of States affected by such accidents demand thathigh priority be given to strengthening nuclear safetyworldwide. Reactor safety and the closure of sub-standardreactors represent for my Government fundamentalnecessities that nuclear-energy States must meet.It is simply unacceptable that poor management ofradioactive waste and spent fuel should threaten thehealth and safety of populations or cause serious long-term damage to the environment of States which have nonuclear programmes. The recent Joint Convention dealingwith these matters will hopefully bring aboutimprovements. However  much more needs to be donethrough international cooperation to allay the deepmisgivings of a concerned public.Transport of nuclear materials and radioactive wasteraises the most serious and justifiable fears. We mustinsist that this  along with all other nuclear activities  becarried out in strict accordance with the highestinternational standards of safety and security.Furthermore  the entirely legitimate sensitivities of transitcountries affected by such movements must berecognized.As we approach next year's celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights  we must recognize that we have fallenshort in implementing the goals and aspirations of theDeclaration. While recognizing that none of us hasgrounds for complacency in this regard  it is a reality thatthe human rights situation in certain countries remains ofparticular concern to the international community. TheEuropean Union  in its memorandum to the GeneralAssembly  has listed the areas of particular concern to us including the human rights situation in Myanmar  EastTimor  Nigeria and Afghanistan  to name but a few.We must all work together — Governments andnon-governmental organizations and civil societygenerally — in dialogue and partnership to ensure thatthe human rights principles enshrined in the Charter andthe Universal Declaration are respected to the full.The current reforms proposed by the Secretary-General  in particular his decision to consolidate thetwo existing human rights offices into a single office ofHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  are to bewelcomed. They provide a clear opportunity tostrengthen significantly the human rights programme ofthe United Nations by fully integrating human rightsissues across the full range of United Nations activities.It is a cause of great pride to the Government and thepeople of Ireland that the Secretary-General has chosenMrs. Mary Robinson  the former President of Ireland as the new High Commissioner.I wish to turn now to an area of United Nationsactivity which is of particular concern and interest tomy country — that of peacekeeping. Ireland has aproud record of service in almost every major UnitedNations peacekeeping operation. We will continue thisrole  including our contribution of personnel from theIrish police force — the Garda Siochána — to the newand important role for civilian police in United Nationspeacekeeping operations.Our peacekeepers have at times paid a heavyprice: some 75 Irish peacekeepers have died in theservice of United Nations peacekeeping.Our support for the role of the United Nations inits peacekeeping role has not wavered. But it istempered by the sober recognition that  despite manysignificant successes in past decades  United Nationspeacekeeping  particularly in recent times  has notalways been effective. We must become better ataverting conflicts  through more vigorous preventivediplomacy and action in dealing with the roots ofconflict. When we are forced to intervene  our responsemust be prompt and better informed through effectiveearly warning systems. Our tasks and objectives mustbe better defined  both as regards keeping the peace andmaking the peace. The full support  political andmaterial  of the Member States is essential if they are tobe achieved effectively.Too often the United Nations has been asked  toits cost  to keep the peace indefinitely in conflict areas without any corresponding efforts by the parties to theconflict to make peace. All Member States of thisOrganization have a responsibility to ensure continuousand honest efforts to make the peace permanent.The changing international situation of the lastdecade has seen the emergence of new sources of26conflict and tension. Old ethnic rivalries and hatreds haveresurfaced  leading to new local and regional conflicts. InBosnia and Herzegovina  the killing has stopped  butprogress in building the peace has been painfully slow. Inthe Middle East  too  moving the peace process forwardis proving enormously more difficult than could havebeen imagined. We call on all parties to live up to theirresponsibilities and put the process back on track. InCyprus  in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in manyother places  the serious efforts of the internationalcommunity to secure lasting peace are making very slowheadway.In the island of Ireland  we face the task of forgingreconciliation and  leaving behind us the bitterness ofhistory  ensuring that the root causes of the threat topeace are addressed effectively.Successive Irish Foreign Ministers have addressedthis Assembly over the years and informedrepresentatives of the efforts being made to resolve theconflict in Northern Ireland and bring about a lastingpeaceful settlement. They have brought news ofsignificant advances  from the launching of theintergovernmental approach by Ireland and Britain in1980 and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in1985  to the formulation of the Joint Declaration in 1993and the publication of the Joint Framework document in1995.I now bring to the Assembly the joyous news thatyesterday in Belfast we succeeded in launchingsubstantial and historic all-party talks in which the futureof a peaceful and agreed Ireland is to be mapped out.What is notable about all of these developments — eachan important foundation stone in the current peaceprocess — is that they were undertaken in partnershipbetween the Irish and British Governments. Progress hasbeen driven by our two Governments  united in the questfor peace and a lasting and just settlement. That progresshas been defined and directed by the concept of the“totality of relationships”  with which our two islands areintertwined and which bears directly on the question ofNorthern Ireland. Northern Ireland represents theinterface between the respective traditions and futureaspirations of both Ireland and Britain. Only in thetotality of our relations can we come to terms with ourdiffering visions of the past and reconcile our hopes forthe future.The notion of the “totality of relationships” has beenreinforced recently by profound shifts in political andsocial attitudes in both Ireland and Britain. Thecharacter of these shifts has much in common in thatthey serve to illustrate the commonality that the peoplesof Ireland and Britain share.Ireland has been undergoing a dramatic andinvigorating process of renewal. This has been mostevident in our economic performance  but it is evidenttoo in our social and cultural life. I have a deep sensethat it has been encouraged and shaped by ourinvolvement in the evolution of Europe and thedevelopment of our multilateral relations through theUnited Nations itself. This renewal has been marked byinspiration about what can be done and by what isneeded pragmatically to achieve what we set out to do.In Britain  there has been a dramatic developmentwhich redefines and reshapes the nature of its politicalunion. And we too detect that same impulse toreinvigorate the institutions of the state  to undertake areappraisal and a renewal as the new millenniumapproaches.I believe that this sense of change in both islands this quickening pace  will be a very important factor asboth Governments and all the parties to the negotiationsin Northern Ireland take the peace process forward. Itwill  I believe  impart an urgency and focus to thedeliberations. More importantly  it means that thosewho form part of the talks process have the opportunityto shape their future rather than surrender throughindifference or apathy to the inexorability of change.For we live in a time which offers an invitation toshape our common future. That invitation is open to allthose with the courage and vision to participate in thetalks process  which seeks to reshape the relationswhich are central to the solution we seek — relationsbetween the two communities in Northern Ireland relations between the North and the South of our island and relations between Ireland and Britain.The efforts of both Governments to construct thecomplex structures on which to base a peace processwere undertaken with the very clear acknowledgmentthat ultimately it was there to serve all the parties mostdirectly involved in the conflict and  through them  thewider community. As the leader of the SocialDemocratic and Labour Party (SDLP)  John Hume  soclearly recognized  it had to be an inclusive peaceprocess if it was to be a lasting one.27Creating the conditions for this inclusive processwas a difficult task in the face of continued violence byparamilitaries on both sides — violence which has beenongoing for over 25 years; violence which threatened tolimit the boundaries of a whole generation to suspicion mutual mistrust and division; violence which still seeks tothreaten and disrupt our efforts to build a lasting peace.The task of creating an inclusive peace processrequired us to call on our friends in the internationalcommunity. I want to acknowledge those friends particularly in the European Union  Canada  Australia New Zealand and  most important  in the United States.The partnership between Ireland and Britain hasbeen consistently encouraged and assisted by the UnitedStates under the leadership of President Clinton and withthe backing of friends and supporters in the United StatesCongress. In particular  President Clinton offered hispersonal support and active engagement in the search forpeace. The President undertook to share the risks forpeace which were being taken by both Governments. Andin doing so  he added significantly to the momentumwhich secured the ceasefire in 1994 and re-established itin July of this year.The United States has been a resource offeredgenerously in the name of peace. I want to acknowledgethe invaluable role played by Senator George Mitchell inchairing the multi-party talks in Belfast. And I also wantto express my Government's appreciation for thecooperation and assistance provided by the Governmentsof Finland and Canada  particularly by making availableas co-chairmen of the talks former Prime Minister HarriHolkeri and General John de Chastelain. They haveshown unfailing forbearance and unremitting commitmentto this delicate and complex process.With this help  and with the resolve of bothGovernments to ensure that an unequivocal ceasefire wasa necessary condition for involvement in the talksprocess  another ceasefire was  as I said earlier established in July this year. Because the ceasefire hasbeen re-established  all parties to the problem of NorthernIreland have now been invited to join the talks process inBelfast and to begin the task of shaping our respectiveinterwoven futures.We have  in the course of the Anglo-Irish peaceprocess  sought to accomplish the purpose for which thisAssembly was established — to replace mistrust andviolent confrontation with dialogue  negotiation andagreement between all the parties to conflict. We do notunderestimate the difficulties that lie ahead. As thehistory of the United Nations itself has shown  majorconflicts have  for the most part  been avoided.However  the resolution of localized conflicts hasproven elusive and problematic.The principles  purpose and practice of thisAssembly and the United Nations itself were formed toreplace conflict — of whatever scale — with peacethrough dialogue. In our approach to Northern Ireland we have been guided by the same impulse to createprinciples  purposes and practices which will replacethe method and means of sectarian hatred andintercommunal violence.We have made it clear that in our talks  all issuesare on the table  that no outcome is ruled out of boundsfor discussion or is predetermined. We have constructeda process and rules of procedure by which the partiescan discuss  refine and eventually agree on thestructures which will embrace the totality of relationson the two islands and which command the consent ofboth unionists and nationalists in Ireland.We have established as an integral part of thedialogue that we recognize the rights and wishes of theunionist community in the same way as we insist thatparity of esteem for Nationalists is a necessary and justcomponent of any eventual settlement.We have set out our view that the resolution of theissue of the decommissioning of arms is anindispensable part of the process of negotiation. Wehave emphatically declared  in our insistence onadherence to the Mitchell principles of democracy andnon-violence  that only those committed to democraticand exclusively peaceful means of resolving politicalissues and those who renounce force or the threat offorce to influence the outcome of the negotiations canbe a party to the talks process.We have embraced as a founding principle in thecurrent talks process and its eventual outcome that anyagreement must command sufficient consensus betweenboth sets of participants. We have accepted that theagreement reached will be put to the people of Ireland North and South  for their approval.Both Governments have set a target to concludethese talks by next May and present proposals to thepeople of Ireland  North and South  in parallel28referendums. I believe that this target is necessarilyambitious and realistically achievable.We may well have setbacks in the interim. Wecertainly have difficult issues to confront andcompromises to make which will require courage andvision.But both Governments — and I believe the partiescurrently in the talks process — are collectivelydetermined that this process will be pursued  that therewill be no going back  and that the future we seek ofharmonious relations and an honourable andcomprehensive agreement will be secured and that lastingpeace will be brought to our island."
"77",3299,"IRN",52,1997,"﻿Allowme to express my felicitations to the President on hiselection and express the confidence that  with his wisdomand diplomatic skill  he will ably guide the fifty-secondGeneral Assembly towards tangible results. Let me alsoexpress my appreciation to his predecessor for his excellentwork.Due to lateness of the hour  I will present a briefversion of my statement. The complete text will bedistributed.At the threshold of the third millennium and under thecircumstances of unfolding interplay among not one or twobut various powers in the shaping of new global decisions international relations need a new doctrine  commensuratewith the evolving conditions and emerging needs. The mainobjective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of aglobal civil society  a society where liberty and salvationharmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and materialneeds of humanity in an institutionalized manner  andwhere comprehensive  balanced and sustainabledevelopment lies at the foundation of universalcooperation and participation.The doctrine of global civil society is predicated ontwo major principles  the first being theinstitutionalization of the rule of law in domestic andinternational relations. The international community today like its constituent Member States  simply cannot providea peaceful and prosperous life for people throughcoercion  autocratic decisions and a cultural dominationand hegemony. Therefore  the rule of law  as the veryfoundation of order and the relations among individualsand States  should be institutionalized.The second major principle is that of empowermentand participation. Similar to the process of participationat the national level — where all individuals  regardlessof colour  race  opinion  wealth or social status have aninalienable right to determine their own destiny —countries and regions with differing cultures and resourcesshould enjoy the right and be empowered to participate atall stages of decision-making and policy implementationat the global scale.Today  North and South constitute twocomplementary domains in a single global arena.Equilibrium and stability of the future world orderdepend  in large measure  on the South’s contribution tothe shaping of the norms governing future internationalrelations.In our view  we can move towards the gradualrealization of a global civil society throughinstitutionalization of these two fundamental principlesand by committing ourselves to pluralism  tolerance dialogue among civilizations  promotion of human rights comprehensive  balanced and sustainable development justice and equality of opportunities as the governingnorms in our interactions.The political philosophy of the Islamic Republic ofIran is in full accord with these fundamental foundationsof the prospective global civil society. The domesticprogramme of the new administration is geared towardsstrengthening the foundations of civil society.The main features and priorities of the newadministration’s foreign policy include the following: theexpansion of relations with all countries on the basis ofmutual respect  common interest and non-interference inthe internal affairs of others; emphasis on the23institutionalization of international law as the foundation ofglobal order and as the final arbiter among States; theestablishment and strengthening of mechanisms of mutualconfidence-building and security through regionalcooperation and the negation of the presence and influenceof foreign powers; the protection of all human rights andthe rejection of attempts at selective and discriminatoryabuse of human rights as instruments of policy; emphasison the fundamental rights of oppressed individuals andnations  particularly the Palestinian people; the arresting ofthe arms race at the regional and global levels  theelimination of weapons of mass destruction and the controlof conventional weapons; the strengthening of the bonds ofamity and solidarity among Islamic and non-alignedcountries; an active presence and constructive participationin the United Nations and other international organizations with an effective contribution in international efforts onglobal issues such as arms control and disarmament comprehensive and sustainable development  human rights peacekeeping and combating terrorism and illicit drugs  aswell as the reversal of unjust international arrangements;and  finally  defending the rights of Iranian citizens all overthe world.The Islamic Republic of Iran has adopted concretemeasures at the regional and international levels in pursuitof these principled policies  and it is fully prepared tocooperate with all countries towards achieving commonobjectives in accordance with the principles of the UnitedNations Charter.The question of Palestine  which lies at the very heartof the Middle East crisis  represents the most vivid andpersistent case of disregard for international law and thesystematic violation of fundamental human rights ofindividuals and peoples. The Middle East crisis can besolved only through the full realization of the rights of thePalestinian people  in particular their right to self-determination  the return of refugees and the liberation ofall occupied territories  including Al-Quds al-Sharif southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan. The experience ofthe past few years has made it abundantly clear that anyscheme or proposal which fails to take into full account therealities in the region or the infamous Israeli patterns ofbehaviour is bound to fail.It is indeed unfortunate that some outside powersdeliberately misconstrue or misrepresent Iran’s frank  openand objective exposé of the realities as support for terrorismand as opposition to peace and security in the region. Ireiterate once again that the Islamic Republic of Iran alsoseeks peace and stability in the Middle East — a just andlasting peace that would receive regional consensus andthat would cure this chronic crisis once and for all.Our region has witnessed for nearly two decades thecrisis in Afghanistan. There is  undoubtedly  no militarysolution to this tragedy; yet some warring factions haveyet to realize this evident truth. Only through theestablishment of a ceasefire  the cessation of foreignintervention  negotiations between all Afghan groups andthe formation of a broad-based Government representingall Afghans can the crisis in Afghanistan find a lastingsolution. My Government is determined to continue itshumanitarian and peacemaking endeavours in Afghanistanin tandem with the United Nations Secretary-General andthe Secretary-General of the Organization of the IslamicConference. I must draw the attention of the internationalcommunity to the dire need for and the urgency ofhumanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.The cold war generated a tendency in internal andexternal relations which required the existence of a real orimagined enemy. Escaping this state of mind and buildinga new world based on cooperation and the rule of lawrequires not only political will  but careful planning inorder to foster confidence and to mitigate economic security and social concerns at national and regionallevels.Confidence-building at national  regional andinternational levels  as an essential strategy to transformhuman relations  will not succeed in the absence oftransparency in decision-making and the participation ofall concerned. The antithesis of universal participation indecision-making and law-based cooperation at theinternational level is unilateralism. This phenomenon findsits manifestations in various areas  including arms control development  international trade  the environment andcodification of new human rights norms.The first and most effective step towards buildingconfidence is the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  the reduction of conventional weapons transparency in the field of armaments and theestablishment of security and cooperation schemes invarious regions of the globe. This endeavour requires thefull and non-discriminatory implementation of existingundertakings in the area of disarmament and security andthe development of new rules to address universallyaccepted priorities  as well as security requirements of theinternational community and its members.24The Islamic Republic of Iran  on the basis of Islamicprinciples  considers weapons of mass destruction inhumaneand illegitimate. Officials of the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) have repeatedly confirmed the factthat Iran’s nuclear activities are performed within theframework of the Agency’s regulations and that they followpeaceful objectives. Despite these clear facts  someGovernments have embarked upon a barrage of false andbaseless accusations against Iran during the past few years.Yet propaganda campaigns of public deception willcertainly not change regional realities on the ground. It isself-evident that the lack of security in the Middle East isrooted in Israel’s militarism and its arsenal of weapons ofmass destruction  which have thwarted all disarmamentinitiatives and mechanisms in the region.Furthermore  the unabated race for the acquisition ofconventional weapons exacerbates the atmosphere ofanxiety and mistrust. The foreign policy of the IslamicRepublic of Iran is founded on peace  self-restraint confidence-building and the reduction and elimination oftension  particularly within our region. I wish to inform theAssembly frankly and sincerely that of all the countries ofthe Middle East  Iran allocates the lowest percentage of itsbudget to its military. In 1995 and 1996  only 3.3 per centof our gross domestic product was spent on defence. Wecontinue to be ready for any regionally acceptableunderstanding on further reductions in defence budgets suchthat the security concerns of large and small countries alikeare fully addressed.The highest foreign policy priority of the IslamicRepublic of Iran is to make every effort to strengthen trustand confidence and to build peace in our immediateneighbourhood  which in cases such as Tajikistan hasachieved encouraging results. In our region  the EconomicCooperation Organization has also contributed to theexpansion and consolidation of relations among its memberStates through the adoption of common positions and byplaying an active role in the field of economic and technicalcooperation.In the Persian Gulf area  only cooperation andcollective participation can bring about security and stabilityfor all countries in the region. Taking full advantage ofhistorical affinities  cultural ties and religious bonds andsparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinatedmanner the human and natural potential and resources ofthe region constitute the single best long-term guarantee ofsecurity and tranquillity. Iran — as the biggest country inthe region  enjoying a historical depth of several millenniacombined with the richness of Islamic civilization — doesnot need to engage in any arms build-up or competition.Our message to our neighbours is one of friendship andfraternity  and we shall warmly welcome any initiative tostrengthen the foundations of confidence and cooperationin the region.The Islamic Republic of Iran  which in Decemberwill be hosting the eighth Islamic summit  is of the viewthat on the threshold of the twenty-first century  theprimary task of the summit will be to foster mutualconfidence and establish mechanisms for cooperation andcoordination in various fields among Islamic countries.This will undoubtedly contribute to the furtherstrengthening of the foundations of lasting internationalsecurity and stability.Terrorism is the wicked result of widespreadlawlessness and the violent obstruction of publicparticipation  which in its various forms andmanifestations threatens human societies at the national regional and international levels. The political exploitationof this international problem  through hurling unfoundedallegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives orcover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy  is noless dangerous than terrorism itself. These two elementstogether diminish trust  stability and security at theregional and the international levels.Resolution of this destructive problem requires adetermined avoidance of sensationalism and demagogueryon the one hand  and a concerted international attempt tofind practical measures to combat terrorism that arereasonable  objective and realistic on the other. Moreimportant  our collective success requires the non-selective  universal and law-based application of agreedmeasures by relevant international organizations.As a country that has suffered immensely from theinhuman phenomenon of terrorism in the post-revolutionyears  the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to take anactive part in any international effort to combat thisproblem in a serious  comprehensive and principledmanner.The resolution of complex international problemsand the realization of post-cold-war opportunities requirethe participation of all members of the internationalcommunity in the decision-making process  on the basisof the rules and principles of international law. TheUnited Nations is the institutional embodiment of bothuniversal participation and the rule of law on the globalscale. It is the only universal organization which  with the25help of an efficient and capable system  can move towardsfinding solutions to the problems of human society andresponding to post-cold-war challenges. The magnitude ofthis task clearly points to the need to improve the efficiencyof the Organization and to enhance its role by embarkingon the transformation and reform of the major bodies programmes and modes of operation of the Organization.I should like to express appreciation for the Secretary-General’s efforts to reinvigorate the Organization  and toassure him of our earnest desire to cooperate with him inthe process of restructuring the United Nations into a moreefficient  capable and reliable institution responsive to theneeds and views of all its Members. In our opinion  theextensive scope and implications of the measures envisagedin the Secretary-General’s report of 16 July make itimperative for the General Assembly to establish workinggroups to examine the report thoroughly and in detail sothat the views of all Member States are identified andtaken into account.There is no doubt that the current composition of theSecurity Council is remote from the state of internationalaffairs today and is not acceptable to the overwhelmingmajority of the international community. In our opinion any increase in the membership of the Security Councilor reform of its working methods will have to take thetrue role and concerns of the developing countries intoaccount. Moreover  reform of the working methods of theSecurity Council should not be contingent upon resolutionof the question of the increase in the membership of theCouncil; they are two distinct subjects and thus requiretwo separate decisions.The General Assembly is undoubtedly the highestand most representative organ of the United Nations where all Members of the Organization enjoy an equalright to participate. This body  which comprises the entiremembership  certainly has the right — and indeed theresponsibility — to address each and every issue of globalconcern  including in particular those relating tointernational peace and security.Expansion and broadening of the participatory baseof the future global order on the basis of normsacceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conduciveto building a better tomorrow  and to ensuring freedom security  stability and sustainable development at thenational  regional and international levels. The GeneralAssembly  providing all Member States with theopportunity for full and equal participation in decision-making  is the most appropriate venue for dialogue understanding and the adoption of coordinatedinternational measures to build a better and a moreequitable tomorrow.As the new Government of the Islamic Republic ofIran assumes its responsibilities  I reiterate the willingnessand full preparedness of my Government to take aconstructive part in this collective endeavour throughpromoting dialogue  understanding  trust and solidarity."
"78",3346,"IRQ",52,1997,"﻿Itgives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session. I am confident that your extensiveexperience and extreme competence will positivelycontribute to the successful conduct of the proceedings ofthis session. I would like to assure you that the Iraqidelegation will do its best to cooperate with you and withyour colleagues in discharging your responsibilities to bringthe proceedings of this session to a successful conclusion.I would like also to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Razali Ismail  for the incessant and sincere effortswhich he made to crown the proceedings of the last sessionwith success. He has earned our appreciation.The success of the United Nations in the exercise ofits desired role depends primarily on the proper applicationof the principles and provisions of the Charter  because itis the only instrument that can achieve the goals for whichthis Organization was established: the endeavour to achievean international community based on respect for thesovereignty  freedom and independence of peoples and theirempowerment to achieve their goals of economic and socialdevelopment.The reform of the United Nations structures andmechanisms in a proper way that ensures justice to allMember States and geographical groups will enable it todischarge its responsibilities in a manner consistent with thepurposes  principles and provisions enshrined in theCharter.We believe that the reform process of the Organizationshould not be restricted to the management aspect important as it is. More important  there should be acommon political will to redress the real and effectivebalance in the work of the Organization and to prevent itsmachinery from being used for private political objectivesand purposes of certain super-Powers. Above all  oneshould pay attention to the dangers inherent in oneinternational pole breaking loose and trying to dominatethe world. In this context  Iraq welcomes the communiquéissued after the meeting of President Yeltsin of Russiaand President Jiang Zemin of China in Moscow on 22April 1997  which clearly called for the rejection ofhegemony by any State over the world’s destinies  of theexercise of power politics or of the monopoly ofinternational issues. The Russian-Chinese communiquéalso called for the establishment of a multi-polarinternational system. We in Iraq are proud to note thatour leader  President Saddam Hussain  called 20 years agofor a multi-polar world.The United Nations should not be controlled by therich  who are a small minority in the world. Among thebasic purposes of the United Nations  according to theCharter  is the promotion of the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples. Based on that  we consider itnecessary to avoid marginalizing developing countries anddenying them the opportunities and potentialities foreconomic and scientific development.While we are talking about the reform of theOrganization and its mechanisms and the review of itsrole  we should not overlook the basic realities of theevolution of the international community from a smallgroup of States that are homogeneous in their conceptsand interests to a community of a global nature necessarily heterogeneous and varying in all itsperceptions and interests. This objective reality makes itimperative for all of us to employ our common energiesto review the charters and mechanisms that we haveinherited to make them consistent with the objectivereality of the international community in order to achievethe common and public good  not simply the interests ofthe minority. One example that comes to mind in thisregard is the area of human rights.Finally  we must recognize the need for deliberation consultation and extensive negotiation on what reformsteps should be approved. A prerequisite for the successof any step in this common effort is the presence of a realconsensus among States  not the voices speaking underpressure and threats to their respective interests.6For more than seven years  Iraq has been sufferingunder an unjust blockade the like of which has never beenwitnessed in human history. We have more than once statedclearly and unequivocally before the General Assembly thesteps that Iraq had undertaken to implement the resolutionsof the Security Council on the so-called Gulf crisis particularly resolution 687 (1991)  so that the blockadeimposed upon it could be lifted.Iraq has carried out what was required of it underthese resolutions. In the context of working with the SpecialCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) for the implementation of section C of resolution687 (1991)  on proscribed weapons  Iraq has carried out allthe substantive obligations set out therein. Iraq has nevertarried in doing everything possible to emphasize itskeenness to deal even with the very minute details so thatthe Security Council could move to carry out itscorresponding obligations towards Iraq by lifting theblockade.Our work in this regard is of special importance. Weshould pause to shed light upon it. The full implementationto date of the substantive obligations imposed on Iraq withregard to banned weapons is an established fact. Despite allthe rumours  the truth is that Iraq no longer has any bannedweapons  equipment  machinery or materials. The system ofcontinuous observation established in Iraq by the SpecialCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agencyis working effectively and has been since August 1994 covering all the territory of Iraq.When the new Chairman of the Special Commission Ambassador Richard Butler  assumed his office  wewelcomed his statements in which he affirmed that hewould follow an objective  scientific and technical approachin dealing with what the Commission views as remainingissues  in accordance with the requirements clearlyestablished by resolution 687 (1991). We affirmed our fullreadiness to cooperate with Ambassador Butler. We agreedwith him  during his first visit to Baghdad last July  on anintensive common work programme  which we haveactively carried out. In fact  substantial advances have beenmade in this common activity  and we look forward to thesemi-annual report by the Special Commission  which wehope will be submitted to the Security Council in a fewdays. We hope it will equitably reflect the progressachieved and will open the door for the Security Council tostart implementing paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) which means the beginning of the lifting of the blockade onIraq.The comprehensive blockade imposed on Iraq is themost extensive and cruel boycott system ever imposed bythe Security Council throughout its history. It covers andaffects  in theory and in practice  every aspect of life.From our practical experience  we are convinced that theinsistence on the perpetuation of the blockade against Iraqis not related to the fulfilment by Iraq of its obligations.It is rather a systematic plan to inflict severe damage onIraq by putting an end to its development potential and bydestroying its basic economic infrastructure to fulfil theselfish interests of an unjust super-Power.The whole world has felt the magnitude of the wilfuldamage and destruction inflicted on Iraq by thecontinuation of the blockade  which is contrary to thepurposes for which the United Nations was established which purposes have been emphasized in its numerousconferences. International organizations  humanitarianmissions and United Nations agencies have warned of thedangers besetting the people of Iraq as a result of thecontinued blockade  particularly the dangerous effects onwomen and children.The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  forinstance  has confirmed in its latest study in March 1997that 27.5 per cent of Iraqi children under five years of agesuffer from chronic malnutrition and that the mostthreatened segment is children under two years old  dueto malnutrition and the incidence of contagious diseases.Furthermore  the environment in Iraq has sufferedextensive damage because of indiscriminate bombing bythe United States and some of its allies  which was aimedat power stations  sewage systems and factories  which wehave not been able to rebuild fully because of theblockade.Scientific studies and research carried out by foreignresearchers and scientists have unequivocally confirmedthat the United States used banned weapons andammunition enriched with depleted uranium in its militaryoperations against Iraq. This exposed vast tracts of Iraqiterritory to contamination by deadly toxic materials.Numerous cases of hitherto unfamiliar illnesses have beenrecorded  such as congenital deformities of foetuses  bonedeformities and many cases of leukaemia among children.We heard many allegations from the representativesof the United States and Britain before Iraq agreed to dealwith the oil-for-food formula. The representatives of bothcountries shed crocodile tears and alleged that they wereconcerned about the suffering of the Iraqi people. They7said that they had come up with Security Council resolution986 (1995) to alleviate this suffering. that resolution wasnot balanced. We and the United Nations Secretary-General in May 1996  were able to reach a memorandum ofunderstanding to implement the resolution in a balancedmanner. When implementation started — that is to say when the implementation of the memorandum started — inDecember 1996  the American and the British conduct wasseen for what it really is.The oil-for-food-and-medicine formula is a temporaryand modest formula that meets only a small fraction ofIraq’s needs. Nevertheless  this formula has encounteredand continues to encounter many major obstacles anddifficulties  which the United States and Britain inparticular try to impose with a view to impeding the properand effective implementation of the memorandum ofunderstanding.The conduct of the representatives of these twocountries in the Committee established pursuant to SecurityCouncil resolution 661 (1990) has led to an accumulationof contracts which were rejected or suspended on flimsypretexts. This has caused a huge break in the smooth flowof the approval of such contracts and has thereby delayedthe delivery and distribution of materials to the Iraqipeople. To date  despite the fact that the implementation ofthe first period ended over three months ago  Iraq hasreceived only 25 per cent of the medicine required and hasnot received any materials at all up to now relating toagriculture  education  water or sewage  or any spare partsfor electricity-generating power stations.Now more than ever is the time for the United Nationsto discharge its responsibility with regard to its obligationsunder the Charter  not only to the people of Iraq  but to theinternational community. The United Nations has a duty tocarry out a professional and objective review of theprovisions of the blockade imposed on Iraq in order toimplement paragraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687(1991) as a first step towards lifting the blockadecompletely.All the discussions that have taken place in the UnitedNations  in specialized working groups and committees  andin particular in the Special Committee on the Charter of theUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of theOrganization  have stressed that sanctions should be anexceptional measure used by the United Nations in specialcircumstances and in accordance with the Charter. Theyhave also stressed that such sanctions should not be basedmerely on political expediency  but rather should be firmlybased on international law; that they should beimplemented according to the principles of justice andinternational law; that they should not serve individual orfactional interests; that in their implementation consideration should be given to the human suffering thatthey cause; and that a time limit should be set for theirlifting. Such a serious measure should not be imposedwithout setting a precise time for its lifting.United Nations responsibility does not end there. TheUnited Nations must put an end to all hostile practicesagainst Iraq by the United States  which persists in itscontinuous attempts to interfere in Iraq’s internal affairswith a view to causing instability and insecurity and incarrying out operations to change its nationalist regime;such practices are considered criminal acts even under itsown domestic law. Statements made by senior Americanofficials confirm the hostile American policy towardsIraq.Members of the United Nations are not unaware ofthe article published in the Washington Post on 26 June1997 or of the information contained in the ABCtelevision programme aired on 26 June 1997. Thisinformation confirmed that the United States was involvedin conspiracies against the nationalist regime in Iraq. Thisinvolvement is an official policy  approved by theAmerican President  and more that $100 million has beenappropriated for it. The Central Intelligence Agency hasbeen charged with its implementation. Following thatpublicity  the policy was acknowledged by an officialspokesman of the American State Department in a pressbriefing on 27 June.The United Nations resolutions on Iraq affirm thatall States have an obligation to respect Iraq’s sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence. The UnitedStates is carrying out a policy of its own making  whichruns counter to the provisions of the Charter and of theresolutions referred to. I hope that Members of the UnitedNations are not ignorant of the fact that among the meansof achieving the declared objectives of this hostile policytowards Iraq is the imposition of no-fly zones in northernand southern Iraq. This is an illegal act that is contrary toSecurity Council resolutions. It is a unilateral military actby the Governments of the United States and Britain —a clear application of brute power politics against ourcountry. We demand that the United Nations deplore andcondemn unilateral policies based on the logic of bruteforce  opportunism  double standards and hegemony.8We are demanding no more than the legal and properapplication of Security Council resolutions in accordancewith the purposes and principles of the Charter. We believethat there is a collective duty to take joint action to evaluatein an equitable manner Iraq’s fulfilment of its obligations.This responsibility rests first and foremost with themembers of the Security Council because collectively theybear responsibility for any imbalance caused by theunilateral positions taken by the United States and Britain.We are eager to establish excellent relations withneighbouring countries. We have affirmed on more thanone occasion the importance of dialogue in order to arriveat the best solutions to problems affecting relations betweenthe countries of the region. Unfortunately  we have notreceived the required response from certain parties  largelybecause of interference by external Powers that havenothing to do with the reality of the interests of the Statesof the region.We note that  unfortunately  our neighbour  Turkey  isindulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deephistorical  religious and human relations between Iraq andTurkey. Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate oursovereignty  interfere in our internal affairs and invade ourterritory  on the basis of flimsy pretexts. We have discussedthe situation with our neighbour  Turkey  on severaloccasions in the past. The most recent discussion was withthe Under-Secretary of the Turkish Ministry for ForeignAffairs  which took place on 15 September 1997 inBaghdad. During those discussions we explained that thesolution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not beachieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq  orby interfering in its internal affairs  in collaboration withforeign Powers — the United States and Britain — butrather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect forthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countriesand by cooperation between their Governments to ensuresecurity and stability on both sides of the internationalborder.We have warned Turkey of the serious and negativeconsequences of its policies for relations between the twocountries and for Turkey’s own interests. Many countries inand outside the region  and international organizations foremost among them the League of Arab States  havecondemned the new Turkish aggression against Iraq  whichbegan on 22 September 1997. We strongly condemn thisnew military aggression  which is a flagrant violation ofIraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We demand thatTurkey immediately withdraw its invading forces from ourcountry and refrain from repeating such aggressive militarypractices  which contradict good-neighbourly relations  theCharter and international law. We hold Turkey fullyresponsible internationally for its acts of aggression insideIraq. We reserve our full right to respond to these actsand to assert our other legitimate rights underinternational law that arise as a result of Turkey’sresponsibility for those acts.We are also keen on establishing good-neighbourlyrelations with Iran  based on mutual respect forsovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference ininternal affairs. On 8 August 1997 President SaddamHussain issued a call to the new Iranian Government toshow its good intentions towards Iraq by carrying out itsestablished obligations  foremost of which is the releaseof Iraqi prisoners of war and the return of the aircraftentrusted to it. He also affirmed that Iraq wouldreciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard bytaking two balanced steps: one corresponding to theIranian step and another in line with our deep sense ofhumanitarian  regional and international responsibility toencourage the taking of successive  continual steps toensure that regional security  mutual respect and balancedinterests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such away that benefits the peoples of the region.It is unfortunate that our neighbour  Iran  does notmatch our inclination and prefers to continue to exploitthe conditions of the unjust blockade imposed against Iraqand to exploit the imposition of no-fly zones by theUnited States and Britain in northern and southern Iraq toenable it to violate Iraqi sovereignty  penetrate its airspaceand commit one military aggression after another. Themost recent of such acts was the bombing by eightIranian military aircraft of positions inside Iraqi territory in the governorates of Diala and El-Kut on 29 September1997.Iran and another State are taking advantage of theillegal air embargo  imposed on northern and southernIraq by the United States and its collaborators  to violateIraq’s sovereignty  penetrate its airspace and commitcontinuous military aggression on its territory. Thecontinuation of this illegal air embargo constitutes anongoing threat to Iraq’s sovereignty and security  not onlyfrom America and Britain  but also from Iran and other States.This situation  in which acts of aggression arerepeatedly committed  means that the explicit UnitedNations pledges in relevant Security Council resolutionsto safeguard Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrityhave become a mere dead letter. It is time that these9pledges be honoured. If it does otherwise  the UnitedNations will have violated its own pledges.Iraq is an ancient country with a history going backmore than 7 000 years. The Iraqi people  who contributedimmensely to human civilization  will remain in charge oftheir own affairs  independent in their choices and able toovercome these crises. As we stand at the threshold of thetwenty-first century  we look forward to seeing the UnitedNations enabled to discharge its basic responsibilities tocarry out the purposes embodied in the Charter."
"79",3393,"ISL",52,1997,"﻿May I begin bycongratulating the President on his election to presideover the fifty-second session of General Assembly andpledging to him the full support of my delegation.The new Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hasalready put his mark on the United Nations  after lessthan nine months in office. He has led efforts to reformour Organization in an effective  fair and balancedmanner. I congratulate him and pledge the unwaveringsupport of my Government for his important mission.Increasingly  as we approach the new millennium we have come to appreciate the value of internationalcooperation  as most clearly demonstrated by the historicfirst meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)/Russia Permanent Joint Council in a ministerialsession that took place here in this building today.The information revolution is advancing  and a newsense of global neighbourhood and the gradual abolitionof trade barriers are raising the level of economic well-being in different parts of the world. At the same time 25the world community is faced with challenges of a neworder of magnitude  making it necessary for Governmentsto pool their resources and work together.Global forces are in many ways eroding the traditionalboundaries between nation States. The trend calls for thestrengthening of international organizations competent totackle issues that no single State or groups of States candeal with in isolation. Consequently  it is crucial that westrengthen the United Nations. Without a reinvigoratedUnited Nations  the international community will not be ina position to address the foremost challenges confrontingthe twenty-first century.Sadly  our Organization has not been endowed to meetthose challenges. Demands on the United Nations aregreater than ever  and the limited resources at theOrganization’s disposal are grossly disproportionate to thetasks in hand. The question inevitably arises: Do we wishto give the United Nations a clear and focused mandate andempower it to carry that mandate out? In my opinion ouranswer should be the same as the one Winston Churchillonce gave:“Give us the tools and we will finish the job”.Once more we must urge all Member States to paytheir contributions to the Organization fully and on time.The Secretary-General’s reform initiative is the mostcomprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the UnitedNations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of servingthe common interests of all peoples  guided by the enduringtenets of peace  human rights  the rule of law and socialprogress  enshrined in the Charter more than half a centuryago. Coming at the end of a thorough and useful debate the Secretary-General’s report is in large part a distillationof views expressed by individual Governments.Inevitably  the report represents a compromise unlikely to accommodate all the wishes of a single State orgroup of States. But  taken as a whole  it represents the besteffort to obtain what is realistically feasible under thecircumstances. The reform package should  in our opinion be accepted as an integral whole.A focused discussion on the Secretary-General’s reportshould give a boost to the ongoing debate among MemberStates on an increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil  as well as a more equitable representation on theCouncil. The Nordic countries have jointly presented theirideas on this issue. Iceland welcomes the paper submittedby the Chairman of the Security Council Working Group which is largely in line with the suggestions of the Nordiccountries  and hopes that efforts to resolve thisfundamental aspect of the entire reform process may bebrought to a successful conclusion during the currentsession.Although the reform of our Organization and itslong-term credibility must have a high priority  regionalconflicts continually demand our attention.In the Middle East  the situation has rarely beenmore uncertain since the signing of the Oslo accords. Theparties to the accords must not be distracted frompursuing the path of peace. They should refrain fromcreating unnecessary hurdles in the path of peace byprovocative undertakings likely to cause hostility suspicion and fear. There should be a clear andunambiguous recognition that terrorism against innocentcivilians is wholly incompatible with the pursuit of peace.Both parties have to ensure that international norms in thefield of human rights and humanitarian law are respected.A troubled African continent remains at the top ofthe United Nations agenda. In sub-Saharan Africa particularly the Great Lakes region  the situation isworrying. The United Nations  in cooperation withregional leaders and organizations  must spare no effort toprevent the peoples of this region from further suffering.By contrast  encouraging developments have takenplace in Western Sahara  where direct talks  held underthe auspices of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General  have greatly improved prospects for areferendum on the future of the region.Arms control and disarmament will continue tooccupy an important place in the activities of ourOrganization. Our most immediate goal should be in thearea of conventional arms: to work for a comprehensiveban on that most terrible destroyer of the lives and limbsof innocent people  the anti-personnel landmine. Therecently concluded Oslo conference on this menace hasprovided a welcome impetus to work towards a bindingtreaty. Iceland strongly urges all States to banish thisinhumane weapon from their arsenals.Human rights  which are of intrinsic value inthemselves  are also a vital part of efforts to secure peaceand stability in areas torn by wars and internal conflict.Next year marks the occasion of the fiftieth anniversaryof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. MyGovernment applauds the Secretary-General’s proposed26streamlining of the work of the United Nations in the fieldof human rights  bearing witness to a strong emphasis onthis crucially important aspect of our work.Unfortunately  the human rights of women continue tobe disregarded. As the Secretary-General observed in thisforum earlier this week  violence against women hasbecome the most pervasive human rights violation. Theinternational community must work harder to correct thissituation and to improve the lot of women everywhere  notleast through the creation of better education andemployment opportunities.Trafficking in drugs is a peril that recognizes nonational boundaries. To a greater or lesser degree  we areall affected by it. In addition to the cost in human lives andsuffering  we are witness to calamities that follow in thewake of drug abuse  the spread of AIDS  prostitution andcrime. Iceland welcomes United Nations efforts in the areaof drug prevention and looks forward to the special sessionof the General Assembly on the problem of drugs nextJune.Next year has been declared the International Year ofthe Ocean by the United Nations. The world’s oceans area crucial part of the earth’s biosphere  in addition to beingthe single largest source of protein for mankind. This vitalresource is now threatened in some regions of the world.Therefore  it is important that the Year of the Ocean beused to raise public awareness and to reinforce efforts toprotect the marine ecosystem. A global  legally bindingagreement should be concluded to limit the emission ofpersistent organic pollutants.Problems afflicting the marine ecosystem call forgreater coordination at the global level  and also in thesustainable use  conservation and management of livingmarine resources. At the same time  we must recognize thatthe primary responsibility for harvesting marine resourcesin a sustainable manner rests with the States that depend onsuch resources for survival. Also  while Governments mustwork with non-governmental organizations  there is a needto resist the indiscriminate pressure of unaccountableprotectionist groups that wish to sever the vital linkbetween environmental protection and economic self-interest.Although not yet in force  the Agreement for theImplementation of the Provisions of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982relating to the Conservation and Management of StraddlingFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks  whichprovides a framework for regional cooperation in theconservation and management of these stocks  has alreadyhad a positive impact. In the North Atlantic  for instance fisheries-management conventions are under review inorder  inter alia  to adjust them to the provisions of thisAgreement. Iceland urges Member States to ratify theAgreement.As a new member of the Economic and SocialCouncil  Iceland welcomed the thorough discussion onfostering an enabling environment for development duringthis year’s substantive session. It is of grave concern thatthe gap between the rich and the poor has continued towiden. At a time of vastly expanded trade and investmentin the world  the least developed countries have seen theirshare of world trade drop by half in two decades. Manyof them are threatened with exclusion from world marketsand economic marginalization.The key elements for attaining sustainable economicdevelopment are a sound policy framework thatencourages stable growth  a vigorous private sector  thestrengthening of institutional and legal foundations and last but not least  good-governance and anti-corruptionmeasures. At the same time  we need to focus on human-development strategies. The strengthening of educationand school systems and health and social services must bean integral part of any sound strategy for development.We must mobilize the dynamic private sector together with bilateral and multilateral officialdevelopment assistance to secure sustainable growth andpoverty reduction in developing countries.As the chairman of the Nordic and the Balticconstituency of the World Bank’s DevelopmentCommittee  I emphasize the important role of the WorldBank Group in development cooperation. I would like toreiterate what I stated in Hong Kong earlier this week:that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiativemust result in a permanent solution to the unsustainabledebt burden of the countries in question.27Finally  this is a time of extraordinary challenges forthe United Nations and its Member States. This is why weneed a vigorous  strong and confident Organization  capableof leading the way into the next century. For such anOrganization to become a reality we must now focus oneffective and meaningful reform. We should use themomentum and not fritter away our time in long-windedand familiar debates. Now we have an opportunity we maynot have again any time soon."
"80",3440,"ISR",52,1997,"﻿I would like to begin bycongratulating the President on his unanimous election topreside over the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at thissession the Assembly will be successful in bringing nationscloser to each other and in finding ways to address thechallenges that face all countries and nations  north andsouth  east and west.I also wish to congratulate his predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for the manner inwhich he carried out his duties.We mark this year the twentieth anniversary of thepeace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin  and the late President of Egypt  AnwarSadat. Those leaders  with their historic decision and theircourageous leadership  pioneered the way towards the firstpeace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour  Egypt.Throughout their entire history  the people of Israelhave aspired to live in peace. Together with our constantcall for peace with our neighbours  we have not spared anyeffort to seek  whether through direct or indirect contacts a partner in this effort. Today  too  we continue to seekchannels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.In recent years  since 1991  after the principles fornegotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down atMadrid  we have achieved a number of importantadvances with the establishment of full peace betweenIsrael and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and thesigning of interim accords with the Palestinians.Nevertheless  the road to full peace is still long  andnegotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria andLebanon still lie ahead of us.Immediately after the last elections  the Governmentof Israel accepted the need to continue to advance theOslo accords and has acted to implement them. In thepast year we have spared no effort to implement thoseaccords  but  unfortunately  the trust that is the lifebloodof the entire process has been undermined as a result ofthe failure of the Palestinians to carry out theircommitments according to the agreements they havesigned.In the past year  while pursuing these efforts  wehave endured many tests and have suffered ongoingterrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspirationfor peace  security and tranquillity has been stained by theshedding of innocent blood  by the murder of men women and children cut down by barbaric terroristattacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning overthe loss of those innocent lives  the hope for peace hasnot been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens ofIsrael.The citizens of Israel have taken upon themselvesgreat risks for peace  but there is none among them whois willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is beingdemanded in the name of peace. We must break thistragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action inconfronting the terror that trust will be re-established andthe doubts regarding intentions be removed.As I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session ofthis Assembly  all Israel is united in its deep desire forpeace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel  bothright and left are united in this quest.If trust can be restored  if the principle of reciprocityis honoured  it will be possible for us to proceed. Wehave already proved our willingness to do so  through ourdecisions and actions since taking office and in thesigning and implementation of the Hebron agreement inall its aspects.Peace cannot live side by side with continuedincitement  hostility  violence and terror. Peace means  inessence  the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of25violence. Dialogue  negotiation  compromise and thehonouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.These principles apply throughout the world and mustapply also in the Middle East. The existence of two paralleltracks  one on which negotiations are pursued while asecond track of violence  terror and bloodshed continuesunimpeded  is totally unacceptable. This is a directchallenge and affront to the very concept of peace.Terror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is nota spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seenterrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade ofinnocent and peaceful organizations  charitable and welfareorganizations  while under this cover they contribute to thepreparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.Terror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at anymoment  whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who liein its path.Those who resort to terror are seeking not only to killIsraelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot beaccepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. Itmust be rejected  absolutely and unequivocally  and it mustbe fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under itsconstant threat.The words of the President of the United States and ofthe Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a fewdays ago are important and should guide us all in thismatter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from thisvery rostrum:“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiablepolitical act.” [See Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fifty-second Session  Plenary Meetings  5thmeeting]Thus  the international community bears the responsibilityfor ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support recognition or legitimacy  not even implicitly.In the 1993 Oslo accords  the Palestinian Authorityand Arafat  its leader  undertook in the name of thePalestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed thiscommitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement  againone year ago at the Washington summit and again in theHebron agreement. Much to our consternation  it has beenproved that this commitment has not been upheld asrequired  thus causing the present crisis of confidence.Israel stands firmly upon its call to the PalestinianAuthority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly againstterror. The Authority must act jointly and in fullcooperation with us against terrorism and violence. Weseek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely theimplementation of signed agreements. The fight againstterror  in our humble opinion  is also in the Palestinianinterest.In response to the repeated crises in the processcaused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to liveup to its commitments  Israel proposes a binding code ofconduct for relations between us. This code shouldinclude  first  the rejection of violence as a means forachieving political goals; secondly  preservation of theframework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrainfrom attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations ontothe international stage; thirdly  the institutionalization ofpermanent channels of communication  including in timesof crisis; fourthly  a cessation of incitement and the callto violence and jihad  and their replacement with thelanguage of reconciliation and mutual respect; and  fifthly the advancement and encouragement of normalization andsupport for regional activities.The purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitateuninterrupted negotiations and crisis management  and tocreate an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respondto the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believethat the adoption of the above principles will allow us toovercome the present crisis and help in preventing futureones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the gamewill also contribute to renewed trust between the leadersand greater confidence between the peoples.In the wake of the visit to the Middle East of theUnited States Secretary of State  renewed agreement hasbeen reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peaceprocess to its proper track. We have been conductingintensive talks in recent days  with the assistance of theUnited States  both in Washington and here  with a viewto resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts toreach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.Israel values and appreciates the action of the UnitedStates Secretary of State and her commitment and effortsto extricate the peace process from its current impasse  tobring the parties closer together and to ensure the successof the negotiations. We are fully committed to theseefforts.26Israel reaffirms its proposal to conduct acceleratednegotiations  according to an agreed timetable  onpermanent status. We propose conducting negotiations inwhich the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes andthe way towards achieving them. This proposal is intendedto hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement  not todelay it. This is also our call and our proposal to thePalestinian Authority.The international community can play an importantrole in facilitating the dialogue between the sides  whichwill make it possible for us to resolve our differencesthrough direct negotiations. It is only through directnegotiations that we can bring this process to a successfulconclusion. One-sided international declarations  dictates orpressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize thedispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to theUnited Nations and other international forums only serve tocreate unnecessary obstacles and to make alreadyentrenched positions more rigid.The comprehensive peace we yearn for will not beachieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria andLebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings andagreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and toresolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect tofind in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search fora just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice infavour of peace — the “peace of the brave”  as claimed byits leadership — then we must explore together everypossible avenue  at any place and at any time  for renewingthe talks between us.Israel cannot accept the continued violence and terroron its northern border. The terrorist activities oforganizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusharockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear thethreat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.There is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.We wish to see a sovereign  free and independent Lebanonacting determinedly against the terrorist organizations thatoperate from its territory.If we are to reach peace  we cannot make do onlywith agreements and contracts. The reality of peace meansnormalization  open borders  freedom of movement commerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entireregion. These are the soul and essence of peace.Normalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.The decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the ArabLeague at their recent meeting in Cairo  just over one weekago  stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations forpeace and undermine its foundations. The attempts toprevent normalization with Israel  to freeze the level ofexisting relations with it  to close liaison and interestsoffices between Israel and Arab neighbours and toreactivate the Arab boycott add up  in practice  to aboycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy whichis reversing the process.The ongoing and intentional freeze of themultilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on theentrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meantand should serve as a platform and incentive for buildingpeace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateralchannels alike and not make one conditional upon theother  nor create further obstacles and barriers on the roadto peace. The question mark hanging over the regionaleconomic conference scheduled to take place later thisyear in Doha  Qatar  is further evidence of this negativedrive.The countries of the Middle East that are party tothe peace effort have a common interest in regionalstability and the advancement of prosperity and well-being for all the nations of the region. We face togetherthe growing shortage of water and the ever-expandingdesert. We are also facing dangers from within our regionthat threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes ofvarious nations and to plunge the entire region intoviolence  war and bloodshed.It was only a few years ago that the entire worldwas forced into forming a coalition to combat anaggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouringcountry and to terrorize our entire region. Today  we facenew and even more extreme dangers  but the lessons ofrecent experience have not been learned and manycountries turn a blind eye to the threat.The leadership of Iran continues to speak in termsthat threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.Yet the international community continues to remain deafand refuses to speak out against Iran's policies declarations and actions.Iran's efforts  like those of Iraq  to acquireoperational weapons of mass destruction of all kindsrepresent the greatest threat to security and stability in theMiddle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran'sweapons programme extend far beyond the geographicalconfines of our region. They threaten the security of other27members of the international community and their interests.Israel reiterates its call to the members of theinternational family of nations — and at their head theUnited States  Russia and the members of the EuropeanUnion and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —to exercise the full weight of their influence and to takeconcrete steps to prevent this development  whichrepresents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.After the establishment  as we hope  of peace treatiesbetween Israel and every country of the region  it will bepossible to create a regional security system that wouldprovide multilateral and shared solutions to the range ofsecurity problems in the Middle East  including a mutuallyand effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Theseare our goals and we must act to achieve them.Israel is an active and responsible member of thefamily of nations represented in this body. However  50years after the United Nations adopted  on 29 November1947  the resolution calling for the establishment of theState of Israel  we are still denied our equal rights in thisOrganization.We attach great importance to the fundamental reformof the United Nations work. We also share the opinion ofother United Nations Member countries that believe that theOrganization urgently requires greater efficiency and aredirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards itstruly important tasks. At the same time  we are convincedthat no reform can be completed so long as the question ofIsrael's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.We call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.Much to our chagrin  in the last year we have seen anintensification of the political campaign waged againstIsrael at the United Nations. This campaign only impedesthe peace process and further undermines confidencebetween the parties. We call upon the Member States torefrain from lending their support to such resolutions. Thetime has come for this Assembly to reduce the number ofresolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year andto contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conduciveto direct negotiations between the parties.As part of Israel's international and regionalcommitment and of its credo as a State  we are engaged incooperative programmes with many countries  with whichwe share the experience and knowledge we have acquiredin various fields. Israel attaches great importance to itsinternational cooperation programme and to assistingvarious peoples to address the challenges of developmentand the hazards of nature  hunger and disease.Over more than three decades  tens of thousands oftrainees have participated in courses in Israel and in theirown countries within the framework of Israel'scooperation and assistance programme in the fields ofeducation  health  agriculture  industry  social affairs andleadership. We are especially proud of the participation inrecent years of trainees from Arab countries  amongstthem Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries ofgoodwill  ambassadors of peace  who bear with them themessage and the great hope of human well-being. As inthe words of the prophet:“Each shall help his neighbour and make himstrong”.This year  the Jewish people in Israel and around theworld marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty yearsago  the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty inits ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our2 000-year dispersion  we dreamt of the day that wewould renew our national life in the land of ourforefathers  the land of Israel.It is the privilege of our generation to fulfil thisaspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up itsland. The Jewish people is once again gathering in itsancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrantand democratic society  a flourishing economy  science research and industry.For the past 50 years  we have laboured to ensureIsrael's security and independence  while always seekingpeace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fiftyyears on  the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.This week  we mark the beginning of the Jewishnew year. At this holy time  every Jew turns his eyetowards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for thepeace of the world  the end of misery and a new dawn ofhope for all. On this day of remembrance  the blow of theshofar is accompanied by the prayer:“may the year and its troubles pass and a new yearand its blessings begin”."
"81",3487,"ITA",52,1997,"﻿I warmly congratulate MinisterUdovenko on his election to the helm of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly. His profoundexperience in international affairs is the best guarantee forthe success of his mandate. Allow me also to thank hispredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  who led the fifty-first session of the General Assembly with greatdistinction.On all the broad issues confronting the GeneralAssembly  Italy supports the statement made on Tuesdayby the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of theEuropean Union.Today we have a historic opportunity to connectprinciples and reality  give life to our ideals and shapethis Organization for decades to come. The ideologies thatdivided humankind in this century have crumbled.Meanwhile  the system engineered with such foresight bythe founding Members amidst the horrors of the mostdevastating war the world has ever seen has maintainedand increased its significance.We no longer live in a world of purely nationalinterests. More and more  policy-making is informed byglobal concerns such as human rights  solidarity andsocial justice. At the threshold of the twenty-first century let us pledge to settle religious and ethnic conflictsthrough dialogue  tolerance and cultural exchange  and tofind collective answers to international terrorism organized crime  drug trafficking and the degradation ofthe environment. We can join forces to eradicate poverty which is a major cause of social injustice and politicalturmoil in the world  and guarantee dignity  respect andbetter living standards for every human being.The goals of a new world order  founded on mutualtrust and the rejection of the threat and use of force  arepeace  security  sustainable development and respect forthe fundamental freedoms of the individual. But thesevalues cannot be dictated by an elite group of States. Thefuture of humankind is the responsibility of theinternational community as a whole.As the United Nations prepares to meet thechallenges of the third millennium  the General Assemblyhas a role of paramount importance to play.15At the opening of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly there was unanimous consensus on the need fora far-reaching reform of the United Nations system. In myaddress I stated that if the United Nations was to respondeffectively to the growing concerns that had emerged reform could no longer be postponed. The internationalcommunity requires higher standards of security development and democracy  and it needs them now.On that occasion  I listed 10 specific proposals tomake United Nations peacekeeping operations moreeffective  and I am glad to see that progress has been madeon some of them. Procedures for periodic meetings betweenthe Security Council and troop-contributing countries havebeen consolidated. To help the Organization respond tocrises where and when they arise  Italy recently became thesixth country to formalize its participation in standbyarrangements for United Nations peacekeeping operations.President Clinton said in his speech on Monday thatthe first task of the United Nations must remain the pursuitof peace and security. When a situation of seriousinstability developed in Albania last March  the SecurityCouncil — with the full support of the Secretary-General — acted promptly  authorizing a coalition of thecountries  led by Italy  willing to form a MultinationalProtection Force. During the four months of its mandate Operation Alba enabled the safe delivery of humanitarianassistance  created a secure environment for the missions ofinternational organizations  and made democratic electionspossible. In short  it helped put the country back on its feet.One of the keys to its success was an innovative approachto peacekeeping  involving the rapid planning anddeployment of the Force  and close coordination among theparticipating countries and the host country  under theconstant monitoring of the United Nations.To consolidate the gains that have been made and laythe foundations for Albania's growth and prosperity  thenext step is to rehabilitate the State institutions andeconomy. With this in mind  the Italian Government hasconvened a ministerial conference for October  in Rome with the participation of the Albanian Government and allthe relevant international organizations to assess needs anddecide on a common course of action.For over half a century  the United Nations has beenseeking to establish a permanent international criminal courtto prosecute and punish genocide  war crimes and crimesagainst humanity  wherever and by whomever they arecommitted. This is a test of our collective responsibility made even more pressing by the terrible massacres thathave characterized recent ethnic conflicts  and Italyconfirms its strong support  pledges its active contributionto this endeavour  and is prepared to host in Rome thediplomatic conference to adopt the statute for theinternational criminal court.A second major challenge is arms control. Beforedealing with the security requirements of tomorrow  wemust stop living by the fears of yesterday. New standardsof security can be produced only through internationalcooperation under the leadership of the United Nations.Italy has some of the world's strictest and mostadvanced legislation on the export of arms. I am proud toreport that this past June the Italian Governmentunilaterally decided to renounce the production  export stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines  andenabling legislation to this effect has already been passedby one branch of our Parliament. But the full value ofthis commitment can only be realized if it is shared by allcountries  whether or not they are parties to the Ottawaprocess. The recent Oslo conference  to be sure  maderemarkable accomplishments  but they are not yetuniversal. To achieve this goal  our efforts should becomplemented by the continuing involvement of theConference on Disarmament.Two months ago  Secretary-General Kofi Annanpresented a package of ground-breaking proposals toimprove the effectiveness of the Organization andenhance its ability to meet the new challenges. Thoseproposals deserve our full support.One important goal of the Secretary General's reformplan is to energize the strategic direction provided by theGeneral Assembly. To this end  we need to streamline theagenda and identify priorities for consideration in the short-and medium-term. Since the time available for plenarydebates is limited  we should focus on matters of generalinterest.The reform of the Organization is a question of thehighest priority for the current session of the GeneralAssembly  as the Secretary-General himself hasunderlined. In the coming months  two other majorsubjects also command our attention: the financialsituation of the Organization  and the structure andcomposition of the Security Council.To function properly  the Organization has to be ableto rely on adequate resources. Assessed contributionsmust be paid in full  on time and without conditions by16Member States. Italy  for its part  has always complied withthis fundamental rule. Nevertheless  we believe that thetime has come to agree on a realistic new scale ofassessments  based on Member States' capacity to pay andmaking the Organization less dependent on thecontributions of a single country.However  let there be no confusion about our supportfor a review of the scale of assessments. There can beabsolutely no link between Members' contributions andSecurity Council reform  lest the impression be created thatpermanent seats are up for sale.This brings me to the reform of the Security Council.There is broad agreement that reform is needed to bring theCouncil more in line with the new realities of the world inwhich we live. The reform must be inspired by theprinciples of democracy  equitable geographicalrepresentation and transparency. These are the veryprinciples guiding the proposal presented by Italy. Whilewe are prepared to look constructively at other proposals we must guard against those advocating a system thatwould divide Member States into four categories: first-classcountries — the five current permanent members of theSecurity Council  with veto power; second-classcountries — the new permanent members fromindustrialized nations  without veto power; third-classcountries — “pseudo-permanent” rotating members  withoutveto power  from developing nations in different regions;and fourth-class countries — the overwhelming majority ofUnited Nations Member States  with fewer chances thanever of serving on the Security Council.Such stratification of membership  reminiscent of thecaste system in ancient empires  would defy thefundamental principles of logic and democracy  andmarginalize some of the countries most active in theOrganization. How could any of us accept relegation to thelast of these categories and go back to our people andParliaments and tell them that we actually voted in favourof our country's demotion to fourth-class status? Let mestress that this type of problem would not be generated bythe Italian proposal  which calls for an increase only innon-permanent members  to be democratically elected bythe General Assembly.Another aspect of reform is the question of the veto.This cannot and should not be discussed independently ofthe issue of enlarging the Council. The two issues areinseparable. Indeed  every aspect of Security Councilreform should be addressed at the same time and in thesame context. Before determining the future size of theCouncil and the names of new members  we must definethe criteria that should govern the reform. Ad hocapproaches will not work. Ultimately  no solution can beadopted unless there is broad consensus. And a lastingand equitable outcome cannot be reached through hastyand partial solutions. Forcing the issue would deependivisions and jeopardize the larger and more urgentquestion before the General Assembly: approving theSecretary-General's reform package.In a longer-term perspective  I would like to add thata fact-finding inquiry recently conducted by the ItalianParliament envisaged a permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil for the European Union  as a natural evolution ofits common foreign and security policy.Almost 55 years ago  on November 13 1942 President Roosevelt said that the future of the UnitedNations association“should not be restricted to the 28 signatories of theAtlantic Charter  but should be one which all nationscould join.”President Roosevelt believed that the purpose of theUnited Nations should not be the defence of the statusquo and that its strength did not lie in sheer numbers  butin the way that Member States engaged in collectivedeliberations and action. This vision should guide ourpursuit of a more promising future for all the people ofthis world. History will not be lenient with us if we fail."
"82",3533,"JAM",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  yourelection to preside over the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly is a fitting and well-deserved result ofyour distinguished service for your country in theinternational community.I also wish to convey our appreciation toAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for so ablydirecting the work of the fifty-first session  and tocongratulate him for a job well done.I join those who have spoken before me inwelcoming the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan to this his first General Assembly session since his assumptionof office. Already he has impressed us with his sincerityof purpose and his willingness to take bold initiatives. Hecan always rely on Jamaica’s full cooperation and support4as he seeks to steer the United Nations towards the newmillennium.Exactly 35 years ago  Jamaica became a Member ofthe United Nations by one of its first acts as a sovereignnation. We did so in recognition of the central role in themanagement of global affairs which only the UnitedNations can fill and from our desire to participate as anequal partner in that process. Ever since then  Jamaica hasactively sought to contribute in a constructive spirit to thebuilding and strengthening of the international system. Oneconcrete result of these efforts is the location in Jamaica ofan offshoot of the system  the International SeabedAuthority  established under the United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea  which is generally acknowledged tohave been a signal achievement in extending the reach ofinternational cooperation. We feel confident that theAuthority will be able to discharge its mandate efficientlyas a completely autonomous institution.We are constantly reminded that we are approachinga new century and a new millennium. This new eraprovides exciting possibilities and  at the same time  posesformidable challenges. It requires of us a creative effort tofind new directions and a continuing search for freshsolutions. The fluidity and changing currents in worldaffairs demand constant adaptation and adjustments to meetcontemporary realities.Some old disputes remain unresolved  and an array ofnew problems continues to enter the international agenda.The situation in the Middle East should not be allowed toremain forever a source of anxiety and frustration. The riseof ethnic violence and intercommunal conflict must behalted now.Whatever cloud of uncertainty may hang over thefuture  we must not fail to lay the foundations of a morestable and equitable world order which fosters greater hopeand wider opportunities for mankind.As we seek to strengthen the fabric of internationalsecurity  there needs to be a concentrated focus on the rootcauses of instability  conflict and confrontation everywhere.The danger signals are unmistakably clear. The coexistenceof a world of wealth and prosperity and a world of povertyand misery is too profound a contradiction to be ignored. Itlies at the heart of an emerging crisis. More than onebillion human beings are still condemned to abject poverty.The despair and frustration which form their dailyexperience breed tension and trigger instability which arebound to erupt from time to time.In a world where we note with increasing concernthe absence of appropriate measures by multilateralfinancial institutions to relieve the burden of debt  we arebound to question whether the economic measures appliedin the last few years represent the only way fordeveloping countries to orient their economies. We cannotaccept that the impoverishment of millions is a necessarycost of future world growth.Globalization and liberalization  which have led tothe breaking down of so many barriers between nations are not removing the barriers between rich and poor. Theprocess seems instead to be widening the differences anddeepening the divide. The benefits of increased productionand the expansion of global trade have been unevenlyspread. Many developing countries are being increasinglymarginalized in the process. Expected transfers ofresources from increased trade and investment flows havenot materialized  while the burden of debt remains amajor constraint on development. Simply put  the rich aregetting richer and the poor are getting poorer.Unless we redress the imbalance — and quickly —the disparities will increase exponentially. To avertimminent disaster  there has to be a reversal of the patternof transfer of technology and more liberal access to themarkets of developed countries.In all this  the United Nations has a decisive andstrategic role to play. It should direct and channelinternational cooperation to correct distortions andinequities in the system  and contribute to the creation ofan international economic environment facilitatingeconomic growth and the benefits of development for all.The new trading system is skewed in favour of theeconomically powerful. It is becoming more and moreapparent that free trade  as practised by its loudestadvocates  is not necessarily fair trade. For developingcountries  access to larger markets remains difficult owing to a variety of protective barriers. And wherespecial and historical market arrangements for smallproducers still exist  these are now under threat fromalliances of powerful governmental and private interests.We developing countries cannot afford to shutourselves off from what is taking place around us. Thepace of change is at times bewildering  but we cannotsay  “Stop the world  I want to get off”. We must makeuse of the positive elements of modernity  organization ofwork and efficiency  to build the kind of society we wishto leave to our children. The empowerment of all of the5peoples of our countries is of paramount importance to theadvancement of our societies.Such empowerment requires that priority attention begiven to human-resource development and human-capitalformation  and to the optimal utilization of all the availablehuman and natural resources of our time. Increasingly where this has not already started  our programmes ofeducation and training will have to be redesigned andrefocused to enable our peoples to function effectively inthe emerging knowledge-based world economy.Applications of science and technology and advances intelecommunications must become all-pervasive factors to beeffectively and appropriately utilized for the benefit of ourpeoples.Nothing would better fulfil the lofty ideals of ourfounding fathers than an immediate global assault onpoverty  ignorance and disease. To win the battle  I callupon this Assembly to emphasize the creation  applicationand dissemination of knowledge in every corner of theEarth.Liberalization and globalization  as they are beingpractised  have not shown the capacity or willingness totake into account the genuine interests or practicalpossibilities of small States. This is the painful lesson thatwe as Caribbean producers of bananas have learned. Therecent panel ruling by the World Trade Organization(WTO) in Geneva on the European banana regime threatensto ruin the economies of the smaller States of theCaribbean  thereby endangering the economic stability ofthe entire region. It demonstrates not only the vulnerabilityof small economies  but also the extent to which we are atthe mercy of those whose calculations seem oblivious to theinterests of our survival.Small economies operate under severe resourceconstraints and need to conserve the natural environment which is a precious resource. That is why countriesmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) attachspecial importance to international recognition of thepeculiar circumstances and needs of small island developingStates  as highlighted in the Barbados Programme ofAction  which was adopted by the United Nations GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States.It is with great disappointment that we note how littleprogress has been made to implement the Programme ofAction. There is a special need for financing arrangementsto develop production capabilities  infrastructure andenvironmental protection programmes.Small island States suffer other disadvantages. TheCaribbean is renowned for its natural beauty  but it is alsovulnerable to a range of frequent natural disasters. To thephysical limitations in resources and economic scale havebeen added the hazards of nature.Even as I speak  the people of the small island ofMontserrat are struggling to maintain their existence intheir own land  two thirds of which has been destroyed bya volcano that resumed activity just over two years ago.As a member of the Caribbean Community  Montserrat'splight is of grave concern to all CARICOM States. Ispeak on behalf of the Community in acknowledging thecategorical commitment given by the administeringPower  the United Kingdom  for both emergencyassistance to Montserratians and for the sustainabledevelopment of that territory.The costs of reconstruction are immense. Membersof the Caribbean Community have offered constructivesupport to the recovery efforts. We believe that theinternational community should also respond in ahumanitarian gesture of solidarity. I therefore take thisopportunity to appeal to the General Assembly todemonstrate appropriate support for Montserrat throughthe adoption of tangible measures to assist in therebuilding and sustainable development of that island. Itis our hope and expectation that the membership of theUnited Nations will be able to devise a specific schemeof assistance for a small and courageous people.We all look to the United Nations to help inemergencies  but above all  to be effective in keeping thepeace. It should be ready to respond promptly to crises asthey occur and to defuse tensions and conflict situationsthrough preventive diplomacy. We believe the presenttime affords a significant opportunity for creating theframework to fulfil this role and for us to shape a rapid-response capability.In recent years  a number of unilateral as well asmultilateral measures have resulted in a more positiveclimate for international peace and security. Theconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly andthe entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Conventionhave enhanced the prospects for real progress towards thegoal of general and complete disarmament. Wenevertheless acknowledge that more needs to be done in6the areas of arms regulation and disarmament  in respectespecially of conventional weapons and the proliferation ofsmall arms.We welcome the steps being taken to prohibit the useof anti-personnel landmines  which should be regarded asa category of inhumane weapons that can no longer beallowed to cause the maiming and loss of life of civilians.We urge Member States to give full support to the Ottawaprocess for the conclusion of an international treaty to banthis category of weapons so that there can be universalobedience.The threat to international peace and security can nolonger be viewed in purely military and political terms.Illicit trafficking in drugs poses a serious threat  as alltoo often we witness the pervasive and pernicious effects ofthe production and consumption of illicit drugs. Themassive demand and the lure of profits from the trade havespawned a transnational network of criminals withconsiderable resources and influence. The activities of thesegroups are particularly threatening to small States such asthose in the Caribbean  where the State apparatus is oftenstretched to deal with their coercive capability. Within theCaribbean Community we have taken these threats seriouslyand have committed significant resources to confrontingthem. Our geographical proximity to the major destinationfor the consumption of drugs makes the Caribbeanparticularly vulnerable as a transshipment point. Wetherefore view bilateral and regional cooperation as criticalto combating drug smuggling.An associated problem that is particularly dangerousfor us is the smuggling of arms and weapons of destruction which is a significant factor in spreading a cycle of crimeand violence. CARICOM has pushed for a regionalinitiative to attack this problem. We look forward tohemisphere support  particularly in restricting illegal exportsfrom the main areas of manufacturing and sale of smallarms.It is evident from all the forces at work that theimperatives of interdependence  the impact of globalizationand the interlinkage in global problems require a renewaland strengthening of multilateralism. With the end of thecold war  we now have within our grasp the opportunity toestablish a lasting framework for international cooperationand to build genuine partnerships that will guarantee afuture that is secure for all. The challenges of the emergingworld order are best addressed by multilateral approaches.Isolationism and unilateralism cannot be viable options  butmultilateralism can thrive only if there are effectivemultilateral institutions.The United Nations remains indispensable as theonly universal mechanism capable of addressing issues ofglobal impact and concern. But we must realize that theinternational society which the United Nations now servesis vastly different from the one in existence when theOrganization was originally created. The reshaping of theUnited Nations therefore has to take into account new andcomplex international realities. Without compromising thefundamental objectives of the Charter  we need new rulesand procedures to guide us.Of special importance is the reform of the SecurityCouncil  in terms of both composition and mode ofoperation. The Council is a vital organ in the working ofthe United Nations. It is essential for its effectiveness thatit command the confidence of the internationalcommunity.Jamaica supports an expansion of membership of theCouncil which will make it more representative of theinternational community. We advocate the adoption ofprocedures that will make it more democratic andtransparent in decision-making. We recognize that thereare important and delicate issues at stake and that weshould proceed with care  but we have a concern that theprocess should not be mired in endless debate. Webelieve there is a sufficient consensus on proposals toform the basis for decisions soon.We also acknowledge that more efficientmanagement and more scope for effective initiative by theSecretary-General and his staff are essential to astrengthened United Nations structure. We support theSecretary-General in this endeavour.Jamaica also endorses the need for measures toimprove efficiency  and we have no quarrel with reformto streamline and rationalize the system. In welcomingthese steps  we must however emphasize that reform isnot synonymous with cost cutting. Reform is not aboutdoing less; it is about doing better.We would therefore wish to see a process thatstrengthens the capacity of the United Nations to deliverthe services required by Member States as well as cementthe linkages among the organs of the system whilepreserving comparative advantages  complementarities andsynergies. The exercise must improve the capacity of theUnited Nations to take preventive action and respond7swiftly to crises. Above all  for small developing nationssuch as my own it is important that the Organizationcontinue to play a leadership role in defining globaldevelopment priorities.Not all Member States will readily embrace the reformproposals that have been introduced  yet no one can denythe need for meaningful action to strengthen and improvethe United Nations system. We must therefore seek to findcommon cause and summon the collective will toimplement the measures that are necessary for itsrevitalization. It is our collective responsibility. Effectivereform of our global institution requires broad agreement onthe main features of the new global environment. We mustclearly define the role the United Nations is expected toplay in the next millennium. Our common vision must beone in which the United Nations can act as the catalyst forchange and an instrument of progress on behalf of allpeoples of the world.Let us resolve to equip the United Nations with thenecessary tools  including the requisite financial resourcesin accordance with Charter obligations  to enable iteffectively to undertake its leadership role in safeguardinginternational peace and security in ensuring the economicand social well-being of mankind. It is our responsibility and our peoples are looking for an institution energized toact effectively and swiftly to address the challenges thatconfront us as we approach the twenty-first century. Let usexploit the opportunity we now have to fashion a UnitedNations which reflects the hope and aspirations of allmankind for sustainable development  for lasting securityand for enduring peace.The new millennium beckons with its endlesspossibilities and challenges. Let not narrow self-interestprevent us from taking bold and decisive steps to meetthese challenges. Jamaica and the Caribbean Communitystand ready to play their part in a cooperative effort toattain global equity and prosperity. All of us owe it toourselves and to succeeding generations.I urge the international community wholeheartedly toembrace this venture in a genuine spirit of solidarity andharmony. History will not forgive us should we fail to doso."
"83",3579,"JOR",52,1997,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to begin my statement bycongratulating you  Mr. President  and the Government andpeople of your friendly country on your election asPresident of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly. I am quite confident that you will conduct theproceedings of this session efficiently and competently given your renowned skill and experience in bothdiplomatic and international affairs.I would also like to express our utmost appreciationand gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  for hissuccessful and distinguished management of the affairs ofthe fifty-first session which has just ended.It is also my pleasure heartily to congratulate theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his election to theoffice of Secretary-General of the United Nations at thebeginning of this year. I wish him success and wish ourOrganization progress and prosperity under his leadership.Since the start of the peace process in the MiddleEast  Jordan has carefully upheld the purposes and termsof reference of this process  which began in Madrid in1991 with the participation of all the concerned parties.Since recovering its territory and water under the peacetreaty signed with Israel in October 1994  Jordan hasmaintained its pivotal role in the process and continued itsefforts with the other parties to achieve the desired goalsof establishing a just  comprehensive and lasting peacewhich will be accepted  preserved and protected by futuregenerations. We fully believe that the durability of peaceis closely tied to the need for it to be just andcomprehensive. We understand comprehensiveness in itsbroadest sense  namely  all parties to the conflict withoutexception must be involved and all aspects of the conflictmust be dealt with  whether its inherent causes or thosewhich have evolved and been aggravated over the yearsand during the various phases of the conflict.Jordan has always emphasized its adherence toSecurity Council resolutions  particularly resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  as the basic terms ofreference for the peace process  in addition to theprinciple of handing back occupied Arab territory inreturn for peace. Based on this and on relevant UnitedNations resolutions  legitimacy and justice  we call for theresumption of negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track andthe Lebanese-Israeli track. We have also made andcontinue to make our best efforts to achieve theimplementation of the transitional phase agreements andgo on to the final status negotiations on the Palestiniantrack. We do this out of our firm conviction that thepeace process will not attain comprehensiveness norjustice unless the Israelis and Palestinians arrive at a justsolution for the question of Palestine  including the rightof self-determination for the Palestinian people and theestablishment of their independent State on their nationalterritory.Jerusalem  the city of peace  which is the seat of theHoly Places of the three heavenly religions  and to whichthe hearts of believers the world over turn  deserves ourutmost attention  with a view to reaching a satisfactorysolution that ensures to all freedom of access to the HolyPlaces  preserves the holy character of the city and keepsit as a symbol of peace among peoples across the world.We affirm that East Jerusalem is an occupied PalestinianArab city to which Security Council resolution 242 (1967)applies  as it applies to all occupied Arab territories.If the security problem is a major obstacle to peace confidence-building and peacemaking are the best means6to achieve individual and regional security as well asstability in the Middle East. There is no peace withoutsecurity and no security without peace.Accordingly  we would like from this internationalrostrum to call upon Israel — the State with which we haveconcluded a peace treaty — to do everything possible tobuild and consolidate confidence with the peoples of theregion in general and the Palestinian people in particular. Afirst step toward that would be to abandon  in its dealingwith security matters  the language of force  the languageof siege and restrictions on the livelihood of the Palestinianpeople. At the same time  Israel must abide by the FourthGeneva Convention by abandoning the settlement policyand the policy of creating a new fait accompli onPalestinian territory  including its attempts to change thedemographic structure and the religious  historical andcultural character of the occupied territories  includingJerusalem. We also call upon Israel to implement theagreements concluded with the Palestinian side in letter andspirit as soon as possible  for delay and siege will create astate of despair in which it becomes impossible to controlextremism and prevent it from wreaking havoc on securityand stability. Extremism undoubtedly finds in these policiesa fertile ground for the achievement of its anti-peaceobjectives.On the other hand  in order to build confidence withthe Governments and peoples of the region  Israel has toabandon the production and development of weapons ofmass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons. All theMiddle East States  except Israel  have become parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). The whole world recognizes that the currentsituation in the region is indeed a unique situationunparalleled in other regions of the world. A single Statehas a monopoly of nuclear capabilities  while the otherStates of the region are bound by treaties and internationallaw.Because the presence of nuclear weapons is a majorobstacle preventing the peace process from reaching itsgoals  the ideal solution for this problem would be toremove this obstacle by establishing in the Middle East azone free from all weapons of mass destruction.In this context  permit me to announce the decision ofthe Government of Jordan to accede to the Convention onthe Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.This decision was motivated by Jordan’s belief thatweapons  including all weapons of mass destruction  do notestablish security nor restore stability to the Middle Eastregion or to any region in the world unless there is fullconfidence among its Governments and peoples.The Iraqis no longer see any ray of hope of endingtheir continuous suffering caused by the embargo that hasbeen imposed on them for the last seven years. Iraqishave suffered enough and tasted enough bitter pain. It ishigh time that our international Organization moved toalleviate their suffering and dress their wounds  so thatthey may recover their livelihood and contribute anew tothe development and prosperity of the region.In issuing this serious and sincere call for the liftingof the embargo imposed on the people of Iraq  we wouldlike to reaffirm that it is necessary to preserve Iraq’ssovereignty and territorial integrity. We also call upon theIraqi Government fully to implement all Security Councilresolutions and to do its best to reach a solution for theproblem of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons  topave the way for the reestablishment of normal andfriendly relations among the States of the region on thebasis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of all States.Just as the Iraqi people are suffering from theblockade  so are the Libyan people. Since the sanctionswere imposed on Libya  the Libyan people have beensuffering from a ban on flights. We therefore call for apeaceful settlement of the problem arising from theLockerbie tragedy within a framework of internationallaw and legitimacy.We call upon Iran to enter into serious negotiationswith the sisterly United Arab Emirates in order to reacha peaceful solution  ensuring the return of the threeoccupied islands  Abu Musa and the Greater and theLesser Tunb  to the United Arab Emirates  which wouldeffectively contribute to the establishment of peace security and stability in the Gulf region.Since war began in the former Yugoslavia  Jordanhas joined its voice to those of all the States that calledfor an end to the suffering of the people of the nascentRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  suffering thatshocked the conscience of the whole world and movedthe international community  which had held high hopesfollowing the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement.We now reaffirm that peace  security and stability inBosnia — and  indeed  throughout the Balkans — dependlargely on the full and honest implementation of thatAgreement. A strong international commitment is also7essential for making the peace process an irreversiblereality. The international community must do what isincumbent upon it in this regard  including providingeffective assistance for reconstruction in Bosnia andHerzegovina and ensuring the effective management ofpublic enterprises as provided in the Dayton Agreement.This would have an important impact on the preservation ofBosnia’s unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.The problem of Palestinian refugees  the resolution ofwhich has been left to the final status negotiations  is oneof the most intricate problems faced by the Middle Eastregion. However  the international community  regrettably does not accord this problem the attention that it deserves.The financial crisis which grips the United Nations Reliefand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East(UNRWA) has been escalating year after year without asolution being found. UNRWA has been forced this year toannounce austerity measures entailing a large reduction inservices offered to the Palestinian refugees  including theimmediate cessation of the scholarships funded from theregular budget; the elimination of all medical compensationand referral to hospitals during the last two months of thisyear; the freezing of emergency cash assistance and shelterrehabilitation from the regular budget; a freeze on thecreation of new posts  international as well as local; thesuspension of recruitment of international staff; thesuspension of appointments to local posts  with theexception of those considered essential for the continuationof operations; and a plan to consider collecting fees fromstudents in UNRWA’s areas of operation.Although all those measures have been put on holdfollowing pledges by certain donor countries during theirmeeting with UNRWA and host countries  held recently inAmman  to increase their voluntary contributions by anamount sufficient to cover this year’s deficit  whichamounts to $20 million  the danger of cutting servicesremains as long as no final solution has been found  takinginto consideration the need to meet the requirements ofnatural population growth among refugees and inflationrates.Since the beginning of the refugee tragedy more thanfive decades ago  Jordan has borne the heaviest burden ofall the host countries. The number of refugees in Jordan is1.5 million  20 per cent of whom live in refugee campsserviced by UNRWA and the rest of whom are scatteredthroughout Jordanian cities and villages. Out of its sense ofhumanitarian responsibility  the Government of Jordan hasprovided all services needed by the refugees  includinginfrastructure  education  health and welfare services andfinancial support  in addition to public security and civildefence services. Thus  Jordan  despite its scarceresources and limited means  spends approximately $340million annually on services provided to refugees  anamount almost equal to UNRWA’s total budget. That isnot all. The Government of Jordan has also developedthis year a strategic plan  a so-called social securitypackage designed to develop infrastructure for refugeecamps and disadvantaged areas  to provide sustainabledevelopment and to reduce poverty. The total share ofrefugee camps in this plan comes to nearly $240 million which will be allocated to the rehabilitation of watersystems  solid waste treatment  sewerage systems  waterpurification plants  road and electricity projects and theprovision of essential public services.While Jordan affirms that improving the standards ofliving for the Palestinian refugees does not diminish theirpolitical right to return and compensation  as provided forin General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948  itreaffirms that the support of UNRWA is a collectiveresponsibility of the international community. It alsostresses the legal  political and humanitarian dimensionsof the refugee question and considers that any failure todischarge the humanitarian responsibility for this questionwould negatively reflect on political responsibility.My country therefore affirms from this rostrum theneed to take serious and sincere action and to make everyeffort to continue the services provided by UNRWA toPalestinian refugees until a lasting  just andcomprehensive solution to their problem is reached. Wealso call for the abandonment of any attempts to abolishUNRWA  suspend its operations  reduce the services itprovides to refugees or turn its mandates andresponsibilities over to any other agency  for that wouldhave a negative impact on the political and legaldimensions of the refugee question. It would also have anegative impact on the peace process and stability in theregion.We call for compliance with the letter and spirit ofGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948 on thequestion of refugees  as well as with Security Councilresolution 237 (1967)  which calls for facilitation of thereturn of displaced persons. We call upon donor countriesto fulfil their commitments to UNRWA and increase theircontributions to an extent commensurate with the naturalincrease in the numbers of refugees. We also call uponthe international community in general  and potentialdonors in particular  to give due attention to this matter.8The refugee problem reminds us of internationalhumanitarian law in general and the need for its fullapplication in particular. This subject has always been oneof interest to Jordan. Since 1981  Jordan has beensubmitting a draft resolution to the Third Committeeentitled  “A new international humanitarian order”  whichcalls for respect for the full application of internationalhumanitarian law. My Government has also amendedJordanian laws to give priority and immense importance tothe application of this law. I would recall here the appealby His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Jordan to workhard with the international community to bring intoexistence a new international humanitarian order.The report of the Secretary-General entitled “Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform” which he submitted last July  constitutes a good basis forthe reform process and a studied plan for the future embodying a serious and real desire for change for thebetter.The report reviews the main strategic functions of theOrganization and provides for each of them specificproposals charting the way and making Member States realpartners in achieving an Organization better prepared todeal with humanitarian and political crises; based on greaterefficiency; qualified to play a more vital role in the areasspecified by the Charter; and made imperative by thechanging security  economic  social and politicalcircumstances of this world. Jordan calls for openingmembership of the United Nations to all peace-lovingStates  in accordance with Article 4 (1) of the Charter  inorder to achieve the universality of the Charter.The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  while fullyappreciating the good efforts of the Secretary-General inpreparing his plan  stresses the fact that the purpose ofreform is not confined to cutting costs or dealing withunwieldiness. It goes far beyond that to reactivate the roleof the Organization to discharge its responsibilities andcarry out its functions with a high degree of efficiency transparency and credibility. We agree with the Secretary-General that reform is not an isolated event  but acontinuing process that does not stop at the implementationof the proposals contained in the report. It extends toencompassing the general direction in which theOrganization will evolve as a result of the implementationof the proposals.The coming century will witness deeper and quickerglobal changes. The United Nations must be prepared todeal with these changes in the five major areascorresponding to the main mandates of the UnitedNations: peace and security  economic and social affairs development cooperation  humanitarian affairs and humanrights.In the area of international peace and security  wefind that the multiplicity and diversity of armed conflictsin the post-cold-war era have made the Security Councila hub of international efforts to establish peace andsecurity throughout the world. This makes it veryimportant to restructure and reform the Council. TheSecurity Council  established after the Second World War does not reflect the balance of power prevalent in today’sworld. It has become necessary to review its structure andrules of procedure. The Working Group on therestructuring and reform of the Security Council has madetireless efforts over the past few years to achieve thispurpose.There are many useful and feasible concepts thathave appeared in the context of reform. What has beenlacking so far is the collective political will to translatethese concepts into reality. In this regard  Jordan feels thatany new restructuring of the Security Council must takeinto account the representation of the developing countriesthroughout the globe. We feel that the Arab Group  inview of its major and effective role  is entitled to apermanent seat on the Security Council.There is no doubt that the United Nationspeacekeeping operations will continue to be one of themost important activities of the Organization in enhancinginternational peace and security. Driven by its belief inthis noble aim  Jordan has  on the direction of itsHashemite leadership  participated for many years in theseactivities to the extent that  at one point  its contributionranked second among all the troop-contributing countries.I must  however  point to the financial difficultiesfaced by some troop-contributing States  including Jordan as a result of the financial crisis gripping theOrganization  because reimbursements have not beenmade in a timely manner. I appeal from this rostrum toall Member States to pay their assessed contributions tothe Organization without condition  in full and on time.Moreover  Jordan has participated in the UnitedNations stand-by arrangements. It was the first country tosign a memorandum of understanding with the UnitedNations under this system. It also participated effectivelyin crystallizing the idea of establishing a rapidlydeployable mission headquarters to contribute to9enhancing the Organization’s ability to respond rapidly tocrises as they occur.As for disarmament and arms control  the progresswitnessed by the world during the past few years is reallyencouraging. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons has been extended indefinitely and is nowapproaching universality. Last year  the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was concluded  in addition toother significant achievements in the reduction of thenuclear-weapon arsenals of the United States and theRussian Federation. All eyes are now set on the Conferenceon Disarmament in the hopes of seeing it crown itsachievements with a treaty banning the production offissionable materials used in the manufacture of nuclearweapons and another providing full security assurances tonon-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of useof nuclear weapons.Since development in the economic and social fieldsis one of the primary objectives of the United Nations serious attention must be directed towards reform of UnitedNations organs functioning in these two spheres  foremostamong them the Economic and Social Council. This reformshould enhance international cooperation in setting fortheffective national policies aimed at advancing growth in allMember States with no exceptions.The most important characteristics of the worldeconomy  as we stand on the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury  are two: first is the global transition to marketeconomy  and second is the rapid technical development ofcommunication and information technology  makingknowledge the most important factor of production. Thenew world economy is also characterized by intensecompetitiveness  speed  the intensive use of information andincreasing globalization.We must  however  consider how we can find themeans to avoid the negative effects of globalization represented by the marginalization of some developingcountries  because of their declining exports and an increasein their external indebtedness  and of social groups in thesecountries as a result of the inequitable distribution ofincome. Globalization is not concerned with the problemsof distribution  but with being a prime mover of economicgrowth in general.In view of this situation  the industrialized countriesare called upon to increase their official developmentassistance to the developing world  to find comprehensivesolutions to the problem of external indebtedness  tointegrate the developing countries into the world’s free-trade system and to improve these countries’ terms oftrade.Jordan  as a developing country  has sufferedeconomic problems since the end of the 1980s  whichwere aggravated by the Gulf crisis and the Gulf War earlyin this decade. By pursuing structural adjustment policies however  with the assistance of the International MonetaryFund  Jordan was able to achieve very good results thatexceeded expectations. The budget deficit wassubstantially reduced  as was the size of external debt. Allmacroeconomic indicators have improved.Substantial progress has been achieved in the area ofprivatization and the reform of internal financialregulations and the banking sector  which gave the privatesector a chance to participate effectively. Jordan has goneahead on the way to development. It has initialled apartnership agreement with Europe and is now taking thepreparatory measures needed to join the World TradeOrganization (WTO). To that end  we are doing our bestto adjust our economy and prepare it for full integrationin the global free-trade system.In association with our Arab brethren and othercountries in the Middle East  we are making tremendousefforts to widen the area of cooperation  trade andinvestment in the region. We have succeeded in attractingsubstantial investments in the stock exchange and otherindustrial and tourist projects. The Government of Jordanis working hard to remove the remaining restrictionswhich limited the inflow of regional and globalinvestments  including lifting all restrictions on foreigncurrencies.The world recognizes the historical responsibilitythat we assume towards future generations to preserve asound global environment  in compliance with theprinciples adopted by the Earth Summit. In spite of itsscarce resources  Jordan is committed to applying the Rioprinciples and is working hard to make its contribution asa partner with other countries of the world in sustainabledevelopment.Although we are committed  as a developingcountry  to doing what is required of us by virtue of thispartnership  we  along with other developing countries have noticed regression and procrastination by developedcountries in discharging their obligations under thispartnership. We have also felt that the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly was held to consecrate10this regression in the discharge of obligations  rather thanto enhance them and to cooperate in carrying out those notyet implemented.In conclusion  if the establishment of peace  securityand stability in this world is one of the noble purposes ofour international Organization  we must provide the solidground for that  which is to reduce poverty  controldiseases  illiteracy and unemployment and work towards thecreation of a clean environment and sustainabledevelopment for future generations."
"84",3626,"JPN",52,1997,"﻿I should likeat the outset to extend my warmest compliments to HisExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  Foreign Minister ofUkraine  on his assumption last week of the presidency ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Japanwill cooperate closely with him for the success of thissession.I should also like to pay sincere tribute to HisExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail  who  as President of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly  demonstratedactive initiative for strengthening the functions of theUnited Nations through reform. Japan earnestly hopes thatAmbassador Razali will continue to contribute his viewsfor the advancement of United Nations reform.5This session of the General Assembly will be an“Assembly for reform”. I say this because the currentsession is of unprecedented importance in terms of realizingthe reform of the United Nations.I should like to recall what the purpose of UnitedNations reform is. The purpose of reforming the UnitedNations is  I believe  to strengthen its functions to furtherenable it to fully accomplish its tasks. As a member of theSecurity Council  Japan is deeply aware that since the endof the Cold War grave problems of conflicts and povertyhave emerged  most frequently and acutely in Africa. Byreforming the United Nations  the international communitywill be better able to solve the problems of peoples in allparts of the world who are suffering due to conflicts andpoverty  problems which are especially glaring in Africa.We must begin immediately to strengthen the UnitedNations in this respect and continue our efforts into thefuture. Japan intends to play the role which is expected ofit in the strengthened United Nations.I regard highly the strong initiatives of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in promoting reform. Inparticular  his proposals for United Nations reformannounced in March and July of this year are intended toenhance the coherence and effectiveness of United Nationsactivities by strengthening the leadership of the Secretary-General as well as the coordination function in each field including development and humanitarian affairs; as such they have Japan’s basic support. We earnestly hope that thereform of the United Nations as a whole will gathermomentum through these proposals.If the United Nations is unable to reform itself to meetthe demands of the coming era  but simply engages in anaimless repetition of detailed arguments in which eachMember State pursues its own interests  the confidence ofthe international community in the Organization will beseverely undermined. We must be aware that at thismoment we are standing at a crucial crossroads. It is thevery moment at which we must summon the political willto decide on the outlines of United Nations reform.Japan believes that each Member State should  in aspirit of statesmanship  engage in substantive negotiations not from the viewpoint of pursuing its own parochialinterests but from the genuinely broad perspective ofmaximizing benefits to the international community as awhole.Japan believes that reforms relating to the SecurityCouncil  finance and development are the three pillars ofUnited Nations reform. Today  the Security Council isattentive to the economic and social aspects of theconflicts it seeks to resolve. Moreover  in order toestablish a sound financial basis  it is necessary that allthe activities of the United Nations  including those in thefields of development and peacekeeping  be renderedmore effective. Serious efforts in the area of developmentare also important for ensuring international peace andsecurity. It is therefore essential that reform in these threeareas be achieved as a whole in a balanced manner inorder for the United Nations  the sole universalorganization  to respond appropriately to the dramaticallychanging context of the international community and tobe better able to discharge its functions.Now I would like to reiterate Japan’s views on someof the most important points regarding the United Nationsreform effort.First  the reform of the Security Council.Needless to say  the international community isvastly different today from what it was 51 years ago when the United Nations was founded. Broadly speaking this is reflected in the following two ways.First  in addition to those States that were originallyexpected to assume primary responsibility forinternational peace and security  other States have newlyemerged with the capacity and the willingness to play aglobal role. Secondly  many States have in the meantimebecome independent  and today they represent a majorityin the international community  in which they havebecome important players.Particularly in the wake of the cold war  the SecurityCouncil is expected to play an even greater role in thearea of international peace and security. To meet suchexpectations  it is essential that it be reorganized to adaptto these two changes  thereby enhancing its legitimacyand effectiveness. This is the very essence of SecurityCouncil reform. It is with such a reformed andstrengthened Security Council that effective measures toresolve  for example  the frequent conflicts in regionssuch as Africa become possible.It is from this perspective that many States including my own  are advocating the expansion of bothpermanent and non-permanent membership. If the reformwere to result in an expansion of only the non-permanentmembership  the Council’s legitimacy and effectiveness6would not be enhanced and genuine reform to adapt to thechanging times would not have been accomplished.This year  under the leadership of former GeneralAssembly President Razali  discussions on Security Councilreform have gained greater momentum than ever before.Japan strongly urges that we seize this opportunity todecide on at least a framework for Security Council reformand reach an agreement on an outline for the realization ofconcrete reform by the end of the year. I should like toreiterate that Japan  with the endorsement of manycountries  is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as apermanent member of the Security Council in accordancewith its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use offorce  prohibited by its Constitution.I shall touch next on financial reform. Today a furtherretrenchment by the United Nations in the area of financeis required  and Japan regards highly the Secretary-General’s efforts towards this end. The Government ofJapan is itself currently pursuing drastic reform of itsfinancial structure  with the aim of bringing its financialdeficit below 3 per cent of gross domestic product by theyear 2003. It is also essential for the United Nations tosecure a solid financial basis for itself. In this regard  Iwould emphasize again that it is the obligation of MemberStates to pay their assessed contributions in full  and thatMember States in arrears should make every effort toeliminate them.It goes without saying that the expenses of theOrganization must be apportioned more equitably. Asregards the basis for calculating the scale of assessments Japan has advocated adopting the concept of “responsibilityto pay” to complement the present method  which is basedon the principle of “capacity to pay”. Japan’s assessment isabout to reach that of the United States  and it is alreadyalmost as great as the assessments of the other fourpermanent members combined. If Japan’s assessment wereto increase further out of proportion  with reform of theSecurity Council not yet realized  I must say there would bea problem with respect to the fairness of such a situation.Japan strongly hopes that the financial reform of the UnitedNations will proceed together with reforms in other areas asa whole in a balanced manner  and that agreement on anequitable scale of assessments can be achieved.The third point relates to reform in the area ofdevelopment. Development and peace are  so to speak  twosides of the same coin. Without development  the causes ofconflicts will not be eliminated  and without peace theconditions for development will not be met. Under itspresent Constitution  Japan has continued to attach greatimportance to contributing to international peace throughits active involvement in development issues andhumanitarian assistance efforts. Involvement indevelopment issues is a matter of priority for my country and its commitment to the development of developingcountries remains unchanged.Japan has been insisting that a “new developmentstrategy”  based on a genuine partnership betweendeveloped and developing countries  is particularlynecessary in this post-cold-war era. Consideration of theAgenda for Development has concluded recently. Webelieve it is important that the new philosophy  based onthe ownership of developing countries and on a genuinepartnership  be widely shared in the United Nations.Towards this end  in July of this year Japan held theOkinawa Conference on Development  and this month co-hosted with the Kingdom of the Netherlands theConference on the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development/Development AssistanceCommittee (OECD/DAC) Strategy “Shaping the Twenty-first Century: The Contribution of DevelopmentCooperation”. We are thus exploring ways of promotingand realizing this strategy. Through such efforts by Japan it is becoming widely recognized that South-Southcooperation  fortified with the new dimension oftriangular cooperation  is an important means ofpromoting this strategy.We regard the Secretary-General’s proposals toestablish a United Nations development group and toconsolidate United Nations offices at the country level tobe very worthwhile in terms of increasing efficiency.United Nations reform must not be a euphemism forbudget-cutting. From this point of view  Japan  with thesupport of many States  has been advocating the idea ofreinvesting in development programmes the savings thataccrue from reforms. We urge that this proposal  whichis reflected in the Secretary-General’s reform plan  bequickly implemented. In addition  Japan hopes that theyear 2001 will be designated as the International Year ofVolunteers in order to encourage more active participationin United Nations activities at the grass-roots level.Setting development on track and eradicating povertyin Africa are necessary for the fundamental solution ofthe conflicts that frequently occur in that region. Bearingthis in mind  Japan has been focusing its efforts onAfrican development issues. At Japan’s initiative  plansare under way to hold the second Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development (TICAD II) at the7ministerial level next year in Tokyo  following apreparatory meeting  also in Tokyo  at the senior-officiallevel in November of this year. We would like to ask theStates concerned to cooperate for the success of theseconferences and for the achievement of substantive progressin promoting African development.Ever since becoming a Member in 1956  Japan hasconsistently pursued a foreign policy that attachesimportance to the United Nations. Since January of thisyear  thanks to the support of many countries  Japan hasbeen serving its eighth term as a non-permanent member ofthe Security Council. It has been actively cooperating inUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and efforts for theprevention and settlement of regional conflicts. NextJanuary  Japan will convene the International Conference onPreventive Strategy  which Prime Minister RyutaroHashimoto proposed at the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. We anticipate thatconcrete proposals will be made at that conference as tohow cooperation between the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity  and the strengthening of thefunctions of the United Nations through such measures asreform of the Security Council  can contribute to theprevention and early resolution of conflicts in Africa. I amalso pleased to announce that next March Japan plans toconvene in Tokyo an international conference on thepresent situation and future prospects of United Nationspeacekeeping operations.Japan is also hosting the third session of theConference of the Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change in Kyoto this December todecide on international measures to prevent global warmingto be taken after the year 2000. Global warming is a criticalissue  with implications for the future of humankind  and itssolution will require the efforts of every country  includingdeveloping countries. Japan is sparing no effort to ensurethe success of this conference and its adoption of a protocolthat is meaningful  realistic and equitable  and I wouldearnestly ask for the cooperation of all participatingcountries.Next year we shall observe the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I expect theUnited Nations to further strengthen its role in the areas ofhuman rights and refugee and humanitarian assistance.Japan will also continue to contribute actively in theseareas.In addition  disarmament efforts  as well as the regimefor the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction must be further strengthened for the sake of world peaceand stability. Japan will also emphasize at this session theimportance of steady and cumulative efforts to takerealistic nuclear disarmament measures  aiming for aworld free of nuclear weapons. We will also participateactively in discussions on anti-personnel landmines  thereview of the United Nations Register of ConventionalArms and the question of small arms.The twenty-first century will arrive in less than fouryears. In order to make the next century brighter  theUnited Nations should reform itself to be ready for thenew era. If it is to do so  an agreement on the outline ofUnited Nations reform must be reached this year. Let usjoin forces to ensure that the world in the twenty-firstcentury is stable and prosperous. This will require that wegreet the twenty-first century with United Nations reformsachieved.I should like to conclude my statement by stressingthe profound importance of strengthening the UnitedNations — the only universal international Organization."
"85",3651,"KAZ",52,1997,"﻿First of all  I would like tocongratulate the President on his election to his high office which convincingly proves that the international prestige ofUkraine  one of the founders of the United Nations  iswidely recognized. For the current session  which is beingheld in the spirit of renewal of this world forum  it is verysymbolic.I also with to express our appreciation to the previousPresident  Mr. Razali Ismail  for his considerablecontribution to the successful work of the fifty-first sessionof the General Assembly.Kazakhstan believes that in the twenty-first century theUnited Nations should become a highly effective instrumentthat will help to make a smooth transition to realmultipolarity  establish global economic partnership anddemocratize international relations. For our part  we standready to contribute to the adoption within the UnitedNations of important decisions on the urgent issues oftoday.The Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hasundertaken to carry out a daunting mission of reformingthe Organization. Nothing could be harder than to live intimes of change; it is all the harder to be the maker of thechanges. This is why we are fully on the side of the manat the head of the United Nations  and we welcome hisinitiatives and his course of action. Kazakhstan supportsthe Secretary-General’s proposals regarding a moreefficient leadership and management structure  a newmanagement culture and structural transformations withinthe Organization.We support measures taken by the United Nations toensure sustainable development. In our view  the proposedUnited Nations Development Group deservesendorsement. At the same time  it is important to preservethe independence and the distinctiveness of the funds andprogrammes that are being consolidated  especially theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  a reputableorganization that is doing so much for the sake ofchildren  including its work in Kazakhstan.The financial crisis of the United Nations is anurgent issue demanding a solution. The programme ofreforms proposed by the Secretary-General provides formeasures to redress the situation in which theOrganization has found itself. There is no doubt that theimprovement of the financial situation of the UnitedNations depends on the fulfilment by Member States oftheir obligations to the Organization. Despite theeconomic difficulties of the transition period  Kazakhstanis trying to honour its financial obligations. At the sametime  we consider it imperative to further improve thescale of assessment on the basis of real ability to pay.Kazakhstan  as one of the States that have joined thesystem of stand-by arrangements  supports thestrengthening of the Organization’s capacity to carry outpreventive and peacekeeping activities. We welcome theSecretary-General’s proposals on the issues ofdisarmament and regulation of armaments  and wesupport his measures regarding human rights  organizedcrime  drugs and terrorism.Kazakhstan is ready to join in efforts to strengthenthe role of the General Assembly in dealing with burninginternational issues. Our country is in favour of conveninga special “Millennium Assembly” in the year 2000. Thisidea is in consonance with President Nursultan17Nazarbaev’s initiative to convene on the eve of the twenty-first century a special session of the General Assemblydevoted to reform.In our opinion  United Nations reforms should becarried out in an integrated manner  at different levels andin different directions. At the same time  it is impossible toignore that the key element of these reforms is the reformof the Security Council itself. Kazakhstan has repeatedlydeclared its support for Germany and Japan as candidatesfor permanent membership of the Council. Supporting theenlargement of the Council in both categories of itsmembers  we believe it is possible to include as itspermanent members representatives of the developingcountries of Asia  Africa and Latin America in order toensure a balance of interests and an adequate reflection ofexisting geopolitical realities. It is important to keep inmind  however  that to preserve the Security Council’sefficiency  the number of its members should be limited. Atthe same time  we think it is necessary to show properrespect and to pay attention to other proposals coming fromother States.Kazakhstan has on several occasions used this highrostrum to stress the need to strengthen the United Nationsactivities in the area of the environment. For our countrythese activities have special importance. For this reason addressing the nineteenth special session of the UnitedNations General Assembly last June  the President ofKazakhstan once again drew the attention of theinternational community to the acute environmentalproblems inherited by our country. I refer to ecologicaldisaster areas of the Aral Sea and the former Semipalatinsknuclear testing ground.The problem of the Aral Sea has a global dimension.Particles of salt sediments from this region have been foundin Europe  as well as in the Arctic Ocean. The Aral Searegion is witnessing a disastrous shortage of fresh water  aworsening of the population’s health and the degradation ofthe natural environment.Some 470 nuclear explosions have been conducted atthe Semipalatinsk testing ground  which used to be thelargest in the world. Enormous damage has been caused tothe health of the population and the natural environment.We believe that nuclear weapons represent a tragedy thataffects all the peoples of the world. With that in mind  ourHead of State has spoken about the responsibility of thenuclear Powers for the damage caused to the populationand the natural environment of the States where nucleartests were conducted. Such responsibility could beshouldered by setting up an international fund for therehabilitation of the health of the population and theenvironment of the regions affected by nuclear-weapontests.Our President’s decision to close the Semipalatinsktesting ground should be considered as a majorcontribution to nuclear disarmament of historicsignificance. This month Kazakhstan hosted aninternational conference on nuclear non-proliferation initiated by President Nazarbaev. Participants visited theformer testing ground and became further convinced ofthe need to assist Kazakhstan  which is overcoming theconsequences of nuclear tests conducted for more thanhalf a century.In this respect  the strengthening of environmentalsecurity has the highest priority for the region of CentralAsia. Accordingly  at a meeting held in Almaty lastFebruary  the Heads of the Central Asian States adopteda Declaration proclaiming 1998 a Year of EnvironmentalProtection in our region and highlighting the need toestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. Weare grateful to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis support for the idea of establishing such a zone  in hismessage addressed to the participants in the Semipalatinskconference.As a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty Kazakhstan is firmly committed to the non-proliferationregime  and considers it important to actively contributeto its further strengthening. Our State vigorously supportsthe objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. We believe that the signing of this document wasone of the most important and historic events of thiscentury  which is nearing its end. We call on all States toadhere to this Treaty.Recognizing the importance of a deep reduction inthe number of conventional weapons havingindiscriminate effects  Kazakhstan took a decision todeclare a moratorium  effective 6 August 1997  on theexport of anti-personnel mines  including the re-exportand transit thereof.Kazakhstan has taken consistent steps to strengthensecurity and stability at the regional level. NursultanNazarbaev’s initiative to convene a Conference onInteraction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia first put forward at the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly  is shaping up on the practical plane.We are planning to convene  in 1998  a meeting of18Foreign Ministers of interested States to discuss securityissues in Asia.The formation of a Central Asian battalion under theauspices of the United Nations has become a factor ofstability in the Central Asian region and provides clearevidence of the implementation of the proposal made byour Head of State. Recently  its first exercises weresuccessfully conducted in Kazakhstan.The signing of unique agreements betweenKazakhstan  Russia  Kyrgyzstan  Tajikistan and the People’sRepublic of China on confidence-building measures and thereduction of armed forces in the border region should beconsidered as a major achievement in the area ofinternational security.We note with satisfaction the signing in June of theGeneral Agreement on the Establishment of Peace andNational Accord in Tajikistan  which represents asignificant breakthrough in the settlement  under theauspices of the United Nations  of the longest-runningconflict among the post-Soviet countries. Kazakhstan is oneof the guarantors of the peace process in Tajikistan. Webelieve that all those concerned should ensure the adoptionof practical measures to facilitate the implementation of theagreements concluded  the delivery of internationalhumanitarian assistance and the reconstruction of thenational economy.We are seriously concerned by the continued armedconfrontation in Afghanistan. We in Kazakhstan areconvinced that peace in that country can be achievedthrough political negotiations  under the auspices of theUnited Nations  between all the parties involved in thisconflict in order to establish peace and form a Governmentof national unity in that country  which has suffered somuch.Kazakhstan  which is committed to the ideas ofrenewal  has firmly embarked on a course of economicreform and the democratization of social life. Reforms inour country have become irreversible. The privatization ofthe economy is being completed  the level of inflation hasbeen steadily low  the national currency is stable and liquid and for the first time in a little more than five years ofindependence we have registered economic growth.Kazakhstan is open to the outside world and offersconsiderable investment opportunities. Our State is leadingthe Commonwealth of Independent States in per capitaforeign investments. We strongly believe that very soonKazakhstan will firmly take its place in global integrationprocesses and become a fully fledged member of majoreconomic associations and organizations.We should like to express our appreciation to theUnited Nations for its support for President Nazarbaev’sproposal to create a joint body for Central Asia under tworegional Commissions  the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe (ECE) and the United NationsEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and thePacific (ESCAP). In a few days’ time  the heads of theseCommissions will come to our country. A special ECE-ESCAP programme for Central Asian States is underway. A joint office of the two organizations is to beopened in Almaty.I would like to make special mention of theactivities of the Economic Cooperation Organization(ECO). Seven new States  including Kazakhstan  joinedECO not very long ago. Nevertheless  the ECO memberStates have managed to reach promising levels ofcooperation and interaction. The declaration adopted atthe ECO summit last May provides an opportunity tocreate new transportation corridors and routes to transporthydrocarbons  and the ECO member States  as well asmany other countries in Asia and Europe  are equallyinterested in their development.How the Organization will look when it enters thetwenty-first century will depend on the decisions we takein the follow-up to our discussions of United Nationsreform. Years ago  an enormous internal capacity wasbuilt into the United Nations Charter. The United Nationswas designed for a world based on the principles ofpartnership and cooperation  not on all-out confrontation.Also important is the fact that the United Nations Charter which might be called an institutional pillar of theOrganization  is a highly balanced document  free of anyvisible bias in one direction or another  and this hasallowed it to become  one might say  a code of moderninternational relations that no civilized State has any rightto ignore. The decisions that are being taken should be asbalanced as possible and should not amount to stop-gapand ad hoc measures. That is one of the main demandswith regard to United Nations reform.The United Nations should come out of the reformprocess renewed  more effective and more efficient."
"86",3698,"KEN",52,1997,"﻿Allow me  at the outset  toconvey to you  Sir  on behalf of my delegation  my warmcongratulations on your election as the President of thefifty-second session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. I am confident that your work will meet withgreat success throughout the session  particularly in guidingus in the task of reforming and restructuring the UnitedNations in preparation for the challenges ahead.I would like to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail  Permanent Representative ofMalaysia  for the excellent manner in which he conductedour deliberations during the previous session.I also take this opportunity to commend theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his vision anddevotion to the service of the United Nations.The creation of the United Nations by the foundingfathers was a courageous decision. Although theirobjectives are yet to be fully realized  Kenya is convincedthat they are still valid  and we remain fully committed totheir achievement. The world has undergone tremendoustransformation since the signing of the United NationsCharter in San Francisco 52 years ago. We havewitnessed the end of the East-West military and politicalrivalry  which at times crippled decision-making in theUnited Nations system. New opportunities have emergedand the role of the United Nations has diversified  withthe international community placing greater expectationson the Organization.Under the able leadership of His ExcellencyPresident Daniel T. arap Moi  Kenya has undertaken boldpolitical and economic reforms whose benefits we arebeginning to realize. We are committed and determinedto continue forging national unity to enhance the processof democratization and socio-economic development.It is against this background that I wish to addresssome of the issues contained in the agenda of this session.In recapping the events of the past years  we notethat the United Nations has made efforts to secureinternational peace and security. We regret that the peacedividend expected after the cold war has not materialized.Instead  the total volume of assistance to developingcountries has declined  and the scourge of conflicts invarious parts of the world  and in Africa in particular  hasrevealed the frightening proportions of ethnic andnationalistic hostilities and humanitarian crises. Intra-Stateconflicts have torn some of our nations apart  as theypose threats to security  social cohesion and economicprogress.Some of these conflicts have proved difficult toprevent  manage or resolve. They have caused diversionof resources from developmental purposes to non-productive use. Kenya believes in the peaceful resolutionof conflicts and encourages the settlement of disputesthrough negotiations  mediation  conciliation andarbitration as opposed to use of force. His ExcellencyPresident Daniel T. arap Moi  along with other leaders inAfrica  has spent considerable time and resourcescoordinating peace initiatives in southern Sudan  Somalia 14Burundi  Rwanda and the former Zaire  among other places.We are happy to report that the stalled peace processconcerning the conflict in southern Sudan was re-energizedfollowing the extraordinary Summit of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) heldin Nairobi on 8 and 9 July 1997  at which the SudaneseGovernment accepted the Declaration of Principles  whichcalls on all factions to work together. In addition  duringthe IGAD Ministerial meeting held in Nairobi on 22September 1997  the parties to the conflict agreed on 28October 1997 as the date for the next meeting. Kenyabelieves that the parties must have the courage and politicalwill to negotiate in good faith. It is equally important forthe international community to actively support this processby making financial resources available as well as byexerting pressure on all the parties to rededicate themselvesto finding a lasting solution to the conflict. We pay tributeto the IGAD Partnership Forum for its supportive role vis-à-vis the IGAD initiative.The prolonged conflict in Somalia remains a matter ofgreat concern to Kenya. The continued absence of thatsisterly State among the family of nations is indeedregrettable. We maintain that reconciliation of the warringfactions is critical to finding a just  lasting andcomprehensive peace settlement to the conflict. Theinternational community  in particular the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development  the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the United Nations  has an important rolein assisting in the process of reconciliation.The crisis in the Republic of Congo is similarly amatter of grave concern to Kenya. We are concerned thatthree months have elapsed since the President of Gabon Omar Bongo  called upon the Security Council to deploy aUnited Nations force to assist in normalizing the situationin that country. We wish to reiterate the OAU positionstated at the recent Security Council ministerial meeting —namely  that there is a need for urgent intervention by theUnited Nations.Likewise  the situation in Burundi is also of concernto my country. We support the efforts by Mwalimu JuliusNyerere to find a negotiated solution to the problem in thatcountry. We urge President Pierre Buyoya to take intoaccount the concerns of the subregion and the internationalcommunity in general and work towards a negotiatedsettlement.Kenya wishes to reiterate the position taken on theconflict in Sierra Leone by the thirty-third session of theOAU Conference of Heads of State and Government  heldin Harare  Zimbabwe  in June 1997  that the internationalcommunity desist from recognizing the military junta. Wesupport the efforts by the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) in the search for a solution tothe crisis in that country and urge the junta to returnSierra Leone to constitutional rule. We are convinced thatquick and effective action by the international communityis necessary  as underscored by President Tejan Kabbahduring his intervention before the Assembly on 1 Octoberlast.My Government is also concerned with the politicaldevelopments in the Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros. We support the efforts by the Organization ofAfrican Unity aimed at bringing the Government andother parties together with a view to seeking a solution tothe problem. We urge the people of the Comoros to worktowards maintaining the sovereignty  national unity andintegrity of their country.Kenya has been involved in the peace process inAngola since 1975. We are encouraged by the progressthat has been made towards finding a peaceful solution tothe prolonged crisis in that country. However  we wish toreiterate the need for both parties  in particular UNITA to cooperate fully in the implementation of the LusakaProtocol  the agreed framework for peace in Angola. Atthis point in time  any alternative will only hurt thepeople of Angola.On a positive note  we are encouraged by thecooperation between the United Nations and ECOWASthat enabled Liberia to hold successful elections  won byPresident Taylor. In this regard  we commend the effortsof ECOWAS  the international community and theLiberian people for the manner in which the electionswere concluded. We wish Liberia success in the difficulttask of reconstruction and post-conflict peace-building.Kenya believes that a continued United Nationspresence and focused support of the internationalcommunity are critical in the rehabilitation andreconstruction of Liberia  including the repatriation andreintegration of refugees. We welcome the Secretary-General’s intention to establish a peace-building supportoffice in Monrovia upon the termination of the mandateof the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia(UNOMIL). We are convinced that this will assist thenew Government in its efforts to rebuild Liberia’seconomy and contribute towards the promotion of peaceand stability in the region.15Kenya welcomes the recent movements towards theresumption of negotiations by the parties to the conflict inthe Middle East. We wish to urge them to honour in goodfaith the Oslo agreements they have entered into and torefrain from activities that have the potential ofundermining the peace process. There is a need for theGovernment of Israel and the Palestinian Authority toresume dialogue in order to resolve all outstanding issues.Kenya will continue to support the parties in their searchfor a just  durable and comprehensive peace.We also welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative inCyprus and the efforts of the international community tobring the parties to the negotiating table. In this respect  weapplaud the face-to-face intercommunal talks held inSwitzerland on 11 August last. The world would like to seeboth the Greek and Turkish Cypriots resolve their problemof more than two decades. There is therefore a need tointensify efforts to find a durable solution to that problem.We call upon the international community to also supportthe talks by exerting pressure on both sides and to refrainfrom activities that might be seen as impeding the peaceprocess.The humanitarian emergencies accompanying theseconflicts require an urgent response from the internationalcommunity. Thousands of people are affected in one wayor another. Refugees and displaced persons are experiencingvarying degrees of suffering on a daily basis. Whilereiterating our support for the work of the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Refugees and of the internationalcommunity  we feel that it is vital to enhance closercoordination and cooperation between all actors to facilitatethe complementarity of efforts.We are committed to the promotion of universalhumanitarian principles and international humanitarian law.Kenya  indeed  has been host to thousands of refugees fromour region. We have stretched our meagre resources toaccommodate the refugees but regret that some of themhave abused our hospitality and caused problems ofinsecurity in our own country. We urge the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees to work closely with theGovernment of Kenya in monitoring and verifying thegenuineness of the refugees in order to address thisproblem.Kenya and other African countries have contributedtroops to various United Nations peacekeeping missionsworldwide. We view the reluctance by the internationalcommunity to support operations in Africa as a departurefrom the Charter responsibilities of the United Nations. Werecognize that concerted efforts by the countries affectedand others in the region are necessary in the settlement ofconflicts. The involvement of regional organizations in theprevention  management and resolution of conflicts shouldtherefore not entail any derogation of the responsibilitiesof the United Nations. We wish to reaffirm that the roleof peacekeeping and peace enforcement throughout theworld must remain the responsibility of the UnitedNations and in particular of the Security Council  inaccordance with the Charter. In this respect  Africaexpects to see swift handling of the conflict in the Congo(Brazzaville)  in much the same way as was the case inthe Balkans.My country welcomes the results of the OsloDiplomatic Conference on an International Total Ban onAnti-Personnel Landmines. This constitutes a significantcontribution to the realization of ending the use ofweapons that have wreaked havoc in many parts of theworld. Kenya commends the international community forits efforts to bring to an end the use of these deadlyweapons.A prominent feature in recent years has been theincreasing globalization of the world economy. Althoughthe global economy continues to show modest growth with the highest performance being experienced in EastAsia  Africa’s economy still lags behind. The continentremains highly vulnerable to adverse internationaleconomic policies and natural calamities due to its limitedcapacity to respond. The economy is characterized bypoverty and underdevelopment. The per capita incomesare the lowest in the world  and most of the countries areunable to feed their growing population. At the sametime  the marginalization of the continent continues  withunsustainable external debt being a major factor.We welcome the measures taken by the internationalcommunity at the bilateral and multilateral levels tomitigate the debt burden. It is evident  however  thatAfrica’s indebtedness continues to be a major constraintin the economic development of the continent despiteefforts by many countries to implement economicreforms. These efforts have not met with adequatebilateral and multilateral financial support  resulting inlimited prospects for economic growth. We underscorethat the reduction or cancellation of both the bilateral andmultilateral debt of the heavily indebted countries needsserious consideration. Kenya urges the internationalcommunity to seriously address the external debt crisis.16In addition  we regret that the agreed officialdevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent has not beenmet by most donor countries but has  as a matter of fact declined to approximately 0.25 per cent. Hence  theimplementation of the United Nations Agenda forDevelopment should address all these issues and placeAfrica in its proper perspective. We appeal to theindustrialized countries to reverse the declining trend inofficial development assistance and to honour theircommitments by attaining the agreed target. Kenya believesthat to achieve good results  development must be people-oriented and involve all actors  with emphasis on humanresource development  application of science andtechnology  and the creation of employment and income-generating opportunities.Africa has abundant human and natural resources which  if properly harnessed  could generate wealth for thepeople of the continent. Kenya is committed to thepromotion of South-South cooperation and urges thatnecessary measures be taken to ensure effectivecollaboration. In this regard  Kenya and other countries ofthe region are promoting regional cooperation in order tointegrate our economies in the long run. We wish to appealto our partners to complement these efforts by intensifyingtechnical and financial support. We underscore that withoutsocial and economic progress it is difficult to achievepeace.The liberalization of trade regimes and the promotionof an open and secure multilateral trading system are vitalrequirements for the acceleration of economic development.As a member of the World Trade Organization  Kenya iscommitted to the liberalization of both trade and investmentregimes. In this regard  unilateral protectionist actions which are inconsistent with multilateral trade agreements should not be allowed to interfere with these arrangements.Kenya is committed to the implementation of theoutcomes of the various United Nations conferences  suchas the Rio United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the Cairo International Conference onPopulation and Development  the Copenhagen WorldSummit for Social Development  the Beijing Fourth WorldConference on Women  the Istanbul United NationsConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) and theRome World Food Summit  among others. We aredisappointed that the outcome of these conferences has toa large extent remained unimplemented. In the course ofimplementing Agenda 21  my country has initiatedinnovative steps to protect and preserve the ecosystem.These include public awareness programmes  environmentaleducation and the Great Rift Valley ConservancyProgramme  which ensures integrated utilization of land.We urge the international community to honour theircommitments by making available new and additionalresources for the attainment of the intended objectives.As the United Nations continues to introducemeasures to ensure reduction of waste  it is imperativethat the Organization ensure maximal and rational use ofthe existing facilities within the United Nations system.As host to the only United Nations headquarters in thedeveloping world  we are concerned that the facilities atthe Nairobi offices are underutilized. In this regard Kenya wishes to see maximal utilization of the facilitiesavailable in Nairobi  the headquarters of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and of theUnited Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).We therefore wish to urge that General Assemblyresolutions requiring meetings to be held at theirrespective headquarters should  to the extent possible  beadhered to.We are further concerned that both UNEP andHabitat suffer from inadequate funding despite theirenormous potential. We note that these two UnitedNations bodies need to be strengthened by streamliningtheir administrative and financial management. Above all they require adequate and predictable financial resourcesfrom all sources in order to fulfil their mandates. In thiscontext  we would like to request the Secretary-Generalto expedite the implementation of measures expected torevitalize the two institutions. In addition  we wish toappeal to the donor community to honour their financialcommitments and release any blocked funds to enhancethe effective operation of UNEP and Habitat. Kenya willcontinue to ensure that the United Nations offices inNairobi operate in a smooth environment.The challenges facing the Organization in the nextmillennium are many and complex. It is imperative thatthe Organization be restructured to enable it respondadequately to new priorities and challenges. In thisrespect  we wish to commend the Secretary-General forunveiling reform measures and proposals that will formthe basis of our discussion. We urge the Secretary-General to speedily implement measures within hismandate to reduce waste and ensure effective utilizationof existing facilities and better coordination andcooperation within the United Nations.Kenya is committed to the reform of the UnitedNations and will continue to participate actively in the17debate. We expect that the reforms will be carried out withtransparency  and in full compliance with the democraticprinciples and purposes of the Charter. In our view  theOrganization requires not radical transformation but ratherthe strengthening and modification of its structures andorgans to enhance its effectiveness.In reforming the United Nations  it is of paramountimportance for Member States to recognize that unpaidcontributions constitute a major obstacle to the effectivenessof the Organization. We are concerned that the UnitedNations is facing a financial crisis which is due basically toMember States not honouring their Charter obligations. Forthe United Nations to fulfil its mandate effectively  there isneed for stable  predictable and adequate financing. Wetherefore urge Member States to take concrete action toclear their arrears without conditionalities. Furthermore adjustment of the scale of assessments ought to be theresult of a collective decision to redistribute the financialburden while bearing in mind the principle of capacity topay.Kenya considers that the Security Council should bereformed to make it possible to achieve transparency accountability  democratization and balanced regionalrepresentation. We reaffirm the position of the Organizationof African Unity calling for the enlargement of the Councilin both categories of membership to a total of 26 seats. Wereiterate that Africa should be allocated at least twopermanent and five non-permanent seats in the reformedCouncil.We also support reforms in the economic and socialfields which should enhance complementarity and bettercoordination of the activities of the Council. The Economicand Social Council should assume effective coordination ofinternational policies and the activities of the specializedagencies. Further  it should ensure mobilization of resourcesfor the operational activities which are critical for theachievement of socio-economic development. We areconvinced that strengthening and revitalizing the functionsof the Economic and Social Council will acceleratedevelopment  particularly in the areas of poverty alleviation environment degradation  health and humanitarianassistance  among other areas.I should like to conclude my statement by reaffirmingKenya’s readiness to support measures that will strengthenthe United Nations and turn it into a more focused andintegrated Organization able to steer humanity into the nextmillennium. Let us all strive to make the Organization moreeffective in serving mankind in the years to come. We aredetermined to make our contribution."
"87",3722,"KGZ",52,1997,"﻿Allow me  on behalf of the Government of theKyrgyz Republic and its people  to congratulate mycolleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Mr. Udovenko  on his election to the high office ofPresident of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly  and to wish him success in his endeavours. MayI also express our feelings of respect for his country  whichis playing an important role in resolving regional and globalissues.I would also like to express our heartfelt gratitude tothe previous President of the General Assembly  therepresentative of the friendly Malaysian people Ambassador Razali Ismail  for his active and dynamicefforts in establishing constructive dialogue on ways toreform the United Nations.Like the entire international community  Kyrgyzstanexpects genuine progress regarding the complex issue ofthe reform of the United Nations to come out of thepresent session. We are confident that the session will beable to cope with the problems facing the Organizationtoday during this difficult and complicated period. ThePresident and the Government of my country fullysupport the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations and his ability to respond sensitively and adequately tothe challenges of a rapidly changing world. We areconfident that a renewed United Nations will trulyembody the principles and purposes proclaimed in itsCharter  ensuring the harmony of the interests of all itsMembers in the name of peace and progress. We areready to support all proposals that promote that goal.Regarding the reform of the Security Council  theissue of improving its methods of work is no lessimportant than the question of enlarging its membership.Kyrgyzstan believes that these questions must beconsidered together. We continue to support the proposalfor permanent membership in the Council for Japan andGermany. However  in our view  the permanent membersof the Security Council should also include onerepresentative each from Africa  Asia and Latin America.Mankind is now on the eve of a new millennium and the changes taking place are altering the image ofmankind and shifting the emphasis in the models forunderstanding and explaining our world. The collapse ofa bipolar world has provided us an opportunity to focusefforts on resolving the issues of poverty  health care education  economic development and democracy. We areall  however  still facing the threat of local and regionalconflicts  international terrorism  organized crime  illegaltrafficking in drugs and weapons  the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and the deterioration of thestate of the environment. All these negative aspects ofhuman activity threaten the global trend towardsstrengthening peace and progress  undermine the fragilenew democracies  wear down the strength of thedeveloping countries and generally threaten all our effortsfocused on building a safer and better world.The period after the achievement of independencewas decisive for Kyrgyzstan  in the context of theformation of national statehood and of new social andeconomic ties. The country is actively seeking ways andmeans to harmoniously integrate itself into theinternational community. Clear successes have alreadybeen achieved on this thorny path in strengthening10democratic institutions  radical reform of the economy ofthe country  improving the means for achieving inter-ethnicagreement  enhancing tolerance and ensuring human rights.The leadership of the country is also concentrating onthose domestic and international issues which must bedeveloped on a permanent and positive basis for the well-being of the population of Kyrgyzstan.Our country was the first of the newly independentStates to draw up and adopt a national plan of action forenvironmental protection. In the light of the implementationof the decisions of the Rio Conference  Kyrgyzstan is nowcarrying out a country project  Capacity 21  which consistsof three major components: coordination of and carryingout ecological studies  stable management of waterresources and economic growth and social development.Through an edict of President Akayev  a national strategyhas been adopted for sustainable human development whichrecognizes man  and his harmonious existence with nature as the highest priority. Kyrgyzstan was the first country inthe region to draw up a “concept for ecological security”.The Declaration adopted by the conference in Rioranks mountainous ecological systems among thoseparticularly vulnerable to natural and man-made impacts. Itis universally recognized that peoples living in mountainousregions bear far heavier social and economic burdens thanthose who live in plains.In the light of these factors and circumstances and alsoon the basis of the decisions of the Global EnvironmentFacility  our country held an international conference onproblems of mountain ecosystems. The participants in theconference put forward a proposal to proclaim aninternational year of the mountains  a proposal which wasactively supported by President Akayev in his message tothe delegates to the mountain forum and in his letter to theSecretary-General of the United Nations.At the regular session of the Economic and SocialCouncil in July this year  in Geneva  a resolutionproclaiming International Year of Mountains  sponsored by44 countries  was adopted by consensus. The resolutioncontains a request to the Secretary-General to present to theregular session of the Economic and Social Council in1998  after consultations with Governments and with therelevant international  regional and non-governmentalorganizations  a report on the desirability of proclaiming theInternational Year of Mountains and other measures toensure the sustainable development of mountainouscountries.I would like to take this opportunity to appeal toGovernments and  above all  to the other sponsors tosubmit the relevant information for incorporation into acomplete and comprehensive report on this question bythe Secretary-General. I hope the General Assembly willin turn adopt a consensus decision on this initiative.At the same time  we believe that it is possible  withsupport from Governments  to raise the question ofdrawing up a global programme of action to ensure thesustainable development of countries with mountainousregions  similar to the programme being carried out forsmall island developing countries.There can be no doubt that the economic gapbetween the rich developed countries and the developingworld has widened over recent years. The poorestcountries are not in a position to take off economically orsocially and are continuing to lose the ties that enablethem to participate in the world economy. We can assumethat if this trend continues  their numbers will continue togrow  and this represents a serious threat to all humandevelopment. We need to halt that trend. In this context in the view of the experts  the most promising approachesare to increase investments in human resources toencourage the implementation of ecologically clean andeffective technologies and to reform price structures.In our view  it is precisely in these areas that UnitedNations activities  in new conditions  should be steppedup in order to promote economic and social progress. Wesupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to promotestable and sustainable development.Supporting peace and security is the highest prioritytask of the United Nations. We place great store by theUnited Nations peacekeeping activities and pay duetribute to the courage and selflessness of United Nationspersonnel working in regions of conflict. The efforts ofthe United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Gerd Merrem  and the CollectivePeacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS)  culminated successfully inMoscow on 27 June 1997 with the signing of the GeneralAgreement on the Establishment of Peace and NationalAccord in Tajikistan  which opened the way for thecountry’s transition from war to reconstruction andrehabilitation.As a representative of one of the States that is aguarantor of peace in Tajikistan  I am gratified to note my11country’s involvement in this event. The mediation effortsof Kyrgyzstan  and of President Akayev himself  helpedbring about the important agreement in May this year thatlaid the way for the General Agreement  namely  thesigning of the Protocol on Political Questions. However  asthe events in August demonstrated  peace in Tajikistan isstill extremely fragile and its survival depends  first andforemost  on the Tajik parties themselves and how faithfulthey are to the commitments they have made. We areconvinced that our Tajik friends will be able to see thisthrough.The prospects for peace-building in Tajikistan dependto a significant extent on the situation along the Tajik-Afghan border. The armed conflict in Afghanistan is of thegreatest concern to the States of the Central Asian region;it fosters the illegal production and trafficking of drugs andis prompting the massive flow of refugees to neighbouringcountries. The President and Government of Kyrgyzstan arefirmly convinced that there can be only one solution to theAfghan conflict  namely  a political solution. The problemcan be solved with the political will of the Afghan partiesabove all and assistance from neighbouring States that havean influence in the region.We have not abandoned hope regarding theorganization of direct inter-Afghan negotiations under theauspices of the United Nations to discuss conditions for aceasefire and subsequent measures to bring about nationalreconciliation. In November 1996  President Akayev putforward an initiative to hold these negotiations in Bishkek.Subsequently  this proposal was repeated at meetings inNew York of top officials and experts on Afghanistan.Building on this initiative  in August the President ofKyrgyzstan appealed to the parties to the conflict and Headsof State and Government concerned.Kyrgyzstan  which does not share a border withAfghanistan and has no interest aside from ensuringregional security  considers the organization of inter-Afghannegotiations under United Nations auspices an integral partof its peaceful policy of good-neighbourly relations andcooperation. Kyrgyzstan is ready to play the impartial roleof mediator and make its good offices available to ensurea peaceful settlement of this problem.Pursuant to its peaceful policy  Kyrgyzstan has beenactively promoting in the United Nations since 1995 theidea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in CentralAsia  as reflected in a number of working papers of the1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the Preparatory Committee of the Conference of Partiesto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons to be held in the year 2000 and theDisarmament Commission. We are firmly convinced thatthe creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  which is animportant confidence-building measure and a positivebackdrop to the disarmament process  is helpingstrengthen peace and security in the region and  in thefinal analysis  throughout the world.With the entry into force of the Treaties of Pelindabaand Bangkok  more than 1.7 billion people will be livingin zones free of nuclear weapons. Together withAntarctica  this territory will cover practically the entiresouthern hemisphere. It is essential that we do all we canto support and promote the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. Here  above all  we are hoping for theunderstanding and support of nuclear-weapon States. Atthe international conference this September on theestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  held inTashkent  Kyrgyzstan proposed the convening of anadvisory meeting of the five Central Asian States  the fivenuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of theSecurity Council  and representatives of the UnitedNations to discuss practical measures to make this idea areality. The conference approved the proposal.Kyrgyzstan is actively participating in peacekeepingactivities. The Collective Peacekeeping Forces of CIS inTajikistan includes one of our battalions. Kyrgyz militarypersonnel in the Central Asian peacekeeping battaliontook part in the joint exercises held within the frameworkof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)programme Partnership for Peace. Kyrgyzstan is also amember of the United Nations Special Committee onPeacekeeping Operations. We are also interested intraining an international peace force  military observersand civilian personnel so that they can participate inpeacekeeping operations. I would like to take advantageof this opportunity to ask the United Nations and thedonor countries to give us as much assistance as possiblein this area.In conclusion  I should like to say that this is adecisive session for the United Nations. I should like toexpress the hope that the interests of individual countriesand regions can be reconciled and that they will notprevail over responsibility for the fate of our commonOrganization. On this positive note  I should like to endmy statement.12"
"88",3810,"KNA",52,1997,"﻿The fifty-second anniversary of the United Nations is yet anotherhistoric moment for us all. Our shared presence here isevidence that as Members of this great institution we havean opportunity to realize our collective aspirations andexpectations. It is necessary therefore for the Organizationto ensure that the concerns of Member States  particularlythose in the developing world  are not compromised orseen as secondary to the process.It is essential that the United Nations become acatalyst for improving the quality of life of our citizensand a champion of our fundamental rights and freedoms.Such challenges will require much commitment andstrategic thinking. I believe that if we succeed we willhave laid the foundation for peace and internationalsecurity for generations to come.With our nations and peoples standing at thecrossroads of tremendous change  and with heightenedexpectations in the fields of human development andpoverty eradication  the United Nations must be allowed toassume an even greater role. Saint Kitts and Nevismaintains that the United Nations has the necessaryinstitutional capacity to encompass our collective ambitionsand simultaneously to resolve many of the problems facingnation-States.In the light of the fundamental importance which myGovernment attaches to a reformed  more functional UnitedNations  we welcome the appointment of His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General. His commitment toand wide experience in this institution will help provide theUnited Nations with the crucial leadership it needs at thiscritical juncture in the Organization s history.As we march into a new millennium  with itsincreasing uncertainties and complexities  the UnitedNations and its membership will have to recommitthemselves to human development in all its facets.Otherwise we will have failed in this decade to accomplishour mandate of poverty eradication.The growing reduction in much-needed aid andtechnical assistance to the developing world threatens thefurther marginalization of our poor countries. This meansthat countries will grow to depend more on the UnitedNations. We therefore urge the United Nations to workmore closely with developing countries to devise new ideasand pragmatic approaches to improve the standard of livingof the world's poor. This reality  we think  lends greaterurgency to the Secretary-General's proposals for reform. Inthis regard  the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevisencourages wide discussion of the extensive and far-reaching reform proposals with the aim of arriving atconsensus.We believe that it is vital to restructure andconsolidate some of the different areas of services that theUnited Nations provides. However this must herald realchange and increased benefit for Member States. We cannotsupport a mere transfer of resources from one organ toanother without proper safeguards to ensure efficiency andaccountability. In the same vein  we hope that developmentreforms will not sacrifice the effectiveness anddistinctiveness of existing organs. In order for thedeveloping world to achieve sustainable growth  we needthe expertise  we need the resources and we need theinstitutional capabilities of existing United Nations fundsand programmes.As we work towards greater efficiency in themanagement and administration of services  it isimportant not to undermine positive past achievements.Member States must refrain from marryingconditionalities to the process of reform  especially whenthese very conditionalities hinder substantial progress inthe reform process itself. Saint Kitts and Nevis thereforesuggests that in order for reforms to work they must ofnecessity balance and protect the interests of MemberStates  not simply appear to reward or benefit a privilegedfew. Reform is not about creating mechanisms thatmerely restructure the obligations of States to theOrganization. Reform should not be used as anopportunity to compensate current economic strength.Decisions on permanent and non-permanent membership as part of the reform process  should be the result of aprocess of debate and consensus-building.My delegation expects to see greater emphasis ongeographic representation and on correcting oldinequalities that continue to plague us today. Saint Kittsand Nevis appeals to all States to be careful not toconfuse the need for genuine systemic reforms withlegally assessed financial obligations to the Organization.Nations demanding reform should also be willing toreform incongruous attitudes and perceptions of theUnited Nations. We must honour all our responsibilitiesto the Organization. Progress will require that we all workmore closely together to confront the multitude ofcomplicated problems  old and new.To this end  let us challenge ourselves to findcommon ground and assist the United Nations indeveloping the appropriate ideas and strategies thatpromote our common agenda. This may not be easy;hence the Organization will need to establish a mutuallybeneficial relationship between policy makers inGovernment and the business community.On this note  I should like to acknowledge themagnificent contribution of Mr. Ted Turner to thisOrganization. He has shown himself to be an exceptionalinternational citizen. We trust that this humanitariangesture of support for the Organization and its work willmake a noticeable impact on the areas designated  andthat it will challenge others of like mind to demonstratetheir support for the Organization as well.This show of support is a reminder that only theUnited Nations can provide the kind of impartial andcomprehensive leadership that Member States want. Onlythe United Nations  with 50 years of successes and2failures as a world institution  has the unique experience todevelop essential capabilities to serve its membership. TheUnited Nations has the competitive edge. A United Nationsreformed to deal with the modern challenges of a modernera can work  but only if it is allowed to work.I appreciate well the power of national imperatives andindividualism. I also understand well the concerns aboutsupranational institutions. Nevertheless  we have come toofar to surrender our global destiny to fear andmisconceptions.When we speak of the development of the humanperson yet fail to appreciate that economic rights are asfundamental to human dignity as are human rights  we dogreat disservice to the cause of human rights. However when we acknowledge these rights then we give moresubstance to social stability and the process of truedemocracy.Democracy is not new to the Caribbean region. It is away of life  a tradition for our region. We see it as the mostpractical and useful system of government to advance ourpeople. However  democracy is not simply aboutinstitutions or processes. It is about creating an enablinggovernment and an enabling environment in which theordinary person — the impoverished  the disillusioned  theeducated and the rich — feels included and feels that he orshe can participate in the decision-making process and feelsthat his or her dreams can be truly realized.Because we regard democracy as the most efficientand viable vehicle for sustainable human development  itmust deliver and be seen to deliver. The people must bereassured that they can and indeed will rise from thequicksand of poverty through the promise of development.If we fail to deliver on the promise  then democracy willfail. If democracy fails  poverty becomes entrenched andchaos becomes inevitable.The condition of poverty has for too long been linkedwith the destiny of small States. The apparent ease withwhich both are dismissed is a source of grave concern tothe Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.Too little attention is being paid to the economic hardships political disruptions and social dislocations which we areforced to endure as small developing States. Instead ofseeing crucial support from the developed world  we arewitnessing increased tendencies towards isolationism andneglect.In the current wave of globalization  economicstability has become the soft underbelly of Caribbeansecurity  democracy and prospects for sustainabledevelopment. If these economies are not strengthened andgiven appropriate assistance  one lays waste to thetremendous intellectual talents in these countries andexposes the political and social fabric to the nefariousforces that lurk in the region.Our small countries need institutional support andpartnership to help in preparing our youth to adapt theirknowledge and skills to changing world circumstances.Such preparation will help make them self-sufficient andmore responsive to the unpredictable changes taking placearound us.Additionally  we must create jobs on a continuousbasis to inspire our young people and put life's basicneeds within reach of their parents. We must not overlookthe crucial link between economic growth and long-termpolitical and social stability. Sustainable development inthe Caribbean is in everyone's best interest.My Government does not subscribe to conspiracytheories  but it is acutely aware of the ease with which wecan all fall victim to the conspiracy of silence and theconspiracy of neglect. Our economies are under siege; ourway of life is threatened; the growth of our countries andpeople is undermined by forces which are better able toexploit globalization and trade liberalization.No one in good faith can accuse us of complacency.Our countries have worked hard to keep pace with currenteconomic trends. We have tightened fiscal and monetarypolicies  and we are monitoring them very closely. Wehave run the gauntlet of social and economic measuressupposedly structured to ensure the economic growth andsurvival of our various economies.The road we have travelled has been a difficult one and we have learned valuable lessons. Still  we continueto suffer exclusion from developed countries' markets forour various products. As a direct consequence  the privatesector has become sceptical of its very survival andprofitability.Our banana-producing countries in the region havesuffered a tremendous and potentially devastating blow inthe wake of the recent panel ruling of the World TradeOrganization (WT0) on the banana regime of the African Caribbean and Pacific group of States (ACP). It isinconceivable that the insignificant but important3percentage in access that ACP countries share in thismarket can pose any meaningful threat to the collaborativeinterests of multinational producers.Our banana and sugar industries are major employersand foreign exchange earners; yet  without regard for oursurvival  they are being challenged with the ultimateobjective of dismantling them completely. At the sametime  we still do not have ready access to essentialtechnologies vital to making our industries and humanresources more competitive and more efficient.We contend that trade liberalization  without theproper mechanisms to protect the small and the weak  doesnot promote fair trade. Where is the fairness of fair trade?How  therefore  will our small island developing States findnew and sustainable ways to respond to the growing needsof our population? How will we be able to stem the braindrain  the migration of human resources searching for abetter standard of living?Our countries have undertaken to diversify oureconomies despite the obvious dislocations within oursocieties. We remain committed to democratic institutions and we continuously allocate scarce resources to humandevelopment. Our Governments in the Caribbean have beenworking more closely with the private sector as truepartners in development. We have enacted legislation tofacilitate increased investment opportunities and toencourage foreign direct investment and domestic savings.Nonetheless  with every step we seem to fall prey tothe perpetual and constantly evolving demands for moreextensive changes without any regard for the effects on ourcountries and our people. Globalization  with its insatiableappetite  and the ravenous forces of unrestricted free marketand trade liberalization are forever famished. Why must therules which are always in a state of constant flux be to thedetriment of small resource-poor States?In the coming years  not only will we still bestruggling to combat poverty  but the concepts ofsovereignty and governance will also be seriouslychallenged as we endeavour to cope with the compleximplications of forces that face our societies and menaceour democracies. The transnational nature of information of capital  of labour and of technological advances will notspare our tiny countries the trying consequences unleashedby globalization.Despite these difficulties  Saint Kitts and Nevis willnot become a nation of mendicants. We will give priorityto the right of our citizens to economic well-being. Forwhat good would it do if our people achieve their humanright to exist but are denied the right to live dignifiedlives?The Labour Government of Saint Kitts and Nevishas undertaken to build 1 000 new  affordable homes bythe end of this century. We believe that all our citizenshave the right to live in dignity and to have access to thebasic necessities of life. We have already turned over 100new houses  and by the end of this year we expect 300families to be moving into new homes in Saint Kitts andNevis. This is the commitment of the Government ofSaint Kitts and Nevis to the development of its citizens.I have said in the past  and I maintain now  that wemust abandon the practice of using gross national productper capita to measure standards of living for people in thedeveloping world. How can the developed world andmultilateral agencies deny assistance to countries on thebasis that such a country has reached this artificialthreshold? Are people in the developing world not entitledto a higher standard of living  or must they alwaysstraddle the boundaries of poverty and exist only at levelswhich the developed world considers acceptable indicatorsof human progress?It is important for us to dedicate our energies to thelogic of prevention. In Saint Kitts and Nevis we believestrongly that prevention is better than cure. We believe inenabling our peoples to have a life free of poverty anddespair. The Secretary-General has called for greaterefficiency in management  greater resource mobilizationand redeployment of potential savings to the developmentfields. This is long overdue.It is also the duty of Member States to ensure thatnew resources are targeted at development. Such aprocess will have to be guided by and nourished withvision  political will and an appreciation of the globalimperatives of sustainable development and povertyeradication. It will involve foresight  profound analyses and a willingness to look beyond national self-interest.Working together to shape our collective destiny couldenable us to reduce the risks of future political and socialconflicts.I believe firmly that the special circumstances andvulnerability indices of small States must be at theforefront of international debate. If there were ever aquestion as to the vulnerability of small States  Ichallenge the Assembly to recall the unfortunate situation4on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This reality clearlydemonstrates that it takes only one disaster  only oneviolent act of nature  only one volcanic eruption to dislocatean entire population  decimate an entire economy anddestroy the entire social fabric of a people. TheGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis  like other CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) countries  has extended a willinghand of health and social support to the people ofMontserrat. We continue to provide employment and otherbusiness opportunities to those who have come to ourshores in Saint Kitts and Nevis from the island ofMontserrat. I urge the international community to join theCaribbean in taking prompt  decisive and tangible steps toassist the people of Montserrat.Montserrat is a microcosm of our precarious existence.Hence  we urge the international community to fulfil itspromises under the Barbados Programme of Action andother commitments to the developing world. Our survivalas a region is intimately interwoven with our environment and our physical and economic limitations should not befurther burdened by the transshipment of hazardous wastethrough our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violationof our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity.As we work to fulfil the dreams of those who camebefore us  I trust that we will succeed in developingconfidence in the capabilities of the United Nations andentrust it with realizing our common objectives. At thesame time  there will be occasions when we must challengeourselves to appreciate that some problems in internationalaffairs require indigenous approaches and remedies. Wemust  therefore  yield to such imperatives.One case in point is the Middle East  where thecurrent crisis calls for a nurturing of mutual trust and aclear willingness to understand the need for all the partiesto come to the bargaining table. Saint Kitts and Nevisbelieves that durable peace and security are the commondesires of the nations involved. Success requires boldnessand commitment. Genuine progress will come not fromviolence  recrimination and mistrust  but through partnershipand dialogue. Saint Kitts and Nevis urges both sides to usenegotiation and creative confidence-building measures inaddressing their differencesSaint Kitts and Nevis also urges the Chinese people onboth sides of the Taiwan Strait to commit their collectiveenergies to the pursuit of common approaches to resolvingthe current impasse that divides them. The Government ofSaint Kitts and Nevis maintains that progress on this issuerequires sustained dialogue  political will and the goodwillof all. We also believe that the remarkable strides theChinese people on Taiwan have made in the last twodecades should not be squandered. The internationalcommunity can benefit  and stands to benefit significantly from the economic  technological and social advances ofTaiwan.In conclusion  fulfilling the expectations of ourcitizens is not a simple task  but we cannot and must notbecome discouraged. I hope  therefore  that as weendeavour to accomplish our goals Member States willnot continue to make unreasonable demands on thisOrganization while refusing it the requisite tools andresources for appropriate action. Our world needs astronger United Nations. Our countries and our peoplesneed its intellectual supervision and potential forimpartiality. Let us not try to relegate it to the periphery lest we risk serious consequences in the future. Let uscommit to writing a history of which we can be proud lest history should hold us in contempt for squanderingour children's heritage. Let this session of the GeneralAssembly be a watershed when collective efforts weretranslated into appropriate action and well-deservedresults."
"89",3836,"KOR",52,1997,"﻿I congratulate you Sir  on assuming the presidency of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly and pledge to you ourfull support and cooperation. I also pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  whose devotedefforts enabled the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly to come to grips with some of the core issuesaffecting the future of the United Nations.We meet at a time when a number of profoundquestions loom large over humankind. Does theinternational community possess the necessary will and5means to make the twenty-first century an era of widerpeace  deeper justice and greater prosperity? Can weeradicate poverty and protect the environment? Are we ableto ensure that fundamental human rights are respected andpromoted throughout the world? Can we reinvigorate theUnited Nations so that it can be the means to advance theseends? To each of these questions we can and must respondin the affirmative.The Secretary-General  through his recent reformproposals  has provided the international community witha timely compass to help guide the way. In the view of mydelegation  the Secretary- General's latest proposals containa wide spectrum of reforms designed for the overallenhancement of the United Nations system. We areconfident that many of the Secretary-General's ideas can betranslated into action through open-minded deliberation with the full participation of Member States at this session.In this respect  I wish to recall the statement of 10 Augustby the Group of 16  including the Republic of Korea  whichexpressed support for the Secretary-General's reforminitiatives.While institutional reform is a prerequisite for a moreefficient United Nations  it is clear that without morereliable financial support the Organization cannot make anefficient transition into the twenty-first century. Only whenMember States discharge their financial obligations in full on time and without conditions will the United Nationssafely and smoothly reach its ultimate destination ofensuring a better future for humankind.It is in this spirit that Korea has made it a firm policyto pay its assessed dues in full and on time. We willactively participate in concerted efforts to adopt a moreequitable scale of assessment at this session. MyGovernment will consider a gradual move from thecontributors' Group C to which Korea presently belongs  toGroup B in terms of peacekeeping assessment. This is areaffirmation of our enduring commitment towards both thefinancial viability of the United Nations and its efforts tomaintain international peace and security.Another crucial task before us is the reform of theSecurity Council. At the last session  my delegation activelyparticipated in deliberations on the issue  on the basis ofour own experiences as a Council member. We share theview that the profound changes in international relationsover the past several decades fully warrant expansion ofCouncil membership. Given the diverse and sensitiveconcerns of all Member States  however  this issue must behandled with the utmost prudence and seriousness. Everyeffort should be made to work out a consensus formula while bearing in mind that haste makes waste.One of the most significant and promisingdevelopments in international relations over the past halfcentury has been the emergence of a considerable numberof medium-power countries with the capability to make ameaningful contribution to the cause of internationalpeace and security. Any plan to reform the Councilshould provide those countries with opportunities to serveon the Council with reasonable frequency  commensuratewith their capabilities and contributions.We also believe that Council reform should be basedupon consideration of the problems and shortcomingsassociated with the Council's operations thus far particularly with respect to the system of permanentmembership and the right of veto. Convinced that morecan be done to make the Security Council a morerepresentative  efficient and democratic body  we willremain open-minded and flexible with regard to anyproposals that can move this important process in theright direction.As a member of the Security Council for the 1996-1997 period  the Republic of Korea has made its duecontribution to the cause of international peace andsecurity. We have actively participated in reachingimportant decisions to enhance peace and stability in thecountries of some parts of the third world that have beenplagued by civil conflicts over the past several years. Wealso organized  during Korea's presidency of the Councillast May  an open debate on the refugee issue. The debateresulted in the adoption of a presidential statement in Juneon protection for humanitarian assistance to refugees andothers in conflict situations. This clearly reflects the factthat the Security Council has come to recognize thatsecurity applies to people as much as to States in an eraof intra-State conflicts.Despite many positive developments in the securitylandscape of the post Cold-War era  the non-proliferationof weapons of mass destruction remains a priority concernto people and Governments alike. My Governmentbelieves that universal adherence to the existing non-proliferation regimes represents an essential step towardsrealizing that common objective. In this regard  wewelcome the entry into force of the Chemical WeaponsConvention  and urge those States which have not yetacceded to the Convention  including North Korea  to doso at the earliest date.6The proliferation and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines has been the cause of enormoushuman suffering and injury  particularly among civilians.Given the magnitude of the scourge of anti-personnellandmines  the Republic of Korea has decided to extend foran indefinite period its moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines  which was to expire at the end of thisyear. We believe  however  that each country's legitimatesecurity concerns should be given due consideration inaddressing this matter.I wish to reiterate that  while we fully support thenoble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines  a sweeping ban cannot be asatisfactory answer for a country like the Republic ofKorea  which faces the real and present risk of a recurrenceof all-out war  and whose heavily populated capital is only25 miles from the military demarcation line. In our view the draft convention adopted in Oslo two weeks ago doesnot fully accommodate concerns which we haveconsistently expressed  or the exceptional nature of thesecurity situation on the Korean peninsula.The international community has consistentlyendeavoured to wipe out all forms of terrorism from theface of the earth. However  terrorism still persists as one ofthe major threats to international peace  exacting a heavytoll on innocent lives. The Republic of Korea hasexperienced many barbaric and cowardly acts of terrorismand still lives under its constant threat  including recentopen threats aimed at our free press. We strongly supportinternational efforts to combat terrorism and underline theimportance of upholding the principle of zero tolerance.Given the global spectrum of terrorism  we also believe thatthe United Nations can play a central role in strengtheningthe international anti-terrorism regime. In this regard  welook forward to an early adoption of the convention for thesuppression of terrorist bombings.In this era of interdependence among States  theinternational community cannot remain indifferent to theunder-development of much of the world. My delegationtherefore welcomes the adoption of the Agenda forDevelopment at the previous session of the GeneralAssembly and the Secretary-General's reform proposalsdesigned to enhance the United Nations economic andsocial initiatives as well as its development activities. Forthat reason  we support the Secretary-General's suggestionto enhance the coordinating role of the Economic andSocial Council and to strengthen cooperation between theUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. Weexpect that the various proposals for a funding modality forUnited Nations development activities will be discussedfully at this session.Korea  now a member of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development  will participatemore vigorously in South-South cooperation projects witha view to playing a bridging role between developed anddeveloping countries. In an effort to expand assistance tothe least developed countries  we have participated inbilateral cooperation projects with the EconomicCommission for Africa since 1995  and we plan toundertake a programme for the development of Africa forthe period 1998 to 2000.My Government  jointly with the United NationsDevelopment Programme  established in Seoul this pastMay the International Vaccine Institute. This Institute isdevoted to the research and development of vaccines forchildren around the world  particularly those indeveloping countries. The inaugural meeting of its boardof trustees is scheduled to convene in Seoul next month.We look forward to generous support from MemberStates for this worthy goal of keeping our children freefrom debilitating diseases.Turning now to environmental issues  myGovernment welcomes the adoption of the Programme forFurther Implementation of Agenda 21 at the nineteenthspecial session of the General Assembly and standscommitted to participating faithfully in its implementation.In particular  we are pleased that Korea's proposal toconduct a feasibility study on the transfer of publiclyowned technology was supported by developed anddeveloping countries alike and was included in theProgramme. The results of the feasibility study  which isbeing funded by my Government  will be presented at thesixth session of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment next April. Through these efforts  we hopeto expedite the transfer of environmentally soundtechnologies and to promote international cooperation forenvironmental protection.During the special session  there was also an in-depth discussion on the safe management of radioactivewaste  an issue of serious concern to many countries. MyGovernment attaches great importance to the fact that thespecial session adopted a comprehensive set ofarrangements on the environmentally sound managementof these dangerous wastes. We strongly urge that thesearrangements be firmly and strictly adhered to andrespected.7With regard to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  we hope that a realistic andachievable outcome will emerge at the Kyoto Conferenceto be held in December this year.Next year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption and proclamation of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. In 1998  we are also to undertake the five-year mid-term review of the implementation of the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted in June1993.In the view of my delegation  human rights is an areawhere the United Nations has made significant contributionsover the past half century  not just as an international forumfor discussion  but also as a centre for coordinated action.Seen from this perspective  the consolidation of the Officeof the High Commissioner for Human Rights and theCentre for Human Rights  as proposed in the Secretary-General's report  should certainly inject new vitality intoUnited Nations efforts to enhance the coordination of itsactivities in the area of human rights. I wholeheartedlywelcome Mary Robinson's assumption of the post of HighCommissioner.My Government also welcomes the remarkableprogress made by the Preparatory Committee on theEstablishment of an International Criminal Court  which webelieve will serve as an effective deterrent against violationsof international humanitarian law. We expect that theforthcoming conference in Rome will adopt the statute ofthe court  paving the way for its establishment at theearliest possible date. From a historical perspective  thecreation of a permanent international criminal court will seta benchmark for the attainment of international criminaljustice in the coming century.As rightly pointed out in the Secretary-General'sreport  the developments in the present decade have clearlystrengthened the argument that respect for human rights isa precondition for political stability and socio-economicprogress. One of the United Nations' most compellingresponsibilities is to further promote universal respect forhuman rights and deter gross human rights abuses andpolitical oppression. In this context  we are gravelyconcerned at the dire human rights situation in NorthKorea. We truly hope that  in the not-too-distant future  ourcompatriots in the North will come to enjoy basic humanrights and freedoms  as other peoples do around the world.Let me now turn to the situation on the KoreanPeninsula. In April last year  the Republic of Korea and theUnited States jointly proposed four-party talks  involvingthe South and the North of Korea  the United States andChina  which aim to establish a permanent peacemechanism on the Korean Peninsula and build mutualtrust between the two sides of Korea. The four-partytalks  when realized  will offer rare chances of facilitatingpeace and security on the Korean Peninsula andthroughout North-east Asia.If inter-Korean relations are to move forward and theoutstanding problems of the Peninsula are to be resolvedpeacefully  there is no alternative to dialogue andreconciliation between the South and the North of Korea.We sincerely hope that North Korea will realize theimportance and value of improved inter-Korean relationsthrough its participation in the four-party talks. While thetalks are in the interest of all concerned  no one stands tobenefit more than North Korea itself. The construction ofa solid and durable peace structure on the KoreanPeninsula will also produce generous dividends which canhelp North Korea in addressing a host of domesticchallenges it faces  including its economic difficulties.It is regrettable that the recent preparatory meetingsfor the four-party talks ended without any tangible result.Nevertheless  we will continue our patient effort toengage North Korea in a process of dialogue. Weappreciate the continued support of the internationalcommunity to this end.In the meantime  the Republic of Korea willcontinue to provide humanitarian assistance to NorthKorea. The plight of innocent civilians in the North and in particular  vulnerable groups such as malnourishedchildren  is a matter of serious concern for theGovernment and people of the Republic of Korea. As amatter of priority  my Government will provide assistanceto the vulnerable children in North Korea in closecooperation with the United Nations Children's Fund andother interested countries. In this connection  we wouldlike to stress the vital importance of transparency in thedistribution process. We hope that such transparency canbe enhanced through more effective monitoring by theinternational organizations concerned.This year has seen some positive developments ininternational efforts to resolve the long-standing NorthKorean nuclear issue. The 1994 Geneva AgreedFramework has now entered the implementation stage with the ground-breaking ceremony for the light-waterreactor project in North Korea last month under theauspices of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development8Organization (KEDO). For the first time in nearly fivedecades  over 100 engineers and technicians of both sidesof Korea are working together on the construction site. Wehope that this welcome development will be a harbinger ofa new era in inter-Korean relations. My Government takesthis opportunity to express its appreciation to all thosecountries which have extended generous financialcontributions to KEDO.While the ongoing light-water reactor projectundertaken by KEDO is an important step forward ineliminating the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Koreanpeninsula  it must be emphasized here once again that theultimate resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue ispossible only when North Korea complies fully with itssafeguards agreement with the International Atomic EnergyAgency  as well as with the Joint Declaration on theDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula signed by theSouth and North Korea in 1991.When the United Nations was founded in 1945  whocould have foreseen the extent to which internationalrelations would develop during the next half-century? Nodoubt  a number of geopolitical structural changes willoccur in the coming century as well.At the threshold of the twenty-first century  thissession of the General Assembly could well prove to be aturning point by providing a forum for reconfiguring thearchitecture and priorities of the Organization. Facing a newarray of challenges  this session should point the waytowards a brighter future and a renewed sense of optimism.Together  we can forge a stronger United Nations and through it  the foundation for a century of peace  prosperityand justice. The Republic of Korea stands ready to do itsdue part."
"90",3882,"KWT",52,1997,"﻿It gives me pleasure to convey to the President thegreetings of His Excellency Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah  Acting Prime Minister and Minister forForeign Affairs of the State of Kuwait  who profoundlyregrets being unable to participate personally in the debateat this session due to some pressing matters. He hasrequested me to deliver the following statement by Kuwaiton his behalf:“On behalf of the State of Kuwait  it gives mepleasure to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko onhis election as President of the United Nations GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session. We are confidentthat he will be able to lead our deliberationsefficiently towards a successful conclusion. Theextensive experience he has gained from service atthis important international institution together withthe high posts he has assumed will no doubt provevaluable. Let me also underline the good relationsexisting between our two countries  based on mutualunderstanding and common interest.“I wish to take this opportunity to pay tributeto his predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  theformer President of the General Assembly  whodemonstrated an impressive sense of purpose dedication and deep perception. Under hisstewardship  the Assembly reasserted its genuineimportance and relevance in international relations.“I wish to pay tribute to our new Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  who tookthe helm of the Organization at the beginning of theyear. Apart from being a long-time career insider atthe United Nations  Mr. Annan to us now stands asa good example of the executive manager enjoyingwisdom and prudence  together with integrity andcommitment  that make him a living embodiment ofdedication to the ideals and mission of the UnitedNations.“In the same vein  I wish to set on record ourrecognition of the significant contribution ofMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the former Secretary-General  in leading the Organization with efficiencyand confidence. Kuwait will always recognize hiscontributions with a deep sense of appreciation.“Two years ago  the United Nations celebratedits fiftieth anniversary. The mood then wasoptimistic about the role and capability of theOrganization to cope with the lingering issues thatremained without a solution over the first halfcentury. This was due to the nature of theseproblems  which was aggravated by the major-Powerpolarization during the cold war. The sense ofoptimism emanated from our deep conviction thatthe global understanding that swept the world wouldeventually generate the firm will to address theoutstanding problems that jeopardize internationalpeace and security. Also  the widespread publicawareness of the relevance of the United Nationswould also help the Organization in resolvingpending matters. Furthermore  the impressive trackrecord of the United Nations has earned it collectivecredibility regarding the vitality and flexibility of themachinery at its disposal.“Kuwait has examined with great interest themeasures and recommendations contained in thereport of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan 18entitled Renewing the United Nations: A Programmefor Reform'  which was submitted to the GeneralAssembly in mid-July last. In this connection  wewould like to register Kuwait’s support for thisprogramme and its appreciation of the efforts made byMr. Kofi Annan and his assistants to produce thisimpressive achievement. The report is analytical in itsapproach and pragmatic in its outlook  focusing onperformance efficiency without partiality. It alsofocused on improving the financial situation of theOrganization through the institution of better internalcontrol mechanisms and practical suggestions. Theultimate goal of all these measures is to enhance theperformance of the United Nations  which would bemore innovative in its operational modalities and morefocused on its global concerns.“We have noted  with appreciation  the reportssubmitted by a wide array of working groups onrestructuring the organs of the United Nations andimproving their efficiency in order to adapt the entiresystem to the new era following the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations and the post-confrontation environment. The United Nations seemspoised to embark on addressing in a morecomprehensive manner humanitarian  cultural demographic and environmental issues which were notprominent on its list of priorities previously.“Moreover  as we recognize the realities ofcontemporary life  we understand that the world ordercontinues to be quite fluid  and it is indeed difficult topredict its future shape. The current stage is not aunipolar power era  as some might imagine. It is amultipolar arena  where military might is no longer thefinal arbiter in the definition of polarity. In fact  thereexists immense technological superiority  which mayenable some States to make an outstandingcontribution to the shaping of global strategies. Thereis also the economic power that has brought togetherthe major industrial nations in a collectivity which hasa significant influence on the implementation of worldstrategies. This is not to mention the giant economicgroupings which exist in the world of today.“Accordingly  the Open-ended Working Groupon the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and other Matters Related to the Security Council which has been examining the question of reform andexpansion of Security Council membership for thepast four years  should take these new facts of lifeinto consideration. Once agreed upon  the newmembership composition should reflect a collectiveand emphatic will to address adequately the issues athand. Permanent members of the Council should bepolitically capable and should be financial and troopcontributors. They should also be adept at crisismanagement  and able to act decisively  withouthesitation  when the situation warrants such action.“In the final analysis  membership of theSecurity Council is not a privilege as much as it isa responsibility. It should not be a means forvisibility  but a product of conviction. Our view isthat the Security Council in its forthcomingcomposition should be a mirror reflecting a worldshifting towards universalization and transparency inorder to instil a better sense of security in allmembers of the world community  both North andSouth  East and West. Membership should not bedivided between diverse security concepts  somefavouring the North  while others are appropriate forthe South.“In this context  Kuwait affirms its fullcommitment to the common Arab position and to thestand of the Non-Aligned Movement  both of whichwere elaborated time and again in several meetingsof the Open-ended Working Group.“Undoubtedly  agreement on the concept ofunconventional and common security requires in thefirst instance recognition of some crucial facts. Thefirst element is the conviction that the security ofhumankind is universal and  in the final analysis indivisible. The interests of members of the worldcommunity have become more and moreinterdependent  while civilizations and cultures aredrawing closer. The daily concerns of individuals areuniversal in nature  requiring complex solutions  andare multidimensional in their negative impacts. Thesecond element is the emphasis on the concept ofeconomic and social development as a crucial factorin ensuring conventional security and collectivehandling of development requirements. This alsocalls for the involvement of international institutionsin contributions to the improvement of livingconditions in the poor nations that face severeimpediments in their development efforts.“The third element is a firm belief in andcommitment to the dignity of the human person asbeing the essence of human relations both within a19given society and among nations. In effect  this meansupholding the dignity of the human person in the faceof bloody regimes which flagrantly violate theprinciples of human rights and destroy their ownnations to arrogate power to themselves. This bringsus to the necessity of safeguarding the principles setforth in the 1948 Universal Declaration of HumanRights and in the Charter of the United Nations.“Fourthly  all members of the world communityshould adopt peaceful policies which renounceviolence  recognize the legitimate interests of othersand respect their rights  expand the zones of mutualinterests  give due priority to development and rejectthe arms race. Such peaceful policies should alsoabstain from behaviour and political expressions whichdisturb peace. They should observe civilized conductin relationships among peoples  without the pursuit ofany party’s privileges at the expense of others. No oneshould claim an imaginary historical role outside theparameters of justice  equality and the rule of law.“The world today is indeed a small planet whoseproblems interact and overlap. Its pressing problemsare a global responsibility. When viewed through ahuman and global prism  we can see that theprosperity of the North pales in the shadow of thepoverty of the South. The security of Europe will notbe assured against a background of a marginalizedAfrica. There will be little peace of mind in Americain the face of a population explosion in Asia  and withthe widening gap between those with an abundance ofwealth and those who suffer in deprivation. Dealingwith the new developments in the world environmentrequires the evolution of a comprehensive concept ofsecurity. Any such concept must be anchored inunderstanding  coexistence  common interests  and theutilization of the universal technological revolution inmanaging vital national projects. This concept shouldreplace the outdated concepts of security based on thebalance of power  mutual deterrence and militarypresence.“The achievements made by the United Nationsshould provide the Organization with a further impetusto pursue the same course it has charted since the endof the cold war.“We welcome the movement towards theprohibition of the production  stockpiling and use oflandmines. This would be yet another positive stepadded to similar measures  such as the ChemicalWeapons Convention  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Despite suchinstruments  some States continue to export weaponsof mass destruction as a vital source of increasednational income. We welcome the regulations thathave been concluded to control arms  to reduce thelevel of nuclear threat  to tighten controls over thearms trade and to increase transparency regardingweapons expenditures.“In the same vein  we cannot underestimate theachievements made in the area of peacekeepingoperations  where the United Nations has managedto contain dangers and defuse crises in severalinstances  although many regional problems remainunresolved and constitute flash-points of tension.“In this regard  we in Kuwait cannot but recallwith admiration the firmness with which the SecurityCouncil responded to the aggression by the Iraqiregime against the State of Kuwait in August 1990.The Council’s response was characterized byfirmness in rejecting aggression  resoluteness in itsconfrontation  and decisive action to abort theaggression through a series of resolutions that madethe Council’s position perfectly clear. It started withrejection of aggression  then moved to deterrence and culminated in decisive action. In all itsdimensions and ramifications  that case has becomea historical precedent that might constitute the basisfor a solid background for dealing with any similaraggression  irrespective of its origin  against anyState.“But Iraq  despite the dire need of its peoplefor the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by theSecurity Council  has not yet fulfilled basicconditions required for ending the sanctions. Thereis the question of Kuwaiti and third-countryprisoners and detainees. This is a humanitarian issuethat affects several hundred families who still do notknow the whereabouts of their loved ones. Youngchildren continue to cry  appealing for help to rescuetheir missing fathers. The ad hoc TripartiteCommission continues to meet in Geneva while itstechnical sub-group still convenes in the border areabetween Kuwait and Iraq. Despite the formal natureof such regular meetings  which attract mediaattention  there has in effect been no progress in20determining the fate of these missing persons. In fact the Iraqi regime has been exploiting their fate as abargaining chip in its diplomatic manoeuvres. Iraq alsocontinues to refuse to return a great deal of Kuwaitiproperty taken from the public and private sectors  themost important of which is an air defence system andother military equipment  in addition to the principalState documents  which have been referred to in theSecurity Council as State memory.“Among the other key obligations the Iraqiregime has failed to fulfil is the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction  a subject that is beinghandled by the Special Commission. In this context even after seven years of formal acceptance ofrelevant conditions  Iraq continues to indulge its hobbyof procrastination  subterfuge and deception. Iraq hidescertain weapons only to acknowledge later theirexistence after the Special Commission securesdefinitive proof of Iraq’s ownership of such weapons.It denies having certain types of missiles andbiological components only to recant its assertionsonce the international teams of inspectors discoverthose items.“Kuwait welcomes Security Council resolution1111 (1997) regarding the extension of theimplementation of the provisions of resolution 986(1995)  which aims at alleviating the suffering of thebrotherly people of Iraq. Indeed  the hardship faced bythe people of Iraq has long persisted  due to thefailure of the Iraqi regime to meet its obligations  andto its pursuit of a policy of procrastination andtrickery. Iraq is called upon to follow a peacefulpolicy with neighbouring States in order to prove itsgood intentions. This is a substantive condition for themaintenance of regional security  which was shatteredby the Iraqi regime.“We in Kuwait have gone through bitterexperiences with regard to the intentions of the Iraqiregime  which seeks territorial expansion  regionalsupremacy  and military superiority at the expense ofneighbouring countries and of their peace and stability.“In the light of our eager interest in themaintenance of security and stability in the region  weaffirm the need to preserve the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq.“The supreme goal is to build a solid regionalsystem firmly rooted in common understanding amongneighbouring States which seek to expand avenuesof mutual interests. This can be achieved throughrespect for and non-interference in the internalaffairs of others  and through civilized coexistenceamong neighbouring peoples. In this respect  Ishould point out that my country is concerned overthe continued existence of the problem of theoccupation by Iran of three United Arab Emiratesislands. Here I wish to emphasize Kuwait’s fullcommitment to the decision taken by the GulfCooperation Council on this subject.“I wish also to call upon the Islamic Republicof Iran to respond favourably to the peacefulinitiative launched by His Highness Sheikh Zayedbin Sultan Al Nahyan  President of our sister UnitedArab Emirates  to engage in a serious dialogue thatwould take into account the inalienable rights of theUnited Arab Emirates to the islands in question  inaccordance with the principles of good neighbourlyrelations  international law and the United NationsCharter.“The question of the Middle East and thesuccess of the peace process there are crucialmatters for world peace and security. You followwith us with deep regret the paralysis which befellthat process and the increasing frustration andtension throughout the region. The current stalematehas touched off a flurry of threats andrecriminations. All this is the net sum of theconcepts put out by the Israeli Governmentregarding the frame of reference underlying thepeace process in the region.“The Government of Israel has backtrackedfrom the rules and principles of the Madrid PeaceConference and has replaced them by extraneouselements which contravene the rules unanimouslyagreed upon by the international community as aframework for the peace process  namely SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) together with the “land for peace” principle.Furthermore  Israel has not committed itself toimplement bilateral agreements reached with thePalestinian Authority  including withdrawal from alloccupied territories  including Jerusalem. Also  Israelhas not desisted from its policies of annexing ArabJerusalem  its Judaization and expansion of its illegalsettlement in order to change the demographiccomposition of the Holy City which lies at the verycore of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this regard 21we call upon the co-sponsors of the peace initiative tomaintain even-handedness while doubling their effortsto revive the peace process in order to achieve alasting  comprehensive and just resolution of thequestion of Palestine.“The people of Palestine have suffered for toolong the excruciating pain of oppression  homelessnessand neglect. It is the inherent right of the Palestinianpeople to exercise self-determination and to establishtheir own independent State  with Jerusalem as itscapital  similar to other peoples who gainedindependence  so that they may contribute  within theirown capacity  towards building world peace.“Along similar lines  Kuwait emphasizes theimportance of Israeli withdrawal from the occupiedSyrian Golan  which has been under occupation since1967. This question cannot be ignored if we desire thepeace process to be complete. Indeed  the peace mustbe comprehensive  covering all tracks. It should beanchored in good faith  in respect for the rights ofothers and in mutual confidence. In this regard  wesupport Syria’s position that negotiations with Israelshould resume from the point where they haltedinstead of starting new rounds of talks whose terms ofreference have not been defined. Kuwait also supportsLebanon’s firm stand that Israel is duty-bound toimplement all provisions of Security Councilresolution 425 (1978) and to preserve Lebanon’ssovereignty and territorial integrity. This can beachieved only by full  unconditional Israeli withdrawalfrom southern Lebanon  so that Lebanon could resumeits traditional role in consolidating development andprosperity.“Kuwait notes with deep regret that ethnic factional and civil conflicts among tribal chiefs in bothAfghanistan and Somalia still continue. We remainhopeful that the United Nations will take moreeffective steps to address these problems that havetorn asunder those two countries and have continuedto undermine regional security. We also appeal to allparties in these two countries to put an end to acts ofviolence and to put overall national interests ahead oftheir tribal and ethnic interests.“Kuwait lauds international efforts to implementfully the Dayton Agreement  which aims at achievingsecurity and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina andupholding international legitimacy at this stage. In thisrespect  we applaud the Security Council resolution toindict and prosecute certain political and militaryleaders in Bosnia and Rwanda for their crimesagainst humanity.“We live in a world bursting with events.Distances have shrunk  interests have grown  andsecurity dimensions have become more interlinked.Adverse developments in the South worry thepopulation of the North. Failure of developmentefforts has given impetus to chaotic waves of hungrymigrants. Threats resulting from peoples’ frustrationshave become interwoven. But  in our commonpursuit of a better tomorrow  we must act on thebasis of a universal conviction that armaments bythemselves do not guarantee full security  thatdevelopment is the core of progress  that dialogue isthe bridge to understanding and that serious workgives birth to hope. Giving is an obligation  not anact of charity. Respect among nations is a key tostability  and self-improvement is a motive for work.Participation is the path to cooperation. Monopoly isone of the evils of bygone days  and openness is theroad to a better future. Investments are the tools ofdevelopment. Bigotry is repugnant to contemporaryinternational relations. People prosper in a civilizedenvironment that imbues them with the virtues ofdoing good and giving  reaching out towards thosein need and moving against the odds in efforts tocreate a world that exudes friendship and amity  aworld resting on the rules of international legality  aworld enjoying security  peace and prosperity.“Our last prayer is to bless Allah  the lord ofthe universe.”"
"91",3928,"LAO",52,1997,"﻿In accordance with tradition I take this opportunity to begin by congratulating thePresident most warmly on his assumption of thepresidency of the fifty-second session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. His unanimous election which has placed him in this highly responsible post inthis important international arena  is a warm tribute to hiscountry  Ukraine. I wish him every possible success in thedischarge of his difficult duties.I would also like to congratulate his predecessor Mr. Razali Ismail  Permanent Representative of Malaysia 14on his dynamic presidency during the last session of theGeneral Assembly.The Lao delegation also wishes to express itsappreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan  our new Secretary-General for his good work so far. His first nine months at the helmof our Organization have been a time of strenuous effortand resolute action aimed at reforming our universalOrganization to make it more effective and better suited tomeeting today’s challenges. To our new Secretary-General we express our sincere wishes for success in shoulderinghis weighty and great responsibilities.The general trend towards dialogue and cooperationbetween States and peoples for the progress of humankindin this new era continues to characterize internationalrelations. Clearly  we are delighted because on the wholethis is highly positive. However  in several regions of theworld we still witness persistent tension and conflict  dueto interference in the internal affairs of States; theimplementation of policies aimed at hegemony overdeveloping States; and tribal  ethnic  religious and otherdivisions. This situation of tension and conflict is apotential threat to peaceful coexistence and harmonybetween States  and may even jeopardize the currentatmosphere of international cooperation to promotedevelopment. In the interests of world peace  a sine quanon for the promotion of socio-economic development  weshould work together patiently and resolutely  to findrealistic and appropriate solutions as soon as possible.In Europe  the peace accords signed in Dayton on 14December 1995 opened the door to resolving the painfuland destructive conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Wetruly hope that the parties concerned will sincerely andstrictly honour their commitments in order to preserve thefragile peace and cooperation in that region.In some African countries tribal and ethnic conflictscontinue to rage  causing serious harm to their peoples. Weexpress our sincere sympathy to the peoples of thesecountries over the untold suffering they have had to endure.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic considers itimperative that the international community  and inparticular the countries concerned  redouble efforts toresolve these disputes as quickly as possible.In the Caribbean  multifaceted cooperation between theStates of the region continues to grow  thus contributing topeace and security in that part of the world. In this context it is time the United States of America made greater effortsand undertook reasonable negotiations with the Republic ofCuba to resolve their differences  in the interest of boththe American and the Cuban peoples and in the interestof regional and global peace.In the Middle East  the establishment of thePalestinian Authority  in accordance with the Washingtonaccords signed in 1993  marked a crucial stage in thesearch for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which dates back over 30 years. Thepeace process which had been set in motion is nowconfronting grave difficulties  as the recent violenceclearly demonstrates. The Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic expresses its grave concern regarding thissituation. We very much hope that the partiesconcerned — Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization — will show great wisdom  and evengreater restraint  and will engage in serious negotiationsto resolve their problem  thus contributing to restoringpeace and stability to this sensitive region.In the Korean peninsula  the implementation by theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates of America of agreements that had been concludedand the recent opening in New York of preliminaryquadripartite talks on peace in Korea are important stagesin the efforts to ease tension and confrontation in thatregion. In this context  the Lao Government and people while welcoming the efforts of the parties concerned express their unswerving support for the legitimateaspirations of the Korean people to live in peace andachieve the peaceful reunification of the Koreanhomeland.In South-East Asia  efforts to strengthen economic cultural and other cooperation and improve the settlementof disputes by peaceful means are clearly priorities.The admission of the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic and Myanmar as fully fledged members of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on23 July last was a historic event of great significance. Itis our firm hope that an ASEAN of 10 will become areality in the near future and will contribute tostrengthening our region  and making it more prosperous in the interests of peace  stability and cooperation in Asiaand the Pacific  and in the world at large.Another problem which has aroused internationalconcern is the recent event in Cambodia. Fortunately  thecurrent Government has been able to restore normality inaccordance with the country’s legislative procedures. Theinternational community  including the Lao People’s15Democratic Republic  continues to recognize and respectHis Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk as Head of State ofCambodia. It is our hope that all countries and the UnitedNations will also respect his royal authority.In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  politicalstability continues to be solidly guaranteed. The multi-ethnic Lao people are living in solidarity and unity — afact which ensures social harmony. In accordance with ourConstitution  the fourth elections for the National Assemblywill be held in mid-December. That election will onceagain demonstrate the fervent patriotic spirit of the Laopeople and the development of its democracy towards theestablishment of a State of law  a State of the people  bythe people and for the people.In the economic sphere  implementation of the renewalpolicy  which began in 1986  has made it possible for oureconomy to experience sustained growth  with an annualrate for the past five years of approximately 7 per cent.Unfortunately  this year  my country suffered equallysizeable losses because of natural disasters and therepercussions of financial recession in South-East Asia.Nonetheless  cooperation between Laos and theinternational community remains very strong.Parallel with its admission to ASEAN  the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic continues to strengthen itsrelations of bilateral cooperation with neighbouringcountries in the region and in the world on the basis of theprinciples of equality and mutual interest. In order to ensurethe sustained development of the national economy  the LaoGovernment has taken important measures to integrate itseconomy and its market with those of the region and of theworld. This integration is of great benefit to national andforeign investors thanks to the country’s economic andother potential such as its geographical location  in relationto major regional markets  its transit role  its role as asupplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countriesand export producer  using the country’s raw materials  andits innumerable natural tourist attractions.Following up its endeavours and successes of the last10 years through the implementation of its renewal policy the Lao Government firmly intends to continue its policy ofdeveloping the country on the basis of a market economyand broadening relations of cooperation with theinternational community. Its aim is to extricate the countryfrom its state of underdevelopment by the year 2020 and toestablish a preliminary basis for its gradual transformationinto an industrialized  modern country under the slogan“Building a strong and prosperous country  ensuring thewell-being of the people  forming a civilized and fairsociety”.The world economy is seeing some signs of growth.Nonetheless  this growth falls short of expectations. Wewitness growing inequalities between developing anddeveloped countries. The international economicenvironment in terms of access to markets and financialresources granted on preferential terms for developmentpurposes is  in general  in decline. Faced with thissituation  the developed countries must spare no effort totake the necessary steps by coordinating theirmacroeconomic policies in order to bring about arecovery of the world economy thanks to a strongerliberalization of trade  which would contribute toestablishing an international economic environment morefavourable to development.The problem of drug abuse remains a subject ofinternational concern. My country has taken manynational and international measures with a view tocontributing to the global effort to eradicate this scourgefrom the face of the earth. For the first time  in May  theLao People’s Democratic Republic was unanimouslyelected a member of the important Commission onNarcotic Drugs by the Economic and Social Council. Weare profoundly grateful to the international community forthis demonstration of confidence and support and we willmake every effort to discharge our responsibilitieshonourably.Last June  after over three years of hard work  theGeneral Assembly adopted  without a vote  An Agendafor Development. The Lao People’s Democratic Republicis pleased at its adoption  which it regards as an importantstage in the effort to build a real partnership between thedeveloped and developing countries. The Agenda forDevelopment  a highly valuable document  provides afoundation of principles  objectives  measures and actionswhich can serve as a guide to Member States in theglobal approach to development questions in theimmediate and long term and at the national andinternational levels.That June  the General Assembly met in specialsession to review the implementation of Agenda 21 fiveyears after the Rio Summit on environment anddevelopment. At the conclusion of that session  a follow-up programme on the implementation of Agenda 21 wasadopted without a vote; the importance of thatimplementation  inter alia  to the eradication of povertyin the years to come was stressed. The international16community is therefore called on to exert every effort tostrengthen cooperation to make this programme a reality.As we near the twenty-first century  the UnitedNations — the only universal multilateral body — has animportant role to play in the consideration and managementof international affairs. If it is to be commensurate with thattask  our Organization must adapt to the new dynamic andcomplex world. In this context  we express our sinceregratitude to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for theimportant initiatives of his programme of reform  issued lastJuly  which aim at reorganizing our global body in order tomake it more flexible in its structure and more efficient inits actions. This very important programme generally triesto take the interests of Member States into account.In considering these questions  it is necessary toemphasize that any reform process must have the primarygoal of strengthening the Organization’s capacities topromote social and economic development for all States particularly the developing among them. At the same time this promotion must be undertaken while addressingquestions related to peacekeeping  human rights andhumanitarian activities. It is on the basis of these essentialcriteria that we would wish to see the Organizationreformed and revitalized and given an improved structure a more democratic regime and a solid financial footing. Ifwe do so  the United Nations will be able effectively tomeet the new challenges of our times."
"92",3971,"LBN",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to extend our thanks to the outgoing President Ambassador Razali Ismail  and to congratulate him on theway in which he fulfilled his mandate. I would also like tocongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election andwish him complete success in his efforts to strengthen andincrease the effectiveness of the United Nations in thesehistoric times  which more than ever demand ourapplication  perseverance  determination and good faith.More than half a century has elapsed since the UnitedNations was founded. When the United Nations was born mankind wanted it to lead to the creation of a world ofjustice  law and peace. The United Nations was supposedto be able to defend human rights when they were violatedand promote justice. By means of the United Nations mankind aspired to put an end to an era of war and usherin an era of peace and tolerance  of respect for nationalsovereignty and people’s freedom and of independence ofStates; an era in which people would be free to fulfil theirdreams and aspirations and to maintain their identity. Neverin the course of human history have we needed the UnitedNations more than we need it today  in this era ofcommunications and contacts  when frontiers aredisappearing under the force of the technological revolution.This is an era of demographic explosion and deadly destructive weapons; an era when the environment is nolonger capable of meeting mankind’s demands.Today we are truly in need of a basic means ofcontaining conflicts and resolving disputes. This is whywe must increase the effectiveness of the United Nationsmechanism and renew confidence in its justice  credibilityand effectiveness  the freedom of its decision-makingprocesses from hegemony  and the absence of imbalancesin its measured ways and in the enforcement of itsresolutions so that no one remains above internationallaw. These steps are essential if we want to prevent thecollapse of the United Nations  and if we want it to retainthe moral authority necessary to resolve disputes andremain an alternative to hot and deadly confrontations.Therefore  Lebanon enthusiastically supports thereform of United Nations institutions  particularly theSecurity Council. We call for enhancing the numericaland geographical balance of the Council so as to reflectchanged realities. The Council must also be reformed todissipate the misgivings some have about the way itperforms its role.Lebanon subscribes to the principle of rotation of thepermanent seats in the Security Council. We reiterate oursupport for the position of the Arab Group  as expressedin the paper it presented on this subject.We welcome the Secretary-General’s proposals forthe reform of the United Nations. We have given themour full attention and are carefully studying them. Webelieve it is necessary to enhance the role of the GeneralAssembly and to make the issue of development a highpriority for the Organization  while attaching greatimportance to the work of regional economic and socialcommissions.Under the rubric of reducing costs and the budget many United Nations agencies  in particular the UnitedNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugeesin the Near East (UNRWA)  have lost much of theirability to adequately provide social  health and educationservices to refugees in their host countries. This increasesthe burden on host countries  Lebanon among them. It isdifficult for us to shoulder these responsibilities underthese conditions. The responsibility of the internationalcommunity in redressing the injustice inflicted on thePalestinian refugees must be made apparent. This bitterreality  which cannot be free of hidden intentions  aims attimes at attempting to pressure these countries and forcethem to assimilate the refugee population they are hosting.15This would be a step towards liquidating the refugees’ casefor return. It is also a means of pressuring the hostcountries into accepting unacceptable political terms.The international community  represented by theUnited Nations and the donor countries  is duty-bound tocontinue to render assistance to the Palestinian refugeesawaiting a political resolution of their status in accordancewith the right to return  as decided upon by the UnitedNations and  in particular  the principle of reunitingfamilies. This is one of the pillars of the peace process  andthus it is essential that the international communitypersevere until a solution is attained.We had hoped that this session would be an occasionfor us to express our gratitude for the restoration of peacein Lebanon and the Middle East. This would have been anattestation to the success of the Madrid peace process which was launched six years ago to which should beadded one year of preparation. This international peaceinitiative began auspiciously. We believed in both its letterand its spirit because the initiative was international  thesponsorship was effective and the contents were based uponan equitable  just and permanent peace. We were veryhopeful  because we thought that peace would be realizedon the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) 338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  on the basis of the principle ofland for peace and on the basis of finding a consensualsolution to the question of Jerusalem. The initiative wasalso supposed to put an end to Israel’s building andexpansion of settlements in the occupied territories and leadto the recognition of the political rights of the Palestinianpeople. It was supposed to be followed by a discussion ofregional arrangements to settle security  social andeconomic questions  in particular the question of thePalestinian refugees  thereby paving the way for theeconomic development of the region.We entered into the peace process convinced that thebasic elements had been accepted at Madrid and that theyhad become commitments of the participating States. Wethought that all that remained for the delegations was tobegin negotiations on implementation. However  the adventof the present Israeli Government and its head totallydashed our hopes  given the practices of this newGovernment. The principle of land for peace was thrownout  to be replaced by a new formula. The IsraeliGovernment reneged on the need for implementation ofinternational decisions  and thus demanded theirreinterpretation. That Government did not want to find asolution to the question of Jerusalem  so it went ahead andannexed it. The Israeli Government reneged on itscommitments with regard to the occupied Syrian Golan so it stressed its annexation. The Israeli Governmentdemolished the principle of halting settlement activitiesand vastly expanded their efforts at settlement.The negotiated commitments of the previousGovernment were abandoned  as if there were nocontinuity from one Government to the next. Instead ofmaking progress towards peace — the only worthwhileobjective — the Government devoted itself to destroyingwhat had been done  even if the steps previously takenwere limited.Instead of being able to work towards a genuinepeace  we have had to endure propaganda manoeuvresaimed at numbing and misleading public opinion  alongwith meetings that were designed just to give theimpression that a dialogue was continuing. Instead oftrying to find a solution to the basic conflict  the emphasisshifted to the normalization of relations through economicconferences — as a precondition  even before solving thelegal and political problem — instead of havingnormalization occur naturally as a crowning of the basicsolution.Faced with heightened internal crisis  the IsraeliGovernment resorted to stirring up tension along itsborders and in areas under occupation  to divert attentionaway from the peace it had scuttled. Thus  the principleof provocation and confrontation was re-established inorder to create unity internally.Israel continued to carry out its acts of aggressionagainst southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa  oncewith the goal of mobilizing Israeli public opinion againstpeace  and another time for the purpose of emptyinginternational initiatives of their political content.The attacks continued  through artillery shelling  airraids  operations inside our territories — against villagesand cities — against children  women  the elderly andhomes. Destruction and demolition continued  as did thedetention of Lebanese citizens in Israeli military camps —all of this without the United Nations internationalinstitutions being allowed to visit them. They were notpermitted the enjoyment of elementary human rights: theright to counsel and the right to a fair trial. Some of themwere returned to us as corpses  while others were torturedor maimed — and this in the era of respect for the rightsof environment  of plants  and of animals.16Nonetheless  the more the occupation endured  themore Israel became increasingly bogged down in thequagmire of the south which became an inferno to it. Theoccupier has become a prisoner  and the aggressor ahostage in the face of a valiant people’s steadfastness andthe resistance of its sons and daughters. Thus Israelsustained huge losses which is prompting it to rethink theviability and usefulness of its continued occupation ofsouthern Lebanon.Against this reality  we heard  through misleadingmedia reports  of an Israeli readiness to withdraw.We have to bring the truth forth. Lebanon’s firmstance has always been for a complete Israeli withdrawal tointernationally recognized borders so as to enable theLebanese State to exercise its sovereignty over its territoriesthrough its own forces. But Israel does not wish towithdraw; it is still camouflaging its unwillingness towithdraw completely by relocating or redeploying its forces.It continues to cast a smoke screen by asking to maintaininspection and control posts  by imposing conditions thatlimit the State’s authority and by giving the upper hand tothe militias that it created. Furthermore  Israel is attemptingto impose control over the Lebanese Army  which could bedeployed  as well as other conditions that challenge anypresumed Lebanese sovereignty when withdrawal takesplace.I should like to pay tribute to our fallen heroes members of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon(UNIFIL) — most recently four Italian soldiers and an Irishsergeant. Their blood was spilled in defence of southernLebanon  mixing with that of Lebanese citizens. I shouldalso like to pay tribute to the Force itself  whosecommanders and troops are discharging a difficult taskunder the most difficult and most trying circumstances.No sooner had the people of the region begun to adaptto the anticipated climate of peace than they were thrustback into an era of confrontation  violence and inevitabledefiance and resistance. Though development plans for theMiddle East region were being formulated  and the worldmanifested interest in its peaceful future  caution andpessimism began once again to prevail  and hopes weredashed. No sooner had the Government of Israel drawnstrength from the veto power used against Security Councilresolutions on its settlement policies  it has continued tochallenge Council resolutions  thereby underminingwhatever is left of the peace process.The international community  which stands to beaffected by the situation in the region  either directly orindirectly  must hold the defiant accountable. Theinternational community has not only the right but alsothe duty to take action through the Organization of theUnited Nations. On many occasions  the United Nationshas delegated this question to others  hoping that asolution could be found. It has consistently refrained fromenforcing its resolutions  in contrast to its recentbehaviour vis-à-vis many other States.The time has come for the United Nations to reclaimits role. The time has come to return to the basics ofpeace as agreed in Madrid  to the principle of land forpeace  to the need to implement Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  andto resume negotiations on all tracks from the point wherethey stopped. The time has come for Israel immediatelyto cease all settlement activities; to resolve the status ofthe city of Jerusalem; to withdraw from the Palestinianterritory and recognize the political rights of thePalestinian people; to withdraw from the Syrian Golan tothe line of 4 June 1967; to fully withdraw from southernLebanon and its western Bekaa to the internationallyrecognized boundaries in order to enable the LebaneseState to exercise its authority  in accordance with SecurityCouncil resolution 425 (1978).Opting for a peace that ignores these fundamentalsis a choice that is doomed to failure  a choice that couldignite the entire region. An isolationist policy thatseparates the various tracks would run counter to theprinciple of a comprehensive peace and will neverachieve it. This is because the conflict is fundamentallya comprehensive one. It has never been a conflictbetween one single Arab State and Israel  but has alwaysbeen between the Arabs and Israel. As long as a singletrack is excluded from the solution  peace will remainimpossible. The tracks are all intertwined  which showshow indivisible and interconnected the cause is. Nobodyshould think that one track can survive  even for onehour  while other tracks remain excluded.Because Lebanon is at the heart of the conflict  ithas suffered a great deal. Today  however  it isconfounding all forecasts and expectations that presagedits demise by proving to the world once again  as it hasdone throughout its long and time-honoured history  thatit is too strong to wither away  and that a right that isclaimed by its people will never disappear.17When southern Lebanon and western Bekaa areliberated  when Lebanese sovereignty extends to all itsterritory  when the United Nations credibility is confirmedby the authority of its resolutions  when Israeli jails areemptied of their innocent detainees and resistance fighters when an end is put to bloodshed which soaks our land  thenand only then will the wound be healed. The tears will thenstop and confidence will be restored to all in a genuine just  permanent and comprehensive peace  a peace that canrestore to the land of civilizations  religions and cultures theplace it deserves now and in future  as it has always beenthroughout its long history.The choice of peace will not always be available to us.The peace that the Assembly supported is in the throes ofdeath today. If restoring peace seems difficult  its demisewould close the door to any attempt to rekindle the processin the foreseeable future  thus putting world peace injeopardy and sparking an uncontrollable conflagration which will be difficult to contain.May God guide the steps of those who are working fora peace that is just and not unfair  equitable and not biased consensual and not imposed  a peace that honours thememory of those martyred  that does justice to those whostruggle  and that would put an end to darkness in the landof the prophets and the messengers of God."
"93",4018,"LBR",52,1997,"﻿I have the honour to presentmy personal compliments to His ExcellencyMr. Hennadiy Udovenko and to wish him every successduring his presidency.24I have the honour also to deliver the address of HisExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor  President of theRepublic of Liberia  who regrettably cannot be here today.The text of his address reads as follows:“At the outset  I wish to convey sinceregreetings  on behalf of the Government and people ofLiberia and in my own name. We are here today having endured and survived a severe civil crisis ofnearly a decade  through the acute consciousness ofour subregion  whose empathy with Liberia’s plightcreated and orchestrated a mechanism to prevent usfrom self-destruction. And we stand no less indebtedto a sea of humanitarian outreach through theinternational community  most notably the EuropeanUnion (EU) and the United States; but absolutely  asa living testimony to God Almighty  whosecompassionate will has removed the hand of evil fromthe activities of our nation.“Indeed  we are here because Liberia has stoodthe test of time and the full assault of hardship.Today  one added voice of a sovereign State ofAfrica — and an original Charter Member of thisOrganization — is being heard through its constitutedHead of Government  which we symbolize  and forwhich we give all glory to God.“It is my pleasure to congratulate His ExcellencyMr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election to thepresidency of this fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly. To this we add our best wishes for hissuccess in meeting the challenges of this awesomeassignment. Also  it is befitting that we extend ourthanks to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. RazaliIsmail  whose tenure was characterized by a resolutecommitment to finding solutions to the many issueswhich impacted the proceedings of the fifty-firstsession.“I wish also to seize this opportunity tocommend  on behalf of the Government and people ofLiberia  Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Already  hehas demonstrated that he understands the problemswhich afflict Africa  his native continent  and that hisleadership is not confined to the accomplishmentswhich he earned as a son of Ghana. Day by day glimpses of his ability as an effective spokesman forall mankind are being made clearly visible. Permit meto also pay special honour to the former Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose sense ofpurpose and invaluable efforts to strengthen the role ofthe Organization in the pursuit of international peaceand security have brought benefits to mankind. Westand convinced that the patience he exercised andthe many initiatives and the personal commitment heinjected into the search for peace and understandingduring his tenure deserve appropriate commendationby this Organization.“The establishment of the United Nations overfive decades ago marked the beginning of a new erain international relations. The adoption of itsCharter  a document of pride and durability  whichLiberia helped to formulate  instituted a workingsystem of international cooperation. Thus  nationsare resolved to eradicate the scourge of war; tostrengthen peace through justice and internationallaw; to respect the equal rights of all nations —large and small; to promote social progress and toprotect human rights throughout the world. We wishto reaffirm our avowed faith in the United Nations and we retain the undiminished hope that thisOrganization will continue to be a veritableinstrument for the good conduct of relations amongall nation States. In so asserting our firmcommitment to its ideals  we  therefore  rededicateourselves to its objectives. Indeed  from nearly everyperspective  this Organization continues to cater tothe common aspirations of the internationalcommunity. Today  with its increased image as acentre for harmonization  the vision of its CharterMembers has expanded across its original spectrumof engagement.“Accordingly  as one of its visionaries whoactively participated in its creation  we felt itpropitious that — despite our recent civil conflictand its heart-rending accounts — we be personallyrepresented at this fifty-second session  not only toreaffirm our commitment to multilateralism  but alsoto explore new ways of transforming our hopes forsolidarity into concrete actions for peace anddevelopment; not only to make a ceremonialrepresentation  but also to add frankness to the scopeof discussions for the improvement of ourOrganization.“On 19 July  the eve of the sesquicentennialanniversary of our independence  the people ofLiberia went to the polls and made a forthrightdecision for a great new beginning for democracy for representative government within a constitutionalorder  and for peace and prosperity in the forward25march towards the twenty-first century. In thatmomentous exercise  the Liberian people demonstratedonce again  as they had done throughout 150 years ofsurvival  their resilience and unconquerable will toovercome imponderable odds  to keep alive the flameof national independence in Africa.“Jawaharlal Nehru  India’s first Prime Minister at the birth of his nation defined independence as themoment ’when an age ends  and the soul of thenation  long suppressed  finds utterance’.“Thus  when the tragic events of our nationalexperience in the recent past are viewed within thecontext of historical inevitability  we can safely saythat the elections of 19 July 1997 gave rise to a newlyliberated soul of the Liberian nation.“It is in this light that we see the landslidevictory of 19 July 1997 as the final coming togetherof all of our people in a national embrace of unity togive vibrancy to the liberated national soul. The votetook place during the week of the solemn celebrationof the 150-year anniversary of the founding of thenation. It was a vote rooted in renewed hope  whichconcurs with what one writer refers to as ’idealismsuffused with a sense of ending’. The people voted toend civil war and national turbulence and to begin anew era of peace  stability  democracy  responsiblegovernment and prosperity.“We have fully grasped the message of ourpeople’s verdict. Upon our inauguration on 2 August1997  we set out to form a Government of inclusion.We have also embarked on a process of nationalreconciliation. We have invited all Liberians irrespective of political party affiliation  religiousorientation and ethnic origin  to come and join handswith us in rebuilding our country. We have assured allthat our primary objective is to foster national unity asthe best hope for genuine peace and progress in ourcountry.“We have also reaffirmed the 1986 Constitutionas the Organic Law of Liberia. That Constitutionguarantees and protects the fundamental rights andfreedoms of all alike. We are committed to makingthat sacred document work. Our Administration willguarantee and promote the functioning of a credibleand independent judiciary. We shall also protecthuman rights and freedom of the press. Above all  weshall endeavour to promote internal stability througha Government of inclusion and national unity.“Our experience as a nation convinces us thatthe right to self-determination is a necessaryprerequisite for any people to ensure nationaldevelopment and to play a meaningful role in thecommunity of nations. The right to self-determination is not  in our view  limited toliberation from external control  but also applies toliberation from internal tyranny. It is beingdemonstrated time and again that it is unhealthy forexternal support to be tied to the survival of aparticular regime rather than to the growth anddevelopment of the nation. There is no substitute forlegitimacy and good governance. Internal liberationawakens a new consciousness about peace  security stability and conflict resolution within a society. Theinstitutions of the market economy are strengthened and the people develop greater hope for a decent andbetter standard of living.“In this connection  and based on ourexperience  Liberia will continue to play the role ofpromoting regional peace and security  fosteringnational development through regional andsubregional integration and promoting democraticvalues through institution-building.“We are aware of the significant changes whichare taking place  including the increased tendencytowards political pluralism and democratization  therise in economic growth in a number of countriesand the upsurge towards market economies  as wellas progress towards the liberalization andglobalization of the world economy.“The end of the cold war has resulted in arelaxation of tension  particularly between worldPowers  and improved interactions among andbetween States. My Government must neverthelessregister its grave concern that since the advent of thehistoric fiftieth anniversary of this Organization some regional conflicts which appeared on the vergeof resolution have defied settlement. We are deeplydisturbed by ongoing conflicts in Africa  the MiddleEast  Europe and Asia. Historical evidence hasshown that conflicts  whether in Africa or elsewhere will have negative consequences  not only for thecountries directly affected  but also for theirneighbours and the regions of which they are a part.Liberians know only too well the consequences of a26protracted conflict and therefore urge all parties to thevarious conflicts to seek a negotiated settlement oftheir differences.“In recent times  several unfavourabledevelopments have continued to threaten internationalpeace and security. At present  in the Middle East  theconflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authorityis permeated with accusations  charges and counter-charges  despite the signing of the Agreement of 28September 1995. In spite of the fact that efforts topacify the situation are being undermined  we urgeStates within the region which are taking concretesteps  as well as the international community  to givemore attention to ensuring that the peace processremains on course.“Within our subregion  while we draw immensesatisfaction from the fact that the Liberian crisis hasfinally ended and the Liberian people have achieveddurable peace and stability  we lament the reality ofthe threatening situation which recently has developedin neighbouring Sierra Leone. This matter truly leavesmuch to be desired  and we cannot overemphasize thefact that it is in the best interests of Liberia and itsneighbours that peace be soon established in SierraLeone and its people reconciled.“Liberia  a member of the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Fiveon Sierra Leone  is committed to a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Sierra Leonean crisis. Weare of the firm conviction that it is our responsibilityto ensure security and stability within our subregion.“Notwithstanding the individual and collectiveefforts of African States to achieve socio-politicaltransformation  acts of destabilization continue to posea serious threat to these countries. That is why Africancountries have intensified cooperation at the regionaland subregional levels to stem this trend. We welcomethe growing cooperation between the United Nationsand regional organizations in the fulfilment of ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter  and the renewedcommitment to conflict resolution through preventivediplomacy  peacekeeping and peace-building.“In the economic sphere  recent conscientiousefforts have resulted in the registration of positivesigns in the revitalization of the global economy. Thisprogressive trend has been taking place against thebackdrop of explosive growth in world trade andprivate investment flows. In the meantime developing countries have thus far contributed 70per cent of the growth in global gross domesticproduct and half of the growth in world trade.Notwithstanding this  the gap between developed anddeveloping countries continues to grow  leavingmany countries behind amidst the general positiveeconomic progress occurring in the world. Moreimportantly  official development assistance requiredto fill the gap in resource depletion has fallen to itslowest point in real terms during the past 23 years thereby forcing many of the world’s poorestcountries deeply into debt  and making it virtuallyimpossible for them to undertake or sustaineconomic reforms.“This situation has affected most developingcountries  particularly those in Africa which continueto experience the crippling impact of external debt deteriorating terms of trade and decline ininvestment and financial flows. While weacknowledge that the development of the Africancontinent is primarily the responsibility of its people we hope that Africa’s development will  ofnecessity  remain an area of concern to theinternational community. We commend theSecretary-General for his continuing initiatives forthe development of Africa. The Government ofJapan also deserves Africa’s appreciation for helpingto sensitize the international community to the needto assist African countries to overcome the negativetrends which are impacting on their economies.“Closely related to the issues of development isthat of the environment. The human impact on theenvironment has increased dramatically  withunprecedented effects on mankind. Nevertheless  weremain hopeful that the growing awareness of thedegradation of the environment and the need toreverse this trend will remain a priority on the globalagenda. In this connection  my Governmentcommends the holding of the recent high-levelmeeting convened by the United Nations to reviewprogress on the implementation of decisions reachedon Agenda 21 since the 1992 Rio Conference onEnvironment and Development.“The Government of Liberia is concerned aboutthe alarming incidence of drug trafficking and drugabuse  which have already destroyed and continue toruin countless lives. While this unfortunatedevelopment has undermined the integrity of many27Governments  we commend cooperative effortsbetween Governments that have taken bold action toprevent and eradicate drug trafficking and drug abuse.We welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal tomerge the Crime Prevention and Criminal JusticeDivision and the United Nations International DrugControl Programme.“The Liberian Government is prepared to workvery closely with the international community in orderto bring success to the international campaign thatstrives to undermine the production of and traffickingin illicit drugs. We are assured in this connection that working in the framework of international cooperationand given our commitment  we are bound to succeedin our efforts to make our world a safer place forourselves and our children.“Regarding the restructuring of the SecurityCouncil  we must recall that with the founding of thisOrganization we committed ourselves and succeedinggenerations to continuously preserve peace andsecurity in our world. Let us remember that peace willbe elusive in the world where social  economic andpolitical rights are flouted. In this connection  and inview of the Security Council’s primary role in themaintenance of international peace and security  itsreform is of particular urgency. We note theemergence during the fifty-first session of the growingconsensus to restructure the Council so as to ensurethat it becomes more representative and democratic.This would encourage the advent of a greater balancebetween the requirement of efficiency and that ofexpansion  as well as transparency in its method ofwork. Moreover  with optimum utilization of theresources of those Member States that can contributesignificantly to peacekeeping operations  immensesuccesses will redound to the credit of thisOrganization.“Due to the far-reaching implications for globalpeace of the Security Council’s decisions and actions there have been persistent demands to expand itsmembership to reflect geographic balance and ensureequitable representation. Besides  of the fifteenmembers of the Council  five enjoy the veto power.The right of veto  we believe  is against the principleof universality and leaves the fate of our world to bedecided by only a few Members of the UnitedNations.“Accordingly  Liberia joins the call forexpanded membership of the Security Council. Wealso request that  as the region with the singlelargest number of Members  Africa be given twopermanent seats on the Council. We further call forthe elimination of the veto power.“Liberia believes that no country or institutioncan prosper if it is resistant to change — the UnitedNations being no exception. In this connection  weagree with the Secretary-General’s decision toinstitute reforms in the administrative andoperational aspects of the Organization.Notwithstanding this  we support a reform processthat does not diminish the capacity of the UnitedNations to perform the Charter-mandated functionsin the area of development  more especially to meetthe needs of developing countries. We are  therefore heartened by the Secretary-General’s indication thatsavings accrued from the exercise will be utilized toestablish an economic- and social-developmentaccount for the sole purpose of financingdevelopment programmes launched by the UnitedNations. We note that $200 million will be saved fordevelopment by the year 2002.“The issue of sanctions has occupied muchtime and energy here over the years  and Liberia like other African nations and nations around theworld  has watched sanctions succeed  and fail  as ameans of encouraging change. Sanctions’ greatesttriumph was perhaps in South Africa  whereinternational sanctions isolated the racist apartheidregime and contributed to its eventual downfall.“But unfortunately  as we know  sanctions arenot always so successful. Time and again  nationssingled out for punitive sanctions have been able tocircumvent the edicts of this world body and obtainthe goods or the weapons they seek. Still worse  theleaders of these nations  who are the real targets ofthe political and economic pressure that sanctionsare meant to deliver  often feel no pain. Sadly  it isthe innocent people — already the victims of theseregimes — who suffer the most. On balance  then our Government is sceptical about sanctions as atool for change. Unless they are universally adopted strictly enforced and carefully designed to achievespecific political goals  we believe that sanctions cantoo easily end up harming those they are designed tohelp.28“The Liberian civil war was to a great extent  aprotest against the blatant disregard for and violationof the rights of Liberians. At the end of seven years ofcivil war  the need to consolidate peace is of thehighest priority to my Government. It is essential tonational survival and the sustenance of our newlycreated democracy that the post-war reconciliationpolicy be firmly grounded in developing a culture andtradition consistent with international norms of respectfor basic human rights.“In furtherance of this objective  my Governmenthas initiated a process to create by law a NationalCommission on Human Rights that will operateindependently and that will investigate  document andreport cases of human rights violations. Additionally the post of Deputy Minister for Human Rights hasbeen created within the Ministry of Justice  withspecific responsibility to ensure the protection of basichuman rights.“Since its inauguration on 2 August  ourGovernment has taken prompt and appropriate stepsthat will protect the rights of all people  whethercitizens or aliens  residing in the country. As atestimony to this commitment  some immigrationofficers were dismissed when they were found guiltyof having brutalized some alleged aliens. Additionally a private lawyer successfully filed a writ of habeascorpus against the Minister of Justice  theCommissioner of Immigration and the Director ofPolice for detaining a number of aliens for over forty-eight hours without the formal charge required. Thelawyer won the case and the aliens were released.“Without a doubt  we as a Government are awarethat we are being keenly observed  as if through amicroscope  both internally and externally.Accordingly  we do not intend to water down ourpromise that matters relating to human rights will bekept clean and our record maintained unadulterated.As a candidate for the presidency  we made itabundantly clear that  when elected  there would be nowitch-hunting. On this account  we stand to bechallenged.“We are witnesses to the rapid growth of theglobal village through advances in technology communications and tolerance  which  too  haveencouraged world peace and stability. Indeed  whenthe illustrious architects of this noble Organizationconceived the idea  from the Dumbarton OaksConference to the Yalta Conference  before drawingup the United Nations  the world was not as it istoday. From its original membership of 51 nations in1945  the United Nations now has an impressivemembership of 185 nations. Out of this number  28have been admitted just since 1990  the latest beingPalau  in 1994.“The parallel existence of the People’sRepublic of China and the Republic of China oneither side of the Taiwan Strait constitutes for mycountry  a founding Member of the Organization one of the difficulties and the source of the prevalentsense of frustration that continue to persist on theinternational political scene since the end of the coldwar.“It really begs the issue to review the decisionof the General Assembly on 25 October 1971  whenits Members voted to admit the People’s Republic ofChina to membership while ignoring a compromiseproposal that the Republic of China retain a seat inthe General Assembly. My country  a life-longsupporter of the principle of including every nationin the United Nations system  feels that there shouldbe a re-examination of the proposal to which I havejust referred  with a view to admitting the Republicof China to the General Assembly. Quite clearly existing global realities make it necessary andprudent for us to review the action taken in 1971.We believe that the United Nations is the properinstrument for the correction of many seeminglyintractable problems. We would add that thisOrganization is the most significant internationalforum for the resolution of complex crises and thatall nations that desire to participate in the UnitedNations should have that right. Yet  in the highestsense  we believe that until reunification is achievedthe parallel participation in the United Nations of thePeople’s Republic of China and the Republic ofChina would be conducive to regional security andworld peace.“One of the principal challenges facing Liberiatoday is the revitalization of its economy. The pastprosperity of the Liberian economy was built on thesuccessful development of the country’s abundantnatural resources and the active participation of theprivate sector. We also enjoyed the benefits of alively transit trade with our neighbours. During theyears of economic mismanagement and civil strife 29the economy collapsed and the livelihood of ordinarypeople was impaired.“Bringing prosperity back to the country is anenormous challenge. We are determined that thebenefits of such prosperity should reach all the peopleof Liberia  and not merely the privileged few. I amconvinced that the private sector has a key role toplay. The management of the economy must betransparent and cost effective. The burden of externaldebt  which we inherited  needs to be addressed. Apositive relationship with the international financialinstitutions is central to the success of ourreconstruction programme. We need an early infusionof financial resources on favourable terms to launchthe post-war reconstruction programmes.“Private-sector operations in rubber  timber andmining will provide jobs and earn foreign exchangefor the country. We need to create a favourableclimate for new investment. This means that the fiscalregime must be reformed and simplified and that taxesbe paid to the Government. My Government hasalready implemented a programme to centralize allrevenue collection under the Ministry of Finance. Ourexchange rate and currency practices are beingreviewed in order to guide local and foreign investorsand inform them about the transaction costs of doingbusiness.“In managing the economy we must make thebest use of scarce resources. There is no place in thenew Liberia for ineffective public corporations and abloated civil service that are a drain on the budget.Revenue collection is being tightened up  expenditurestrictly controlled  and the budget used as the mainvehicle for prudent fiscal management and publicaccountability. Given our very limited resources  thiswill mean that many priority projects will have towait.“Liberia’s external debt to international financialinstitutions and other external creditors  inherited fromprevious Governments  imposes a huge burden on myGovernment. We believe that the size of that burden coupled with the cost of rebuilding a shattered society makes it essential that the international communitymake special concessions.“My Government intends to manage publicfinances in accordance with the high standardsexpected of any good government. But we cannotconsolidate the transition from war to peace unlessimmediate funds are available to run the machineryof government and to start up the reintegrationprogrammes designed by donors  in consultationwith our Government.“I stand here in this great Hall and beforehonoured representatives of independence as therepresentative of a nation that only 75 days agounderwent a free  fair and peaceful election —perhaps one of the most transparent elections everheld anywhere in the world. I hail from a nationalheritage which  more than a century and half ago was born out of enslavement  servitude and racismand which progressed from thence to freedom andindependence  and my proud homeland  in itsstruggle to maintain its sovereignty andindependence  lost almost half of its territory toexternal Powers. Indeed  I speak of a land of libertythat has passed through more than its share ofpolitical crucibles.“We have come  but not in anger. Rather  wehave emerged from a stained past of self-inflictedsuffering  which is perhaps not the surest rationalefor qualifying. But our scars enable us to speak  withsome constraint  at nearly first hand about how wehave been able to survive and keep our dignity as asovereign State and people. We ask that theAssembly accord us the requisite attention  whileretaining the hope that the experience of conflictresolution in Liberia and the engagement of theUnited Nations and the international community  incollaboration with the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) through itspeacekeeping instrument  the Economic Communityof West African States Monitoring Group(ECOMOG)  which helped restore peace andharmony to Liberia  will enlighten members onfuture undertakings in the arena of civil conflict.“In all candour  if there is anything ofsubstance that must be said  it is this: Let us neveragain allow any form of human anguish to be left inisolation  no matter how meaningless it may appearin the eyes of controlling Powers. Should it not beunderstood that one human tear is just as painful asanother and that the entire globe is united by thesame life-generating substance?“We have come to the United Nations toadvocate international cooperation. Let us not close30our eyes to the countless failures in the achievementof our common objectives as we enter the twenty-firstcentury. Let us take note of the dangers and worktogether so that reason can prevail. The economicproblems and social dangers the world faces areimmense  and we have no right to postpone solutionsor open the door to conflict and instability. Strategicconfrontation dominated the best minds of thiscentury. Perhaps it is now time to turn our eyes uponourselves  upon our peoples and our societies  toassess their condition  their moral needs and theircrises  and to attempt to find solutions.“To conclude  I wish to make an appeal to theheart  without distinction as to creed  dogma political colour or national faction. I should likeeach of us to look the other in the eye and askourselves sincerely and frankly: Is this the world ourchildren deserve? Will we be satisfied when  in thenear future  the voice of history and of our bloodsummons us to judgement? The United Nationssystem and the entire international community willbe judged on the basis of their response to thoseimportant questions.”"
"94",4064,"LBY",52,1997,"﻿Allow me  at the outset  to express toMr. Udovenko  on behalf of my country’s delegation  our21warm congratulations on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at this session. His election to thathigh post is a tribute of the international community to hisfriendly country and a reflection of the confidence of theMembers of the United Nations in his ability to shoulderthis heavy responsibility.By the same token  we express our great appreciationto his predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  for the greatefficiency with which he conducted the affairs anddeliberations of the Assembly at its previous session.Furthermore  I wish on this occasion to express mycountry’s gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for theunrelenting efforts he has made since his assumption of hispost to enhance the role  efficiency and effectiveness of theUnited Nations.Some people have thought that the end of the so-calledcold war would be conducive to the creation of favourableconditions for equitable and healthy international relationsbased on mutual respect and fruitful and constructivecooperation among human communities. However  what theSecretary-General has rightly described as a period of“frenzy” has not taken long to lay such assumptions to restand wreak havoc in several regions of the world. Thisfrenzy is the product of the new unipolar system in whichone country sits alone on the top. This singularity hasemboldened that country to continue to spread itshegemony  expand the area and scope of its aggression andimpose its conditions  concerned only with its own interestsand ignoring those of others. It has even fought against theinterests of its own allies. Those who have exposed thesetrends and refused to pay homage and obeisance except toGod have been labelled outlaws.The end of the so-called cold war deprived the worldof that balance of power which had  in the past  provideda protective umbrella for all small  poor and weakcountries. It has even protected other countries as well. Themost important need on the international scene today is towork seriously to establish any kind of international balanceto preserve the little that has remained of States’independence  freedom of thought and action  and then toreverse the negative effects of the period of frenzy  whichis still with us  although it has somewhat receded.The United Nations has been manipulated by the onlysuper-Power  which sits alone at the top  against certainpeoples  States and even regions that have joined thisOrganization in search of protection  security  peace andcooperation. The United States of America has managed topush the Security Council into adopting resolutions outsideits competence against whoever has said “no” to unilateralhegemony and tyranny or defended the independence oftheir countries and their ability to take free decisions andhave free choices. These resolutions adopted at the heightof the period of frenzy at the beginning of thisdecade were falsely described as being consistent withinternational legality  while in reality there was nothinglegal or international about them. They were adoptedthrough diktat and by the use of threats directed at thecapitals of the States concerned in order to ensure theircontinued applicability.Paragraphs 102 and 103 of the report of theSecretary-General on the reform process (A/51/950)clearly and unequivocally show that these resolutions notonly lack international legality but also that they shouldbe reviewed and rescinded.Globalization which means only the imposition ofthe interests  language  culture  values and customs of theone and only Power at the top is not globalization. It ismerely a crowning of that Power as head of the entireworld. Proof of this can be found in the greatcontradiction between words and deeds. Its leaders callfor the liberalization of international trade  then enactlegislation imposing one embargo after another on themovement of goods and capital against those countriesand peoples that want to remain independent and free intheir decision-making. They punish  through their ownlegislation  whoever in the world cooperates with it.What was published today in The New York Timesregarding cooperation between a company located in aState which is an ally of the United States  and Iran is theclearest evidence of the truth of what we are stating.They are the ones who dictate economic embargoresolutions against countries and peoples and thenunilaterally follow up their implementation. Moreover  itis these same quarters that work to disarm countries andselectively destroy whatever weapons they have  whileallowing only themselves and their allies  to the exclusionof everyone else  to manufacture  possess and acquirearmaments. The same quarters provide money  men technology  and know-how to a select group of countriesin order that they may establish and develop a militaryindustry capable of producing all types of conventionalweapons and even weapons of mass destruction  and ifnecessary would send their armies and fleets to fight attheir sides.22They call for the protection of human rights whilerefusing to acknowledge human rights for anybody but theirown people. This is the case in the denial of the right of thetwo Libyan citizens to a fair and neutral trial.It is the same country that calls for the combating ofterrorism and then goes on to label self-defence  thedefence of honour and resistance against foreign occupiers as terrorism. They call for democracy and then support andfinance those who oppose democracy  especially if thosewho come to power are against the influence in theircountry of the only super-Power.These examples of the contradiction between wordsand deeds  between propaganda and the executive policiesand legislative positions of the very same Power  clearlyshow that the call for globalization is not intended for thegood of the world. In reality the world reaps nothing but aname.The African continent  which is considered the mostunderdeveloped part of the world as we stand at the end ofthe twentieth century  is not  in fact  responsible for itsbackwardness. A brief review of Africa’s history and adiscerning look at its present state of affairs readily showthat all the problems  without exception  Africa faces —whether they be problems of political instability in some ofits regions or economic underdevelopment in most  if notall  its countries — are caused by those who colonized anddrew the political borders of the African countries.Not one single African country has drawn its ownborders with its neighbours. It was the colonial countrieswhich did that  dividing tribes  clans and communitiesamong different countries and thus sowing the seeds of thecurrent social tensions in many parts of the continent at anearly time. This was a deliberate act carried out under theinfamous policy of “divide and rule”.Not only did they draw the borders  but they alsolooted the natural resources  which they now monopolize.Any country that dares to free its resources is quicklysurrounded by embargoes. They use all the financial andeconomic institutions  including the so-called internationalinstitutions  in a manner that deprives these countries of anychoice but to surrender to their conditions or face theconsequences of confronting them. The responsibility forwhat happened during the past epoch and for whatcontinues to occur in our African continent should beshouldered by those who caused it in the first place.The slogan “Africa should help itself”  thoughseemingly innocent  is misleading  because it involves anattempt at avoiding the responsibility for theconsequences of the acts of those who sowed the seeds ofall this in the not-so-distant past. This is still fresh in thememory of current generations. Those who do care forAfrica do not impose conditions for assisting Africa.Africa is ready to cooperate with those who are willing tohelp  but cannot accept dealing with those who dictate toit.My country would like to endorse the positionoutlined here in the General Assembly and at the SecurityCouncil meeting devoted to Africa by President RobertMugabe  President of Zimbabwe and current Chairman ofthe Organization of African Unity (OAU). This is theposition of all Africa and all Africans. From this rostrum my country salutes President Mugabe. We confirm whathe said: Africa does not ask for charity from anybody.We urge those who seek permanent membership inthe Security Council to remember Africa all the time  andnot only when they need the votes of its countries in theGeneral Assembly to help them take over posts and seatsin various councils and committees. We urge them  andothers  to review the standards and criteria for theirrelations with the African countries before it is too late.Allow me to recall what one of Africa’s leaders said15 years ago. His country used to export one ton of cocoain order to import one tractor. Now it has to export 12tons of cocoa in order to import one tractor. Thisastronomical increase in the price of manufactured goodscompared with the price of raw materials in the space of15 years is a sufficient reply to all the questions raisedabout the relationships of others with Africa in variousfields. This very example explains some of the causes ofthe suffering in several African countries  at variouslevels.We would like to say here to both old and newcolonialists alike: Hands off Africa  then Africa will knowhow to help itself.The truth of what we have been saying all alongconcerning the Palestinian question has been proved toeverybody. Everyone here has seen and heard about thepractices of the Israeli occupation authorities in Palestineand the other occupied Arab territories  from the Golan tosouthern Lebanon  or rather  all of Lebanon. The SecurityCouncil held meetings to consider the situation in theseterritories  but those meetings were aborted by the23American veto. The General Assembly held a specialsession on the matter  and what was the result? Nothing.This would explain what the region is facing these days and what is in gestation now is even more dangerous thanwhat is being witnessed today.The Iraqi people are not only starving and dying; theyare suffering from something more serious than hunger andmore dangerous than death. It is known that some Iraqiindividuals have been forced to sell body parts  such askidneys  to feed their children for a little while. What kindof international legality can justify the continued applicationof sanctions that lead to such results? How can any claimsbe accepted now from those who pay lip service to so-called human rights  yet do not apply them except to servetheir political ends? How is it then possible to allow thepartition of Iraq and the violation of the inviolability of itsborders and its territory by foreigners and their armedforces? It is the United Nations which is responsible forthis situation  since it created the conditions that led to thissituation and has provided the cover for what is happeningin Iraq. It is now the United Nations responsibility toredress this situation to which it has given rise.My country overlooks the Mediterranean  with a coastthat extends for about 2 000 kilometres. That is why we arevery keen on making the Mediterranean a lake of peace andcooperation for its coastal States. However  this is madeimpossible by the presence of foreign military bases andforeign fleets that undermine the region’s stability andrepresent a permanent source of danger. This presence hasbeen the cause of our continued concern  because we havesacrificed half our population for our freedom. Three timesa year  we celebrate the anniversaries of the evacuation offoreign troops from our country. Peace  stability andcooperation in the Mediterranean will be possible onlywhen foreign military bases are eliminated  when foreignfleets are withdrawn from its waters.My country  like the rest of the developing world welcomes the international conventions aimed at theprohibition and elimination of weapons of mass destruction.We believe that this is in the interest of mankind as awhole. However  the resumption of nuclear tests  under anypretext  is a great source of disappointment because theyare a violation of the international conventions concludedin this field. The possession by Tel Aviv of nuclearweapons has placed the entire eastern Arab region under adirect threat  constant dangers and definite instability.Without technical and financial support  without theexperts and scientists who are part and parcel of thissupport  such weapons would not have been produced inthe region. It is well known — indeed  it has beendeclared — that tests are now being conducted on long-range missiles that could deliver these weapons of massdestruction to their targets in Arab and Muslim landsalike. Tests are also being conducted on anti-missilemissiles  as part of the strategic cooperation betweenWashington and Tel Aviv.On the other hand  all Iraqi weapons have beendestroyed. Preparations are being made to destroy all theweapons of the Arabs and Muslims  who are helpless andwhose territories are occupied. Alliances are being forgedto surround the Arabs and Muslims so as to prevent themfrom ever becoming powerful and so as to secure forWashington their oil  their gas and their markets.This is the truth  however bitter it may be for usArabs and Muslims to swallow. My country would like toalert the world to the real sources of danger  not thefictitious ones — that is  those being used to fabricatecauses and pretexts to justify the destruction andrecolonization of the rest of the world.It is not Libya  nor Syria  nor Iraq  nor Iran nor theSudan which constitute any danger  by any measure  tothe security of the region or the security and peace of theworld. The real danger to international peace and securitylies in Washington and Tel Aviv  and those who emulatethem. They both possess and manufacture weapons ofmass destruction. Washington manufactures them andWashington exports them. This is while the countries towhich I have referred do not manufacture weapons and moreover  have been prevented by America fromimporting any such weapons. America has imposed aninternational arms embargo against those countries. It hasdestroyed Iraqi weapons  and is now preparing to destroythe conventional and even the obsolete weapons possessedby others.This is the law of the United States against whichthese countries have rebelled. Thus they were labelled“rogues”. This is the new and old form of discrimination.This is the newest form of anti-Semitism.We call for emptying the region of the Arab East ofweapons of mass destruction  which Tel Aviv owns. Theplants that manufacture these weapons should besubjected to international safeguards and controls. Wealso call for investigating the financial and technicalsupport that enabled Tel Aviv to produce these weapons.We must criminalize this support and those who provide24it. The agreements of military strategic cooperation betweenWashington and Tel Aviv are hostile instruments  targetingthe region as a whole and its peoples. This providesevidence of the real intentions of the United States towardsthe region and its peoples  voids its allegations andargumentations with respect to disarmament and reveals itsintentions.We highlight these issues to show the world the extentof the injustice to which we have been subjected and towhat extent the United States of America is deceivingeverybody.The United States used to have five military bases inmy country. It had monopolized the production and exportof Libyan oil and gas. The United Kingdom also had anumber of military bases in Libya. Through its owncompany  British Petroleum  it also produced and exportedour oil.With the advent of the revolution of 1 September1969  Libya immediately evacuated the military bases ofthose two countries and later liberated its oil wealth fromtheir companies.However  under international conditions that theSecretary-General has rightly called a period of frenzy  thetwo countries thought that the time was ripe for a return towhat they were forced to relinquish and to regain control ofthe 2 000-kilometre-long Libyan coastline  adjacent to thethree old continents of Africa  Asia and Europe. Theybelieved the time was ripe to regain control of mycountry’s oil  gas and market  as well as neighbouringmarkets. Once finished with the Gulf War  they turned theirattention to Libya. However  the two countries were unableto find a pretext to realize their ambition of a new return toLibya except by resorting to allegations  which came to beknown later as the Lockerbie case.What is the real truth about Lockerbie? In brief  andprecisely  it is as follows. First  both the United States ofAmerica and the United Kingdom of Great Britain areaware  more than anybody else  that Libya has nothingwhatever to do with this aeroplane and the tragic incidentthat killed its passengers and crew.Second  both the United States of America and theUnited Kingdom claim that two Libyans placed a timebomb in a bag on board a Maltese Airlines flight that tookoff from Malta  and that the bag was unaccompaniedbaggage. They claim that this very bag  which was notaccompanied by a passenger  was transferred in Frankfurtairport from the Maltese Airlines aeroplane to anAmerican aeroplane destined for London. Once again they say  this same bag was transferred in London airportfrom the aircraft originating in Frankfurt to Pan AmFlight 103  which later took off from London andexploded over Lockerbie  Scotland.Can the Assembly imagine how an unaccompaniedbag can move by itself from one airplane to another andfrom one airport to another with such accuracy?Third  the Government of Malta investigated thematter and found that there were no unaccompanied bagson the flight in question. Malta announced the results ofthe investigation at the time.Fourth  the competent authorities in Germany  inturn  investigated the question and found nothing tocorroborate the story about the bag.Fifth  in any case  my country  despite the knownobjectives of the authors of the accusation  dealt seriouslyand pragmatically with the accusation. We informed allconcerned parties that we had begun implementation ofthe provisions of the 1971 Montreal Convention for theSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of CivilAviation. The legal authorities in Libya began exercisingtheir legal jurisdiction in accordance with thatConvention.Sixth  my country asked the two countries concernedto hand over to Libyan judicial authorities the results oftheir investigations so they could be used in ourinvestigation. This request was rejected.Seventh  my country then asked the two countries tosend investigators to Libya to participate in theinvestigation. Once again they refused.Eighth  my country then offered to send its judicialofficials to meet with the competent authorities in boththe United States and the United Kingdom to peruse thefile on this question. This offer was turned down.Ninth  Libya also offered to let a neutral party orparties to carry out the investigation. The two countriesrefused that offer.Tenth  once again  my country proposed that theUnited Nations should carry out the investigation. Thatproposal was rejected.25Eleventh  in a letter addressed to the Foreign Ministerof the United Kingdom and the United States Secretary ofState by the Secretary of the General People’s Committeefor Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation  mycountry requested that article 14 of the 1971 MontrealConvention be invoked. That request was refused.Twelfth  Libya proposed resorting to the InternationalCourt of Justice to decide the case. That proposal wasturned down by the other parties. And when my countryunilaterally took the case to the International Court ofJustice  the parties concerned quickly turned the wholeissue from a legal to a political one  submitting it to theSecurity Council to prevent the International Court ofJustice from deciding the case. Here we have the SecurityCouncil dealing with an issue pertaining to two citizens ofa country. The issue is now five years old. So the issue isbefore the Security Council precisely to prevent theInternational Court of Justice from deciding the case sincethe matter was put before the Security Council  despite thefact that Libya  naturally  had resorted to the InternationalCourt of Justice before the matter was even referred to theSecurity Council.This is how this legal question was politicized. Whendid that occur? This was done at the peak of the “frenzy”period  on 21 January 1992. Nobody at the time could sayno to the United States of America. As we all know  theSecurity Council  under well-known and frankly recognizedpressures  adopted resolution 731 (1992) which did notstipulate any surrender of the suspects  but requested aresponse to the demands of the countries concerned. Irepeat  it did not provide for surrendering the suspects.Thirteenth  my country has fully responded to theprovisions of the resolution both in terms and content bycooperating with the United Kingdom on the question ofthe Irish Republican Army  and with the Frenchinvestigating judge in all the demands he made.Furthermore  we agreed to a trial for the two Libyansuspects in a fair and neutral court.Fourteenth  the aim of both the United States and theUnited Kingdom has not been to discover the real culprit inthis regrettable and tragic airplane incident. They alreadyknow who the responsible party is. Their real objective hasbeen to use the whole issue  including the human blood thatwas shed  to achieve their own political objectives which Ihave already elucidated. To achieve that end  they exploitedthe Security Council once again  pushing it to adoptresolution 748 (1992) which imposes a near total embargoon Libya and its dealings with the rest of the world. TheCouncil also adopted resolution 883 (1993)  whichcomplemented the previous resolution.Fifteenth  in the face of all this intransigence andarrogance  when all efforts and mediation failed toconvince the two countries concerned to opt for dialogueand negotiations; since they had earlier unilaterallysevered their diplomatic relations with my country; andbecause my country has no extradition treaty with eitherof the two countries  we resorted to regional andinternational organizations. Today  we would like to puton record  as always  our deepest appreciation to theseorganizations for their support and for their stand infavour of what is right. Those organizations  let us recall represent more than two thirds of the internationalcommunity.We hasten to confirm that the other third is notagainst us; rather  its States are simply not members ofthose organizations. The League of Arab States  theOrganization of African Unity  the Organization of theIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement haveall supported my country and expressed their appreciationfor my country’s flexibility in our handling of the issue as well as for the positive initiatives we have proposed.Sixteenth  the League of Arab States and theOrganization of African Unity  through the Hararesummit  under the chairmanship of President RobertMugabe  have proposed that the trial of the two suspectsbe held in a neutral third country to be determined by theSecurity Council; that the two suspects be tried byScottish judges  under Scottish law  at the seat of theInternational Court of Justice in The Hague; or that aspecial criminal tribunal be established to try the twosuspects at the seat of the International Court of Justice inThe Hague.Seventeenth  both the Secretary-General of the ArabLeague and the Secretary-General of the Organization ofAfrican Unity came to United Nations Headquarters withthe resolutions of their respective organizations in hand resolutions that are supported by the Organization of theIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement.They submitted these resolutions to the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations and to the President of the SecurityCouncil and its member States. What was the reaction ofthe United States and the United Kingdom? Both rejectedthe requests made by other members of the Council andused the Council’s work mechanism — so-calledconsensus — to reject all proposals submitted by theirmajesties and excellencies  the kings and presidents of the26two organizations. Naturally  this was a shock to bothregional organizations because they were fully andarrogantly ignored.Eighteenth  on 25 September of this year  during theSecurity Council’s ministerial meeting on Africa  the entiremeeting became a forum for discussing the issue when itwas raised by His Excellency President Robert Mugabe President of Zimbabwe and current Chairman of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  in his address to theCouncil. Again  in the name of my country  its leader andpeople  I wish to express again our gratitude to PresidentMugabe for his honourable defence of the concerns and thecauses of Africa as a whole  and in particular his defenceof my country on this question.The issue was also raised by His ExcellencyMr. Salim Ahmed Salim  Secretary-General of OAU  andby most of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of theCouncil’s members. As we express our gratitude to all ofthem  we wish to confirm that their support would havenever been so forthcoming had we been wrong.Nineteenth  about a week ago  the Council of theLeague of Arab States decided to call on Arab States tomitigate some of the impacts of the sanctions imposed onmy country. We are grateful to the Council and to all ourbrothers. We realize that this is a step in the right directionand that it is but a mild reaction to their being ignored lastJuly.We ask you for justice. Members of the SecurityCouncil are not against my country. They have expressedthat in all our meetings with them. They further add thatour problem is with the United States and the UnitedKingdom. Our dispute is with the judge. How can anyoneexpect the Security Council to solve the problem when ouradversaries are both permanent members of the Council andpossess the veto power?Once again  our problem is with the United States andthe United Kingdom. We have no problem whatever withthe Security Council  and the Security Council has noproblem with us. Had these two countries accepted theproposals of the regional and international organizations had they showed respect for the States members of theseorganizations and for their presidents and representatives the Security Council would not have hesitated for onemoment to accept them. This is what we were told bymembers of the Council. We are not just saying that.My country calls on all of you to intervene so wecan reach a peaceful solution to this dispute  one thatwould accelerate the holding of the trial for the twosuspects before a fair and just court  in an atmospherefree from prior condemnation  in any place agreed upon or decided upon by the Security Council.The two suspects were advised by their Americanand Scottish lawyers against accepting a trial before anycourt in Scotland or the United States. This is because ofintensive media coverage and statements by officials inthe two countries which have created a climate and publicopinion that have convicted them in advance of any trial.This does not accord with their human right to receive ajust and fair trial. The fact that the United StatesGovernment has accorded Timothy McVeigh  accused inthe Oklahoma explosion  the right to change the venue ofhis trial from Oklahoma  where the crime occurred  toanother state — namely Colorado — is evidence ofrespect for one of the human rights — a respect whichshould not be restricted only to the citizens of the UnitedStates. This is because human rights should be enjoyed byall human beings  irrespective of their nationality. Humanrights should not be accorded to some and denied toothers.My country  at all levels of official responsibility has repeatedly condemned terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. We have disassociated ourselves from allsuspected terrorist practices. We have also repeatedlyasked the Secretary-General and the Security Council tosend a committee or envoys to ascertain on the groundthe validity of our claims.However  the refusal and objections of the UnitedStates prevented the Secretariat and the Security Councilfrom responding to our requests. This is one of the mainreasons why we have such strong suspicions about thetrue intentions of the United States against my country.This has also exposed its political objectives  for theattainment of which it did not hesitate to exploit humanblood.We call on the international community  asrepresented in this Assembly  to work towards reachinga solution as soon as possible.The United States refusal to allow this side issue —“the question of terrorism” — to be closed is aimed atserving the particular objectives of that country  objectiveswe have already referred to. Everybody knows that it wasthe United States which more than once committed27terrorist acts against my country  using its fleets and itsbombers. The most heinous of these acts was the barbaricraid on the night of 15 April 1986 against the residence andoffice of the Libyan brother leader  and against otherresidential neighbourhoods in both Tripoli and Benghazi. Inthis raid  tens of children  women and elderly weremartyred in their sleep. The United States cannot produceone shred of evidence to prove the so-called Libyanterrorism  whereas Libya has dozens of proofs of theterrorism perpetrated by the United States against Libya.The raid made on the night of 15 April 1986 is not asuspected perpetration of an act  as is the case with ourcitizens who are suspected by the United States. The raidof 15 April 1986 is an established fact whose consequencescan still be seen in the tombs of the martyrs in the famousEl-Hani Cemetery and in the remnants of buildings that stillclearly show the marks of bombs and rockets. And if all ofthis is far away in Tripoli and Benghazi  I am here beforeyou and I personally stand as a proof of the terrorism of theUnited States. These scars here on my face and on myhead  and on other parts of my body covered by myclothes  are the result of a bomb that an American aircraftdropped on my house  which was totally demolished thatnight. My young son  who was less than 10 years old at thetime  was also injured.We  who personally were victims of the Americanraid  resorted to the American judicial system here in theUnited States and brought a legal suit before an Americancourt. Despite all the evidence  the American judicialsystem rejected our case. This negative experience withAmerican justice would surely discourage anyone fromaccepting to be tried by such a judiciary  especially if theopposing party was the American Government. I personallytried to institute a lawsuit and had American lawyers. Myhouse is destroyed and erased from the Tripoli map. I havescars on my face  yet the case was rejected. And now weare to trust it and send our citizens before it? How?We cannot forget that crime. We will always call forthose who decided  planned and implemented it to appearbefore competent Libyan courts for trial. The crime tookplace in my country. They say that a crime took place inScotland? Fine. But another crime took place in Tripoli andBanghazi. Are their people citizens  and our people are notcitizens? We are also citizens of our own nation-State. Theyhave mere suspicions. We have facts not suspicions whichwere actually shown on American television screens.We believe that the reform of the United Nations is ofthe utmost importance to us. However  optimum results ofthis reform cannot be achieved unless the financialsituation of the Organization is put on the right track and most importantly  Member States must pay their assessedcontributions. The fact that the United States has renegedon its contractual commitments to the United Nations bynot paying its assessed contribution to the budget is thecause of the financial crisis from which the Organizationhas suffered for years. If the United Nations is to bereformed  that State must pay all of its arrears withoutconditions and promise to pay in future  on time andwithout pressures that aim to make the United Nations ahostage of the will and policies of that country.We know that that State is now pressuring membersof the General Assembly to make up for the lowering ofits contribution by 5 per cent. We know that nothing hasbeen decided yet regarding changes of assessment orcontributions. This is what we call sitting on top of thisunipolar world. This is what we are warning the world of.We would not have known that had we not been told bythose who are being pressured to pay the extra 5 per cent.The fact that they told us — the Libyans — clearly showsthat they are dissatisfied and that they obviously arerefusing. They cannot say no. But we can say no.Within the framework of the reform process  it isessential to have a complete review of the situation of theSecurity Council. By virtue of our experience with theSecurity Council — an experience I have just commentedon — we know and appreciate the importance andnecessity of reforming the Security Council andexpanding its membership. We believe that the reformshould focus first on improving the methods of work ofthe Council — its mechanisms — thus making itimpossible for any one country to hamper the work of theCouncil or make it irrelevant.My country  which a quarter of a century ago calledfor the abrogation of the veto power  would like toemphasize now that any reform of the Security Councilthat does not rescind the veto power would bemeaningless. There is no longer any historical orobjective reason for maintaining this power. It is notjustifiable by any standard of righteousness  justice andequality  and even under the standards of democracy  towhich certain countries pay lip service. At the same time we believe that the reform process will not be useful if itdoes not take into consideration the interests of allcountries and peoples.That is why my country will support any initiativethat would do away with the present imbalance in the28membership of the Security Council. In this respect  weshould like to underline the need to adhere to the proposalsof the Non-Aligned Movement  which are based on full sovereign equality among States; seek to apply theprinciple of equitable geographical distribution; andrespond to the demands of the developing countries which represent the majority of the Members of theUnited Nations.The General Assembly is the United Nations organthat truly embodies the universal and democratic characterof this international Organization. Since it is the onlyintergovernmental body with a mandate to discuss anyquestion or matter under the Charter  including themaintenance of international peace and security  Libyawould like to underline the wide-ranging and repeatedcalls for the need to invigorate the General Assembly andenhance its powers so as to increase its effectiveness inconfronting the ever-changing challenges that face theinternational community.Lastly  I wish to apologize for having taken up somuch of the Assembly’s time."
"95",4095,"LCA",52,1997,"﻿My delegation welcomesthe experience and expertise which Mr. HennadiyUdovenko brings to the leadership of this session of theGeneral Assembly  and would like to applaud hispredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for hisoutstanding contribution during the fifty-first session.We feel a quiet sense of elation that the Secretary-General has emerged as the personification of the newpossibilities of the United Nations. His recent succession tothe distinguished position of Secretary-General of this bodyis symbolic of the new vision and the new order whichheralds our entry into the twenty-first century.Our historical moment is a defining one. Change hasbrought us to the stage at which we can either transform orbe transformed. All of us — large as well as small nations individuals as well as Governments — are challenged tomake a decisive break with the old ways of doing andseeing things. The people of our planet continue to yearnfor justice  equality and fairness. The human spiritcontinues to thirst for all that is good and beautiful. Thesoul of humankind is still seeking to reinvent itself in waysthat are noble  kind  compassionate and caring. That is thenew wave that is beginning to swell on the cusp of the newmillennium  and we can discern its gathering momentum inthe emotive milestones of the past few months. Theexpression of universal public grief infused with privateintensity over the deaths of Mother Teresa and Diana Princess of Wales and the donation of $1 billion by TedTurner to United Nations charitable causes — these are theaffirmations of the emergent humanist temperament of thenew age.In these times  this body must welcome the inspirationof those who  by their example  generosity  selflessness andcourage  seek to protect the defenceless in a bid to reshapethe horizons of our common humanity. It is a global wavesweeping local shores as well as distant ones. In my owntropical corner of our global village  Saint Lucia  on 23May 1997 the people elected a new Government with adecisive mandate predicated on a vision of hope  changeand possibility.The wave of people’s aspirations at the national levelis faced with its own counter-turbulence in the conduct ofrelations among States. Arrayed against this popularimpulse for humanism in affairs of state is the assertion ofall that has been selfish  greedy and exploitative. Thepowerful continue to parade their might without any regardfor others. They exercise their influence without anycompassion  and accumulate their wealth without anycharity.The icons of free trade  market liberalization andeconomic liberalism represent the hardening of thearteries of human conscience in the sphere of commerce.The movement away from concerns of social andeconomic justice to the preoccupation with market forcesand economic rationality is leading inexorably to a newworld order at odds with the impulse of the world’sbillions for a more caring and compassionate world.At the level of the international system  we arewitnessing a rolling back of the structures of socialresponsibility  the progressive erosion of the capacity torespond and the annihilation of the will to act humanely.We see the inability to care for the welfare of the people the apathy towards their growing material deprivation and most frighteningly  the calculated institutional insensitivityto the plight of the disadvantaged who wish to continueto earn with dignity and by the sweat of their brows.There is no better example of this callous disregardthan the situation facing the African  Caribbean andPacific (ACP) countries  and in particular the bananaproducers of the Caribbean. Only last month  the smallbanana-producing countries of the Caribbean Communityreceived a particularly harsh and crushing blow  when theappeals board of the World Trade Organization (WTO)upheld an earlier finding that the preferential treatmentaccorded in the European market to bananas of theMember States of the ACP contravened World TradeOrganization rules on free trade.The intent behind the current move towardsglobalization as manifested in the World TradeOrganization is evidently most commendable. Indeed Saint Lucia was among the founding members of theWTO. We were led to believe that the World TradeOrganization would help raise the living standards of ourpeoples and  by emulating the ideals of the UnitedNations  would promote fairness in world trade. It wasour hope that it would end  once and for all  the law ofthe jungle as the dominant feature of internationalcommercial relations. In short  it was hoped that the WTOwould establish a standard of arbitration premised onfairness  civilized negotiation of vital interests and theinculcation of equity in international trade and commerce.The WTO ruling on the European banana regime isnothing short of a capitulation to the machinations ofthose who are blinkered by free trade and sheer greed.22We speak in these strong terms because the worldcommunity must understand that the WTO  and thecomplainants to the European banana regime  completelyand steadfastly ignored the fact that the import of its rulingis the economic and social destruction of a number of smallMember States of this body that together enjoy a miniscule2.5 per cent of the world trade in bananas and only 5 percent of the European market.Consider for a moment the flaws in the processthrough which the WTO’s dispute settlement body soughtto resolve this issue. The initial panel did not have a singlerepresentative from a developing country  although thematter was of utmost importance to developing countries.To render fair play even more remote  the appellate boardwas chaired by an American  despite the fact that theprincipal complainant was the United States of America.While that may have been permissible under the rules surely good sense and fairness should have dictated that itwas nothing but highly improper and undesirable. But then even the nature of the major complainant was improper: theUnited States of America does not produce a single bananafor export. Yet  while it activated and participated in theproceedings  we  the banana-producing countries  weredenied the right to full participation and were relegated tothe sidelines as spectators.The WTO has dismally failed to match up to thecommendable goals which inspired its creation. Theimplementation of the ruling will bring about a generalizedreduction in the living standards of our peoples and anacceleration of poverty.Far from providing reassurance of a civilized approachto resolving world trade disputes  the ruling leaves alingering suspicion that “might” will always be “right” andthat the strong and powerful will always be able to use thesystem to achieve their own ends  regardless of the humandislocation and suffering that result.If the World Trade Organization is to be of any valueto us small  developing countries  there must be afundamental reform of its system of dispute settlement. Thisis essential  because the implications of the scope of theruling on bananas are not confined to bananas. The rulingraises questions about other import arrangements foragricultural goods as well as the future of trade anddevelopment cooperation agreements between rich and poorcountries. The real challenge to the WTO is not howeffective its Dispute Settlement Body can be in rigidlyapplying the letter of its regulations  but  rather  whether theprocess by which decisions are arrived at is perceived asbeing fair. The system must be reformed so that it takesaccount of the consequences of the implementation of itsrulings. It must of necessity consider the impact of itsdecisions  particularly when  as in the case of the rulingon the banana regime  the affected countries have small vulnerable and fragile economies.Trade and development must  in the final analysis be about the development of people. Therefore  the WTOcriteria for settling disputes must be redesigned to takeinto account social  health  cultural and environmentalissues. If national security issues can be raised as a reasonwhy the law of one powerful country should not bebrought before WTO jurisdiction  then why should theWTO not take into account the special social andeconomic circumstances of small  vulnerable countries inits dispute deliberations? What is the point of the WTO’sDispute Settlement Body rigidly applying rules  when inso doing it takes decisions which are in direct contrast tothe very principles which justify its existence? In such asituation the principles become worthless and theorganization becomes amenable to manipulation.We do not seek international charity for our bananafarmers. We seek only fairness and opportunity. We arenot irrevocably opposed to free trade  but we need fairtrade. We are a proud people seeking to earn our livingin as honest a manner as the wealth of nations permits.The nations of the European Union entered into apartnership for development with us when  together  wesigned the Lomé Convention. We call upon them not tocast aside their solemn commitments and obligationsunder that Convention  as they respond to those who wantthis most unfair ruling by the World Trade Organizationimplemented immediately and in its entirety. We areheartened by the statements made so far by the EuropeanCommission expressing the European Union’s deepconcern about the negative political  economic and socialeffects of the WTO ruling on a number of countries fromthe African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group ofStates. We take comfort from the Commission’sexpression of its intention to take these factors intoaccount  and to stand by the European Union’sinternational obligations and the principles of itsdevelopment policy. We also welcome the statements ofsupport for Caribbean banana producers from theEuropean Parliament and its call for the revision of thecriteria used by the WTO in the resolution of tradedisputes. We look forward to working with the EuropeanUnion to find a formula which will allow us continuedaccess to the banana market in a manner which will23permit our farmers to continue earning a decent anddignified living. We urge the European Union to besteadfast in protecting the spirit and substance of itsobligations under the Lomé Convention  to remaincommitted to ensuring development and equity ininternational economic relations  and to remain faithful toits ACP friends.Such are the challenges confronting those who aresmall and weak  yet proud. It is within such a context of anuncertain international system that my country has to shapeits foreign policy. The changing characteristics of theinternational system have necessitated that we redefine theboundaries of our alliances. We must look beyond the seaof uncertainty to the mountains of possibility. Thecontemporary confluence of forces challenges us to createnew relationships to assist in our social and economicdevelopment. Having been forced out of our traditionalpartnerships  we must find new friends and reconstructrelationships. In this process  we must be guided by theimperative of finding and mobilizing new sources ofinvestment that are predicated on creating new paths tosustainable growth.For us  foreign policy is about building bridges toother people  other cultures and other markets. It is aboutcontributing to the emergence of a new climate of toleranceand international understanding; it is about matchingdomestic need with international possibility. Consistent withthese basic principles  Saint Lucia has proceeded in adirection in which the majority of the States of the worldhave already gone by establishing diplomatic links with thePeople’s Republic of China.Saint Lucia will always cherish the principles ofrespect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and the rule ofinternational law. All countries  regardless of size  musthave the comfort of these irrevocable principles and besecure in the confidence that the conduct of nations will beguided by them.It is in the context of these basic principles that weurge the United States of America to re-examine some ofits recent policies towards the States of the Caribbean. Itslead role in the challenge to our banana marketing regimehas damaged our peoples’ confidence in its declarations offriendship. Its new immigration laws are causingapprehension and dislocation for thousands of persons whooriginated from the Caribbean  and is eroding the bridgesbetween our peoples. The imminent deportation of personswho have lived for decades in the United States will createa humanitarian problem of mass proportions. This is nolonger a domestic matter. The consequences for thehuman rights of those affected have transformed it into asubject for international concern.In addition  the deportation of persons who havebecome hardened criminals to lands they do not know ashome is further rocking the social and economic fabric ofour democracies. If there is a law of unintendedconsequences  the United States of America must acceptthe negative repercussions of its policies. It must thereforeembark on corrective action to undo the damage whichthese policies have unleashed on the peoples of theCaribbean community.It is our concern for fairness  equity anddemocratization in the conduct of international relationsthat has caused Saint Lucia to embrace and support theprocess of reform of the United Nations itself. Saint Luciafirmly believes that if the United Nations is to adequatelyaddress the challenges of the coming century  then threethings must happen.First  Member States must honour their financialobligations to the body. Saint Lucia continues to believethat the United Nations financial crisis can be alleviatedif all Member States  large and small  rich and poor  doso in a timely manner  without conditions. A UnitedNations that is financially weak  that lurches from onebudget crisis to another  is in no condition to confront andovercome the challenges facing mankind. If there is to befinancial reform  then the precarious financial existence ofthe United Nations must be consigned to the dustbin ofhistory.Secondly  the United Nations itself must take stepsto become more efficient and effective. We need a UnitedNations where waste is abhorred  where the churning outof documents for documents’ sake  at a cost of millionsof dollars  is no longer a priority. We need a UnitedNations that is leaner  but more capable of making themaximum use of its resources.Thirdly  the United Nations must become moreresponsive to the needs of all its Member States. For themajority of the United Nations Member States  the needis for sustainable development  for the eradication ofpoverty and of illiteracy. We need a United Nations thatwill show an even greater sensitivity to those needs.The United Nations must also answer the call forwider representation of the world peoples on the SecurityCouncil. Saint Lucia wishes to reiterate its support for an24increase in the membership of the Security Council toreflect the universal membership of the General Assemblyand to ensure the balanced representation of the developingworld.Saint Lucia applauds the initiatives of the Secretary-General in his proposals to reform the United Nations toinspire greater confidence in its potential. Saint Lucia isparticularly interested in the proposed “dividend fordevelopment”  and welcomes the idea that a large portionof United Nations resources should be allocated todevelopment  particularly to meet the needs of developingcountries. It is our hope  however  that this proposed“dividend for development” will not become like the peacedividend — a noble idea that is yet to materialize.It is a moral responsibility of those who are strong toprotect the weak and vulnerable. The internationalcommunity  through the United Nations  must accept itsresponsibility to establish and maintain mechanisms thatwill protect the small  vulnerable economies of this worldas they seek to build sustainable economies for the twenty-first century.Saint Lucia has begun to do its part through thediversification of its economic base  through action toreduce unemployment  poverty  population growth and toimprove the educational standards of our peoples. We  too want to be better placed to exploit the new employmentopportunities provided by the revolution in information andcommunications technology. But the United Nations mustalso play its part by not forgetting that small islanddeveloping States like Saint Lucia have peculiar needs thatit must be vigilant to protect.We applaud the work being carried out by theCommonwealth on updating its report on the vulnerabilityof small States and in revising the Vulnerability Index ofSmall States  and we welcome the new report  “A Futurefor Small States Overcoming Vulnerability”.Saint Lucia notes the preparation being made for thespecial session of the General Assembly in 1999 to reviewoutstanding chapters and issues of the Barbados Programmeof Action. However  we must express our disappointmentover the lack of progress in implementing the Programmeof Action  and Saint Lucia urges the internationalcommunity to support the mobilization of external resourcesto implement the plan.In recent times  the vulnerability of small States tonatural disasters could not have been more clearlydemonstrated than in the case of the Caribbean island ofMontserrat  whose very existence is threatened by anintermittently raging volcano. Since the fifty-first sessionof the General Assembly  the situation in Montserrat hasdeteriorated. Half of the island’s population has had toflee. The plight of the people of Montserrat is a humantragedy that the world ignores because  once again  itssetting is another small island State which seems to be ina remote corner of the international community. Thepeople of Montserrat badly need sympathy  understandingand support.The establishment of a Caribbean family of nationsis a historical imperative for Saint Lucia. For this reason we shall continue to strengthen the integration process inthe Caribbean and the closer association of our peoples.We have a vision of the entire Caribbean Basin mergingas one nation  becoming one family  irrespective of thedivision of language  size  trade and political traditionsand relationships. We may be small  but we are makingour contribution to the enhancement of civilization.The noble ideals and goals of the United Nationsand its Charter will be meaningless if the internationalcommunity fails to protect small  vulnerable developingcountries like Saint Lucia from the predatory actions ofthose who seek to destroy the livelihood of our peoples inthe name of free trade. These lofty goals will be hollowif  in the rush to espouse globalization and theliberalization of trade  the special circumstances of thesmaller  poorer States of this world are scorned  and theirspecial needs are bulldozed and smashed by the injusticeof international tribunals and the myopia of richer States.Saint Lucia does not wish to be trapped in a cycle ofdependence. It merely wishes to be given the opportunityto be self-sustaining in this global order.The noble aspirations of the United Nations willrank among the greatest failures of the twentieth centuryif  by failing to be involved in the control of the processof globalization  it allows its smaller  poorer Members tobe marginalized. The goal of sustainable developmentmust not be allowed to become yet another myth of ourtimes."
"96",4122,"LIE",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of theLiechtenstein Government  I should like to congratulate thePresident on his election to preside over the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly. I wish also to express mythanks and recognition to the Permanent Representative ofMalaysia  Ambassador Razali Ismail  for the dynamic wayin which he conducted the work of the fifty-first session.Further  I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan  ournew Secretary-General. In the first nine months of histenure  and at a particularly decisive time for the UnitedNations  he has shown great leadership qualities. I wish toassure him of our full support and cooperation.We live in a world that is more interdependent thanever before. Globalization implies that Governments andsocieties can best meet such global challenges asdemocracy  the eradication of poverty  the promotion andprotection of human rights  sustainable development humanitarian emergencies and refugee problems if they takeaction together. International problems require internationalsolutions  and the world community must work together todeal with them on the basis of international law  through aconstructive dialogue of the international community as awhole.This leads me to our Organization  which is a unique— indeed  the only — forum for such cooperation  and tothe deep and far-reaching reform proposals which theSecretary-General  after a first reform package submitted inMarch  presented in his report (A/51/950) of 14 July 1997.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has taken on the challengingtask of reform with the necessary combination of energyand circumspection. I wish first of all to state that wewelcome the report and will lend our full support toachieving its objectives. I hope that the reform process willlead to concrete results before the end of this year. Weshare the opinion of those countries that have stressed thatreform must not be a cost-cutting exercise but a matter ofstrengthening the role of the Organization as an active andeffective world forum.We welcome and support the Secretary-General’sproposal to establish the post of a Deputy Secretary-Generalwho will have a particular role in ensuring the success ofactivities and programmes that cross functional sectors andSecretariat units. We particularly support the Secretary-General’s suggestion to fill that post with a qualifiedwoman. We also welcome the proposal to replace theDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs with an Office of theEmergency Relief Coordinator  and we hope that thismeasure will bring about the necessary changes to ensurea more efficient coordination of United Nations activitiesin this very important field.The Secretary-General has also suggested integratinghuman rights into all the principal activities of the UnitedNations  and we are fully supportive of this approachbecause it reflects the comprehensive and cross-cuttingnature of human rights. We are gratified to see Mrs. MaryRobinson in her new post as United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. We wish her success inher challenging tasks and pledge to her our full support.We are confident that her appointment will giveadditional momentum to the promotion and protection ofhuman rights worldwide and that the consolidation of herOffice with the Centre for Human Rights will provide herwith a solid institutional basis from which to take on herprincipal responsibility for United Nations human rightsactivities. That will be possible  however  only if theunderfunding of human rights programmes that we havewitnessed for so long finally comes to an end. Humanrights are the legitimate concern of the internationalcommunity  and this should be reflected in theappropriation of sufficient funds from the regular budget.We also continue to be very concerned about theprecarious overall financial situation of the Organization which is obviously linked to the failure of some MemberStates to fulfil their obligations regarding the prompt andfull payment of their assessed financial contributions. Itis important to note that the best reform efforts will beseriously hampered unless the Organization’s finances areput in order.Since we last met in New York for the generaldebate at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly major — indeed  crucial — efforts have been undertakento eliminate anti-personnel landmines. This matter hasbecome a truly global cause  promoted by individuals andnon-governmental organizations worldwide and propelledby Governments  which have committed themselves to theOttawa process to achieve a global ban on landmines.This is of exemplary value. Liechtenstein remainscommitted to the elimination of anti-personnel landmines and we therefore wholeheartedly support the results of thenegotiations that were concluded recently at Oslo. We areparticularly pleased that it was possible to agree on a finaltext which is simple  with no exceptions  no reservationsand no loopholes. We are of the opinion that only such atreaty can bring us closer to the goal of the totalelimination of anti-personnel landmines  and I would liketo take this opportunity to thank all those who have madeoutstanding efforts in the course of the Ottawa process 20particularly the Governments of Canada  Austria  Belgiumand Norway  as well as the International Committee of theRed Cross.While the adoption of the treaty will constitute amilestone in the history of both disarmament andinternational humanitarian law  further steps will be needed and the participation of as many States as possible in themeeting which will bring the process back to Ottawa inDecember will be a crucial element in those efforts.Liechtenstein plans to sign the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transferof Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction and iscommitted to its ratification at the earliest possible date.The establishment of an international criminal court isanother area in which we have been able to makesignificant progress over the past year  and we areapproaching the date of the diplomatic conference at whichthe statute of the court will be adopted. We wholeheartedlysupport the establishment of the international criminal court which will constitute a milestone in the history ofinternational law  and we continue to believe that that courthas to be strong and independent if it is to make aneffective contribution to the protection of human rights andthe observance of international humanitarian law. It is ofcrucial importance that the General Assembly agree at thissession on the precise dates for the diplomatic conferenceand that that decision allow for the fullest possibleparticipation by small States  which have a particularinterest in this matter.Two years ago  we adopted the Declaration andPlatform of Action at the Fourth World Conference onWomen in Beijing. Initiatives and actions have been takentowards the implementation of these commitments. TheLiechtenstein Government has since taken a number ofappropriate measures  while a comprehensive packagecontaining detailed further action is presently beingprepared.The role of women in preventive diplomacy and inpeacekeeping and the persistent absence of women frompeace negotiations are of particular concern to mydelegation. The more active participation of women inconflict resolution should be promoted  since women bringdifferent perspectives and innovative approaches topreventive diplomacy as well as to peacekeeping. The equalaccess and full participation of women in decision-makingat all levels and in power structures  including challengingassignments  such as serving as special representatives ofthe Secretary-General  are also important in the area ofthe promotion and maintenance of peace and security.Special attention should be given to the situation ofwomen in armed conflicts  including refugee women.Women are particularly vulnerable to discrimination andhuman rights violations  both before they flee and asrefugees. In the Beijing Platform of Action  the need toprovide protection  assistance and training to refugeewomen and displaced women is clearly recognized.Liechtenstein first introduced in 1991 an initiative onthe right of self-determination  the ultimate goal of whichis to enable States facing internal problems — be theybetween the central Government and communities orbetween communities within States — to cope with theseproblems in a peaceful and flexible manner on the basisof international law and through constructive dialogue.Ever since  we have consolidated and further developedour ideas  and we would like to thank all those who havegiven us active support in this endeavour.At the end of October  the Liechtenstein ResearchProgram in Self-Determination at the Woodrow WilsonSchool of Princeton University will continue its series ofconferences devoted to issues of self-government and self-administration. I would like to renew to all here ourinvitation to attend the next conference  which will takeplace from 31 October to 1 November. We hope that thisconference will provide a deeper understanding of thecomplex issues underlying the concept of self-determination  which has played such an outstanding rolein the history of our Organization. We hope that thisinitiative can be a positive contribution to the future workof the United Nations.The capacity of the United Nations to deal with thechallenges of the future  however  will depend on ourdecisions on the reform of the Organization  decisionswhich we have to take now. Today  I wish to renewLiechtenstein’s commitment to the principles andpurposes of the United Nations. We are willing tocontribute to the extent possible so that this chance torenew the United Nations will not pass us by."
"97",4169,"LKA",52,1997,"﻿May I begin  Sir  byextending to you our warm felicitations on your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly. Your longassociation with the United Nations as Ukraine’sPermanent Representative and your diplomatic skills andaccomplishments as your country’s Foreign Ministerundoubtedly  if I may say so  make you eminently suitedfor the task of guiding our deliberations this year.We would like to place on record our deepappreciation for the achievements of your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia. As President ofthe General Assembly last year he left an indelible markin the annals of this institution by giving it bold andvigorous leadership at a time when far-reaching changesin the United Nations system are being undertaken.I also wish to convey our warm greetings  andindeed a very special welcome  to the Secretary-Generalas he participates in this  his first General Assemblydebate since he became the chief executive of ourOrganization. He has  in a very short time  developed andlaunched a far-reaching programme of reforms  which isundoubtedly the most comprehensive undertaken in the52-year history of the Organization. We pledge our fullestcooperation to him in his arduous work. We pledge tomake a positive response to his initiative for reform.This year the General Assembly is preoccupied —and very rightly so — with the question of reform. It isno doubt an important question  a question on which alldelegations have a view. Indeed  there are manyconflicting views on the subject. My Government also hasa view  one that it shares with a large number ofdelegations  especially those of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement. I will in a moment make my briefobservations on the question of reform.But this year I wish to devote my address to theGeneral Assembly  in the main  to a different theme. Iwish to place before the delegations here assembled fairly and squarely  and to plead fervently  a cause towhich my Government is deeply committed and for whichit has deep concern. It is a cause that deserves the strongsupport of all Governments and all the peoples of theworld. It is a cause that challenges the conscience ofmankind. It is a cause that cries out for redress  forimmediate  concerted  vigorous action. It is the cause ofthe innocent  helpless victims of war. More specifically my theme is the impact of armed conflict on children: asubject that in the experience of Sri Lanka is drenched in6blood and tears. I will return to my theme in a moment.But first  the question of reform.Although 1997 is often referred to as the year ofreform  we would prefer it to be remembered as the year ofrenewal and reform. Reform by itself is no substitute forempowering the United Nations. Renewal of the spirit ofmultilateralism enshrined in the Charter is an essentialcorollary to the reform exercise launched by the Secretary-General. If reform is to be conceptually sound and capableof effective implementation  it must command in the fullestsense consensus in the General Assembly.Sri Lanka certainly shares the vision of the Secretary-General to make the United Nations a dynamic and cost-effective institution responsive to the challenges of our dayand age. We recognize the necessity for reorganizing theSecretariat  the consolidation of United Nations activitiesinto core areas  the creation of a senior management group and the coordination of United Nations field activities as amanifestation of sound principles of good management. Thecreation of a United Nations Development Group thatwould consolidate and coordinate the activities of a varietyof bodies is another proposal that merits close attention. Weendorse the measures to strengthen the United Nationsoperational capacity to combat drugs  crime and terrorismby bringing together disparate international efforts under asingle dedicated organization.Sri Lanka shares with many other delegations thedisappointment that consensus has so far eluded our effortsto expand the Security Council. The General Assembly’sOpen-ended Working Group on this issue has beendeliberating since 1994 with very little progressaccomplished  which is itself evidence of the contentiousnature of the question. Sri Lanka was one of the 10countries that brought the question of equitablerepresentation and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council to the General Assembly agenda in 1979.Many Member States have consistently demanded that thecomposition of the Security Council should be broadenedand that its working methods should be renderedtransparent. The Council cannot remain structurallyfossilized and anachronistic in a world of dynamic change.We are pleased to note that the need for change isnow being widely recognized. In order to be credible viable and successful  reform of the Security Councilshould prudently take into account the interests clearly setforth by the non-aligned nations. We are pleased to notethat the United States of America has now agreed that anexpanded Security Council should contain threerepresentatives of the developing countries as permanentmembers.We agree with the Secretary-General’s proposal thatthere should be a dedicated locus for the United Nationsoperational activities against crime and terrorism. UnitedNations action against terrorism can no longer beconfined to rhetorical statements and exhortations. Wetherefore endorse the Secretary- General’s timely proposalto place United Nations action to combat crime andterrorism in an operational mode.There is convincing evidence that civil society andthe rule of law are increasingly threatened bytransnational networking in illicit arms  terrorism narcotics  money-laundering and crime. The formerSecretary-General rightly described this phenomenon asa “supra-national subversive threat” to peace and stability.The present Secretary-General has correctly focused onthe fact that underworld groups and terrorists havemastered the abuse of technology and the globalizedinformation network to propagate their sinister designs.Their misuse and abuse of modern technology have vastlyincreased the power and influence of these criminalgroups  which pose a massive threat to law and order democratic political institutions and economic activitieswithin and between nations.It should be a priority on the international agendathat effective measures be taken to control  if noteliminate  these pernicious elements. We agree with therecommendation that a redoubling of efforts involvingnew partnerships among national and internationalagencies will be needed to achieve this objective. It is tobe emphasized that there should be coordination betweenthe merged focal points on crime  drugs and terrorism andthe United Nations department handling the flow of smallarms and the illicit arms trade.We also hope that the United Nations Ad HocCommittee on an International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  of which Sri Lankais a Vice-Chairman  will conclude its negotiations andsubmit a text for adoption at this session. Thereafter  weurge the international community  especially the large andpowerful nations  to update their domestic legislation soas to arm themselves with adequate legislative authorityto eradicate the fund-raising and other activities whichtake place on their soil in support of terrorist activitiesthat take place on the soil of other States. Today terrorismis a phenomenon with international ramifications. Only7well-organized  well-coordinated international action cancombat international terrorism effectively.I turn now to the question of human rights. Thedelicate and complex process of protecting and promotinghuman rights  good governance and accountability in anenvironment of underdevelopment  violence and terrorismis one that should be carefully developed and resolutelymoved forward. The Declaration of Human Rights isuniversal and unalterable. Sri Lanka does not believe thatthe Declaration should be diluted  modified or ignored.What we believe  and strongly advocate  is thatinternational action to enforce human rights should be fairand even-handed. Human rights should never be used bypowerful States to bludgeon and bully weaker States forspurious political reasons. The essence of peace anddevelopment is that each human being should be enabled toenjoy “better standards of life in larger freedom”.Undeterred by the extraordinary security problemsposed by terrorism and the threats levelled against thedemocratic traditions and institutions of Sri Lanka  we havebeen able to make much headway in the promotion andprotection of human rights in our country. Sri Lanka is nowa party to 13 international human rights instruments. At therisk of exposing itself to tendentious propaganda by terroristgroups  the Government has taken a number of national andinternational measures on a broad front  to pursue an openpolicy on human rights in accordance with internationalnorms. We have established a national Human RightsCommission  which is an independent organization withinvestigative  monitoring and advisory powers. TheCommission is now functional and is in touch with regionaland international institutions including the United NationsCentre for Human Rights.I am also pleased to mention that I have today  just ashort while ago  deposited with the Secretary-General SriLanka’s instrument of accession to the Optional Protocol tothe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.This important decision to permit international scrutiny ofgovernmental actions affecting the human rights of ourcitizens is consistent with our policy of openness on humanrights.Sri Lanka warmly welcomes the appointment of MaryRobinson as the new High Commissioner for HumanRights. I had the pleasure of discussing human rights issueswith her a few days ago. I am confident that she will bringto her task an open mind and a fair approach; that she willseek and promote informed dialogue  not confrontation; thatshe will strive to win the trust of developing countries; andthat she will not apply double standards nor wield humanrights concerns as a weapon against them. We wish herevery success as she assumes her important duties. Shemay rest assured that she will receive from Sri Lanka thefullest cooperation.I have now reached the central theme of my address:the impact of armed conflict on children. Every year theUnited Nations builds a mountain of paper: according tothe British Foreign Secretary  2 500 tons of paper areproduced annually at a cost of $150 million. At this timeof year  every year  the General Assembly is engulfed bya flood of words that rises to new heights as themembership of our Organization grows in number. Thereis much waste  much repetition  much verbiage in ourmethods of work. But we must always remember thatwithin this pile of papers there are some documents whichdeserve — which require — the closest attention of theinternational community.One such document  outstanding for its sweep  itsdepth and the careful research that went into itspreparation is the study on the impact of armed conflicton children compiled by Ms. Graça Machel and hercollaborators and submitted to the General Assembly lastyear under the symbols A/51/306 and A/51/306/Add.1. Itis a document so profound in its impact  so searing in therevelations it makes of matters that the world littleunderstands that to ignore it would be a permanent rebuketo the collective conscience of mankind.The study exposes the plight of children as thevictims of armed conflict. It covers the agonizingsituation of children as refugees  as objects of exploitationand gender-based violence and above all as child soldiers.The study recommends measures for the rehabilitation andreconciliation of children affected by war  for promotingtheir psychological recovery and social integration  fortheir education and for dealing with a number of otherquestions relevant to the problem of mitigating the impactof war on children. The study points out that millions ofchildren are caught up in conflicts in which they are notmerely bystanders but targets. Some fall victim to ageneral onslaught against civilians; others die as part ofa calculated genocide. Still other children suffer theeffects of sexual violence or the multiple deprivations ofarmed conflict that expose them to hunger or disease. Justas shocking  thousands of young children are cynicallyexploited as combatants.In 1995  according to the study  30 major conflictsraged in different locations around the world. All of them8took place within States  between factions split alongethnic  religious or cultural lines. The conflict destroyedcrops  places of worship and schools. Nothing was spared held sacred or protected: not children  not families  notcommunities. In the past decade  an estimated two millionchildren have been killed in armed conflict. Three times asmany have been seriously injured or permanently disabled.Countless others have been forced to witness or even takepart in horrifying acts of violence. These statistics areshocking enough  but more chilling  says the study  is theconclusion to be drawn from them: that more and more ofthe world is being sucked into a desolate moral vacuum.This is a space devoid of the most basic human values; aspace in which children are slaughtered  raped and maimed;a space in which children are exploited as soldiers; a spacein which children are starved and exposed to extremebrutality. Unregulated terror and violence speak ofdeliberate victimization. There are few further depths towhich humanity could sink.Ms. Machel pleads that whatever the causes ofmodern-day brutalities towards children  the time has cometo call a halt. I make the same plea to the GeneralAssembly today. The study exposes the extent of theproblem and proposes many practical ways to pull backfrom the brink. Its most fundamental demand is thatchildren simply have no part in warfare. The internationalcommunity must denounce this attack on children for whatit is: intolerable and unacceptable.Violent conflict has always made victims of non-combatants. The patterns and characteristics ofcontemporary armed conflicts  however  have increased therisks for children. The personalization of power andleadership and the manipulation of ethnicity and religion toserve personal or narrow group interests have had similarlydebilitating effects on countries in conflict. Armed conflictsacross and between communities result in massive levels ofdestruction: physical  human  moral  cultural. Not only arelarge numbers of children killed and injured  but countlessothers grow up deprived of their material and emotionalneeds  including the structures that give meaning to socialand cultural life. The entire fabric of their societies — theirhomes  schools  health systems and religious institutions —are torn to pieces.The Machel study rightly points out that war violatesevery right of a child: the right to life  the right to be withfamily and community  the right to health  the right to thedevelopment of the personality and the right to be nurturedand protected. Many of today’s conflicts last the wholelength of a childhood  meaning that from birth to earlyadulthood  many children will experience multiple andcumulative assaults.Against the background I have outlined  I wish tofocus sharply on the terrible plight of child soldiers. TheMachel study has pointed out that one of the mostalarming trends in armed conflict is the participation ofchildren as soldiers. Children serve armies in supportingroles  as cooks  porters  messengers and spies.Increasingly  however  adults are deliberately conscriptingchildren as soldiers. Some commanders have even notedthe desirability of using child soldiers in war because theyare“ more obedient  do not question orders and areeasier to manipulate than adult soldiers'”. [A/51/306 para. 34]A series of 24 case studies on the use of children assoldiers prepared for the Machel study  covering conflictsover the past 30 years  indicates that Government or rebelarmies around the world have recruited tens of thousandsof children. Many child soldiers are 10 years of age oryounger. While the majority are boys  girls also arerecruited. The children most likely to become soldiers arethose from impoverished and marginalized backgroundsand those who have become separated from their families.In Sri Lanka we know exactly what the Machelstudy is talking about. We have for almost two decadesbeen in the grip of a war being fought against the Stateby a group of heavily armed terrorists known as theLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  andinternationally known as one of the deadliest terroristorganizations the world has ever seen. It is fighting tocreate a separate State in Sri Lanka by force of arms. LastJuly the Senate of the United States unanimouslyconcluded that the LTTE is a terrorist organization andrequested the State Department to declare it to be so. LastAugust a Canadian court declared the LTTE to be aterrorist organization and ordered the deportation of itschief fund-raiser in Canada.The LTTE has killed thousands of unarmed civiliansand has destroyed public property worth millions ofdollars. In January last year it bombed and destroyed theCentral Bank of Sri Lanka  killing hundreds of civilians and in July last year it bombed a rush-hour commutertrain full of workers going home  again killing hundredsof civilians. These are but a few of the atrocities theLTTE has committed against civilians in the course of along campaign of terror. Only a few months ago it killed9two of our Members of Parliament  adding to the large tallyof politicians and other leaders murdered by the LTTE overthe years  including a President of Sri Lanka and a PrimeMinister of India. Recently the LTTE attacked internationalcivilian shipping that provides essential services andsupplies to the Tamil community in the north of Sri Lanka the very community on whose behalf it claims to befighting.The LTTE has conscripted thousands of teenagechildren to fight its war. Involving children as soldiers hasbeen made easier by the proliferation of inexpensive lightweapons. But the LTTE is committing more dastardly andmore heinous crimes against Tamil children. It brazenlykidnaps them or lures them to its cause by glorifying andromanticizing war. They are brainwashed into believing inthe cult of martyrdom. They swear fanatical allegiance tothe leader. The Machel study identified Sri Lanka as one ofthe countries where children are being lured into “cults ofmartyrdom” [A/51/306  para. 43] by the “ideologicalindoctrination” [ibid.] of the LTTE. A book entitledChildren  the Invisible Soldiers  released by the Save theChildren organization in Stockholm  has condemned the useof children in suicide attacks by the LTTE. Theinternational news agency IPS reported last May that“as adults are killed  up to half the fighters of theLTTE are children  many among them girls”.In another recent study  the United Nations SpecialRapporteur on Violence against Women has stronglycondemned the use of women in war by the LTTE.Many of these children  boys and girls  are no morethan 10 years of age. Many of them are transformed intosuicide bombers. They wear cyanide capsules around theirnecks. They are hurled into battle as human bombs. TheMachel study itself has observed  with specific reference toSri Lanka  that“adults have used young people’s immaturity to theirown advantage  recruiting and training adolescents forsuicide bombings.” [ibid.]A recent press report on fighting in the north of Sri Lankanoted that“young boys barely in their teens are blindfolded andescorted by a woman Tiger cadre to the battlefield  ingroups of eight to 10  their blindfolds removed andthey are ordered to fire at troops”.In December 1995 the former United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF) representative in Sri Lanka said in apress release“The LTTE recruits boys and girls from the age of10 upwards. Their dependence on child combatantsis increasing rapidly.”The Machel study has referred to the role whichinternational organizations  non-governmentalorganizations  religious groups and civil society in generalcan play in preventing this diabolical practice. It is indeeda matter of great regret that in my own country  despitethe notorious prevalence of the LTTE practice ofrecruiting children as fighters  these organizations  whichare often quite vocal in their pleas for peace and swift tocastigate excesses on the part of the armed forces  haveremained strangely silent on this issue. By their failure tocondemn such acts  they are surely guilty of a gravedereliction of the duty to uphold the moral and spiritualvalues of a civilized society. By their silence it wouldappear that they are oblivious to the immense tragedy ofa whole generation of young lives being sacrificed toMoloch  while a misguided few applaud the helplessvictims as martyrs  and yet others seek to romanticize theso-called liberation of girls who have hitherto beenbrought up in a long-respected traditional mode  caringnought for the dehumanization that is involved.I strongly urge the international community to takeaction on the lines suggested in paragraph 62 of theMachel study. These recommendations envisage a globalcampaign aimed at eradicating the use of children underthe age of 18 years in armed conflict and the publicexposure of such practices by the media  creatinginternational pressure against those who resort to them. Ialso urge strict adherence to the Convention on the Rightsof the Child by all actors in armed conflicts  and I stressthe need for specific measures to demobilize andreintegrate child soldiers into society and the need forearly action to conclude the drafting of the optionalprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child inregard to the involvement of children in armed conflictsand the prohibition of recruitment of children under theage of 18.We reject the complacent assumption made by somethat the involvement of children in armed conflict isinevitable and unavoidable. This is clearly not the case.Their participation is the result of heartless  deliberate andcalculated decisions made by ruthless men  regardless ofthe loss of innocent lives  relentlessly pursuing their10megalomaniac ambitions. The leader of the LTTE  whilesending to their deaths thousands of young children — theyoungest of the young — brings up his own children incomfort and safety  far from the battlefields  far away fromthe country itself. This barbaric practice of conscripting orluring children for war must be condemned by all civilizedStates  without any room for equivocation or doubt  andmust be eliminated from our world if we are to preserveour humanity.I appeal to the affluent countries in which the LTTEhas established offices and raises funds to prosecute itsinfamous war in Sri Lanka not to tolerate its presence orgive it shelter when it engages in the commission ofdastardly crimes against children — indeed  the children ofits own community.On behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka  I greatlywelcome the appointment of a distinguished Ugandandiplomat  Mr. Olara Otunnu  as the Secretary-General’sSpecial Representative to study the impact of armedconflict on children. His appointment has also beenwelcomed by Canada. The Canadian Foreign Minister alsoreferred to and condemned the recruitment of children assoldiers. We must give our wholehearted support toMr. Otunnu. He intends to propose and initiate concretemeasures to tackle the problem. He will launch a campaignof public advocacy to bring to the notice of the world theterrible plight of children in war. I appeal to theinternational community not to allow his work to suffer forlack of funds.As we look back at the half century that has elapsedsince the founding of the United Nations  we have  in truth to acknowledge a sense of satisfaction at what has beenachieved  however limited in scope  through our collectivedecisions and actions during that period. There have beenundeniable gains in the spheres of economic and socialdevelopment  however modest they appear to be whenmeasured against our aspirations and objectives. Yet thefundamental problems of the developing world remainunresolved  while the developed countries have gone fromstrength to strength.In the sphere of collective security and themaintenance of world peace  although major catastropheshave been averted  the United Nations has not succeeded inmaking real the dream of every human being to live inpeace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all theattendant horrors of human carnage and the senselessdestruction of everything we hold dear. Even the end of thecold war has made no great difference to countries such asours embroiled in internal civil conflicts  all too oftennourished by the giant armament manufacturers of theworld  while the United Nations endlessly debatesdisarmament.However deep our sense of disappointment anddisenchantment may be  have we any hope apart from theUnited Nations? I do not think we have. If the UnitedNations has fallen short of our expectations  it is becausewe  the Member States  have failed to honour ourobligations and fulfil our responsibilities to the worldcommunity  selfishly placing our national interests abovethe common good.If we continue in this fashion the United Nationswill cease to be relevant altogether  and history willsurely record it as yet another pious venture which we didnot have the courage and commitment to make real.As the German Foreign Minister said from thispodium a few days ago “it is on our children  the weakest members ofany society ... that the world’s future and hopesdepend ... They are little people who need big rights.How much worse off would they be if there were noUnited Nations? What would become of the world’sconscience? Who would demand consideration forand solidarity with such children if we allowed thisOrganization to decline?” [See Official Records ofthe General Assembly  Fifty-Second Session  PlenaryMeetings  9th Meeting]In order to realize the ideals of the founders of thisworld body  and the hopes and dreams of countlessmillions of people who look to the United Nations fortheir realization  we need to renew our faith and trust inthe United Nations — not in the old United Nations which is looked upon with cynicism  even suspicion  butin a United Nations that will  in a sense  be a newcreation and a new being. But for the United Nations tobe born anew we need to bring about fundamentalstructural changes in the international order  changes thatwill give it new life and strength for the coming century.These changes will entail sacrifice; they will be changeswhich many States will hesitate to welcome and bereluctant to accept lest they endanger their sovereigntyand their so-called vital interests. Nevertheless  suchchange will be in the nature of an uncompromisingdemand that will confront us all. Nothing worthwhile canbe achieved without sacrifice. That is indeed a universaltruth concerning human redemption  and the United11Nations is  after all  like any other human institution. Itsweaknesses and strengths are those of humankind.The obligation to act in the common interest cannot beundertaken selectively; nor does the assumption of thisonerous duty admit of any double standard. All the nationsof the world  the powerful and the weak  the rich and thepoor  must jointly agree to curtail their independence andtheir claims to act unilaterally. Each must agree tosubordinate its individual decision and discretion to a globalpolitical will  manifested through truly democratic andrepresentative organs of the United Nations  reflecting theauthentic judgement of the world community of States.Apart from  or bereft of  the collective decisions andconcerted acts of such a reformed and restructured UnitedNations  carried into effect resolutely and withdetermination  I doubt whether we can honestly expect abetter future for humankind in the new millennium. Wemust not fail the United Nations  or else we shall assuredlygo down in history as “the hollow men” of the twentiethcentury."
"98",4211,"LSO",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to extend to Mr.Hennadiy Udovenko the sincere congratulations of mydelegation on his election to the presidency of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. It is with greatpleasure that I assure him of Lesotho’s support andcooperation as he conducts the deliberations of this body.Let me also take this opportunity to pay a special tribute tohis predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail  for theskilful manner in which he guided the work of the fifty-firstsession. My delegation truly appreciates his leadership andtireless dedication to the heavy responsibilities entrusted tohim during the past year.On the eve of a new millennium  the United Nationsis poised on the threshold of an era of momentous changes.During the first 52 years of its existence  the Organizationwitnessed several changes in the configuration ofinternational relations. Some of them were traumatic  othersbenign. The survival of the United Nations through all thesetribulations bears testimony not only to its resilience  butalso to the enduring validity of its mission.But the continued success and relevance of the UnitedNations in the new millennium will depend in largemeasure on its capacity for self-renewal and on itsreadiness to meet its challenges in the environment ofchanged global circumstances.The Secretary-General has demonstrated hiswillingness and resolve to bring about the much-neededchange. We applaud  at the outset  his bold and farreaching proposals on the reform of the United Nations.Many of his proposals  indeed  meet with the approval ofmy Government  and it is our hope that the GeneralAssembly will see its way clear to receiving them in thesame manner. Some  however  do need careful scrutiny toensure that the ideal of cost-cutting can still be achievedwithout compromising the overriding objective ofrealizing higher efficiency and effectiveness of theOrganization in the execution of its mandate.We urge that the totality of these proposals shouldbe subjected to serious scrutiny at the appropriately highintergovernmental level  with a view to implementingthose that enjoy wide support as expeditiously as possible.Our hope is that this can be done in a spirit of franknessand mutual understanding without the acrimony that sooften characterizes our intergovernmental deliberations.During the last two sessions of the GeneralAssembly  we have debated and arrived at a clearunderstanding of the United Nations reforms that will bestserve the interests of the world community in the nextmillennium. The reform initiatives of the Secretary-General  which cover diverse aspects of the functioningof the Organization  are therefore a timely and welcomeresponse to our collective call for a reoriented andrevitalized United Nations.Lesotho  like other States of southern Africa  hasgone through difficult political problems  which havelargely been resolved. The outstanding problem iseconomic underdevelopment. We thus attach greatimportance to the United Nations role in developmentcooperation. We recognize the need to strengthen thecapacity of the Secretary-General in this area byproviding him with a deputy whose principal role  in ourview  should be to coordinate the Organization’s effortsand to give direction to all entities of the United Nationsinvolved in development cooperation.We fully support the initiative aimed at facilitatingthe unified and cooperative functioning of all the UnitedNations funds and programmes involved in developmentoperations at the field level  while at the same timereinforcing and maintaining the distinct nature of theseentities. The specialized funds and programmes within theUnited Nations system continue to constitute an importantvehicle for advancing international developmentcooperation  particularly in the developing countries. The14enhanced coordination and pooling of resources andservices among the specialized funds will not only lead tobetter planning but will also maximize programme impactand minimize administrative costs.Indeed  Lesotho has already made its owncontribution  however small  towards reaching the ideal ofa unified United Nations presence in the field. TheGovernment of Lesotho  using its own national resources has constructed a United Nations House office complex which will accommodate all field representatives of thefunds and programmes as well as other United Nationsagencies in our capital. This House was inaugurated andhanded over to the United Nations Resident Coordinatoronly five days ago  on 25 September 1997.The suggestion by the Secretary-General for theestablishment of a $1 billion revolving fund also has itsown merits. Let me  however  hasten to emphasize thatthere can be no substitute for a demonstrable commitmentby all Member States to honour their treaty obligations bypaying their assessed contributions on time  fully andunconditionally  in order to ensure the financial health ofour Organization. We nevertheless believe that the proposedrevolving fund can only be a short-term palliative. But sucha fund should serve neither to exculpate those who renegeon their treaty obligations nor to place an additional burdenon countries that are already making sacrifices to honourtheir obligations in accordance with the Charter.As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  in 1998  the issueof the protection of human rights is assuming an increasingimportance to all our countries because of its close linkagewith democracy  peace and stability. My Governmenttherefore welcomes the Secretary-General’s proposedreforms regarding the strengthening of the Organization’srole in the field of human rights. In this connection  wewish to urge that the consolidation of the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights into one entity should not lead to theblurring of the distinction between the political functions ofthe High Commissioner and the purely technical functionsof the Centre.The increasing globalization of organized crime including trafficking in illicit drugs  continues to be asource of concern to the international community. It is forthis reason that in our subregion  the countries of theSouthern African Development Community are takingcooperative measures to combat the scourge of transnationalorganized crime. Lesotho believes that the proposal toestablish in Vienna a high-profile United Nations officewhose main focus would be on drug control and crimeprevention should be given favourable consideration.With regard to the reform and restructuring of theSecurity Council  I can only reaffirm the view of theLesotho Government that only equitable representation onthe Security Council and an increase in its membership tono less than 26 can satisfy our aspirations. We share theview held by the majority of members of this body on theneed for true democratization of the Security Council andthe reform of its working methods  including the issue ofthe veto power. Such reform should take into account theprinciple of sovereign equality of States  as well as theneed for transparency and accountability in the decision-making processes of the Security Council.Since the last session of the General Assembly  wehave witnessed a number of developments in theinternational arena that augur well for world politicalstability and peace. Recently we all shared in theuniversal joy at the peaceful reunification of Hong Kongwith its motherland. The United Kingdom and thePeople’s Republic of China ought to be congratulated fortheir significant contribution to world peace and for thevaluable lesson that they have imparted to the worldcommunity in the sphere of resolution of disputes throughdialogue.In our region  we have witnessed the birth of a newDemocratic Republic of the Congo from the crucible ofone of the most vicious dictatorships ever recorded in theannals of history. It is now for the internationalcommunity to assist the people of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo in their efforts aimed at economicreconstruction and the consolidation of democracy andaccountability in their country. The acceptance of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo into the SouthernAfrican Development Community at the beginning of thismonth was a signal of the determination of the countriesof southern Africa to make their own positive contributionto the reconstruction efforts of the Congolese people.We are also greatly encouraged by the recentrestoration of stability and democracy in Liberia throughthe assistance of neighbouring countries in that region.However  the reversion of Sierra Leone to a state ofanarchy and chaos after the selfless efforts made by theinternational community to bring about stability in thatcountry remains a source of great concern. Lesotho joinsin the call by African States for the international15community to withhold recognition of the military junta inSierra Leone and to remain steadfast in its resolve torestore democracy and constitutional legitimacy in thatcountry.In Angola  the recalcitrance of the UNITA leadershipcontinues to unravel the gains that had been made in thesearch for peace. The United Nations owes it to the peopleof Angola to enforce  through the Security Council appropriate punitive measures against UNITA as a signalthat those who stand in the way of peace can no longer beallowed to succeed.The recent events in the Middle East have cast ashadow on a future that seemed to hold promise for anegotiated peace. False moves have escalated tension in theregion rather than abating it. We call upon Israel  as wehave always done in the past  to fully implement allSecurity Council resolutions aimed at the peacefulsettlement of the conflict in that region. All the parties tothe conflict must recommit themselves to the peace processand refrain from any acts which might jeopardize anegotiated settlement.The continuous eruption of armed conflicts throughoutthe world  particularly in the developing countries  is asource of concern to all of us. These conflicts put atremendous strain on the resources of the United Nationsand on the Organization’s capacity to maintain internationalpeace and security. Thus  we are encouraged by the positiveattitude and the interest that some of the developedcountries have in the recent years shown in cooperatingwith the Organization of African Unity towards enhancingAfrica’s capacity in the field of conflict prevention. Wealso welcome Japan’s initiative to host an internationalconference on conflict prevention in Tokyo in January1998. Taken in their totality  these initiatives underline themoral responsibility that rests on humanity to ensure thatpeoples everywhere enjoy the right to peace  developmentand the sanctity of life.Lesotho is generally encouraged by the progress thatis being made in the field of disarmament with the recentsigning of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty andthe ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.Despite the current relaxation of tension in internationalrelations  disarmament must continue to be accorded highpriority on the agenda of the international community witha view to achieving the total elimination of nuclearweapons. Africa has already contributed positively to thedisarmament process by the signing  in Egypt  of thePelindaba Treaty declaring Africa a nuclear-weapon-freezone.The recent international negotiations in Osloregarding a ban on anti-personnel mines are also a step inthe right direction. Lesotho fully supports the Ottawaprocess and urges all nations to associate themselves withit so that a truly global treaty banning the production anduse of anti-personnel mines can be successfully concludedin December this year.Last year  the Assembly demonstrated thewidespread and growing international support for apermanent international criminal court when itunanimously adopted resolution 51/207  which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalizeand adopt a convention on the establishment of such acourt. We have been encouraged by the progress madeduring the last two sessions of the PreparatoryCommittee  held in February and in August.We appreciate the generous offer by the ItalianGovernment to host the conference. The time has nowcome for the necessary arrangements for the convening ofsuch a conference to be put in place  and reaffirming theJune 1998 date will enable the Italian Government toproceed with the necessary logistical arrangements andensure that the court is established before the end of thecentury. Lesotho fully and unreservedly supports thatdate. We remain convinced that the early establishment ofthe court will offer the advantage of a system that aimsto serve the common global good by preventing localoutbreaks of violence from becoming security crises withglobal repercussions  and to deter the continuedrecurrence of the genocide and other massive crimesagainst humanity that have haunted the world sinceNuremberg and Tokyo.Members will recall the ninth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD IX)  held two years ago in South Africa whose main agenda item was on promoting growth andsustainable development in a globalizing and liberalizingeconomy. In the post-UNCTAD-IX period  a majorchallenge before us is to maximize the developmentalimpact of this globalizing and liberalizing world economy.This can be achieved only by ensuring that the risk ofmarginalizing and even excluding weaker nations fromparticipating actively in international trade and commerceis avoided at all costs.16When we met during the nineteenth special session ofthe General Assembly  held only four months ago  we allexpressed our deep concern that  compared to 1992  theoverall trend regarding sustainable development indeveloping countries is worse today. Poverty andenvironmental degradation continue to afflict the lives ofmillions of people in many parts of the world. Thestaggering statistics only underline the need to strengthenthe capacity of the United Nations to improve the lot of ourdisadvantaged peoples. In particular  they reaffirm thatUnited Nations operational activities for development havea critical and unique role to play in enabling the developingcountries to continue to lead the management of their owndevelopment process  and that the funds and programmeswithin the United Nations system continue to constituteimportant vehicles for advancing international developmentcooperation. It is in this spirit that we would support thoseefforts that are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and thecapacity of the funds and programmes in the area ofdevelopment assistance.In conclusion  allow me to observe that with the visionthat the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has brought tothe Organization within his short period in office  theUnited Nations can and will come to terms with thechallenges that lie in the years ahead. The rationalization ofthe structures and working methods of our Organizationwill surely allow us to achieve our objectives."
"99",4237,"LTU",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election to yourhonourable post. You may count on our full support anddedication to your goals.You  Sir  have inherited the legacy of the outgoingPresident  Ambassador Razali Ismail  which we can buildon: friendly atmosphere  lively debates  productive spirit strong desire for change and reform  and  last but notleast  brilliant management of the Assembly’s work. MyGovernment congratulates Ambassador Razali on hisoutstanding performance.I come from a country that is in the midst ofcomprehensive reforms. Top-to-bottom institutionalchanges have reshaped our society from its very roots establishing a commonly accepted democratic way of life.Radical changes involved in introducing a marketeconomy have borne fruit. Today  our democracy andmarket economy are inextricably linked with the newsecurity and economic framework of a united Europe.Our reform experience demonstrates that the courageto grasp the moment — to respond rapidly if and whenthe changing situation requires — a key for success. Wehave this key in our hands  and we need the determinationto use it. With the end of the cold war  the fall of thebipolar system and the failure of power politics havegiven us a new chance to look deeper into the core of theUnited Nations and to reshape it in line with the needsand expectations of its Member States and for the benefitof all. The picture of the road ahead is visible.We want this session of the General Assembly to bedominated by the programme of reforms. Lithuania’sGovernment supports the Secretary-General’s reforminitiative  which is expected to spur most fundamentalchanges. We are confident that the Secretary-General willsuccessfully implement that part of his programme whichfalls within his own responsibility.It is unlikely that everyone will be happy aboutevery part of the proposed reforms. We  the MemberStates  have to see the Secretary-General’s proposals intheir entirety  and  rising above narrow national interests find a compromise on every step that brings us closer toa more focused  more efficient  more transparent andmore democratic United Nations. Lithuania is ready toplay an active part in achieving agreement on a UnitedNations structure that will reflect the nature of the UnitedNations mandate and its core functions: maintenance ofpeace and security  sustainable development and8promotion of human rights  humanitarian assistance  andsocial and economic progress. They should be placed withina strict time-frame. Otherwise  lack of dynamics in thenegotiation process will cause a loss of direction.What is of special concern to us is that the financialdifficulties of the Organization are affecting its performanceand endanger the progress of reforms. Lithuania will fulfilits financial obligations to the United Nations and urgesother States to do so. At the same time  United Nationsfinancing must reflect a State’s capacity to pay. The schemeof limits has to be removed from the new scale ofassessments that is to be negotiated this autumn. Lithuaniacontinues to support the package of comprehensiveproposals put forward by the European Union designed toput the Organization on a sound and predictable financialfooting.Although the reform of the Security Council started asa separate process  it is now part of the entire package ofUnited Nations reform. It was inspired by the generalacknowledgement that the time had come for the Councilto reflect new realities in world politics. Today we havemore nations able and willing to serve permanently on theSecurity Council than in the days of its inception. Two suchStates are Germany and Japan. Asia  Africa and LatinAmerica  too  legitimately aspire to have new permanentseats. And there are more States whose contributions to thegoals of the United Nations point to the need for greaterappreciation and better accommodation of their interests.We want a comprehensive reform of the Councilwhereby the number of non-permanent seats increases aswell. The Group of Eastern European States  whose numberhas more than doubled over the past few years  deserves atleast one additional seat. Our position on this is very firm.We also need a more transparent and democraticSecurity Council. But  most important  the reform shouldcontinue to progress. This year’s discussions have beenproductive  thanks to the efforts of the former President ofthe General Assembly  Ambassador Razali. I hope theprocess will retain its vigour.In the post-confrontation era  there are far too manyweapons around the world. Fortunately  today there aremore tools to control the spread of the most deadlyweapons. Last year we adopted the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty — a major breakthrough innuclear disarmament  which is feasible when pursued inconsecutive steps. The next step should be to ban thespread of fissile material for nuclear warheads.The world’s attention has been captured by thenegotiations in Oslo on the agreement to ban one of themost inhumane weapons: anti-personnel landmines. Wesupport these efforts  which require profound rethinkingof national defence strategies in many countries  includingLithuania. Confidence-building measures and securitycooperation will help humanitarian concerns reign overmilitary purposes.We have faith in regional and bilateral efforts todisarm. Europe has set out on the path of toughening therequirements for the stationing of conventional forces through the adaptation of the Treaty on ConventionalArmed Forces in Europe. We support this process andbelieve that it can be a model for other regions.Even though the total number of peacekeepingoperations and their average size have been reduced inrecent years  peacekeeping is still the key instrumentavailable to the United Nations in discharging its primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peaceand security. Together with Estonia and Latvia  and withPoland  Lithuania is developing joint peacekeeping units.Apart from its genuine objective of contributing to UnitedNations goals  this exercise is  in itself  a testimony to fullunderstanding and cooperation among the neighbouringcountries of our region.In recent years we have witnessed an increase in therole and functions of international civilian police inpeacekeeping operations. The civilian police forces canplay a major role  through assistance to local policeforces  in rebuilding national police and judicial systems in restoring civil order  in supporting the rule of law andin facilitating national reconciliation. The need forassistance from international civilian police is likely toincrease. It can be met by properly functioning UnitedNations standby arrangements  which are designed toexpand the rapid-deployment capacity of the Organization.Lithuania has decided to join the United Nations systemof standby arrangements for peacekeeping operations.Later today  I shall submit to the Secretary-General adetailed description of our permanently availablecontribution  including well-trained police officers.Nations around the world are being challenged bycertain phenomena which know no boundaries and whichcan be tackled only by joint action. Fighting internationalcrime  drug trafficking and terrorism and ensuringenvironmental protection and humanitarian aid are amongsuch challenges.9Lithuania wholeheartedly supports the Secretary-General’s reform effort to strengthen  through the UnitedNations entities in Vienna  the Organization’s capacitycoherently and systematically to address threats to thestability and development of society created bytransnational crime in all its manifestations. For its part  theGovernment of Lithuania is determined to enhance regionalstructures combating transnational organized crime as wellas fully to implement bilateral  regional and multilateralagreements in this area.We also look forward to the special session of theGeneral Assembly in 1998  which should enable theinternational community to develop new and improvedstrategies to address the problem of illicit narcotic drugs.Although the nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly was not a milestone of success and ended withfew commitments  we strongly believe that the political willdemonstrated by the presence of so many Heads of Stateand Government will be translated into action. The nextoccasion to demonstrate the seriousness of our intentions toprotect the environment and to agree on specific targets forreducing the emission of greenhouse gases  which were notrealized at the special session  will be the third session ofthe Conference of the Parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change  to be held inKyoto  Japan  this December.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights will afford a great occasion to see whathas been done and what can be done about the protectionof and respect for basic international human rights.We welcome the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinsonas the High Commissioner for Human Rights and expressour support for the structural reforms of the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights andthe Centre for Human Rights. Internal restructuring of theUnited Nations human rights organs should go hand in handwith close cooperation in human rights issues between theUnited Nations and such regional arrangements as theCouncil of Europe  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe and others.Illegal migration and trafficking in migrants threatenstability in Central and Eastern Europe. We believe thattreaties on readmission between the States of the regioncould be a key instrument against these threats. Lithuaniaurges the countries of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates that have not yet done so to accede to the 1951Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967Protocol and to further strengthen national institutionsresponsible for the management of migration flows.We believe in a regional approach to regional issues.We praise the United Nations reliance on regionalorganizations. The Organization for Cooperation andSecurity in Europe is a good example of what a regionalinstitution with a limited budget can do rather thanplacing the burden on the United Nations. The NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is another goodexample. The record of the two organizations in theformer Yugoslavia is much better than what could havebeen achieved had the United Nations alone dealt with thewar.Along with other measures towards a moreconsolidated peace  good-neighbourly relations havebecome vital for regional security and stability. We havedone our utmost to establish and maintain friendlyrelations with our neighbours  while simultaneously takingpractical steps towards integration into the EuropeanUnion and NATO. The accession of Lithuania toEuropean and transatlantic institutions will have asignificant impact on lasting security and stability.Yesterday the Russian Foreign Minister  Mr. Primakov proposed a different security model of our region.However  creating a substitute for transatlantic integrationis not in line with our vision. The international Vilniusconference entitled  “Coexistence of Nations and GoodNeighbourhood Relations — A Guarantee of Security andStability in Europe”  for which Lithuanian and PolishPresidents Algirdas Brazauskas and AleksanderKwasniewski acted as hosts in September of this year andwhich was attended by 12 Heads of State andGovernment  received joint greetings from the Presidentsof Germany and France  Roman Herzog and JacquesChirac. They wrote:""It is time to foster a culture of cooperation anddialogue all over Europe and to harness the politicalenergies of our peoples to bring about reconciliationand understanding ... Only in a spirit of unity community  friendship and good- neighbourlyrelations  as well as mutual understanding  will webe able to build the future of our continent.""Here at the United Nations  I am tempted to quote thissentence  but with the last word  ""continent "" in the plural."
"100",4281,"LUX",52,1997,"﻿First of all  I should like to extend my warmestcongratulations to you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second8session. As an architect of stability  you have played asubstantial role in securing the recent conclusion of anumber of major agreements with Ukraine’s neighbouringcountries. I am certain that both that experience and theexperience you have acquired in the field of internationalrelations and at the United Nations will be decisive factorsin leading this session to a successful outcome. I shouldlike to assure you  Sir  of our full support.I should also like to thank your predecessor Ambassador Razali  for the skill and commitment withwhich he led our work at the last session of the GeneralAssembly. I also wish to express my appreciation to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the splendid workhe has performed since taking office and  in particular  forhis wide-ranging proposals for the reform of the UnitedNations  which he presented last 16 July.It is an honour for me to address this Assembly todayon behalf of the European Union  which  like the UnitedNations  is seeking to change and renew itself in order toface more effectively the challenges of the new millennium.Globalization  with its emphasis on growinginterdependence between nations and their economies  isbringing profound changes in international relations. Aparticular feature of this globalization is the genuinerevolution in the field of information and communicationstechnologies  which banishes any notion of geographicaldistance. Globalization  characterized by the acceleration oftrade and financial flows and by increased marketintegration  is a source for both progress and freshopportunities. However  it also raises some seriousquestions  even among the industrialized countries  whichare experiencing a worrying rise in unemployment. We noteat the same time that these developments are passing bymany developing countries  which remain in great poverty.More than 1.5 billion people still live in absolute poverty.We cannot remain indifferent to this situation.We are particularly concerned by the growinginequality both within countries and between countries ofthe North and of the South  which is a dangerous source offurther conflict and tension.Free of the threat of confrontation in a polarizedworld  we are faced today with a series of global problemsboth old and new: underdevelopment  population growth increasingly large-scale migration  damage to theenvironment  the proliferation of weapons of all kinds terrorism  ethnic conflict  drug trafficking  violence — theblind  hateful violence against innocent people that wewitness nearly every day  for example in Algeria — andcrime  often in forms never before encountered.In order to deal successfully with all these problems it is essential that we continue to promote justice andsolidarity between all countries and individuals as well astolerance — I lay particular stress on “tolerance” — andrespect for others and  above all  to strengthencooperation between States on both the regional and theworld levels.Progressive integration that respects national identityis a hallmark of the policy of the States members of theEuropean Union. In scarcely more than 50 years  we havesucceeded in developing in Europe a stability and aprosperity that the continent has never before experienced.The European Union is based on democracy as itspolitical system and on a social market economy as itseconomic system. Our market economy is not a free-for-all; it is mitigated by considerations of social welfare.States retain full responsibility in the fields of health education and social justice. Although this system requiresconstant adjustment  its principles are sacrosanct.The European Union  wishing to respond to thechallenges of the post-cold-war world  proposes to takeup three major challenges over the years ahead: theestablishment of an economic and monetary union; thestrengthening of its institutional base through theimplementation of the Amsterdam Treaty; and preparationfor further enlargement towards the eastern and southernEurope.Economic and monetary union is probably the mostimportant and most ambitious economic and politicalproject to be implemented by Europe since the beginningof the integration process. The Euro  as the singlecurrency is to be known  will come into existence on 1January 1999. Its introduction is the culmination of thelengthy process of implementation of the single market.The Euro is the logical consequence of the ventureembarked upon with the European Community’sfoundation in 1957.In order to prepare for the single currency  the Statesmembers of the European Union have successfullycommitted themselves to strengthening the coordinationof their economic policies and the pursuit of healthier more stable macroeconomic and budgetary policies.The creation of the Euro will help to achieve greaterstability and a more balanced international monetary9system. It will help to reduce monetary uncertainty and willgive a boost to the development of trade  investment and hence  growth and employment both at the European andthe world levels.The Heads of State or Government of the EuropeanUnion reached political agreement on 17 June this year ona new treaty for Europe  the Amsterdam Treaty. ThisTreaty will be submitted for signature by plenipotentiariesin two weeks’ time. The Amsterdam Treaty marks a furtherstep in the building of Europe and opens the way for thelaunching of the enlargement process. It provides forgreater consistency in the external action of the Union  andwill enable it to anticipate crises more effectively and toprovide a more efficient protection of its economicinterests. It emphasizes the defence and security dimensionof the European Union  and clarifies in particular theUnion’s role in respect of peacekeeping or peacemakingmissions and humanitarian action.The new Treaty also provides for the creation of anarea of freedom  security and justice  which will enable theUnion to take more effective and coordinated action tocombat terrorism  major crime and illegal immigration.Finally  a number of provisions underline the importancethat the Union attaches to the promotion and to theprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.This coming December  the Union will take majordecisions on future enlargement. Negotiations on accessionshould begin as early as possible next year. Theinternational repercussions of the enlargement of the Unionwill far transcend the new frontiers of an enlarged Europe;this enlargement will add to Europe’s influence in theworld  will provide the European Union with newneighbours and will make Europe a peaceful  more unitedand more stable area.In taking up these three challenges  the EuropeanUnion member States seek to unite further in order to forma common front against the problem of unemployment andto take more effective action to combat organized crime terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of every kind  toact more effectively to prevent major environmentaldamage and to ensure lasting growth while making the bestpossible use of the world’s resources.At the same time  the European Union is seeking toincrease its influence over world affairs  promote valuessuch as peace and security  democracy and human rights ina more effective manner  defend its conception of the socialmodel and assert its presence on international markets.It is in that spirit  and in order to strengthencooperation in the political  economic and financial fields that the European Union is developing relations ofpartnership with all the countries of the world.A larger and more united European Union will alsomake a greater contribution towards developmentcooperation with the most disadvantaged countries. Thedevelopment assistance of the European Union is part ofa policy designed to roll back poverty and inequality inthe world and to foster a sustainable development.The Union is already the largest contributor to theregular budget of the United Nations and to the budgetfor United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is also thelargest international aid donor. The European Communityand its member States provide over half the humanitarianaid dispensed worldwide and fund 50 per cent ofinternational development aid. We provide 40 per cent ofassistance for the reconstruction process in Bosnia andHerzegovina  nearly 60 per cent of international aid toRussia and to the republics of the former Soviet Union half of the aid for the Palestinian territories and one thirdof the total aid for the Middle East.As in the past  the European Union describes itsrelations with third countries  together with its positionson and action in respect of areas of conflict throughoutthe world  in a memorandum that is circulated as anintegral part of this address. I should like  however  tohighlight a number of issues which continue to hold ourfull attention.The European Union continues to make a majorcontribution towards the consolidation of peace in all thecountries of the former Yugoslavia. It wishes to developits relations and to strengthen its cooperation with thosecountries to the extent that their respective Governmentspursue a policy which respects the peace agreementsconcluded and which enables them to progress towardsdemocracy  the rule of law  tolerance and respect forhuman rights and minorities.The European Union is concerned at the tardiness inimplementing the peace agreements in Bosnia andHerzegovina. It emphasizes that the responsibility forsuch implementation rests with the parties themselves.We fully support the efforts of the HighRepresentative  Mr. Carlos Westendorp. We pay a tributeto his deputy  Ambassador Gerd Wagner  to Mr. David10Krishkovich and to their colleagues who have given theirlives in their commitment to peace.The European Union is determined to insist on thestrict and full application of the peace agreements in Bosniaand Herzegovina and of the conclusions of the Sintraministerial meeting. It is on the basis of such applicationthat the European Union is willing to continue to contributeto the international reconstruction effort. It continues toattach great importance to the return of refugees anddisplaced persons and to demand the full cooperation of allparties with the International Criminal Tribunal as anecessary condition for a lasting reconciliation and a justpeace.Without minimizing the difficulties in the MuslimCroat Federation  the European Union observes withconcern the political crisis which has erupted in theRepublika Srpska. It calls on all parties to respect theconstitutional functioning of that entity and to take vigorousaction to reform the police and to establish freedom of thepress. We believe the holding of legislative elections underthe supervision of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) constitutes the appropriateand democratic means for resolving the present politicaldeadlock.The European Union welcomes the recent holding ofmunicipal elections  on 13 and 14 September  with theparticipation of all the parties. These elections mark animportant step in the process of democratization in Bosniaand Herzegovina. We appeal to the parties to respect theresults as certified by the OSCE.The European Union also remains concerned by thesituation in Kosovo  in particular by the lack of respect forhuman rights and the principles of the rule of law.Concerning Cyprus  the European Union regrets thatthe intercommunal talks under the aegis of the UnitedNations have failed to register progress. We call on theleaders of both communities to resume the talks  asproposed by Mr. Cordovez. We urge them and all partiesconcerned to work constructively and in good faith topromote the success of these talks. We reject any linkbetween the talks and the membership negotiations withCyprus. The latter will be initiated in accordance with thedecisions taken by the European Council and will contributepositively towards the search for a political solution. TheEuropean Union recalled that Cypriot membership shouldbenefit both communities and should help to bring aboutcivil peace and reconciliation.In the Middle East  the peace process is at aworrisome standstill. The European Union calls on thepeoples and Governments of the region to renew the spiritof mutual confidence which  at Madrid in 1991 and inOslo in 1993  gave rise to the hope of a just  lasting andcomprehensive peace. We call upon the Israeli andPalestinian leaders to continue the negotiations to furtherthe implementation of the Interim Agreement and theHebron agreement  and to resume talks on permanentstatus. We ask them once more to abstain from anyunilateral action which may prejudice the issues relatingto permanent status.The European Union firmly condemns the recentterrorist attacks in Jerusalem. We call on each side toshow absolute determination in combating terrorism. Wehope that cooperation in the field of security betweenIsrael and the Palestinian Authority will be re-establishedand reinforced. To that end  we propose the setting up ofa permanent security committee with the participation ofthe parties involved and  possibly  with that of the UnitedStates and the European Union.We urge both parties not to yield to blackmail byextremists bent on sabotaging the peace process. We askthat Israel discontinue certain measures taken with regardto the Palestinians which we consider to be counter-productive. In particular  we ask that Israel transfer all ofthe tax revenue owed to the Palestinian Authority. It isnot in the interests of peace to weaken the Palestinianeconomy  administration and leadership and to feed thefeelings of frustration and humiliation of an entire people.In the opinion of the European Union  peace remains theonly strategic choice and the only lasting guarantee forthe security and prosperity of both sides.The European Union will continue  through theefforts of its Special Envoy for the Middle East PeaceProcess  Ambassador Moratinos  as well as through itsdiplomatic relations  its economic commitment and itsrelations of friendship and trust with the various parties to work with the parties concerned both within andoutside the region  and especially with the United States to relaunch the peace process.In Africa  major developments have occurred inrecent months  notably in the Great Lakes region  whichcontinues to experience serious problems. The EuropeanUnion fully supports the efforts undertaken there  aselsewhere  by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)in close cooperation with the United Nations. It welcomesthe action taken by both its special representative 11Mr. Ajello  and the Special Representative of theSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the OAU Mr. Sahnoun. The international community must thus aimat establishing peace  at consolidating the process ofnational reconciliation in the countries concerned  atcreating a climate conducive to the voluntary return ofrefugees and of facilitating the establishment of normaldemocratic life. We support the introduction of the rule oflaw  which should put an end to the climate of impunityprevailing in the region and encourage its economic andsocial recovery.The accession of the new authorities in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo signals a very important change forthe Congo and the whole of Africa. The European Union isaware of the scale of requirements for reconstruction in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and is willing tocontribute its support for reconstruction. It confirms itsreadiness to resume cooperation with that Government ona gradual basis. The resumption of cooperation will depend according to the conclusions of the European Council ofAmsterdam  on the progress observed in the fields ofhuman rights  democratization and the establishment of therule of law.The European Union emphasizes the need for theGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo tocooperate fully with the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees in order to ensure the safereturn of refugees  particularly to Rwanda. We also urge theGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo tocooperate fully with the United Nations in order that themission investigating the allegations of massacres and otherhuman rights violations can take place without impedimentor delay.The European Union remains seriously worried by thesituation in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) and isconcerned that the parties to the conflict have so far failedto overcome their differences. We urge all the partiesinvolved to cease hostilities and to work together to achievenational reconciliation and restore a peaceful society. Wereiterate the Union’s full support for the mediation effortsundertaken by President Bongo of Gabon.The European Union condemns all violence inBurundi. It encourages the authorities of that country toaccelerate the dismantling of the reassembly camps. Weearnestly appeal to all parties in Burundi to embarkdefinitively on the road towards negotiation and nationalreconciliation.The European Union is also concerned by theworsening insecurity in Rwanda’s north-westernprovinces  which affects all populations  withoutexception.The European Union welcomes the success of themonitoring mission in the Central African Republic established under the Bangui Agreements.The European Union also continues to be concernedby the situation in Cambodia  which is likely tojeopardize the whole democratization process and themajor efforts by the international community in supportof that country’s reconstruction. We renew our supportfor the mediation efforts by the Association of South-EastAsian Nations and welcome the constructive constitutionalrole played by His Majesty King Sihanouk in the searchfor a solution to this crisis.We appeal for an immediate end to all violence inCambodia and reiterate the importance we attach to theholding of free pluralist elections in 1998.I would like now to take up several thematicquestions.The tragic consequences of the indiscriminate spreadand use of anti-personnel landmines have aroused genuineemotion in world public opinion in recent years. InOctober 1996 the Union  for its part  adopted a decisionon joint action on anti-personnel landmines in which itexpresses its determination to achieve the aim of totallyeliminating such mines and of actively working towardsthe earliest possible conclusion of an effectiveinternational agreement on a worldwide ban on theseweapons.We welcome the work done at the recent OsloDiplomatic Conference  which resulted in the adoption ofan international Convention. We shall also be pursuingthe achievement of our aims at the Conference onDisarmament.Next 10 December will see the start of celebrationson the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. That Declaration adopted on 10 December 1948  and the two internationalpacts and other legal instruments on the subject that weresubsequently adopted  are still fully relevant today. Wereaffirm our deep commitment to the universality ofhuman rights and to their protection and promotion. Theyear 1988 will provide an opportunity for all members of12the international community to step up their actions toensure better implementation of the universal principles ofthe Declaration through the instruments and machinery ofthe United Nations.The year 1998 will also be an opportunity to reviewthe implementation of the Declaration and Programme ofAction adopted at the World Conference on Human Rightsheld in Vienna in 1993.We welcome the appointment of Mrs Mary Robinsonas United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.She will have our full support. We wish to underline theimportance of her mission  not least in the context of thefiftieth anniversary.Regarding the environment and development  theGeneral Assembly will be asked to endorse at this sessionthe results of the special session on the follow-up toAgenda 21 and of the Rio Conference. The European Unionconsiders it essential that the implementation of Agenda 21receive fresh political impetus. We believe it is imperativethat we come to a substantial conclusion of the negotiationson climate change to be held in Kyoto in December. Weurge all States to work towards that end.We have proposed clear objectives for the reduction ofgreenhouse-gas emissions  and we hope that other Stateswill very soon be making their own detailed proposals inorder to speed up the progress that is vitally needed if theKyoto session of the Conference is to be a success.Two years ago the Heads of State and Governmentmeeting in this Hall on the occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations observed that  in arapidly changing world  the objectives set out in the Charterhad lost none of their relevance.In many regions of the planet  we still have to face upto serious threats to international peace and security. Morethan ever  we need to promote economic and socialdevelopment. It is vital that the ideals upon which ourOrganization is founded — human rights  good governanceand democracy — come to be reflected more and more inthe behaviour of public authorities and in people’s everydaylives. The primacy of the rule of law must be reaffirmed.We realize that if our Organization is to respondadequately to the profound changes in its externalenvironment it must adapt its structures to the new realitiesof the modern world.Last July we heard the Secretary-General’s ambitiousproposals  and we welcomed them. It is not  of course  aquestion of rewriting the mandates of the United Nations to which we remain deeply committed  but oftransforming the Organization into a productive andefficient instrument at the service of all the peoples of theworld.In examining these proposals  at its fifty-secondsession  the General Assembly is embarking on a periodof debate and decision-making that promises to be one ofthe most significant in the history of the United Nations.We need an Organization that fulfils its mandate topreserve peace and international security more rapidly andeffectively by building better capacities for action in thefields of preventive diplomacy  peacekeeping andpeacemaking  and by having more effective capacities foraction in the areas of recovery and reconstruction after aconflict.We need an Organization that responds better to oneof its fundamental objectives  which consists of promotingeconomic and social progress  eradicating poverty andensuring the widest possible participation in an expandingworld economy.We need United Nations funds and programmes thatcan translate the objectives of the Organization in thefield of sustainable development. They must offer thecountries and the peoples of the world both materialsupport and a frame of reference that will enable them togenerate their own development in the most efficientmanner and in a way suited to their specific needs.We need a United Nations system that provides acredible response to the complex problems ofhumanitarian assistance and emergency situations problems which include conflict prevention  peacekeeping rehabilitation and transition towards development.Finally  we need an Organization that integrates inall its activities the fundamental concept of respect forhuman rights  which is an integral part of the quest forpeace and security  economic prosperity and social justice.To attain those objectives  our Organization must beable to rely not only on the commitment of the Secretary-General and the cooperation of Member States  but on thesupport of every sector of international society  and inparticular on the non-governmental organizations  whoseefforts inspire and complement our own.13The programme of reforms put forward by theSecretary-General has two parts. The first concerns theresponsibility of the Secretary-General himself. Itsupplements the series of proposals he put forward inMarch this year. It is designed to rationalize the operationsof Secretariat services and United Nations agencies and toimprove their coordination. The proposals are intended tomould those services into a more coherent structure. Thereis a need to establish a community of ideas  a coherence ofeffort and greater flexibility in implementing action. Weurge the Secretary-General to implement those proposals asquickly as possible. The European Union considers thatmodalities could be worked out to see that the savingsrealized are reinvested in the field of development.The second part of the programme deals withimproving the operation of the United Nations system andstrengthening its intergovernmental machinery. It requiresthe approval of Member States. Here  too  the EuropeanUnion believes that the method used and the choices madeby the Secretary-General should open the way to effectiveand far-reaching reform of the United Nations. This appliesparticularly to the promotion of economic and socialdevelopment  which must remain one of the priorityobjectives of our Organization.In this sector  the reform should improve theOrganization’s capacity for action at the intergovernmentalas well as the structural and managerial levels. In the viewof the European Union  the reform of the United Nations as an instrument in the service of development  cannot beconceived as a cost-cutting exercise; on the contrary  itmust be designed to strengthen and revitalize theOrganization so that it can respond to the challenges of thefuture in the most effective way possible. Only a reformedand revitalized United Nations can create the foundation fora global partnership between developing countries developed countries and multilateral organizations  with theprime objective of achieving sustained and sustainabledevelopment.The European Union believes that  taken as a whole the programme of reforms proposed by the Secretary-General represents a balanced package. It attempts to takeinto account the various interests in play and  onceimplemented  will enable the Organization to fulfil itsmandate more adequately and to carry out its tasks in theservice of the international community more effectively.We therefore consider that  if we want to achieve therenewal of the United Nations  it is of overridingimportance that the Secretary-General’s proposals beexamined by the General Assembly in an integratedmanner and as a package. It is also important to abide  sofar as possible  by the timetable that the Secretary-General has suggested  so that the reform measures canstart to be implemented at the beginning of 1998.The reform programme before us affords us a uniqueopportunity to reform the Organization from top tobottom. It is for us  the Member States  to demonstratethe necessary ambition  courage and clarity of vision toshow that we are equal to this challenge.The European Union is well aware that the proposalsbefore us necessarily represent a compromise between thesometimes divergent interests of Member States  and thatthey cannot  therefore  fully reflect either its own viewsor those of other schools of thought within the GeneralAssembly.Because we believe that the programme of reforms taken as a whole  represents significant progress for ourOrganization  the Union does not intend to press for thefine points of its own positions to be taken into accountwith regard to each of the proposals or recommendationsbefore us. It is our hope that other delegations willapproach this exercise in a similar spirit and that they canagree to put the general positive thrust of the package ofproposals before the satisfaction of their individualdemands.Over the coming weeks the European Union intendsto play an active part in the Assembly’s work. Our taskis to reach general agreement on a feasible  constructiveand coherent response to the Secretary-General’sproposals  one that respects his responsibilities and hisauthority.Necessary as it is  the reform exercise on which wehave embarked will not bear fruit until the United Nationshas the financial resources it needs to fulfil its mandates.For several years now  the United Nations has beenembroiled in a financial crisis  which began as a cash-flow problem  but which has now become structural. Thatcrisis is undermining the necessary sense of partnershipbetween Member States and compromisingimplementation of the Organization’s programmes inmany areas. The European Union has often stated that thecrisis cannot be resolved until all Member States haveagreed to meet their obligations under the United NationsCharter in full by settling their arrears and by paying ontime and without conditions the full amount of their14mandatory contributions to the Organization’s regularbudget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations.The States members of the European Union  whosecontributions represent 35 per cent of the regular budgetand 38 per cent of the peacekeeping budget  have alwayshonoured their financial obligations promptly  fully andunconditionally.The European Union has put forward a package ofcoherent proposals designed to put the Organization on asound and predictable financial footing. They relate tomeasures to speed up the payment of arrears  to tighten upthe system for paying contributions  to monitor UnitedNations spending more closely and to reform the scale ofassessment so as to better reflect the principle of ability topay.It is important that together  at this fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly  we find a constructiveand viable solution to these questions  which arefundamental if we wish to ensure that our Organization hasthe capacity to fulfil its mandate at the dawn of the twenty-first century."
"101",4307,"LVA",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to congratulate thePresident on his election and express my confidence inhis leadership during a crucially important session of theGeneral Assembly. I wish to assure him that Latvia’s pastexperience of fruitful bilateral cooperation with Ukrainewill guide the delegation of Latvia in pursuit of ourcommon tasks at this session of the Assembly.20I wish to recognize with gratitude Ambassador RazaliIsmail of Malaysia for his determined leadership during thefifty-first session of the Assembly  as well as of its GeneralCommittee  of which Latvia was a member.At the outset I will address the need for UnitedNations reform  follow that with a response to the reformproposals of the Secretary-General  and  finally  inform theAssembly about Latvia’s recent experiences with reforms.Recent history suggests why reforming ourOrganization is essential. In 1945 many delegates to thefounding conference of our Organization travelled to SanFrancisco by train and by sea. Delegates to the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly have travelled to NewYork by air. They communicate with their capitals by veryfast electronic means that did not exist 50 years ago. Theseadvances in the technology of travel and information havefacilitated an enormous and continuing expansion ofinternational activities by ever greater numbers of State andnon-State actors.Most important for the United Nations is theexpansion of international activities by state actors otherthan members of foreign services. The participants in thesetransgovernmental activities come from many governmentalinstitutions: the courts  police  central banks and regulatoryagencies.State as well as non-State actors form successfultransnational organizations that are independent of theUnited Nations system. These organizations can becompetitors and cooperating partners for the UnitedNations. A United Nations that does not continually evolveto offer a coherent response to changing global conditionsis a United Nations that risks becoming irrelevant.The world needs a United Nations that can contributeeffectively to the solution of complex global problems  suchas those caused by the three-fold increase since 1945 ofboth the global population and the number of independentStates. It needs a United Nations that will be a leader in theshaping of a new and workable international political orderto fill the place vacated by the bipolar order of the cold-warera. This will be done best by a United Nations withuniversal membership.Latvia believes that the package of reform proposalswhich the Secretary-General has presented to this Assemblycontains measures which will enable the United Nations torespond to the imperative of organizational evolution.Latvia views this package as a work in progress  rather thanas completed reform proposals for the long term. Buteven if the proposals are imperfect or not complete  theyare the best this Assembly has before it. Latvia willsupport the reform package as a good springboard forreform and hopes that other Member States will do thesame.During the next few months  the General Assemblyand the Secretary-General will need to work together tobegin the process of implementing the reform package.The Secretary-General will have to report regularly toMember States on the progress of the reforms. He willhave to develop implementation plans forrecommendations approved  on the basis of informedconsiderations  by the General Assembly and other UnitedNations organs. This Assembly will have to elaboratefurther the procedure for addressing the proposals of theSecretary-General. It may wish to decide on additionalreforms. Latvia expects that lessons will be learned duringthe implementation of the reform proposals and that thelessons will suggest mid-course corrections  improvementsand even termination of some elements in the package.Let me now turn to several substantive aspects ofreform that may touch upon the Secretary-General’sreform package  but are not a part of it.The success of reform depends upon a soundfinancial footing for the Organization. In this regard  threerecent interconnected processes may be noted. Theseprocesses are  first  rapid changes since 1991 inpeacekeeping budgets and a basically unchanging regularbudget; secondly  reform of the assessment methodologyunder way since 1994; and  thirdly and most important recent unprecedented increases in overdue outstandingcontributions.The interdependence of these three processes meansthat the General Assembly will have to work out ways totreat the three processes as parts of a whole. It is alsonecessary that the Assembly make decisions that assure agenuine movement towards achieving a sound financialsituation within a few years at most.In regard to the very difficult question of SecurityCouncil reform  Latvia wishes to reiterate its continuedsupport for an expansion of the Council that would resultin more equitable geographical and small-staterepresentation.Latvia believes that the mixed outcomes of thecomplex post-cold-war peacekeeping operations initiated21by the Security Council may have relevance to the reformof the Council. Learning how to improve the success rateof these operations could have the side benefit of pointingtowards Security Council reforms that might improve themaintenance of international peace and security.Latvia has a special interest in the future of UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  since the Baltic Battalion(BALTBAT)  in which Latvians serve side by side withEstonians and Lithuanians  has completed a successful yearof learning to cooperate and interface. This has been donewhile participating in a multinational operation: theStabilization Force (SFOR) peacekeeping mission in Bosniaand Herzegovina. BALTBAT  which has been trained andequipped with the help and encouragement of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Nordicpartners of the Baltic States  corresponds to their standardsand has become fully operational.In view of the growth of crimes that escape nationalpunishment or that cross national borders  Latvia fullysupports the establishment of an independent  efficient andauthoritative international criminal court with independentprosecution. We consider this to be the most importantdevelopment in international law since the creation of theInternational Court of Justice. Latvia intends to participateactively in the completion of the establishment of the courtin 1998.In regard to reforms in Latvia  it may be noted at theoutset that they are driven by the need to overcome theconsequences of 50 years of occupation  which caused thepolitical  economic and social development of Latvia to fallbehind its Nordic neighbours. In its sixth year of restoredindependence  Latvia continues with reforms designed tocatch up with its Nordic neighbours. Latvia wishes to builda solidly democratic foundation for long-term economic andsocial well-being.In this endeavour  Latvia receives internationalassistance from many sources. One source is the UnitedNations system  cooperation with which — primarily withthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) —has contributed significantly to the improvement of socialand economic well-being in Latvia. The United Nationspresence in Latvia began in 1992 with an integrated officeunder the leadership of a resident coordinator who is alsothe UNDP representative. The integrated office  essentiallya United Nations House  has allowed cost-effective accessto the technical assistance offered by any part of the UnitedNations system. In addition  UNDP mobilizes bilateral andmultilateral donors for projects in which it participates. Iwish to express my deepest gratitude to UNDP and thedonors who have made contributions to Latvia’s reformprojects.I will now focus on reforms in only three of theareas that have an impact on social well-being and inwhich UNDP and the donors it has mobilized have beeninvolved.The first area is human rights. Although at its lastsession the Assembly concluded its consideration of thequestion of human rights in Latvia and Estonia  I believethat a brief report on some human rights developmentsduring this year may nevertheless be of interest at thissession.Latvia cooperates with the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights. Recently Latvia made a financialcontribution — its first voluntary contribution ever to anyUnited Nations body — in support of work by theCommissioner’s staff on national human rightsinstitutions.The Latvian National Human Rights Office established in 1995 as an independent national institution has begun to have a tangible impact  particularly on therights of vulnerable social groups. The somewhatunprecedented powers and functions of the Office havegenerated considerable interest in other central and easternEuropean countries. The Office has received UNDPtechnical and financial assistance at all stages of itsconception  planning and development.On 4 June 1997 Latvia ratified the EuropeanConvention for the Protection of Human Rights  thusproviding new legal guarantees to its residents  includingthe right of individual complaint and compulsoryjurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.Human rights were further strengthened through adoptionof the Law on Refugees and Asylum Seekers andratification of the 1951 United Nations Conventionrelating to the Status of Refugees.Another area affecting social well-being andintegration is language training offered to the relativelylarge segment of the population that lacks a knowledge ofLatvian  the State language. The Government of Latviaapproved the National Programme for Latvian LanguageTraining in 1995. Since then the Programme hascompleted the training of a core body of teachers.Textbooks and teacher handbooks have been published.22The third area relevant to social well-being is supportfor the re-emergence of civil society. Since the time ofnational reawakening 10 years ago  almost 3 000 non-governmental organizations have been established in Latvia.The first major national non-governmental-organizationforum will take place in Riga this weekend. I note that itsorganizers have received valuable assistance from theUNDP office in Latvia.With regard to economic well-being  the Governmenthas worked hard to achieve macroeconomic stability duringthe transition process from a centrally planned to anefficient market economy. As a result  economic growth hasresumed and inflation has decreased dramatically. Realgross-domestic-product growth for 1997 is estimated at 4per cent. By June of this year inflation had declined toabout 7.5 per cent on an annual basis. These achievementsare accompanied by continuing economic hardship for largesegments of the population. Social welfare and poverty-alleviation projects are aimed at decreasing these hardships.Latvia intends to apply the lessons learned from itsreform experiences to its work as a member of theEconomic and Social Council. One general lesson learnedin Latvia is that the results of reforms include not onlybenefits but also costs. The cost hardest to bear is probablyinsecurity about the ultimate outcome of reforms.We  the reformers of the United Nations  will surelyhave to bear the cost of insecurity as well. Perhaps a bit ofancient wisdom can diminish the insecurity. The Romanphilosopher and Emperor Marcus Aurelius  in hisMeditations  asked three questions about reforms:“Is any man afraid of change? Why  what can takeplace without change? What then is more pleasing orsuitable”than change?"
"102",4354,"MAR",52,1997,"﻿First of all  let me say how very pleased I am tocongratulate you sincerely  Sir  on behalf of thedelegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  on yourelection to preside over the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly — an election that is a token ofconsideration for your political experience and greatcompetence.It is also a pleasure for me to salute you  Sir  asthe representative of the friendly country of Ukraine which has solid ties of friendship and full cooperationwith the Kingdom of Morocco. I am convinced thatyour vast experience and excellent command of11international affairs will guarantee the success of ourdebates and will lead our session to results that open upnew prospects of peace  cooperation and prosperity.I should like to take this opportunity to express tothe outgoing President  Mr. Razali Ismail  therepresentative of the friendly country of Malaysia  ourrespect and gratitude for his efforts and for havingsuccessfully guided the work of our previous session.I should also like to extend to the new Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  my mostsincere congratulations on the confidence placed in himby virtue of his election as Secretary-General  whichcrowns many years of competent management andtireless effort within the context of the United Nations.His election also reaffirms the deep consideration inwhich the friendly country of Ghana is held.Since our last session  the world has beenexperiencing a period of various political and economicinteraction which  unfortunately  has not lived up tomankind's aspirations for bringing the internationalcommunity closer to tranquillity  security and peace.International relations indeed continue to be fraught withvarious tensions and disturbances. Thus  on theinternational scene  new conflicts have emerged whichthreaten the security  stability and sovereignty of peoples.Given these challenges  we believe that thoseproblems which emerge in the international arena todaycan be resolved only through international efforts underthe auspices of the United Nations. In this context  weapplaud the efforts made by the Secretary-General toreform and restructure the United Nations and improve itsworking methods in accordance with the requirements ofthis age. In the same way  we reaffirm our support for allof these efforts aimed at strengthening our Organizationand enhancing its effectiveness to allow it to carry out itsmission in full  in accordance with the provisions of theCharter.We firmly believe that the aims of any reformdesigned to restructure the Organization and rationalizeits expenditures can be attained only if due account istaken of the interests of the developing countries and above all  if reform provides for a solution to theireconomic and social problems as well as the provision ofmaterial and technical means required for these ends.With regard to enlargement of the SecurityCouncil  we would like to stress the need for consensusand the achievement of balanced and equitablerepresentation of all continents  in particular since theconditions in which United Nations bodies  includingthe Security Council  were established have nowdisappeared. The world is now witnessing profound andswift changes which force us to reconsider thecomposition and role of the Security Council to make ita genuinely effective instrument which is not subject toobjectives and interests which contravene the Charter.The international community welcomed withoptimism the peace process which began in the MiddleEast on the basis of agreements reached between theparties concerned. However  the interruption of thispeace process  as a result of the violation by theGovernment of Israel of all previous commitments andthe contravention of all obligations and rules ofinternational conduct now threaten to wipe out allprevious efforts to strengthen the foundations for peacein the region.The violation by the Government of Israel of itscommitments was illustrated by its decision to resumeits settlement policy and to alter the culturalcharacteristics and demographic composition of EastJerusalem. This decision is in violation of previousagreements with the Palestinian side. This unilateral andillegitimate decision is also a blatant violation of theFourth Geneva Convention  which forbids occupationauthorities from effecting any changes in the territoriesunder their control.Israel  which is still persisting in its refusal toimplement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1978)  has once again brought aboutan escalation of tension in southern Lebanon  and iscontinuing to ignore the Syrian proposals to resumenegotiations from the point at which they were brokenoff.Our vision emanates from our conviction thatpeace in the region cannot endure or achieve its goalsexcept through equitable treatment which guarantees themutual interests of all parties and in the context of aregion free from weapons of mass destruction.Convinced as we are of the need to pursue peaceefforts  and conduct this process in accordance with thelegal framework laid down for it  we would like tostress the need to honour all the obligations stipulated12in the agreements signed  and the adherence to credibilityin dealings based on such agreements  which will lead topeace and security for all the peoples of the region  andallow the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and establish their independent State withAl-Quds as its capital.In this framework  the international communityshould take the necessary measures to make Israel respectand implement Security Council resolutions.The stability of the Middle East requires theestablishment and consolidation of security in the Gulfregion. We deplore the sufferings of the Iraqi people who are living in extremely harsh conditions as a resultof the economic embargo which has been imposed onthem for many years now  and we reaffirm that theimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)on “oil for food” is a first step towards lifting theembargo imposed on the Iraqi people. We look forwardto the day in the near future which will mark the end ofthat suffering and the return of Iraq to the exercise of itsrights as a member of the Arab family of nations and anactive and constructive member of the internationalcommunity.Morocco  as a part of the Arab Maghreb region takes a special interest in the existing dispute between theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and certain western countriesbecause of its negative impact on the regional situationand on the brotherly Libyan people.Thus  we call for a favourable response to theinitiatives undertaken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya andthe flexibility it has demonstrated  and the efforts exertedby the Arab Maghreb Union  the League of Arab States the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement with a view to lifting the sanctionsimposed on Libya.Morocco  which has closely followed thedevelopment of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovinaand has contributed  along with other members of theinternational community  to the initiatives proposed bythe chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and through participation of Moroccan military units inthe Implementation Force and Stabilization Force expresses its satisfaction at the progress made in theimplementation of the military and civilian aspects of theDayton Accord  and stresses the need to pursue efforts toensure its full implementation with a view to establishingthe legitimate rights of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina and to contribute to the reconstruction ofthe country through provision of the requisite means asagreed by the conferences of donor countries.As an African nation  and given its age-old andvaried relations with other African countries  andfurthermore conscious of its obligations to Africa Morocco expresses deep concern about the deteriorationof the political  economic and social conditions in manyparts of that continent.Morocco follows with deep concern thepersistence of instability in some parts of Africa  andreaffirms its determination to support and enhance theefforts of the international community to findappropriate and lasting solutions to crises.On the other hand  the woeful economic situationin Africa is a source of concern for the internationalcommunity. This situation is particularly reflected in theweak participation of the continent in world trade andin an increase in its debt burden. It is also reflected in achronically inadequate infrastructure  a seriousdeterioration in social and health conditions  and despite the stringent structural reforms introduced byAfrican countries  by the paucity of foreign investment.In this context  we welcome the initiative taken byPortugal to convene a European-African summitmeeting to consider these conditions in the continentand to seek appropriate solutions. We consider that thisinitiative reflects the awareness of the European Unionin respect of its responsibilities with regard to Africa.Morocco therefore proposes the convening of aministerial meeting to prepare for that summit.Similarly  the Security Council's initiative calling forthe convening of a special meeting at the foreignministerial level to consider the situation in Africaattests to the degree of concern of the internationalcommunity with regard to the gravity of that situation.In its relations with all other African countries Morocco has always adopted policies aimed at effectivecooperation  taking into consideration the priorities andthe basic needs of our partners.As a consequence of the profound changes thataffected the world economy after the Second WorldWar  it has become current knowledge that the world istoday characterized primarily by the globalization of theeconomy. However  the new challenge which faces theinternational community today lies in coping with13economic and social development issues in all theirdimensions  and doing so in harmony with our efforts toachieve peace and security.The liberalization of world markets and theglobalization and comprehensiveness of the worldeconomy have led to a noticeable increase in the volumeof trade and financial flows. However  this has not easedthe marginalization of developing countries or reducedtheir debt burden.Morocco  which has been following with interest theactivities of the World Trade Organization (WTO) considers that liberalization of trade must be basicallyaimed at correcting existing discrepancies and atnarrowing the gap between developed and developingcountries.We hope that the second WTO conference  due totake place in Geneva  will provide a new opportunity forthe international community which leads to consolidatingthe bases and rules governing multilateral relations  andto taking decisions likely to reconcile the imperative fortrade liberalization and the requirements of development while responding to the aspirations of developingcountries by allowing them  if necessary  to adoptprotectionist trade measures.With regard to the question of the Sahara  Morocco which cooperated with Mr. James Baker as soon as hewas appointed Personal Envoy of the Secretary-Generalfor Western Sahara  hopes that the results achieved willallow for the implementation of the United Nationssettlement plan. In this regard  Morocco  which took theinitiative of proposing a referendum in 1981  stressesonce more its readiness and desire to cooperate with theUnited Nations for the achievement of this objective.The most important achievement of the internationalcommunity in this century  to which we soon bidfarewell  was the end of colonialism in almost all regionsof the world. In the past few months  the world haswitnessed the return of Hong Kong to its parent country the People's Republic of China  and Macao will also beso returned in 1999. In the light of the example of HongKong and the plans for the future of Macao  logic nowdictates the elimination of all remaining pockets ofcolonialism throughout the world.Here I am referring in particular to the Moroccancities of Sebta and Melilla and the islands adjacent tothem  which remain under Spanish domination. Moroccohas always believed in the virtues of dialogue as acivilized way of reaching a final settlement to theproblem of Sebta and Melilla so as to enable Moroccoto regain its sovereignty over those territories whileguaranteeing Spain's interests. It was in this context thatHis Majesty King Hassan II took the initiative incalling for the setting up of a Moroccan-Spanish unit toconsider a final solution to this question. This initiativeimplies a greater rapprochement between the twocountries  whose impact would spread to wider andmore comprehensive fields.Humankind is still committed to the noblepurposes laid down in the Charter of our Organization.It is therefore incumbent upon us to pursue effortsaiming at the furtherance of those purposes so that together  in a spirit of confidence and renewed hope we may bring about a better future for all ofhumankind."
"103",4378,"MCO",52,1997,"﻿It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate you  Sir  onyour outstanding election. Your competence and your vastexperience in multilateral diplomacy  to which you havedevoted a large part of your professional life  together withyour personal qualities assure us that our work will beconducted properly and be successful.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay awell-earned tribute to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia forthe effective way in which he conducted the fifty-firstsession of our General Assembly.I congratulate  also  the members of the Bureau  whoI am convinced stand ready to do their utmost to ensurethe success of this important session.It is in fact an important session because  upon theinvitation of the Secretary-General  it is being devotedlargely to an exchange of views  which I hope will beproductive  on the reform of the Organization.The document before us  entitled “Renewing theUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform”  is of thegreatest interest to my country's authorities. The desire tomake the Organization  and above all its Secretariat  moreefficient by improving the coherence and coordination ofits activities is the very judicious inspiration for theproposed reform process. That desire is easy tounderstand and endorse  given its obvious responsivenessto current real needs.During the 52 years of its existence  the UnitedNations has regularly been challenged by the requirementsof an ever changing world and has thus been led todevelop or create new structures — without  however always reducing or suppressing old ones.The current exceptionally broad changes in thepolitical  economic and social spheres irresistibly call fora profound transformation of multilateral cooperation.They require the Organization to make an ineluctableeffort to adapt that cannot be delayed without jeopardizingits prestige and seeing its international role inexorablywither. Thus  we can only endorse the will demonstrated bythe General Assembly at the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations and the recent initiatives undertaken. In ourview  it is rational to concentrate and better coordinate theOrganization's missions around the five great pillars of itsCharter responsibilities: international peace and security development  humanitarian affairs  economic and socialaffairs and human rights.The promotion and protection of human rights  whichthe Secretary-General very rightly proposes to strengthen receive the intersectoral treatment which theirmultidisciplinary nature naturally evokes. That nature mustnot allow us to forget  however  that this fundamental areaof the Organization's competence requires the strengtheningof its appropriate structures. The High Commissioner forHuman Rights  Mrs. Mary Robinson  who has just assumedher office — and whose arrival we welcome sincerely andconfidently — must be given sufficient human and financialresources  as well as the decision-making autonomy necessary to fulfil the essential duties that have fallen toher.Next year's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be anopportunity to recall the commitments undertaken by theMember States when they adopted that text on 10December  1948  and  a few years later  on 16 December1966  the two international human rights agreements which I am pleased to say  the Principality has recently ratified.The Emergency Relief Coordinator entrusted withhumanitarian assistance must also enjoy the greatestautonomy and the means necessary to allow him tointervene effectively and promptly when necessary — atask that the Government of the Principality accords thehighest priority.This autonomy must  more generally  touch the entireinternational civil services. The independence of UnitedNations agents — the Secretary-General first amongthem — is the guarantee of the quality of their service andof the trust which the international community places inthem.The decision to bring together all the fieldprogrammes and information centres in common premises to be known as United Nations Houses  is both rational andsymbolic. It is an ideal response to the current needs toconcentrate and better coordinate operational activities while promoting a strong and cohesive image of the entiresystem. We strongly encourage the Secretary-General topursue this approach  which has recently been undertakenin South Africa.For those States that will not have the opportunity tohost such Houses  might we not consider establishing aUnited Nations presence in the form of a volunteerhonourary representative: a national figure mandated alongside the authorities  to disseminate information andheighten general awareness? The widespread practice ofappointing honourary consuls could  in this respect  serveas an example.The special team dedicated to reorientinginformation activities highlights  in the Secretary-General's report  a need which we understand: to improveand enlarge the United Nations capacity to communicateat the country level through innovative local partnerships.The establishment of honourary United Nationsrepresentatives would be one way to follow up thatsuggestion on a practical and affordable level.As the Secretary-General points out  public interestin the United Nations could also be sharpened by theorganization of high-level thematic debates within GeneralAssembly bodies. We agree with this  given that suchdebates would receive more attention from the press andpublic opinion than those currently held and would lessenthe need for large world conferences.The Security Council has already taken steps toimprove information services and exchanges with MemberStates that are not members of the Council and with theinternational community at large. These steps are usefuland welcome and are beginning to bear fruit.The important question of enlarging the membershipof that principal organ  which depends on a decision fromthe Member States  is also of great interest to us. TheHigh-level Working Group on that subject has workedtremendously hard under the leadership of successivePresidents of the General Assembly and the dedication ofits Vice-Presidents. We convey to them our warmestthanks. The Principality of Monaco is ready to endorseunreservedly any commitment or solution that might beachieved  including the creation of long-term seats lastingsix to 10 years  for example.In tandem with the improvement already begun inthe functioning of the Economic and Social Council  someconsidered attention also appears to be necessary to the2Trusteeship Council. The suggestions made by theSecretary-General seem to us to be wise and far-sighted.The Principality of Monaco could support the idea ofentrusting that organ with new trusteeship responsibilitiesin the spheres of the environment and the protection of thecommon human patrimony. Outer space  the atmosphere the high seas  as well as the free zones of the Arctic andAntarctic — especially in the spirit of the 1959 Treaty —would all stand to gain  under certain conditions  by beingplaced within its competence. The Council might also beentrusted with the ongoing task of considering the greattransformations that would be entailed by predictableadvances in science and technology.We must hope that the proposed reforms will bespeedily enacted  so that the Millennium Assemblyproposed by the Secretary-General for the year 2000 willindeed be an occasion for celebrating an updated andmodernized United Nations.The Principality  which this year is celebrating the700th anniversary of my family's dynasty in Monaco  canonly wish long life to a United Nations strengthened andmore open to civil society.Turning now to the nearer future  allow me toemphasize the importance that my country attaches toconcluding the work on the international criminal court which should lead to a plenipotentiary diplomaticconference next year in Rome. A collective morality that isuniversal in scope cannot exist without institutions todisseminate it  implement it and ensure its respect.The adoption of a Convention on anti-personnellandmines  which continue to inflict their savagery oncivilian populations  has long been one of our goals. Is notrespect for the dignity and physical integrity of humanbeings one of the most essential and universally recognizedvalues  one that underlies both human rights andhumanitarian law?The meeting convened by Canada last October and theseries of meetings held in Vienna  Bonn and Brussels thisyear  as well as the diplomatic conference that recently tookplace in Oslo have led to the drafting of a text  which  inthe spirit of resolution 51/45 S  prohibits not only the usebut also the development  stockpiling and transfer of suchmines. We truly welcome this development.In the same vein  I should like to note that thePrincipality has recently submitted its instruments ofaccession to the Convention on Prohibitions orRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional WeaponsWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or toHave Indiscriminate Effects  a Convention that we believeconstitutes great progress in the rules of warfare.Next year will be the International Year of theOcean  for which we are making active preparations. Themarine environment laboratory of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency in Monaco has recently movedinto new  spacious and functional offices made availableto it by our Government. That laboratory  thanks to itsmodern equipment  is helping to identify sources and newchemical markers of marine pollution. It regularlyorganizes training courses and consultative missions  andit is actively contributing  with the assistance of theUnited Nations Environment Programme and theIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission  to theMEDPOL programme to combat pollution in theMediterranean — an issue of great interest to us.The International Year of the Ocean should providean opportunity to strengthen such programmes as well asinternational cooperation to promote the preservation andmanagement of marine resources  including certain fishstocks and marine mammals. At the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly on the environment lastJune  many delegations emphasized these issues. Echoingthe Commission on Sustainable Development  some quiterightly recalled the need regularly to assess  on anintergovernmental level and in the framework of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  thequality of the marine environment. This has been done foralmost 20 years in France  Italy and Monaco under theRAMOGE programme. We hope that other regionalcooperation activities of this nature will develop in 1998.For coastal States as well as for the internationalcommunity  the oceans and the seas must be a protected shared space  sparingly exploited — not a place forintense economic confrontation.Finally  like the European Union  whose views onmany issues we share  the Principality of Monaco remainsvery concerned by the continued financial crisis in theUnited Nations. This crisis can be resolved only ifMember States comply strictly with their commitmentsand pay in full  on time and without conditions theircontributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets aswell as all accumulated arrears.3As a member of the International Olympic Committee I am pleased once again to remind the Assembly that theWinter Olympic Games will be held next February inNagano  Japan. The General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession invited Member States  through resolution 50/13  torespect a truce before  during and after both the Summerand Winter Olympic Games. Building a peaceful and betterworld through sport and the Olympic ideal must remain ourmotto at that great international meeting of the youth of theworld.Finally  I should like to convey my deep sorrow shared by my father and by the people of Monaco  at theloss of lives resulting from the forest fires — an ecologicalcataclysm — that are raging in Sumatra  Indonesia  andfrom the air disaster that occurred in Maden this morning as well as at the tragic results of last night's earthquake inthe Italian peninsula. I should like to extend  on my ownbehalf and on behalf of my father and the people ofMonaco  our deepest condolences and sympathy."
"104",4403,"MDA",52,1997,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate thePresident wholeheartedly on his election to the presidencyof the fifty-second session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. I am especially pleased at the election ofa distinguished representative of Ukraine  a country whichis a neighbour and friend of the Republic of Moldova  tothis important post. After declaring their independence sixyears ago  the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine worked tocreate prosperous and democratic societies. I am convincedthat the President  with his great skills and with the supportof all the Member States  will be able to discharge withdistinction this lofty mission which has been entrusted tohim during this crucial period for the United Nations.I would also like to express my appreciation for thecontribution made by Mr. Razali Ismail in his capacity asPresident during the previous session. I wish also to expressour gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis efforts to reform this global Organization.It is my honour and privilege to address the GeneralAssembly for the first time  and I would like to convey amessage of friendship and solidarity from the people of theRepublic of Moldova.My country  which is very much devoted to the idealsof the Charter of the United Nations  strongly supports thereform process of the United Nations. That is why we havetaken note with interest of the reform programme proposedby the Secretary-General. This package of proposals isdesigned to achieve a reform in order to deal better withthe challenges of the coming millennium. We havewelcomed such initiatives and we support them.It is clear that the reform of the United Nations canmove forward only if the financial crisis of theOrganization is settled. There is no doubt that MemberStates must fulfil their financial obligations on time and infull. At the same time  it is indeed necessary to reform thesystem for the payment of contributions in order to achievea fair assessment  one that better takes into account theprinciple of capacity to pay of each country. For our part we will spare no effort to honour our financial obligations.The Republic of Moldova fully supports the efforts ofthe United Nations to maintain international peace andsecurity. In the five years since our country was admittedto membership in the United Nations  we have co-sponsored several resolutions in this important field ofactivity.In the field of disarmament  last year the delegationof the Republic of Moldova likewise voted in favour ofthe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. Consequently  I am pleased to report that on 24September I signed this important Treaty on the completeban on nuclear testing. We are convinced that theimplementation of this Treaty can enhance internationalsecurity.The Republic of Moldova also supports the effortsof the international community to limit the use of andultimately to eliminate certain conventional weaponswhich have injurious and indiscriminate effects  includinganti-personnel landmines. We are ready to contribute tothe efforts being made to obtain these objectives.The positive developments which have characterizedthe activity of the Organization in recent years havebrought about certain concepts and the diversification ofmechanisms for action in the field of international peaceand security. Some of these mechanisms could beimplemented soon. Perhaps I need not stress here theusefulness and benefits of the United Nations standbyforces  which all Member States welcome. Yet  I wish toemphasize that the Republic of Moldova would like tocontribute to this system and that last year ourGovernment expressed its readiness to take part in theUnited Nations standby forces. That is why my countryintends to provide to the United Nations Secretariat assoon as possible information concerning contingents andequipment which are available for this purpose.Moreover  the Republic of Moldova is consideringthe possibility of taking part in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. We believe that our country hasalready accumulated a certain amount of experience inthis field through its participation in a variety ofinternational manoeuvres.Militant separatism has become one of the mainthreats to international peace and security after the coldwar period. Totalitarian regimes have engendered ethnicconflicts and frictions in certain countries of Central andEastern Europe. Some conflicts are rooted in age-oldanimosities. Others  as is the case in the conflict involvingthe Republic of Moldova which broke out five years ago are inspired by and supported from the outside  in orderto recreate a form of by-gone domination.This is the reason why I would like to emphasize thefact that the recent separatist trends which have appearedin the newly independent States who are Members of the29United Nations have nothing in common with the legitimateaspiration of peoples to achieve self-determination. In ourview  attempts to construe the right to self-determination asthe right of an ethnic or national community to establish itsown government and to splinter off are real dangers tointernational and regional security. Moreover  the right toself-determination is treated in the Charter of the UnitedNations as a principle which cannot serve to justify theviolation of the principle of the independence and territorialintegrity of a State. Nevertheless  it is imperative to definethis principle of self-determination more precisely in orderto avoid any subjective interpretations.It is quite clear that the stability of small and largeStates hinges on a number of factors  such as the rule oflaw  respect for human rights  democracy and economicdevelopment. Our Government is therefore striving toestablish an equitable social system based on the respect forthe dignity of the human person. And yet  the process ofeconomic reform  with all its inherent problems  is retardingthe achievement of these objectives.The high social costs of transition are felt throughoutsociety. Despite all of these difficulties  we are neverthelessdetermined to continue the process of economic reform. Werely on the support of developed countries  the UnitedNations and other international agencies and organizationsduring this decisive moment in the reform of our country.I take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the peopleand Government of my country to those States andinternational institutions which have supported thestrengthening of democracy and market-economymechanisms in our Republic. Furthermore  I note withsatisfaction that my country has made progress in buildingits civil society and in establishing democratic institutions.Nevertheless  it is a paradox that under suchfavourable conditions we have not succeeded in achievinga final settlement of the conflict which broke out in thesummer of 1992. Yet  the authorities of the Republic ofMoldova endeavour to find pragmatic solutions in order tomaintain the integrity of the country.Following negotiations with the leaders of theseparatist region  and with the mediation of the RussianFederation  Ukraine and the mission of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  an agreement wasreached between the parties involved with regard to thegeneral principles of the settlement of the dispute. Amemorandum was likewise signed on the normalization ofrelations between the authorities of the Republic ofMoldova and the Transdnestrian region.At the same time  the Presidents of Ukraine and theRussian Federation and the Chairman-in-Office of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) signed a joint Declaration emphasizing theimportance of the parties' commitment in thememorandum to conduct their relations in the context ofthe existing borders of the country by granting specialstatus to the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova.In view of the provisions of the memorandum  an adhoc commission was established to negotiate the legalstatus of the Transdniester region. To our regret negotiations in the Commission are deadlocked becauseof the intransigent and highly politicized position taken bythe Transdniester side. Therefore  no mutually acceptablesolution has been found on the key elements for resolvingthe dispute  namely  the legal definition of the status ofTransdniester and the powers of the parties during thetransitional period. In opposing the provisions of theaccord  the Transdniester side insists on a settlementwhich runs counter to the Constitution of the Republic ofMoldova and is prejudicial to the principle of sovereigntyover the territory of the country. Despite the commitmentsthey assumed by signing the memorandum  the separatistleaders have  exceeding their power  enacted certainunconstitutional laws establishing a so-called customsborder in Transdniester and a “commission for thedelimitation of the State border in the region”. Inaddition  a series of unlawful acts have been committedin the area controlled by the peacekeeping forces.I must therefore emphasize that it is vital to ensuremore active mediation by the Russian Federation  Ukraineand the OSCE mission  as well as stronger action by theinternational community  led by the United Nations. Ishould like to say the conflict in Transdniester coulddestabilize the political and military situation  andthreatens subregional and regional peace and security. Weknow that the separatist regime in Transdniester issupported by a powerful paramilitary force having themost modern weapons  obtained from the equipmentavailable to forces of the Russian Federation illegallystationed on our territory. At the same time  the leadersof those opposed to constitutional authority are trying toobtain weapons belonging to the Russian military forces while opposing the complete withdrawal of the troops ofthe Russian Federation and their weapons. It musttherefore be pointed out that disarming and breaking upthe Transdniester paramilitary groups is as important asthe withdrawal of Russian troops.Both those processes must be monitored byinternational observers. We have reached the conclusionthat an immediate and effective solution to this conflict30requires more active involvement by international bodies aswell as the countries of the region and even the majorPowers. We are awaiting such involvement  for our recentexperience demonstrates that all attempts made by theauthorities of the Republic of Moldova to settle the conflictin the Transdniester region through dialogue andnegotiations have failed. The interests of the separatistleaders are subordinate to other interests  entirely political going beyond our national context.There is a danger that the conflict will continueindefinitely. We believe that the problem of the easternregion of the Republic of Moldova could already have beenresolved by peaceful means and in a civilized fashion if theseparatist regime did not receive strong support fromoutside. More often than not such support has been givendeliberately  for reasons of geopolitical interests  butsometimes the separatists in the eastern region of theRepublic of Moldova have received unintentional  indirectsupport through the unlawful trade activities of companiesand firms in developed countries. We hope that theGovernments of countries where certain undertakings aregiving political and technical support to the separatistregime in Transdniester will put an end to such activity.These actions can no longer be tolerated for they constituteipso facto direct interference in the internal affairs of theRepublic of Moldova.The illegal stationing of military contingents of theRussian Federation on the territory of my countrycontinues. The deadline set by the 1994 Moldovan-RussianAgreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from theterritory is 21 October 1997. The fact that for three yearsthe State Duma  unlike our Parliament  has failed to ratifythe Agreement cannot be excused or explained. We havebeen assured on several occasions  at the highest level  thatthe question of the withdrawal of troops will be settled  andit is regrettable that this problem remains unresolved.We understand  of course  that the failure to ratify the1994 Accord by the State Duma entails legal complicationsfor the Russian Government. However  we believe that thetime has come to find a solution to the question of troopwithdrawal. In accordance with the principles ofinternational law  no foreign army can be stationed on theterritory of another State without its free consent. Inaddition  international organizations  particularly the OSCE strongly support the unconditional  immediate  orderly andcomplete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory ofthe Republic of Moldova. Finally  Russia's admission to theCouncil of Europe as a fully fledged member  wasconditional on the timely withdrawal of its troops from theterritory of the Republic of Moldova.We believe that the political forces in the StateDuma opposing troop withdrawal will also be sensitive tothe legal commitments of the Russian Federation. Wehope that the removal of armaments and the withdrawalof troops from the territory of the Republic of Moldovawill be speeded up and completed as soon as possible.This course would certainly serve the interests of bothcountries and would properly reflect the high levelreached in the development of relations between theRepublic of Moldova and the Russian Federation.In conclusion  I express the fervent hope that thework of the fifty-second session of the General Assemblywill take place in a climate of solidarity  with a realisticand constructive approach to the complex problems facingthe world at the end of this century. My delegation  likethose of other Member States  is ready to make itscontribution to achieve the purposes of the UnitedNations."
"105",4447,"MDG",52,1997,"﻿The success of asession of our General Assembly lies heavily with itsPresident  the chief catalyser and conductor of our workduring the session; with the state of affairs left by hispredecessor; and  of course  with the capacity of the wholeUnited Nations Organization to implement in a credible coherent and sustainable way the various decisions resolutions and recommendations made by the GeneralAssembly.It is therefore a pleasure for me to express to you  Sir on behalf of the Republic of Madagascar  our warmestcongratulations on your election to the presidency of thepresent fifty-second session of our General Assembly.Please be assured of our support and of our conviction thatyour proven experience in international affairs is definitelya major asset towards the success of your mission.We would also like to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Resale Ismaili  whosecommitment during his tenure we admired and whosework and achievements make up a solid foundation onwhich this and upcoming sessions will build and furtherconstruct.Last but not least  I should like to reaffirm ourstrong praise and encouragement for our Secretary-General and his staff for their highly laudable work onproposed reforms of the United Nations aimed at makingour Organization an even more credible and efficientbody  capable of meeting the challenge of the nextcentury. It would thus be a matter of legitimate pride torealize at the end of this process that major and positiveUnited Nations reforms would have been achieved underthe tenure of a native African Secretary-General.(spoke in French)There is no doubt that the question of UnitedNations reform  which has been of concern to us moreparticularly since the middle of July last and which hasfigured prominently in most of the statements madeduring the general debate  is not only making the fifty-second session of the General Assembly seem like a hiveof feverish activity leading up to major events but also islending it a special character that will remain in theannals of the Organization because of the importance ofthe stakes for all of humankind.It is a starting point for this necessary process to findanswers to our aspirations for the future of ourOrganization  following the solemn commitment made heretwo years ago by our Heads of State and Government  inthe framework of the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  to work jointly topromote peace  development  equality  justice andunderstanding among peoples.This reform process should reflect the changes andprofound upheavals that have taken place in the world andthat have made it necessary for our Organization to adaptitself and its structures to the new realities of the world inwhich we live — a world characterized by an upsurge inglobalization and by greater interdependence amongnations. The free movement of goods  people  capital andinformation has increased. Technological progress ismaking it possible to transmit and disseminate ideas cultures and lifestyles.Some developing countries have undergone rapideconomic growth and have become integrated into thedynamic current of the world economy. Others — andunfortunately there are far too many of them — haveexperienced slow or even negative growth and have beenmarginalized in the globalization process. Poverty andfamine still affect a considerable number of people. Thefigures speak for themselves: at a time when some peopleare privileged enough to surf the Internat to do theirshopping  800 million others go hungry every day — thataccording to a report of the Food and AgricultureOrganization at the World Food Summit last November.And that is to say nothing of illness  illiteracy or violence.The basic principles that have given impetus to thisprocess of renewal include good governance  soundmanagement  transparency and the democratization ofinternational relations. In this respect  Madagascar cannotbut welcome this innovative approach because it is basedon the same values and the same ideals underlying myGovernment’s quest for social and economic progress whose goal is to provide a higher standard of living for theMalagasy people in conditions of greater freedom.Indeed  we in Madagascar hope to ensure that theobservance of human rights  social justice  participation byall in national development efforts  the implementation ofeconomic reforms and the practice of democracy do notremain mere political slogans but are put into practice. Asthe representative of a Government born of a democraticchange of power seven months ago  I know what I amtalking about.At this stage of the considerations presented by ourSecretary-General  certain points are noteworthy. Amongthose I would refer specifically to restructuring  financialreform and the Security Council.With respect to restructuring  it is clear that effortsmust be made to merge agencies of the United Nationssystem in order to ensure improved efficiency and bettercoordination. An example would be to merge into a singleunit in Geneva the Office of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights and the Centre for Human Rights in orderto strengthen complementarity in related activities of ourOrganization.My country believes that we must increasetransparency and create a culture of shared savings  whicha reform of the Centre’s administration would bringabout — this with the aim of avoiding by every possiblemeans the non-observance of democracy  which is thefundamental reason for serious human rights violationsthroughout the world. Likewise  humanitarian relief which the United Nations continues to provide tocountries that are facing natural disasters  would becomemore effective with the creation of an office for thecoordination of emergency situation efforts complemented by an appropriate intervention mechanism.I take this opportunity to convey my country’sgratitude to those who did not hesitate to assistMadagascar in our efforts to deal with the locust invasionin the southern part of the island. I would mention inparticular the Food and Agriculture Organization of theUnited Nations  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the World Food Programme  the UnitedStates Agency for International Development and theWorld Bank  as well as friendly countries — Japan Germany  France  Norway and the United Kingdom among others.My delegation  which welcomes the strengthening ofcertain United Nations activities and the inclusion of newpriorities  agrees with the conclusions of the fifty-thirdsession of the Commission on Human Rights  accordingto which human rights are inseparable from the promotionof peace  security  economic prosperity and social equity.It reaffirms  therefore  that the work of the UnitedNations in the area of human rights must be considered asan element of the Organization’s activities in the field ofpreventive diplomacy  and that United Nations operationsto monitor the observance of human rights must promoterespect for these rights in order to be able to restore2social stability and assist in the reconstruction and recoveryof societies following periods of conflict.In this regard  the restructuring of the Secretariatshould take into account all approaches to human rights  inaccordance with the outcome of the Vienna Conference which  as we know  proclaimed the interdependence andindivisibility of human rights as well as the promotion ofthe right to development.My delegation  however  would appeal for greatervigilance on the question of human rights  bearing in mindthat on 10 December we shall begin to celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in view of the possible consequences of internationaloversight of human rights for the sovereignty of States particularly when this involves monitoring measures andeven conditionality  under the guise of humanitarianconcerns.Reform must not be reduced to a simple cost-cuttingexercise; rather  it must strengthen the role of theOrganization and above all enhance its efficiency. HenceMadagascar recognizes the need to strengthen the role ofthe General Assembly  which we feel must remain theprimary forum for States to discuss essential issues ofpeace  security and development. At a time when thevirtues of democratization are preached  the GeneralAssembly is the only body capable of guaranteeing that asmany people as possible can make their voices heard at theworld level and play an effective part in the management ofinternational affairs.The Charter could therefore be amended to givegreater power to the General Assembly  so that it mightplay a bigger role alongside the Security Council particularly in the maintenance of peace. We thereforesupport the Secretary-General’s initiative to set up aministerial commission to consider the possible changes.On financial reform  many eminent speakers — Iwould refer in particular to the Prime Minister ofPakistan — have stated in this debate that one of the mainweaknesses of the United Nations stems from the fact thatwhile some Members are supposed to pay their assessmentsin full and without conditions  others delay payment making it contingent on one reason or another  whetherstated or not.Madagascar appeals for what I would call a code ofgood conduct or financial civic-mindedness  in order toremedy this situation. We support the principle that thefinancing of the United Nations must be an integral partof the reform process. Moreover  the scale of assessments the key to the apportionment of expenses  must reflect thecapacity of each State to pay  as it is applied in most  ifnot all world organizations  on the basis of equity  pureand simple. It is clear to us that the scale cannot be set instone and that there should be provision for amendmentwhen necessary — that is  when there is a change in acountry’s capacity to pay.Finally  we welcome the desire of the Secretary-General to allocate more predictable resources to financedevelopment  to ensure an overall increase in officialdevelopment assistance and to create an Office forDevelopment Financing to allocate to developingcountries what have been described as the dividends ofreform.In regard to the Security Council  it would be puttingit mildly to say that its present membership no longerreflects reality. To speak of our continent alone  Africahas the greatest number of Member States of the UnitedNations  and yet the continent has no permanent seat onthe Security Council. Nor was the continent evenconsulted or considered at the time of the first review ofthe Council in 1965.Madagascar endorses the position of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and would opt foran expansion of Security Council membership based ondemocratization  transparency and equitable geographicalrepresentation. An increase in number and animprovement in the Council’s functioning and workingmethods  as well as its relations with States that are notmembers of the Council  are essential in order to reflectthe present reality  and above all to allow the UnitedNations to lend an attentive ear to the problems of thepoor and less favoured countries. In addition  relationsbetween the Security Council and the Economic andSocial Council must be strengthened  so that decisions oninternational peace and security can take into accountsocial factors.In this regard  my delegation welcomes the decisionof the sub-working group of the African Group  chairedby Egypt  which is considering the modalities forimplementing a rotation system for two permanent seatswhich could be allocated to Africa  called for in theHarare Declaration of the summit of Heads of State andGovernment of the OAU.3We feel that the veto must not be consideredseparately from the question of expanding the membershipof the Council. Moreover  given the principles ofdemocracy supported by the international community as awhole  it would be logical to extend the right of veto to allpermanent members  or simply to abolish it.In addition  we emphatically reaffirm that any questionrelating to reform of the Security Council must be subjectto a two-thirds majority vote of Member States  inaccordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Charter.Any initiative to submit a simple resolution running counterto that would be prejudicial to the Organization and to itsMembers.The 15 priority areas on which the Secretary-Generalhas taken action and made recommendations respond to thedemands of today’s world. My delegation is certain that thesubstantive comments and proposals of the GeneralAssembly will help implement the initiatives taken  so thatour Organization can keep pace with the demands of ourtime and  above all  live up to the expectations of ourpeople. In any event  Madagascar  within the framework ofthe regional forums to which it belongs  is considering theproposals of the Secretary-General in a spirit ofconstructive dialogue and without preconceptions.However  I cannot speak of international peace andsecurity without expressing my concern at the slow pace ofnegotiations leading to general agreement on every aspectof Security Council reform. We are concerned because despite the establishment of a Department for Disarmamentand Arms Regulation  announced in the package of reforms the Council will still remain  under the Charter  the bodyentrusted with maintaining international peace and security.However  the Malagasy Government welcomes the fact thatcooperation between the United Nations and the OAU withregard to peace was mentioned in the Secretary-General’sreport to the fifty-second session  as well as in statementsmade last Thursday at the ministerial meeting of theSecurity Council on the situation in Africa. We are pleasedto note the determination of the Secretary-General toincrease this cooperation and extend it to all activitiesrelated to the maintenance of peace  including conflictprevention. In this area  we welcome the Secretary-General’s plan to appoint a representative based in AddisAbaba. It is important here to emphasize the importance notonly of combining  but also coordinating  the efforts of theOAU — which has a central Mechanism for ConflictPrevention Management and Resolution — with those ofthe Security Council  so that we do not work at cross-purposes. Here I would like to recall that the OAUwelcomed the principle of strengthening Africanpeacekeeping capacity  which France  the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America have jointlyproposed to assist.My delegation welcomes the negotiations to date onnuclear disarmament measures and on limiting andgradually reducing conventional weapons and in particularanti-personnel mines. On this last point  Madagascar hasvoted in favour of General Assembly resolutions on amoratorium on the export of mines. We welcome theagreement drafted in Oslo on the text of a convention forthe complete elimination of anti-personnel mines  as wellas Norway’s commitment to provide $100 million fordemining activities and assistance to victims.In this respect  my country appeals to States withmilitary arsenals to continue resolutely to take measuresaimed at general and complete disarmament. Theparticipation of all States in this process of disarmament in cooperation with the Department for Disarmament andArms Regulation  whose establishment is part of thereform programme  will provide an invaluablecontribution to the easing of global tensions.This international determination will also be a sourceof mutual assistance and cooperation in combatingorganized transnational crime. Transnational criminalorganizations have  in fact  existed for a long time  butthe globalization of international relations with regard tothe economy  commerce  telecommunications and therapid progress of technology  as well as the disappearanceof ideological blocs  have permitted the activities oftransnational criminal organizations to expand and haveincreased their power to such an extent that they are nowa permanent threat to the foundation and internal securityof States  to their cultural and artistic heritage and to theenvironment of the planet. Today we are witnessing theemergence of new forms of transnational crime: money-laundering or the investment of capital generated byactivities that are usually interconnected  including drug-trafficking  corruption  traffic in weapons  terrorism traffic in nuclear and toxic material  traffic in protectednatural resources  traffic in human beings  removal oforgans  and more.From this standpoint  the countries that are weakestin terms of economic  institutional  material andtechnological capacity are the most vulnerable —developing countries in general and African countries inparticular — because the automatic effect of the activitiesof developed countries to prevent and combat organized4crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zonesof expansion.We must therefore urgently find an effective responseto this threat by defining a common objective based on aunited stand and coherent action  by establishing orstrengthening cooperation for exchanging experience andknowledge  by increasing our exchange of information and above all  by actively promoting and supporting cooperationwith international or regional forums so as to provideinstitutional technical assistance and logistical support. Thatnotwithstanding  we note the special importance attributedby the Secretary-General to the need to improve thecapacity of the system to combat drug-trafficking andterrorism.Peace is  with development  one of the main missionsof the United Nations. My country reaffirms its unwaveringcommitment to the principle of settling disputes peacefully.It is deeply concerned by the threats to destabilize peace inthe world  especially in Africa.With regard to the Republic of Congo  therefore Madagascar appeals to the parties to develop a dialogueaimed at a definitive ceasefire  in accordance with the spiritof the Libreville Summit  held on 14 and 15 September1997  and at allowing the deployment  under the auspicesof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  of the international intervention forcerecommended at the Summit.As for the internal crisis in the Comoros  which is animmediate neighbour of Madagascar  we support of theefforts of the Secretary-General of the OAU as well asthose of the League of Arab States and the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference. Furthermore  we reaffirm oursupport of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoroswith regard to sovereignty and territorial integrity. In thisrespect we support the convening of an internationalconference to restore peace in that sister Republic  and wehave expressed the readiness of Madagascar to becomeinvolved in any initiatives along these lines.Also in Africa  Madagascar welcomes theestablishment of direct talks between Morocco and thePOLISARIO Front  which recently culminated in theHouston Agreement  as a result of the mediation of JamesBaker. We believe this to be a major landmark on the pathto the settlement of the question of Western Sahara  whichhas gone on for too long.In the Middle East  Madagascar also strongly appealsto the parties concerned to safeguard the progressachieved in the peace process. We believe that anessential element for this is for Israel to halt theestablishment of new settlements.Finally  we reaffirm our support for the concept ofthe reunification of Korea and welcome the progress thatis starting to appear in this regard.During the course of the United Nations conferenceson human rights  the environment  population  socialdevelopment  women  etc.  we succeeded in achievingimportant global commitments  and we must ensure thefollow-up. We have achieved an international consensuson the need to ensure that ecological realities andpriorities for environmental policies are taken into accountin structural changes that are in progress in theinternational economic order. To be more specific  wemust integrate environmental factors — a precondition forsustainable development — into economic priorities. Inthis regard Madagascar encourages the efforts alreadyundertaken by international development financeorganizations and by Governments. We are convinced thatthe overall implementation of the provisions in the basicAgenda 21 document for rapid and specific action willcome to fruition in the recommendations of the Secretary-General as contained in his programme for reform.In conclusion  I take this opportunity to recall mycomments at the nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly  on an overall review and appraisal of theimplementation of Agenda 21. While reaffirming our fulladherence to the principles of mutual interest and theshared but differentiated responsibilities of developed anddeveloping countries contained in the Rio Declaration and to its general implementation  we requested  first  thatdeveloped countries honour the commitments undertakenin Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross nationalproduct to development assistance. Secondly  werequested that the Global Environment Facility berestructured and adequately replenished so as to facilitateaccess to resources; and thirdly and above all  that following the concept of the “democracy dividend” andthe “economic adjustment and reform dividend”  an“environment dividend” should be advocated for the leastdeveloped countries to enable them to protect theirenvironment and thereby speed up the eradication ofpoverty  the main cause and consequence ofenvironmental degradation.5We now ask whether the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) in its present form has the necessarypower to impose sanctions or to grant dividends  or whetherwe need to strengthen its mandate or create a new structurewith adequate power.For its part  Madagascar — we cannot repeat thisoften enough — is proud to comply with the measuresrecommended in Agenda 21. Indeed  it stands out in itscapacity as a country that is both a nature sanctuary and anatural sanctuary  possessing treasures and specificcharacteristics that are rare  if not unique in the world  interms of flora and fauna.We hope that in Kyoto in December firmcommitments will be made to reduce greenhouse gasemissions  which cause global warming and therebycontribute to the further deterioration of our environment.It rests only with us to make this session a session ofreform  as the Secretary-General wishes  or to make it asession like so many others — one in which speakers assailus with rhetoric or at best with verbal promises that are notfollowed up with actions. Madagascar is convinced that wewill make the right choice at the right time to consolidateour ideals."
"106",4486,"MDV",52,1997,"﻿First of all  Sir  let mecongratulate you on your election to the presidency of thefifty-second session of the General Assembly. Your electionis a reflection of the confidence and the hope that this bodyhas in your abilities to guide this session to a successfulconclusion.I would also like to take this opportunity to expressmy delegation’s profound gratitude and appreciation to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  for the exemplarymanner in which he carried out his responsibilities andsteered the work of the General Assembly during his termas President.It is also my privilege to take this opportunity toextend  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf a very warm welcome to the new Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. We have no doubt that his longexperience as an international civil servant and his vastknowledge of the United Nations system will give him allthe insights he requires for carrying out his responsibilitiesfairly and firmly. He deserves every assistance and supportfrom all Member States of the Organization.With great enthusiasm for capitalizing on theopportunities created by the end of the cold war  weembarked on a journey to revitalize the United Nations andto reform the way it functions  making it more effective andcapable of playing the central role it is entitled to inmaintaining the world order  and perhaps shaping a newworld order for the future.However  as the discussions continue  the viewsremain far from consensus  even on the single issue ofrestructuring the Security Council  which I agree isimportant and pivotal. But at this point we should remindourselves that in our approach to reform we should becovering the whole spectrum of political  social  economicand legal activities of the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies.It is rather disappointing that the focus is at presentmainly on the restructuring of the Security Council.Furthermore  the proposals made so far on this issue aresadly inadequate  and many suggest the creation of a newform of idiosyncrasy.In the absence of a formula which is comprehensiveand just  we may as well suggest the following.First  increase the number of non-permanentmembers in the Council to an appropriate level  reflectingthe growth of the membership and its present diversity.Secondly  amend paragraph 2 of Article 23 of theCharter to enable the non-permanent member States to bere-elected for any number of consecutive terms  so thatthose who seek to occupy a seat in this important body ona continuing basis can do so as long as they enjoy theconfidence and support of the Member States.Thirdly  encourage the permanent members of theSecurity Council to agree among themselves on an accordwhich will remove or at least minimize the commonapprehension arising from the fear of their misusing theveto power.My delegation applauds the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring much needed reforms to theadministrative and financial functioning of theOrganization. The proposals that he submitted to theAssembly on 16 July 1997 deserve our carefulconsideration  as they contain far-reaching andconstructive arrangements which will at least help theUnited Nations emerge from its present difficulties.The enthusiasm which followed the end of the coldwar also provided us the opportunity to meet in severalinternational conferences to deal with some of the issuesof true concern to all of us. These issues include theenvironment  social development  population  women human settlements and food security. At those meetingswe adopted ambitious action plans  reaching theconclusion that sustainable development should be thecore of the achievement of our objectives. Yet without thegenuine and sincere will of the international communityto honour their commitments  the action plans  which bearenormous price tags  cannot be implemented effectively.11This stark truth dominated the special session of theGeneral Assembly in June this year  when we noted thelack of progress in the international action called for in thehistoric Agenda 21 of the 1992 Earth Summit.The emission of greenhouse gases is continuingunabated  polluting the environment and warming the globalatmosphere more and more. If the latest predictions of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ongreenhouse-gas emissions and global warming were tocome true  then by the year 2100 almost 80 per cent of thelow-lying island countries  including my own  would besubmerged in the sea.For the Maldives and other small island developingStates  which are most affected by the degradation of theworld’s environment  the lack of progress in internationalaction is most lamentable. We are not only fearful of animpending danger  we are also anxious that unless theworld acts now and swiftly  it may be too late for us toavoid environmental catastrophe.If we care to halt and reverse this lurking threat  weneed the unwavering commitment and cooperation of theentire international community. And there is nothing we cando on our own.Ever since my President  Mr. Maumoon AbdulGayoom  apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impendingenvironmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to ourcountry  the Maldives has been warning vigorously  atnational  regional and international levels  of this problem.Today I am happy to state that at the national level weare continuing successfully to create environmentalawareness by involving non-governmental organizations andthe private sector. We have also successfully implementeda few projects to protect and preserve the environment. Forinstance  under the two-million-tree national programme thepeople of the Maldives have planted eight trees per personin the last two years. I wonder what a spectacular impactwe could have on our planet if we could plant eight treesper person in the entire world over the next two years.At the regional level  the Delhi Declaration of theEnvironment Ministers of the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC) stands as testimony to ourregional efforts. The Declaration  which reflected thecommon position of our region on global environmentalissues  was presented to this Assembly by PresidentGayoom at its nineteenth special session. Another importantmeeting of SAARC environment ministers is scheduled tobe held this month in the Maldives.At the international level  we are working closelywith the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) topursue our cause. We attach the utmost importance to theswift and steady implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States  and once again we callupon the developed countries to fulfil their commitmentsand pledges of support.In this connection  we call upon the industrializedcountries to follow the examples set by the UnitedKingdom and the European Union during the nineteenthspecial session of the General Assembly and to committhemselves to legally binding and meaningful targets toreduce their greenhouse-gas emission levels.For the Maldives  a country that will be affectedseverely  if not fatally  by climate change  it is hard toaccept a target below the 20 per cent reduction level bythe year 2005  as contained in the AOSIS protocol  as ameaningful reduction.Last month the Maldives hosted the thirteenthsession of the Intergovernmental Panel on ClimaticChange  which was regarded not only as a very importantmeeting on the subject  but also a very timely one  as theworld is looking forward eagerly and with great optimismto the forthcoming third session of the Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change in Kyoto.My country and many other small States in thedeveloping world  especially those among the leastdeveloped countries  have placed our trust in the UnitedNations to help us face and overcome the inherentconstraints we have as we continue our quest towardsprogress and prosperity. We also look to the UnitedNations to develop policies and take effective measures toprotect us from threats  whether economic or political and alleviate our sufferings from environmentalcalamities. The fact is that we cannot on our own face theodds and that our economies are more vulnerable thanthose of larger and more prosperous States. Protection ofthe weaker should not be seen as a burden  but rather asa shared responsibility of all  recognizing the realities ofour diversified membership in this Organization.While liberalization of the world economy may haveboosted the prospects for some of the developing12countries to successfully integrate themselves into the newinternational trading arrangements  those with little accessto the world market  capital and new technologies findthemselves becoming marginalized  away from themainstream of the world economy.The gap between the rich and the poor is continuingto grow unabated. Several developing countries  andparticularly the least developed of them  still continue tosuffer from endemic poverty  which is compounded by thesevere debt burden and leads to political and economicdislocation.The overall decline in official development assistanceover the years has aggravated the conditions of the leastdeveloped countries. Unless the developed countries fulfiltheir commitment to reach the United Nations acceptedtarget of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national productto official development assistance and intensify their effortsto reverse the present downward trend  hopes for the leastdeveloped countries will remain as grim as ever.The Committee for Development Planning  at itsthirty-first session  held in May this year  proposed in itsreport that the Maldives be graduated from the leastdeveloped countries list at the time of the next review inthe year 2000  if we continue to prosper at the present rate.We are overwhelmed to see our development effortsbeing rewarded with a decision of expulsion. Over theyears  my country has successfully cleared numeroushurdles in the path of socio-economic development  despiteits limited resources. We were able to improve the percapita income  raise the standard of living of the people andprovide basic services to the community and individuals athigher levels than many others in the least developedcountry category.This success was in large measure due to the stablepolitical climate that we enjoyed  which in turn provided usthe opportunity to implement carefully planned  action-oriented policies and strategies. At the same time  we couldnot have achieved these happy results without the supportwe received from friendly countries and multilateralorganizations.However  if one were to consider these fewachievements against the background of an extremelyfragile economy deprived of natural resources  and a highdependency on tourism and fisheries — both of which aresusceptible to global economic change and environmentaland other external factors — the whole scenario couldeasily change from a happy and promising one to anobscure and insecure one. The vulnerability of oureconomy compels us to continue to depend on externalresources  to build infrastructures that we cannot build onour own and to develop our own needed human resourcesfor further development.Furthermore  the smallness of our countries has alsomade us vulnerable to the activities of drug-trafficking money-laundering  terrorism and other forms of organizedcrime carried out by criminals who are looking for newterritories to operate from. We therefore need to remainclose to our development partners in a relationship oftrust  which is far beyond kindness and charity. Therefore my delegation would like to stress the importance ofdeveloping and applying a vulnerability index for thesmall island developing States as a basic and meaningfulcriterion for determining the status of least developedcountries  recalling the content and the spirit of resolution51/183.I cannot overemphasize the important role that theregional organizations are playing in internationalrelations: fostering mutual trust and understanding andopening up greater prospects for the promotion of peace stability and socio-economic cooperation within theregion.The activities of the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC)  to which my countryproudly belongs  are no exception. In fact  I am happy tostate that the ninth SAARC summit  held in the Maldivesin May this year  has adopted far-reaching and boldinitiatives that will bring the countries of South Asiacloser to each other and enhance further cooperationbetween them in the economic and technical fields.Among other important decisions  we have pledged toeradicate poverty from our region as early as possible preferably by the year 2002. We have joined hands toaccelerate our efforts to achieve trade liberalization andestablish a free-trade area by the year 2001. We havealso  for the first time  decided to begin informal politicalconsultations in order to enhance and foster good-neighbourly relations  relieve tension and build trust andconfidence between and among Member States.The alarming level of tension that exists on theinternational political scene is of utmost concern to us. Inthe recent past  we have witnessed in various regions of13the world the reigniting of old conflicts the emergence ofnew and serious ones that possess the intensity to stretchthe United Nations to its limits.The dangerous developments unfolding in the regionof the Middle East have brought into question once againthe credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations. Thepresent Israeli Government’s arrogance towards and utterdisregard for United Nations resolutions and the agreementsthat they themselves reached with the Palestinians under theOslo accords have shattered the little hope that the peopleof Israel  Palestine and the international community at largehad for a lasting solution to this age-old conflict. Recentevents have drastically diminished the confidence that is soessential for the success of the process  leaving us towonder if peace will ever come to this region.The General Assembly met twice in emergencysession this year to consider the issue. At those sessions the international community almost unanimously ralliedbehind the Middle East peace process and demonstrated itsgenuine and unwavering support. While my delegation fullyshares the view that continued negotiations in good faithbetween the two parties is essential for a permanentsolution to the conflict  we strongly believe that the UnitedNations also has an important and crucial role to play in thepeace process. The decisions of the General Assembly andthe Security Council must be respected and fullyimplemented without any preconditions. We call on bothparties to respect the agreements reached so far and toexercise maximum restraint in resorting to activities thatmay undermine the peace process.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina may havefaded a little from the headlines of the international press but we must realize that our job will not be complete unlessand until the perpetrators of genocide and other brutalcrimes in that country are brought to justice.In the field of disarmament and arms control  theinternational community has achieved considerable success.The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  the adoption ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) andthe entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Conventionare testimony to this. The Maldives attaches utmostimportance to the efforts of global and regionaldisarmament and arms control  and vehemently supportsthem. It was in this spirit that we signed the CTBT twodays ago.Contrary to our expectations  the era of peace andeconomic prosperity of the post-cold-war era has so farproved elusive. Outbreaks of violence and ethnic strife inseveral parts of the world have precipitated unbelievablelevels of human suffering. Conflicts within States havecrossed national boundaries and ignited conflicts ofinternational proportions. Unless the United Nations isequipped to act swiftly on such symptoms of rupture large numbers of people will remain in the shadow ofconflicts. We should redouble our efforts to deliver on thepromise of peace  human rights  fundamental freedomsand economic prosperity contained in the Charter of thisOrganization.The United Nations should not be solely a politicalforum. It was meant to cover the wide spectrum of allhuman activities with institutions for social as well aseconomic matters. The disparities vividly observed aroundthe world  a half century after the creation of the UnitedNations  prove that none of the institutions has diminishedin importance. They were created to remedy theseimbalances among States and to contribute to justice equality and peace. They were established to build andconsolidate a climate of cooperation  to help each otheron the basis of moral and ethical obligations and notmerely of charity. They were erected to help the poor —not just some of them  while neglecting others; to helpchildren — not just some of them  while neglectingothers; to consolidate human rights — not just someaspects of it  while neglecting others; and to further peaceand prosperity for all mankind — not just for certainsegments of humanity.If we want the United Nations to perform the dutiesthat we have entrusted to it  then we should ensure thatwe honour our financial obligations to it. My delegationis convinced that without a firm and sound financialfooting  even our reform efforts will be totallymeaningless."
"107",4533,"MEX",52,1997,"﻿Let me first of all congratulate the President on his well-deserved election. It is a source of satisfaction to us thatthe President of his country  Ukraine  Mr. LeonidKuchma  is on this very day starting a state visit toMexico.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  weextend our sincere gratitude for the extremely dynamicway in which he is discharging his importantresponsibilities  and particularly for his significantcontribution to the process of reform of the Organization.The work of this session of the General Assemblywill cover the main items on the international agenda.Allow me to begin this statement by referring to thosewhich are of particular significance to my country.In relation to the topic of disarmament  significantsteps have recently been taken. Some prominent oneshave been the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the approval of a Convention prohibiting22anti-personnel mines  and the forthcoming conclusion of aninter-American convention against the illicit traffic in arms munitions and explosives.Also prominent at the regional level are the efforts theRio Group has decided to undertake towards beginningconsultations with a view to establishing criteria for self-regulation in the purchase and transfer of certain types ofsophisticated conventional weapons. Latin America is oneof the regions with the lowest military expenditures in theworld  and there will be no grounds for asserting that anarms race exists among our countries. There is  nonetheless agreement to prevent this from happening  and  accordingly we hope that the meeting to be convened in Cancun nextJanuary by the Rio Group itself  with the participation of allits member States  will attain its objectives. Despite allthese advances  we reiterate our concern at the lack oftangible nuclear disarmament measures  and we stress thatthe issue continues to be the responsibility of theinternational community as a whole  and not the exclusiveprovince of the nuclear Powers. Accordingly  we regret thatthe advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of8 July 1996  which called attention to the illegality of theuse of nuclear weapons and the obligation to negotiatenuclear disarmament measures  has not been taken intoaccount by the main nuclear-weapon States.It is appropriate to recall that when the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was indefinitelyextended  a series of commitments was drawn up with aview to making progress towards nuclear disarmament  butso far not even the most minimal progress has been made.In an effort to break the impasse  Mexico  along with othercountries  submitted to the Conference on Disarmament inGeneva a programme of action  in which we called for theconsideration and analysis of certain concrete disarmamentmeasures with all the seriousness they deserve.To the same end  we support increasing the number ofnuclear-weapon-free zones  along the lines of the Treaty forthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America —the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Mexico will continue to supportthe Brazilian initiative to consolidate the southernhemisphere as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.With reference to the Convention banning the use ofanti-personnel mines  it should be pointed out that therecent approval of that instrument in Oslo was theculmination of negotiations which had been conducted forone year within the framework of what is called the Ottawaprocess  as a result of an initiative by the Core Groupformed by Mexico  Canada and other countries inOctober 1996. The Government of Mexico considers thatthe use of this category of weapons constitutes a flagrantviolation of international humanitarian law  and that theonly viable solution to the problems it poses is the totalabolition of anti-personnel landmines and the destructionof those currently stockpiled. Mexico welcomes the resultachieved  with the justified hope that the countries whichstill remain outside the process will join in it.Let us not continue to regard peace as anunattainable objective or a utopian dream. Peace is notonly the absence of war  but a way of life whichestablishes as the norm cooperation among free and equalnations to overcome the problems that plague humanbeings in all corners of the world. Peace is and must bepossible  because it is essential to us.Mexico views drug trafficking as a serious threat toits national security and to the health of humankind. Wemaintain that this phenomenon promotes violence corruption and other unlawful activities  such as illegalarms-trafficking  money-laundering and the diversion ofchemical precursors.Among the possibilities offered by internationalcooperation in this sphere  Mexico has been extremelyactive in signing bilateral agreements to combat drugtrafficking and in participating in forums dealing with thesubject  such as the Inter-American Commission for DrugAbuse and the Rio Group. To this must be added theimportant process initiated by Mexico for the purpose ofholding  in June next year  a special session of theGeneral Assembly devoted to the consideration of theworld situation with regard to the illicit drug problem  sothat concrete measures against drug-trafficking and itsassociated crimes can be agreed upon. We invite all theMember States of the United Nations to participateactively at the highest level in that special session.Mexico rejects repressive police measures to preventand control migratory flows  convinced as we are that theuse of such methods  far from resolving problems  cloudsrelations between frontier communities and many timesleads to the abuse and mistreatment of migrants by theauthorities responsible for applying migration policy.As part of an effort to seek multilateral solutions tothis problem within the framework of the fifty-thirdsession of the Commission on Human Rights  theMexican delegation submitted a draft resolution onmigrants and human rights  which was adopted by23consensus  both in the Commission and in the Economicand Social Council.On the basis of the Mexican initiative  theCommission on Human Rights decided to establish a groupof experts to formulate recommendations on strengtheningthe promotion  protection and exercise of these rights. Wehave a well-founded hope that it will be possible to securethe establishment of a minimum standard of conduct forcountries in relation to migrants  regardless of their legalstatus.Recently  in the states of Texas and Virginia of theUnited States of America  two Mexican citizens wereexecuted after all the means of recourse that could be usedto obtain the commutation of their death sentences had beenexhausted. In neither of the two cases was the personconcerned able to contact the consulate of his country at thetime he was arrested. This was a flagrant violation of article36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Thisirregularity probably cost them their lives. There are 35more Mexicans who have been sentenced to death in theUnited States  and a number of them did not have access tothe consular protection to which they were entitled. Thestate of Texas went so far as to justify the omission bysaying that it was not a party to the Convention in question.In the case of Virginia the State Department of the UnitedStates offered “profuse apologies” to the Government ofMexico after the Mexican national had been executed.Mexico wishes to denounce  in this highest forum ofmankind  this appalling state of affairs. We shall be seekingan advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court ofHuman Rights on the legality of applying the death penaltywhen an international convention that affects due processhas not been complied with. In our view  this violates thespirit and letter of the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights and the American Declaration on the Rightsand Duties of Man  the juridical importance of which hasbeen recognized by the Court to which I have referred.We are convinced that at this session of the GeneralAssembly — imbued with new leadership and havingplaced on its agenda a number of reports containingspecific proposals for progress in the reform process including the one submitted by the Secretary-Generalhimself on 16 July this year — we are at the threshold ofa new phase in the Organization's development.With the same resolve with which it has invariablywelcomed any effort to raise international affairs to thesphere of law  Mexico  as a founding Member of theOrganization  reiterates its full readiness to contribute tothe efforts we shall have to make to face this challenge.For a number of years  when the issue of reform wasdiscussed we were content to pursue the rationalization ofthe work of the United Nations through changes whichdid not entail amendments to its founding Charter.Nevertheless  the present juncture is so crucial that weneed to analyse where the defects that have prevented usfrom being more efficient as an Organization are to befound  in order to redress them.I would like to reiterate some of the basic positionsMexico maintains on the subject of the reform of theOrganization  while at the same time adding now somecomments regarding the proposals made by the Secretary-General  as well as referring to some decisions which wehave taken recently.We maintain that absolutely scrupulous respect forthe principles of law embodied in the Charter  includingin the decisions the Security Council has to take onmatters affecting the peace and security of the world  isa fundamental rule of conduct of countries in theirinternational relations.Since 1945 Mexico has attacked the very concept ofa division between permanent and non-permanentmembers of the Security Council  basically because theexistence of the two categories establishes adiscriminatory situation — a situation which isexacerbated by the permanent members having been giventhe right of the veto  a privilege that has certainly beenabused and has frequently prevented the Council fromfulfilling its basic task.We also maintain that the need to increase thecapacity of the United Nations to prevent conflicts andresolve those that exist requires not only the reform of theSecurity Council and its working methods  but also thestrengthening of the mechanisms for resolving conflictsthrough peaceful means.With regard to the Secretary-General’s proposals  wewelcome them and view with special interest the idea ofstrengthening the Secretariat by creating a post of DeputySecretary-General and establishing a strategic planningunit. We do not believe  however  that the objective ofcutting costs should guide the reform process. Avoidingduplication and implementing the programme of theOrganization in an optimal way are the objectives thatshould guide our work.24Mexico has repeatedly maintained that the financialsituation the Organization is experiencing stems from afailure to comply with the obligations derived from theCharter. The current financial situation has no link with theassessment system. The way to deal with it is by makingfull  timely and unconditional payments of the assessmentsthe General Assembly assigns to Member States. If wemust review the financial situation  then certainly all of usMember States are ready to do so  as long as the result isan equitable solution.The financial crisis of the Organization should not leadus to take decisions that distort the spirit of reform weshare. Carried to the extreme  this logic would call for thedesignation of Ted Turner as a permanent member of theSecurity Council  with the right of veto. By the way  weappreciate Mr. Turner’s generosity.We view with concern some of the proposals made formerging subsidiary bodies of the Economic and SocialCouncil — for example  the Commissions on NarcoticDrugs and Crime Prevention — which could in our viewdevalue the treatment accorded to these subjects. Themerger of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for HumanRights  on the other hand  would undoubtedly strengthentreatment of the subject. Thus  while we consider that thenew tasks to be performed by the High Commissionershould be in conformity with the provisions of theinternational instruments in force and the guidelines of thecompetent bodies in this field  we strongly support thisproposal. We also welcome Mary Robinson as HighCommissioner.In relation to the reform of the Security Council  theMexican Government wishes to draw particular attention tothe following elements in the declaration adopted by theHeads of State and Government of the Rio Group on 24August 1997 in Asunción  Paraguay  marking the firstoccasion on which that forum has conducted an in-depthexchange of views on this important issue.Reform of the Council is needed in order to correctthe imbalances in its current composition  improve itsdecision-making mechanisms and make the conduct of itswork more transparent. A reform resulting in treatment thatdiscriminates between developed and developing countrieswould not be acceptable. The veto should be restricted  asa first step  to Chapter VII of the Charter. The expansion the reform of working methods and the question of the vetoform an integral part of the reform of the Security Counciland should form parts of the same agreement; in otherwords  we view them as an indivisible whole.Lastly  the Heads of State and Government of theRio Group reiterated their readiness to continueparticipating actively in the Working Group dealing withthe subject  with a view to securing general agreement and decided to give their Ministers for Foreign Affairs“responsibility for maintaining a broad dialogue onthe issue which takes the regional interest intoaccount and seeking understandings on the subject”.Representativeness  political legitimacy  the regionalapproach and consensus solutions are thus the elementsthat should guide the work being undertaken.To the extent that the above criteria are met  Mexicowants to make it clear that it is fully prepared toparticipate in an expanded  renewed and representativeSecurity Council. Nevertheless  the reform of the SecurityCouncil must be a factor promoting cohesion and acatalyst of cooperation among countries. At present  thereare so many and such diverse formulas that we run therisk of the issue causing divisions and tensions.Clearly  the international community has not yetfound the formula for achieving consensus on this delicatematter. The issue calls for additional consultations andbetter definitions of the very meaning of reform. Statescannot conceive of Security Council reform as a sourceof national prestige or a way of consolidating regionalhegemonies. Any reform that is adopted must be inclusiveand strengthen regional equilibriums  which aresometimes very fragile and very vulnerable.Today  the States Members of the United Nationsappear  for the most part  to feel threatened more thanimbued with hope by the proposals that are circulatingwith regard to the Security Council. A wave of lobbyingand national and regional expectations has been unleashedin which the interests of the Organization itself areconspicuous by their absence. This is precisely theopposite of the spirit we want to achieve through reform.It would be paradoxical and unacceptable if thiscrucial challenge which the reform of the SecurityCouncil poses us were to result in a fragmenting of theUnited Nations at a time when unity of purpose andcommunity of efforts are more important than ever. Theissue is too important to be dealt with hastily.25The reform package proposed by the Secretary-General is capable of making rapid progress  supported bya broad consensus. The issue of the Security Council doesnot appear to have secured the same level of agreement.Let us make progress on the first and continue to reflecton the second."
"108",4559,"MHL",52,1997,"﻿I wish to take thisopportunity  on behalf of the Government of the Republicof the Marshall Islands  to congratulate Mr. HennadiyUdovenko on his election and to commend the President ofthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly for a jobwell done.My delegation has stressed the importance ofsustainable development ever since we first became aMember of the United Nations. Our convictions and oursupport were most recently reiterated by His ExcellencyThe Honourable Imata Kabua  President of the Republicof the Marshall Islands  at the special session of theGeneral Assembly to review Agenda 21. It is  and willremain  the cornerstone of the Government’s policy  butI must recall the sentiments that we have often voiced:sustainable development is not the easiest path to travelfor a small country like the Marshall Islands. There arenumerous obstacles which we must face and which areimpeding our progress. Please let me try to put this intobetter perspective.Population growth in the Marshall Islands and inmany parts of the Pacific is of great concern to ourGovernments. It has been as high as 4.2 per cent but nowappears to be slowing down to 3.5 per cent. This isnevertheless far too high a figure for our small country tosustain. With rather limited resource bases to begin with it is difficult to imagine what job opportunities will haveto be created for new generations. We are already facingproblems with layoffs in the public sector. Granted  it wasmuch too large. It was at one point almost 60 per cent ofthe work force but is now down to 43 per cent. This isstill a very high number  and we are looking into all sortsof methods of increasing private sector investment toincrease private sector employment.But population growth also has a negative impact onour local environment. There is a growing trend ofmigration to the two main urban centres of the MarshallIslands — Majuro  the capital  and Ebeye  close to theUnited States base at Kwajalein. These areas arebecoming increasingly crowded  and there is an urgentneed to find local solutions. There is a great need toimprove urban conditions  but at the same time we alsowish to reduce the rate at which the urban centrepopulation grows.In a democracy like ours  it is difficult to try toimpose any restrictions; instead  we have tried to lookinto incentives. One idea that has been tried is jobcreation in the outer islands. We have long been aware ofthe potential that the outer islands could have if therewere only more investment in sustainable developmentprojects.Population growth is causing difficulties for thecountry in many diverse fields  but Government and localauthority action is making some progress. Our youth andchurch groups in particular are taking up this issue as amain concern for the future. But this is only one of manyproblem which we have to face.22We have by no means given up on the struggle toachieve sustainable development and the improvement ofliving standards in the Marshall Islands. On theGovernment side we are first of all looking at how existingstructures can be reformed and how better to utilize ourresources. We are interested in any innovations that couldhelp us. But it is increasingly clear that if we are to breakout of destructive cycles and move away fromunsustainable patterns  then we must all work together.There will continue to be a need for external assistance tothe Republic of the Marshall Islands  but this can and mustbe channelled in a more appropriate manner.Last year we reported that the damage caused bynuclear-weapons testing in the Marshall Islands was farmore extensive and devastating than previously understood.We now know that many more islands and groups ofpeople were affected. The testing programme in theMarshall Islands helped the international communityunderstand the effects of nuclear weapons on people andthe environment. This knowledge was a contributing factorto the prevention of nuclear war during the cold-war era. Inthe Marshall Islands  we believe that we played asignificant role in bringing about the end of the cold war.We share the commitment of the United Nations to worldpeace  security and disarmament.There is little question that the nuclear-testingprogramme in the Marshall Islands was the definingexperience of the Marshallese people in this century. The67 nuclear-weapon tests conducted in our country and thetests conducted on our neighbouring Pacific islandscontaminated every inch of our environment and exposedeach one of our citizens to radiation. As a result  myGovernment is desperately seeking resources to address thedirect medical and environmental consequences of radiationexposure  since we do not have sufficient funds. We arealso struggling to deal with the indirect problems of thedisplacement of  and the lack of adequate medical care for the affected population. It places an additional burden onour already constrained medical care resources.We cannot solve these problems on our own  and wefeel obliged to appeal to the international community. Wecertainly appreciate all efforts to address our problemsmade by our former administering authority  and we areencouraged by recent indications that the United States iswilling to address outstanding concerns. Yet present effortsto address lingering consequences are inadequate.Marshallese people have the basic human right  like allpeople throughout the world  to a healthy and cleanenvironment. We are justified  therefore  in askingassistance in restoring our lands and returning ourdisplaced populations to a safe environment.In this regard the United Nations has an importantrole to play. We are encouraged that the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency is in the process of conducting asurvey in the northern areas of the Marshall Islands. Butanother body  the United Nations Scientific Committee onthe Effects of Atomic Radiation  could in our view havea much greater role. We have noted the terms ofreference of that Scientific Committee  and we see noreason why it cannot undertake studies that could in thefuture assist those populations that are suffering from theeffects of atomic radiation. In our view it must go beyonda simple academic understanding and have a role thatwould allow more interaction with affected countries. Iwas also a little puzzled by the brevity of the ScientificCommittee’s last report — only one page. We would liketo request that the Committee expand its scope of work to see how it could look into areas  like the MarshallIslands  affected by nuclear tests. We would be willing toassist the Scientific Committee in obtaining  for itsconsideration  documents and declassified informationpertaining to nuclear testing and its effects on people. Mydelegation intends to review this issue in the FourthCommittee.My country  all low-lying atolls  with no mountains is also facing a most serious threat of sea level rise.While we are here discussing this issue  the effects oferosion  storms and tide surges are already being felt inthe Marshall Islands. We are of the firm opinion that thescientists working with the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC) have by now made such aconvincing argument about this troubling issue. Thisconsensus has been reflected in the acceptance by allGovernments concerned of the Second Assessment Reportof the IPCC. As a result of this acceptance of thescientific proof  we would have expected  at the veryleast  that the developed countries would agree toundertake so-called no-regrets measures. Such measuresseek to improve efficiency and reduce waste  and todevelop alternative sources of energy. My Governmentfully supports such initiatives  as they seem to us to be aperfectly sensible way to begin addressing climate change.But we are finding that there is resistance even to such amodest idea aimed at trying to halt this irresponsiblewaste of natural resources and fossil fuels. I have beenhearing reports that in the negotiating process there arestill those countries that seek to undermine the processitself for their own short-term gains. I can only say thatmy Government is saddened by these countries’ attitude.23For this reason  a Pacific regional expert group has warnedthat we may have to look at our migration options  ratherthan adaptation options. Are we willing to see thedisappearance of whole countries for the sake of short-termeconomic gain?A recent newspaper ad campaign here in the UnitedStates has further attempted to add confusion and doubt inregard to the scientific evidence  and is also spreadingalarmist doomsday scenarios for the economies of thedeveloped countries. This is simply a misrepresentation ofwhat is being discussed and of what has been proposed  aswell as what is likely to be the result if we do not act now.I was further amazed at seeing television ads stating similarmisleading information. The question that appears to beraised is that the developed countries will pay a heavyfinancial price for ineffective measures. The suggestion hereis that climate change is a preposterous plot by developingcountries to dominate the industrialized economies. Butclimate change would be costly to us all. The destruction ofsmall island developing States and other low-lying areaswill only be the first marker as the flood gates open forfull-blown climate change. There should be nomisconception that there is any other option except actionto significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I wish tostate our position  supported by scientists  economists andconcerned people  that inaction will result in a disaster formankind. What we need as the first step are significant legally binding cuts in the greenhouse gas emissions of theindustrialized world.Please allow me to state our gratitude to and fullsupport for the Secretary-General in his efforts andproposals to reform the United Nations. His report has beenstudied by our officials  and we have concluded that wemust give the Secretary-General our full backing on hisvision for a reformed United Nations. I have someexperience with the difficulties of bringing reform to anunwilling system  and we understand fully what he is goingthrough. But reform is crucial if we are to have a forward-looking and effective United Nations  a United Nations thatcan assist us developing countries in our search forsustainable development. All the national efforts ofcountries like the Marshall Islands require an internationalsupport structure that is conducive to sustainabledevelopment goals. The United Nations has a crucial andvital role  and we must maintain its leadership andcoordination function.Reform of the United Nations requires that theMember States recommit themselves to their treatyobligations to negotiate in good faith and find the mutuallybeneficial steps that we need to take. I wish to reiteratethe support which my Government has given to theproposals that have come out of the Committee onContributions as a good starting point for financialreform. Let us take these modest first steps  and then inthe next phase we can finish the reform.Reform will also have to involve the expansion ofthe Security Council. We have stated our support forvarious proposals in past general debates  and we havebeen involved in the working groups. Last week thePrime Minister of Fiji reiterated their proposal to givemore prominence to the Pacific as a subregion of theAsian Group. This is an idea that we wholeheartedlyembrace. It has captured a very important facet of thereasons why we need to have expansion — that is  tofacilitate the participation of all countries in the SecurityCouncil. Our countries would feel much morecomfortable with the decisions of the Security Council ifwe had a better opportunity to be a member. There is alsoa need to review the use and extent of the veto power and whether there should in fact be any new permanentmembers of the Security Council. It may well be that amore equitable rotation structure would suffice.These are some of the most pressing issues beforethis session of the General Assembly. The connectionbetween what occurs in the international community andthe impact the results have on individual countries shouldbe made clearer. The sustainable development processthat we wish to work towards requires a great effort onthe part of the Marshall Islands Government andcitizenry.Similarly  the international community as a wholemust be involved in charting a more democratic andcooperative future in this singular world organization. Wefeel that we deserve the support of the internationalcommunity for our own efforts  and we pledge to workconstructively with the United Nations system and donorcommunity."
"109",4582,"MKD",52,1997,"﻿First of all  Sir  allowme to congratulate you on your election as President ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations and to wish you success in the executionof that responsible and lofty function. I am especiallypleased that the General Assembly has elected to this veryresponsible function a very competent representative fromUkraine  a friendly country with which the Republic ofMacedonia is developing successful cooperation.The Republic of Macedonia attaches greatimportance to the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly. On the threshold of the twenty-first century the interdependence of peace and global development isa standard that must be respected. It is dangerous forsome to develop while others continuously regress. Thistrend can only be a source of conflicts  of confrontationof interests  even of wars. Consequently  there is noalternative to the strengthening of peace through thepromotion of international cooperation  and ourOrganization faces the serious responsibility of being evenmore efficient and more focused on essential issues. Thisis the direction that the Macedonian delegation will alsopursue.I applaud the fact that the Organization is headed byMr. Kofi Annan  a very competent reformer who believesin the irreplaceable role of the United Nations as aguarantor of international peace and security. Hisprogramme for United Nations reform  as contained in hisreport of July of this year  is one of the most topicalissues before the Organization. We believe that theessential changes that have been proposed take intoaccount the basic consideration that the United Nations4remain a democratic institution representing the interests ofall Members. We too  much like the Secretary-General wish the Organization to be a promoter of new changes  atrue centre where countries can harmonize their activities inbuilding a better world. Whether the United Nations willtruly become such an organization will depend on all of us and the Republic of Macedonia will continue to make itscontribution to that end. In that context  the emergingpriorities are as follows: a stronger General Assembly reform of United Nations organs  and above all of theSecurity Council  a reduction in the number of ad hocbodies  greater transparency of operations  and maximumcontrol over the budget of the Organization  financialspending and contributions.Allow me to address some of the priority tasks thatthe United Nations will have to face in the coming period tasks which should not be placed in the background becauseof the reform of the United Nations. Indeed  that reformmust be in the service of a more efficient resolution of thebitter issues that burden the international community. Thecredibility of the United Nations will to a large measuredepend on this  for in the coming period much energy willhave to be devoted to ending existing crises and conflictsand to preventing the eruption of new ones.The United Nations has become renowned for itssuccessful peacekeeping operations. I should like to use thisopportunity to express my highest appraisal of the presenceof the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force(UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia  as well as myappreciation to all the participants in that operation  whichhas helped prevent a spillover of the conflict from someparts of the former Yugoslavia to my country.With regard to the crisis in Albania  my country hasconstantly felt the need for the effective presence of theUnited Nations peacekeeping forces. The cooperationbetween the Macedonian Government and UNPREDEP  oneof the most successful preventive operations in the historyof the United Nations  is truly excellent. My pleasure isincreased by the reports of the Secretary-General thatcontain the same assessments. The mission of UNPREDEPis ongoing. We believe that it should continue  for thepresence of peacekeepers in the Republic of Macedoniaserves not only as a dam preventing the existing crisispoints in the Balkans from overflowing  but also as an actorworking for peace  security and stability in the country’ssouthern regions.In that context  the Republic of Macedonia haswelcomed and follows closely the implementation of theDayton Accord. It is a matter of principle that theindicted war criminals be brought to justice. Theinternational community  epitomized in the UnitedNations  must not allow the Dayton Accord to fail. Hence it is imperative to give impetus to further engagement bythe Organization  in coordination with the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union  insustaining the peace process. A particularly important partof that effort  I would emphasize  is the normalization ofrelations between the Balkan countries  on the basis ofgood-neighbourliness and mutual respect. Within itscapacities  the Republic of Macedonia has made and willcontinue to make the maximum contribution to that effect.The agenda of this session of the Assembly alsoincludes the development of good-neighbourly relationsbetween Balkan countries  in accordance with resolution50/80  adopted following our proposal at the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  and the election of newmembers of the Security Council for the term from 1998to 1999. Allow me to address these issues briefly.Throughout the twentieth century  the Balkans hasremained a concern for the international community dueto the many wars waged in this region. The Republic ofMacedonia has unequivocally opted for peace there. Inthis context  we are engaged in an active policy of good-neighbourliness and mutual cooperation with all Balkancountries. This can also be seen through resolutions 48/84and 50/80 B proposed by the Republic of Macedonia andsponsored by many Balkan countries — but not justBalkan countries — and adopted with the vast supportand consensus of the General Assembly. The Republic ofMacedonia is committed to respecting the territorialintegrity and sovereignty of the Balkan States and theinviolability of international frontiers  and to advancingmutual cooperation in all spheres. We are particularlycommitted to the institutionalized and functionalintegration of the Balkans in the European integrationprocesses. During this session  our delegation will submita draft resolution for the development of good-neighbourly relations in the Balkans. I hope that theGeneral Assembly will adopt it by consensus.As long ago as 1994  my country  the Republic ofMacedonia  submitted its candidacy as a non-permanentmember of the Security Council from the EasternEuropean group of countries  for the term from 1998 to1999. I also announced our candidacy during my addressto the Assembly last year. I am pleased that many UnitedNations Members have expressed great understanding ofour motives and arguments  and have supported the need5for one Balkan country to be elected as a member of theSecurity Council. We very much appreciate the support forand confidence in our candidacy that we expect to receivefrom the Assembly. We would like to make our owncontribution to the activities of the Security Council and theUnited Nations as a whole by incorporating our own policyof peace and democracy into those activities on the issueswhich fall within those organs' areas of responsibility. Iwould like to assure the Assembly that our delegation onthe Security Council will act in full accordance with theCharter of the United Nations. In the period that lies ahead United Nations bodies will continue to deal with Balkanproblems and the general Balkan situation. This is reality.For these reasons  it is quite logical that the Republic ofMacedonia  as a Balkan country  be elected to this function.It will be a great honour for us to shoulder thisresponsibility  and  at the same time  a great obligation forwhich we have long been preparing.The processes of democratic transformation in manycountries in the world will undoubtedly continue at thesame pace in the twenty-first century. This trend willinevitably influence the character of overall andcomprehensive international relations in global proportions.The United Nations and other organs within its system mustinevitably take part in these changes. Only if the rules ofinternational law are abided by and the real situation on theground is respected can a better and more humane world becreated and thus our trust in our Organization increased. Iam confident that the reforms that have been announced  orrather their consistent implementation  will lead to an evengreater affirmation of the United Nations and itscommitment to combating policies of force and dominationand to supporting peace  cooperation and the balanceddevelopment of all countries and peoples. In a word  we areconfident that in this way the United Nations will be evenmore efficient in responding to the objectives and ideals ofthe Charter of the United Nations."
"110",4628,"MLI",52,1997,"﻿MayI first of all congratulate you  Mr. President  most sincerelyon your outstanding election to the presidency of the UnitedNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I haveno doubt that thanks to your eminent qualities and your richexperience you will carry out remarkably well the missionentrusted to you. You may be assured of the completesupport of the delegation of Mali.I also want to express our appreciation and thanks toyour predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  for theimportant contribution he made to the last session asPresident of the General Assembly.To the new Secretary-General of the Organization Mr. Kofi Annan  I would like to express my fraternal andwarmest congratulations. His election on 17 December1996 was a tribute to the eminent qualities of a man whohas devoted his life to the service of the United Nations.While wishing him every success in the difficult missionconferred upon him  it is my firm conviction that he willdo honour to his continent  Africa  in guiding ourOrganization towards the next millennium.As this fifty-second session of the General Assemblyopens this year  the United Nations is at a crossroads.Two years ago in this very Hall  on the occasion of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  128 Heads ofState or Government forcefully reaffirmed their faith inthe United Nations in its principles and its objectives.They unanimously appealed for profound reflection on therole and resources of the world Organization so that itmight be given the human  material and financialcapacities that are vital to its mission  and so that it mightbe able to enter the twenty-first century withdetermination and professionalism.This appeal was not in vain. Under the dynamicleadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan whose courage and lucidity I wish to commend  ourOrganization has today embarked on an ambitiousprogramme of reform. On 14 July last Mr. Kofi Annan continuing the work of his predecessor  submitted to theGeneral Assembly his report on the reform of the UnitedNations. Like other Member States  Mali is nowconsidering the proposals contained in that report and willwithout delay submit its observations thereon. Mydelegation is delighted at the political will expressed byall to initiate the appropriate reforms in order to make ourOrganization better able to respond to the needs of ourday and to the aspirations of the peoples for which it wascreated.While on the topic of reform  I cannot gloss over thesubstantial progress made by Member States in thedifferent working groups of the General Assembly. 1997will mark the crowning of sustained efforts  including thefulfilment of the mandates given to the Working Groupson  respectively  the Agenda for Development and thestrengthening of the United Nations system. Theunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of thedocuments that endorsed the often difficult andpainstaking deliberations of these two Working Groups11eloquently reflects our shared will to succeed  byconsensus  in laying the groundwork for the restructuringand modernization of our Organization in the priority fieldsof development and economic cooperation.As for the reform of the Security Council  the high-level Working Group established to study this issue hasmade considerable progress  although concrete measureshave not been adopted on such fundamental items as theexpansion and composition of the Council  and thee use ofthe right of veto.However  I welcome the many constructive and oftencomplementary proposals that have enriched the debatesthis year. I am convinced that by redoubling our efforts wewill be able to benefit from the momentum that has beencreated  and that we will succeed in restructuring andmodernizing the Security Council by making it moredemocratic and credible as well as more legitimate andtransparent.The maintenance of peace and security  we know requires the prevention  management and settlement ofcrises — of which there unfortunately are still a largenumber  often pernicious. These crises are currently sourcesof grave concern to the entire international community  andparticularly to Africa  where some countries continue to beafflicted by multifaceted conflicts. In this respect  it isgratifying to note that significant advances have been madehere and there towards the restoration of peace and security.My delegation is gratified at the dynamic process thatled on 20 July to the holding of general  free and credibleelections in Liberia  marking the end of a long and brutalcivil war and the establishment in that country ofdemocratic institutions. This victory  which is above all thatof the people of Liberia themselves  must be welcomed asa successful example of the settlement of a regional conflictand should serve as a source of inspiration for thesettlement of other crises.Mali  which has played an active role in the settlementof the Liberian crisis in both the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group(ECOMOG)  would like to recall here that assistance forthe reconstruction of Liberia is the only means ofconsolidating the peace won at such cost. The resultsobtained by the Inter-African Mission to Monitor theImplementation of the Bangui Agreements are a goodexample of the virtues of direct dialogue and ofinternational mediation.My country welcomes the positive evolution of thecrisis in the Central African Republic as a result of thecommendable efforts of the International MediationCommittee established by the Nineteenth Summit Meetingof Heads of State and Government of France and Africa.As regards Western Sahara  my delegation is pleasedwith the progress achieved at the end of the fourth roundof private contacts on the implementation of the UnitedNations Settlement Plan  with a view to the organizationof a referendum for self-determination.Conversely  the existence of other centres of tensionand breaches of democratic order are of grave concern.This is the case in Angola  where the delaying tactics ofthe União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola(UNITA) are putting a severe strain on the peace processunder way. My country supports without reservation themeasures recently decided upon by the Security Councilrelating to this party to the conflict.Likewise  in Sierra Leone  the situation is extremelyconfused because of the obstinacy of the leaders of themilitary coup d’état in holding on to power in spite of thepressure exerted by the United Nations  the Organizationof African Unity and  more particularly the EconomicCommunity of West African States whose selectministerial committee has courageously and selflesslyundertaken difficult negotiations in order to achieve there-establishment of constitutional order with the return ofthe democratically elected president.My country  which is a member of the InternationalMediation Committee in the Republic of the Congo  isgravely concerned by the situation of widespread civilwar prevailing in that country. Once again  we appeal tothe sense of responsibility of the parties and ask them toengage resolutely and very quickly in a politicalsettlement of the crisis so that the mediation process canbe brought to a successful conclusion.This crucial moment for Africa is equally crucial forthe Middle East  where the dynamic of peace that beganwith the Madrid Conference is increasingly being calledinto question by the recent serious events. This is the timeand place to call urgently on the co-sponsors of the peaceprocess and the international community as a whole totake further initiatives to safeguard the peace process inter alia by persuading the parties to resume thenegotiations as a matter of urgency with a view to theapplication of the agreements that have been concluded.12My country  Mali  also remains concerned by thepersistence of the sanctions against Member States of ourOrganization  in particular the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  andby the suffering the sanctions cause for the peoples of thesecountries.For more than 50 years  the realization of the ideal ofdisarmament has been at the centre of our constant concernto build a system of collective security  free of weapons ofmass destruction. From this viewpoint significant progresshas been made towards  in particular  the reduction andultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals. In this respect Mali welcomes the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction.Nevertheless  the objective of general and completedisarmament has still to be achieved. On the basis of thisconviction  Mali has demonstrated its commitment to thisgoal by taking concrete initiatives at the international regional and national levels. Evidence of this is theresolution initiated by my country in 1994 and co-sponsoredby about 20 Member States  regarding “Assistance to Statesfor curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collectingthem”. This initiative by Mali  which contributed toinitiating the now well-known concept of“microdisarmament” within our Organization  is aimed atdrawing the attention of the international community to thedisastrous consequences of small arms  particularly in thedeveloping countries where  as we know  they play a largepart in fuelling conflicts.All this emphasizes how important it is urgently tosupport the efforts of the countries of the Saharo-Saheliansubregion in order to stem the phenomenon of theproliferation of small arms  especially through effectivecontrol of borders and the review of legal instrumentsregarding the bearing of arms.Along the same lines  from 24 to 28 March 1997  theGovernment of Mali organized  together with the UnitedNations Department of Political Affairs  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)  a “Week of Peace” to commemorate the firstanniversary of the “Flame of Peace”. The internationalforum  held on that occasion  which brought together therepresentatives of the countries of the subregion and of theinstitutions and bodies to which I have just referred  gavean opportunity to analyse the factors that led to therestoration of peace in the northern regions of Mali and toidentify ways and means of ensuring lasting peace and ofpromoting a real culture of peace.I would like here to echo the fervent appeal made atthat forum for good governance  which favoursparticipation over exclusion and dialogue overconfrontation  and which assures respect for democraticprinciples and human rights. I also wish  from thisrostrum  to make an appeal to the internationalcommunity to give its full support to the proposal for amoratorium on the import  export and production of lightweapons that was formulated during the consultationsheld at the same time as the “Week of Peace”. In additionto the countries of the West African subregion  theseconsultations brought together representatives of theUnited Nations  OAU  the ECOWAS/Togo agreement onnon-aggression and defence assistance (ANAD)  and ourdevelopment partners.Furthermore  the conflicts in recent years haveshown that conventional weapons can also cause massdestruction. For that reason my country welcomed theadoption on 18 September 1997 of the Convention on thetotal ban of anti-personnel mines  and supports theinternational efforts  including the Ottawa process  toachieve the total elimination of anti-personnel mines atthe global level.The values of peace  freedom and economic andsocial justice which inspired the founding fathers of theUnited Nations must remain today  more than ever  thefoundations of the joint action incumbent on us in thequest for a decent life for everyone. In this respect  wemust  together and in a united way  seek concertedsolutions to the persistent problems of underdevelopment.Thus  from New York in 1990  with the WorldSummit for Children  to Rome in 1996 with the WorldFood Summit  the great international conferences of thedecade have contributed remarkably to the preparation ofa new design for human society at the dawning of thethird millennium. The paradigm of sustainabledevelopment  based on economic growth that is sustained socially equitable and ecologically viable  constitutes thecommon denominator on which the internationalcommunity now agrees in order to give new direction tothe collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples. The mixed results of last June’sspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to anoverall evaluation of the implementation of Agenda 21are a sharp reminder of the vital need to think for our13world globally and act collectively to meet the challengesconfronting our planet.Regardless of the angle from which we approachthem  the problems at the end of this century cannot beresolved except through concerted and integrated action —action capable of managing harmoniously the upheavalsaccompanying this changing period of history. Theconsensus achieved in the Agenda for Development showsour shared faith in the virtues of a new global partnershipfor development  based on the imperative ofinterdependence and on mutually beneficial action.Since the conceptual framework has been defined andaccepted by all  it is now time — and high time — to moveto action through a rational mobilization of resources inkeeping with the generous goals formulated in the Agendafor Development.The settlement of the debt crisis  just remuneration forcommodities  the renunciation of trade barriers and anincrease in official development assistance — this isessentially the direction that needs to be taken in order tobuild a world that is more accommodating to all  so true isit that our global village cannot be built in a lasting way ifthe majority of its members are excluded. The fight againstpoverty in this context has absolute priority  because it issimply unacceptable at the dawning of the third millenniumthat millions of men and women throughout the worldshould continue to lack the minimal conditions for a decentlife. The aspiration of peoples for a better life is alegitimate quest which cannot be ignored.As Mali sees it  any work towards sustainabledevelopment is above all a national responsibility  throughthe effective definition and application of soundmacroeconomic policies  based on transparency  the pre-eminent rule of law  the practice of democracy  respect forhuman rights  social justice  and the participation of all inthe effort of national development. For my country  this isthe surest path to follow in our quest for the shared idealassigned to us by the United Nations Charter:“to promote social progress and better standards of lifein larger freedom”.We are on the eve of a new millennium  which willsee the emergence of new challenges and new threats  butalso of great dreams and hopes for humankind.As responsible leaders of our States  we have anobligation to seek ways and means to meet thesechallenges. But we also need to guide in the rightdirection the aspirations of our peoples to live in peace liberty  progress and active solidarity.Fifty-two years ago the founding fathers of ourOrganization cleared the way for us to attain these nobleobjectives  which are still relevant. If we apply the termsof the Charter  we will be able to respond to particularuncertainties and put an end to the climate of doubt  fearand suspicion that characterizes present day internationalrelations.We must also agree to do more and to do better inour quest for a better future for the human race. Webelieve in the United Nations as the institution to help usachieve this.The President of the Republic of Mali  HisExcellency Mr. Alpha Oumar Konaré  is convinced thata restructured  modernized United Nations  endowed withthe essential capacity to act  can help to resolve ourdisputes  ensure more orderly management of worldaffairs and eliminate the injustice  disparity and egoismthat threaten humankind.That is why my country  Mali  will continue to workwith enthusiasm and determination to ensure theemergence of a United Nations that is truly united in itsdiversity  at peace with itself and resolutely committed tothe service of all peoples."
"111",4669,"MLT",52,1997,"﻿I wish to join other delegations incongratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I amsure that  with your vast experience and diplomatic skill this Assembly will be guided towards achieving the goalsto which all peace-loving nations aspire. I also take thisoccasion to thank your predecessor  Ambassador RazaliIsmail  for the efficient and energetic manner in which hepresided over the Assembly at its fifty-first session.As we approach the dawn of a new millennium  theinternational community continues to prepare itself for thenew challenges that the twenty-first century willinevitably bring. Malta welcomes the commitment of ourevolving United Nations  ably led by Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  to become more responsive to and effectivein meeting these new challenges. Similarly  we share hisperception that the United Nations is at a moment of greatopportunity.There should be little doubt that  with the demise ofbloc politics  the way has been opened for a world moreat ease with itself. Tension on a global scale hasdiminished. At the same time  global instability has beenreplaced by regional tensions that have often led to ethnicand other localized conflicts. In our interdependent world the United Nations has a significant role to play in thepromotion of understanding and cooperation  which areessential elements for the survival of humankind.For its part  Malta is ready to work closely with allMember States to strengthen our capacity for collectiveaction in the best interests of the States and peoples ofour countries  particularly in upholding the principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations. Our commitment tofundamental rights and the process of democracy isunwavering.Malta looks forward to the establishment of aninternational criminal court in Rome in 1998. Earlier thismonth  Malta was honoured to host an internationalconference on this initiative  which we strongly support.Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stemsfrom the fact that this court would be a landmarkdevelopment in the creation of a balanced and effectivesystem aimed at ensuring that international crimes 5especially mass violations of basic fundamental humanrights  do not remain unpunished.We strongly believe that no country can enjoy peaceand prosperity in the true sense of the word unlessfundamental human rights are respected and unless theState adopts a democratic system of government. Likewise Malta is committed to an international policy that promotesdisarmament and supports all measures that militate againstthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  includingnuclear  chemical and biological weapons. Malta fullysupports current efforts being undertaken to ban theproduction and use of anti-personnel landmines.Eleven months to the day after a democratic change ofGovernment in Malta  I must take this occasion to affirmour commitment to peace  to cooperation among all nationsand to the pursuit of economic prosperity in a context ofsocial justice. Placed as it is at the southern rim of Europeand at the geographic and strategic centre of theMediterranean  Malta stands by its commitment to theideals of European integration as well as to those ofMediterranean unity. We believe that both these sets ofideals are of vital importance  while being complementaryand in the best interests of all Mediterranean and allEuropean peoples.In following up on these ideals  we have proposed tothe Maltese nation a vision of a role for Malta that tangiblyaffirms the island's neutrality  in order to remove once andfor all any perception that Malta could be of any threat toany of its neighbours  north or south  west or east. Withinthis context  our vision projects for Malta a role that subject to our clear limitations of size and resources actively seeks to help build political  economic  social andcultural bridges between all our neighbours and otherpeoples of the Euro-Mediterranean space.Indeed  Malta's foreign policy has three importantconstituents. It is a foreign policy based on cooperationwith neighbouring countries  free of alignments yet openand friendly to all; supported by an economic strategybased on high-quality production and the provision of high-quality services; and endeavouring to pursue excellence andreliability in all that it seeks and undertakes.Malta's foreign policy priority is to maintain the bestand most transparent relationship possible with all of ourneighbours in the Euro-Mediterranean region and beyond.Our active neutrality foreign policy agenda aims to deepenour ties with the European Union in a meaningful mannerwhile implementing an active Mediterranean policy toencourage regional cooperation and unity.Indeed  the Government of Malta aims to forge theclosest possible relations with the European Union bynegotiating ties in the form of a free trade area coupledwith a long-term political and security cooperationagreement  and cooperation in technical  economic financial and social affairs.We are equally committed to build upon ourMediterranean identity and heritage by seeking to furtherspur intra-regional networks of cooperation. Maltastrongly believes that such cooperation  based on dialogueand mutual understanding  will contribute to a peacefulEuro-Mediterranean region where Malta is ready to act asa catalyst to bring together the diverse civilizations of theMediterranean littoral.It is in this spirit that Malta speaks of and promotesits active neutrality. We seek and promote peace andstability in a troubled and complex region. Malta presentsno threat of any nature to anyone. At the same time Malta extends to all of its neighbours the engagement andcommitment of an honest broker  an intermediary orsimply a venue for dialogue and discussion  in the searchfor a solution to the many problems which beset them.The Government of Malta is determined to be proactivein the quest for peace  and  in this context  we aredetermined to enhance the trust needed to act in the bestinterests of all of our societies.Malta's neutrality is indeed validated by ourgeostrategic position in the centre of the Mediterranean where political uncertainties  socio-economic disparitiesand diverse cultural traditions all are contributing to anarea that remains plagued by tension and instability. Farfrom being ideologically motivated  Malta's neutrality istherefore a direct response to the very specific and uniquegeopolitical factors that currently exist in the surroundingregion.The Government of Malta believes that its strategyof active  site-specific neutrality enables it effectively topromote stability and understanding across the Euro-Mediterranean region. Moreover  this status of neutralitywill continue to serve Malta's self-interests preciselybecause it will also serve the best interests of theEuropean Union member States and of our Mediterraneanneighbours.6For Malta  the Mediterranean has been and continuesto be an integral element in our national developmentprogramme. Malta's active participation in international andregional forums is perhaps best described as an extensionof its cooperative security philosophy.The Mediterranean is a microcosm of today'smultipolar world. The region epitomizes many of theproblems associated with the North-South debate. Theseinclude maritime safety  maritime pollution  illegalmigration  terrorism and weapons proliferation. Malta isparticularly concerned at the ever-widening demographicgap and the ever-widening economic disparities in theMediterranean region between the affluent North and theunderdeveloped South. Poverty  combined with a lack ofjob opportunities and deteriorating living conditions  isfueling extremist tensions throughout the Mediterranean.Malta lies at the crossroads of the Mediterranean andtherefore believes it can act as a focal point in the effortneeded to attract the necessary attention and resources totackle security challenges in the region. The Mediterraneanis still dominated by areas of tension and conflict  whichrequire our constant vigilance. Israeli-Palestinian relations the Cyprus question  the situation in the former Yugoslavia the sanctions against Libya  the situation in Algeria andother issues continue to create political tension  which isunfortunately escalating and therefore creating a sense ofurgency in the finding of immediate and enduring solutions.My Government thus believes that the perceivedthreats to stability and therefore to security in theMediterranean are more of a political  environmental economic  social and humanitarian nature than of a militaryone.An important dimension of my Government's foreignpolicy is directed towards the fight against drug-relatedmatters: illicit trafficking  money laundering and organizedcrime. As a transit country  Malta could easily be open toinvolvement in the web woven by drug traffickers.Nevertheless  Malta is more determined than ever to faceup to this challenge  which is threatening the very fabric ofour societies. Malta calls upon the international communityfor support in our efforts to eradicate this social plague.The Government of Malta believes that the creation ofa nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Mediterranean established on the basis of arrangements unanimouslyagreed to by all the States of the region  would inevitablycontribute to peace and stability in the Mediterranean. Thisfact was acknowledged by the 1995 Review and ExtensionConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  when thecreation of such zones was encouraged.The ultimate objective of Malta's Mediterraneanpolicy is the transformation of the region into a politicallystable and an economically prosperous  demilitarized andnuclear-free zone. In this respect  Malta intends to makemaximum use of its contacts and available diplomaticrepresentation at the United Nations and in otherinternational forums to promote its political objective ofthe Mediterranean Sea as an area of peace and stability.Through regular diplomatic interaction with other MemberStates at the United Nations  as well as through a moreactive interchange and collaboration with the Office of theSecretary-General  Malta intends to keep questionsrelating to the Mediterranean high on the internationalagenda.Earlier this year Malta was host to the second Euro-Mediterranean Conference  at which 27 States fromEurope and the Mediterranean held their secondministerial meeting in as many years to forge a Euro-Mediterranean partnership  an event which in itself hasfar-reaching significance. The Malta Conference reiteratedthat the serious and deep-seated problems of our regionneed to be tackled through a process of dialogue andcommon action  extending over a period of time andcovering a whole range of interrelated issues. It is Malta'sconviction that this process has generated a politicalcommitment that will effectively contribute to the removalof the misperceptions and prejudice that still exist in theregion.In its document on foreign policy published beforeMalta's last general elections  held in October 1996  theMalta Labour Party stated that for the United Nations toimprove its credibility and authority  it must improve itsstructure  its administration and its competence. Aboveall  it is hoped that this world Organization will developa more efficient mechanism by which it could implementand execute its decisions more rapidly and effectively.That is why Malta today supports the initiative ofthe Secretary-General in presenting his report to theGeneral Assembly and congratulates him for what weconsider to be proposals of an unprecedented andcomprehensive nature.This annual gathering provides the perfect setting forthe international community to come together and takestock of the previous 12 months and to identify  as7precisely as possible  the challenges that lie ahead. Webelieve that three types of trans-national security challengesrequire our immediate attention. These are the war ondrugs  environmental degradation and the eradication ofpoverty. Unlike the immediately visible effects of war these three challenges cannot always be defined withsufficient clarity  although they have a potential fordestruction that is equivalent to that of war. Malta sees eachof these areas as a far-reaching hazard which threatens thevery fabric of our economic  human and environmentalhabitat  leading to instability and presenting real threats toour security.The first challenge concerns the scourge of illicit drugtrafficking. Countless human lives are being ruined andwasted to satisfy the greed of a few. This is anunacceptable situation. Malta believes that the UnitedNations system is well placed to coordinate this fightthrough appropriate and effective measures. We thereforewelcome the recommendation of the Secretary-General thatthe functions of the Commission on Crime Prevention andCriminal Justice and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs beconsolidated into a single commission under arrangementsthat will fully preserve the treaty-based functions entrustedto the latter.The second challenge we are facing on the thresholdof the twenty-first century is the reconciliation ofenvironmental concerns with development needs. Thecommon concerns and mutual interests of the internationalcommunity in promoting sustainable development  and atthe same time protecting our environment  cut acrossnational boundaries.The problem of the environment is no less relevant toMediterranean countries. Sound management of Malta'scoastal and marine environments is of crucial importancefor an island State like Malta. The pressures exerted on theMediterranean environment as a consequence of its beingan important maritime highway and a tourist destination areof particular concern. We believe that solutions to commonenvironmental problems are best found through anintegrated regional approach.My Government is firmly committed to a proactiverole in supporting regional initiatives in the Mediterraneanfor the conservation and sustainable management of itsnatural marine habitat. Malta has contributed actively to thisprocess in the past  within the context of the MediterraneanAction Plan of the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) and the Barcelona Convention  the most recentinitiative being the setting up of the MediterraneanCommission for Sustainable Development. Malta intendsto strengthen its participation in that Commission as wellas to contribute to the fullest extent to the Mediterraneanenvironmental programmes within the context of theEuro-Mediterranean process.Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organizationin the promotion of environmental protection and thesustainable use of the world's natural resources to ensurea more equitable distribution of wealth  and of aninternational trade regime free of restrictive ordiscriminatory practices. Together we must adopt aneffective course of action for the coming years that willcreate the right balance between the need for human-centred and socially just development and the need toensure the sustainability of our natural environment.In the five years since the United NationsConference on Environment and Development  not much unfortunately  has been achieved. Last June's specialsession made an in-depth appraisal of the progressachieved  defined future priorities and helped to raise theissue of sustainable development higher on the politicalagenda. We acknowledge that all of us — developed anddeveloping  rich and poor — share a common interest inthe pursuit and attainment of development  which must besustained  equitable and integrated. In the words of theSecretary-General  development is“a pillar of peace  a foundation of stability  and apowerful force for preventive diplomacy andpreventive action”. [Press release ECOSOC/5708]However  our third challenge is what I consider tobe the most complex. For years  the internationalcommunity has been trying to come to grips with theperennial problem faced by millions and millions of theworld's population: poverty. The ever-increasingdisparities between the haves and the have-nots havereached alarming proportions. The cold war and East-West division have been superseded by a post-cold-warNorth-South divide. Though many had predicted thisdevelopment and called for a concerted effort to deal withthe issue  little has been done to try to reverse this trend.Poverty still reigns supreme. Aggravated poverty  hungerand malnutrition are a paradox of our times. A fifth of theworld's population  or 1.3 billion human beings  live onincomes of below a dollar a day  and over 50 per cent ofthe world's population have less than 5 per cent of totalglobal income.8The United Nations system is uniquely placed to dealwith such intolerable and acute problems. This Organizationmust dedicate more attention and more time to coordinatingeffective action to alleviate the suffering and the degradingenvironment in which billions of citizens still live. It is timeto act firmly and unequivocally to halt the aggravation ofthis situation  which is fast becoming a latent source ofpolitical instability in the world.Malta believes that as we enter the new millenniumour Organization must become more relevant; it mustbecome more democratic. Today's setup reflects the past. Ina world where everyone is speaking about democracy  theright and the use of the veto become anachronistic. Maltais of the view that the use of the veto should be curtailedwith a view to its eventual elimination. Malta is not infavour of extending the right of veto.On the issue of the expansion of the Security Council Malta believes that the Charter of the United Nationsconsiders all States to be equal  and therefore it follows thatthough we should have a more representative SecurityCouncil that reflects today's membership of the UnitedNations  this can easily be achieved by increasing thenumber of non-permanent seats to the Council.My Government has carefully examined the Secretary-General's report on renewing the United Nations  documentA/51/950. We agree on the need for more efficiency andgreater cost-effectiveness. At the same time  we feel that as the Organization is a unique body  its tasks andsuccesses cannot be measured solely in monetary terms.Here  I would like to highlight two important areas ofthe Secretary-General's report. In paragraph 108 it is statedthat when imposing sanctions the Security Council shouldgive more consideration“to making these sanctions more effective in achievingthe goal of modifying the behaviour of those targeted while limiting the collateral damages. There is also aneed to address the broader humanitarian andeconomic effects of sanctions  as well as objectivecriteria in their application and for their termination”.[A/51/950]Malta finds itself in total agreement with thisstatement. While supporting the use of fair sanctions imposed appropriately and for the minimum period of timepossible by the United Nations in its task of guaranteeinginternational peace  we feel that the decision to imposesanctions  especially those which will ultimately affect thewhole population of a given country  must be justifiedand that they should be imposed only as a last resort.In another area referred to by the Secretary-Generalin his report  Malta would like to see the Secretariat'sDepartment of Political Affairs dedicate more time andattention to the situation in the Mediterranean region. Inthis context  consideration should be given to theestablishment of a Mediterranean desk within thatDepartment. The creation of such a desk would facilitatecontacts and the Department would thus assume a moredirect role in the implementation of the relevantprovisions of resolutions adopted by the GeneralAssembly on the strengthening of security andcooperation in the Mediterranean.Malta's contributions in the search for peace  securityand cooperation for the benefit of mankind are wellrecorded in the annals of the history of this Organization.Malta's initiatives on the law of the sea and climatechange and the recent initiative on the new role to begiven to the Trusteeship Council are witness to the esteemand dedication which Malta attaches to its role in thisOrganization.Malta is a small island State. Notwithstanding this we look upon the United Nations as the forum wherecountries such as ours can express their views and wherethe principle of the equality of States is enshrined andprotected. For us  this Organization has much significanceand for this reason Malta intends to support the Secretary-General in his quest for urgent reform.The more efficient and relevant the United Nationsbecomes  the better our interests are served. MyGovernment will continue to give its wholeheartedsupport to the United Nations  its agencies and itsprogrammes. Many of the problems and challenges whichwill face us in the third millennium can be overcome onlythrough the concerted efforts of all Member States andthrough a better  more efficient and more effective UnitedNations."
"112",4715,"MMR",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to begin bycongratulating His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko onhis unanimous election as President of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly. His outstandingdiplomatic skills and long experience in foreign affairsassure us that he will lead our deliberations at the presentsession to a successful conclusion.May I also pay our tribute to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia for his sagaciousand exemplary stewardship of the Assembly at its fifty-firstsession.I also wish to extend our warm congratulations to thenew Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan  on his assumption of his high office. The newSecretary-General has already proved his dynamism anddedication in the discharge of his responsibilities — notthe least by providing us with his comprehensive UnitedNations reform programme for our consideration at thissession of the General Assembly.This is a time for change and renewal for the UnitedNations. The reform package  proposed by Mr. KofiAnnan  Secretary-General of the United Nations in hisreport  “Renewing the United Nations: A Programme forReform”  is the most comprehensive proposal on thereform of the United Nations in the 52-year history of theOrganization. Specific proposals  contained therein  needto be most carefully studied  and considered by all of us.Another question of reform which is the subject ofintensive consultations and discussions among MemberStates at present is that of the composition and workingmethods of the Security Council.Both the reform of the United Nations and that ofthe Security Council are imperatives of our times. Theseinstitutions and their working methods need to be changedand adjusted appropriately to reflect the present-dayrealities. With regard to the reform of the United Nationsin general  we believe that there is a need for a thoroughreview of the United Nations Charter. Many profoundchanges have taken place in the world since the Charterwas framed 52 years ago. We are of the view that therole of the General Assembly should be enhanced in linewith Articles 10  11  12  13 and 14 of the Charter. Thepractice whereby a few great Powers hijack importantpolitical issues for settlement among themselves in theSecurity Council  bypassing the Assembly is not basicallyconsistent with the spirit and principles of the Charter.Nor is it in the interest of the entire membership of theUnited Nations and the interest of the Organization. TheGeneral Assembly should be more actively involved inthe settlement of important political issues before theUnited Nations. We wish to see more intimate anddynamic cooperation between the General Assembly andthe Security Council. Moreover  the General Assemblyand the Economic and Social Council should play agreater role in the coordination and direction of globalmacroeconomic policy matters.With regard to the reform of the Security Council there is an emerging convergence of views amongMember States that the membership of the Council shouldbe expanded to reflect the present-day realities  althoughdifferences of opinion still exist on the modalities ofenlarging the Council. Myanmar endorses the position ofthe non-aligned countries that the Council should be11enlarged by not less than 11 new members and that such anenlargement should be based on the principles of sovereignequality of States  equitable geographical distribution androtation. Imbalance in the composition of the SecurityCouncil and gross under-representation in it of the non-aligned countries should be corrected in order to reflect theuniversal character of the world Organization. In thecategory of permanent members  there are a few interestingproposals  including that of Mr. Razali Ismail  President ofthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly recommending an increase of five new permanent members two industrialized States and one State each from regionsof Asia  Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean respectively. There are also proposals to rotate the threenew regional permanent seats. These proposals deserve ourserious consideration. We believe that there is also a needfor democratization and greater transparency in the workingmethods of the Council.May I now touch briefly on the reform package proposed by the Secretary-General. We welcome the mainthrust of his proposals for cost-cutting and streamlining ofthe United Nations institutions and services. The importantthing is that the reform of the United Nations should trulybenefit the entire membership  of which the majority aredeveloping countries. Our vision is a leaner and moreefficient United Nations that can more effectively respondto the challenges of our time and better serve the interestsof the entire membership of the Organization. In thisrespect  we need to examine most carefully whether thenew senior executive posts it is proposed to create arereally necessary and whether emphasis and focus oninstitutional reforms are rightly placed.These proposed reforms  if and when approved by theGeneral Assembly and implemented  will have far-reachingeffects on the Organization and will go a long way indetermining how well the United Nations will be equippedto meet new challenges in the twenty-first century.Accordingly  we should not rush into reform measures fortheir own sake  showing undue haste. We should undertakea most careful examination and a thorough discussion ofthese proposals before taking firm decisions in this regard.Myanmar is an ardent advocate of stepping upinternational disarmament efforts with a view to makingfurther advances in this important area of our collectiveendeavour. We welcome the proposal by the Secretary-General in his reform package to upgrade the Centre forDisarmament Affairs to the Department for Disarmamentand Arms Regulation.Today  the post-cold-war international politicalclimate is conducive to arms limitations and disarmament.Last year  the General Assembly successfully adopted theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We areencouraged to learn that the Preparatory Commission forthe Organization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty is making good progress. However  it wasdisconcerting to learn of the recent subcritical non-explosive nuclear tests carried out by a nuclear-weaponState. Such subcritical tests run counter to the spirit of theCTBT and to the cause of nuclear disarmament. We wishto see the cessation of all weapon-related nuclear tests —be they explosive or non-explosive  subcritical orsupracritical — in all environments for all time.In the field of arms limitations and disarmament  weattach the highest importance to nuclear disarmament andelimination of weapons of mass destruction. At thehistoric golden jubilee session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly  Myanmar submitted  with theoverwhelming support of Member States  the draftresolution that became resolution 50/70 P  entitled“Nuclear disarmament”  calling upon the nuclear-weaponStates to undertake a phased programme of progressiveand balanced deep reductions of nuclear weapons with aview to the total elimination of these weapons within atime-bound framework and calling upon the Conferenceon Disarmament to establish  on a priority basis  an adhoc committee to commence multilateral negotiations onnuclear disarmament.Since the adoption of resolution 50/70 P by theGeneral Assembly in 1995  there has been a ground swellof renewed interest in and support for nucleardisarmament worldwide. In their advisory opinion of 8July 1996  all Judges of the International Court of Justiceunanimously reaffirmed the existence of a legal obligationfor all States  including nuclear-weapon States  to pursuein good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiationsleading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects understrict and effective international control. There has alsobeen a clamour for nuclear disarmament by severalgroups of experts  groups of ex-military officials fromsome nuclear-weapon States and public organizations invarious countries around the world.At the fifty-first session of the General Assembly my delegation once again successfully submitted a follow-up resolution — resolution 51/45 O — on the samesubject. My delegation will submit another follow-up draftresolution on nuclear disarmament at this year’s sessionas well. We hope that  in view of its immense political12importance  our draft resolution will enjoy theoverwhelming support of Member States  as in previousyears.The recent Conference held in Oslo from 1 to 19September negotiated a draft convention to place a total banon anti-personnel landmines. We are supportive of banningthe export and indiscriminate use of anti-personnellandmines. We believe  however  that every country isentitled to exercise the right of self-defence  enshrined inArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter  in matters of itsnational defence. In our view  the real problem lies in theindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines and theexport and trade in these weapons. It is the indiscriminateuse of anti-personnel landmines that is actually killing andmaiming innocent children  women and men the worldover  and it is the export and trade in these mines that iscausing their proliferation  leading to their indiscriminateuse. We should effectively address these real issues  ratherthan reach out for an indiscriminate and all-encompassingtotal ban on anti-personnel landmines.Next year  1998  will mark the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Significant andsubstantial advances have been achieved by the UnitedNations in the promotion and protection of human rights inthe past 50 years. Nowadays  increasing importance andemphasis have been placed on the promotion and protectionof human rights.We are all for the promotion and protection of basichuman rights  including the right to development. There isno question about that. But when it comes to theapplication of human rights standards  we are concerned bythe deviation by certain Western countries from the criteriaof universality  objectivity and non-selectivity enshrined inthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adoptedby the World Conference on Human Rights. Thepoliticization of human rights questions and the selectivityand use of double standards run counter to the spirit andbasic norms of human rights.Myanmar has been unfairly treated in this matter andhas been singled out for censure by certain Westerncountries under the guise of the promotion and protectionof human rights. The fact is that never in our post-independence history have we in Myanmar enjoyed sucheconomic growth; never have the Myanmar people betterenjoyed the basic human rights to peace and stability shelter  clothing and food than at present. Those Westerncountries turn a blind eye to all these positive developmentsand accomplishments of the Government in my country andindulge in the ritual of unfounded fabricated chargesagainst my country. To cite a Myanmar saying  theirignorance of the realities and misjudgment may belikened to that of a quack doctor who ignores the fact thatthe patient is a man and gives him a gynaecologicaldiagnosis. A man must not be accused or censured for theoffences he has not committed.For our part  we have cooperated with the UnitedNations to the fullest extent possible. Myanmar has beenengaged in a continuing dialogue with the United Nations.From 1994 onwards  I myself  as a representative of theMyanmar Government  have held discussions with theSecretary-General and his representatives at UnitedNations Headquarters in New York. Assistant Secretary-General Mr. Alvaro de Soto  representative of theSecretary-General of the United Nations  has visitedMyanmar several times and has met and held discussionswith officials of the Government. There have also beenseveral visits by the Special Rapporteur of theCommission on Human Rights. Moreover  the MyanmarGovernment has fully responded to queries on humanrights situations and provided the full and comprehensiveinformation sought by the United Nations and itssubsidiary bodies. We shall continue this cooperation withthe United Nations.The spread of narcotic drugs is a growinginternational concern. Myanmar has always been in theforefront of the war on illicit drugs. A few facts andfigures will speak for themselves.In the military operations from 1988 to the end ofAugust 1997 by the Myanmar Armed forces to interdictdrug traffickers  776 members of the Armed Forces including 25 commissioned officers  sacrificed their lives;and 2351 members  including 84 commissioned officers sustained injuries.From 1989 to date  operations to destroy narcoticdrugs have been carried out 11 times in Yangon;operations to destroy narcotic drugs  drug refineries andpoppy plantations have been carried out 18 times by thelocal populace in frontier areas; a total of 36 682.03 acresof poppy plantations have been destroyed. All theseoperations took place in the presence of foreignjournalists and diplomats.Myanmar has a comprehensive legal framework tocombat drug abuse  including money laundering. Underthe 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic SubstancesLaw  money laundering and the acquisition of property by13the illegal means of drug trafficking are strictly prohibited.Stern punitive measures for such criminal offences areprescribed and a separate body — the Property ExaminationCommittee — was constituted effectively to deal with theseoffences.Myanmar’s cooperation with other countries in mutuallegal assistance in the suppression of narcotic drugs isexemplified by the handing-over of the drug trafficker Mr.Li Yun Ching by the Myanmar authorities to the Thaiauthorities on 17 May 1997 during the goodwill visit ofThai Prime Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh toMyanmar.A most significant accomplishment by Myanmar inrecent times in this respect is the declaration of Mong-laSpecial Zone (4) of the Eastern Shan State as a “drug-freezone” as of 22 April 1997. Special Zone (2) of the EasternShan State and Special Zones (1) and (2) in Kachin Statehave been designated for establishment as “drug-freezones”. Effective measures are being implemented to totallyeradicate drug abuse in these areas. We are confident thatthese areas will be totally drug free in the near future. Byestablishing an increasing number of such drug-free zonesand by other effective measures of suppression of narcoticdrugs  we envision and strive to achieve the totaleradication of drug abuse in Myanmar in the not-too-distantfuture.In fairness to all  it would be hard to find othercountries that have made sacrifices of such magnitude interms of loss of life and limb of the members of theirarmed forces and have carried out such massive destructionof narcotic drugs. No candid observer  free from anyprejudice against Myanmar  can deny these concrete facts.But certain Westerners  bearing prejudice and maliceagainst Myanmar  are pointing accusing fingers at mycountry on all sorts of fabricated charges. Nothing can befurther from the truth. So glaring is their distortion of factsthat we can only say that the analogy of the quack doctorI have quoted above also applies in this instance.As this is a time for change and renewal for theUnited Nations  so it is for the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN). In this year of the thirtiethanniversary of the founding of the Association  ASEAN  atits ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July this year admitted Laos and Myanmar  bringing its membership tonine. By so doing  ASEAN has demonstrated to the worldthe solidarity among the South-East Asian countries. Weare confident that this will lead to the further expansion ofthe membership of the Association to 10 in the near future.By this expansion  ASEAN has once again proven itsrelevance  viability and dynamism as a regionalorganization.Myanmar is also taking an active part in regionaleconomic cooperation. An important step taken by mycountry recently is Myanmar’s joining of the Bangladesh-India-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIST-EC) in August this year.Through its pursuit of an independent and activeforeign policy  Myanmar has consistently contributed topeace and stability in the region and beyond. As amember of ASEAN and of the Non-Aligned Movement Myanmar will continue this contribution through its activeparticipation in international and regional affairs in futureas well."
"113",4772,"MNG",52,1997,"﻿It gives mepleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Udovenko Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  on his unanimouselection to the presidency of the current session of theGeneral Assembly and to wish him success in the dischargeof his important responsibilities and duties. May I alsothank Mr. Razali  Permanent Representative of Malaysia the outgoing President  for his able stewardship and for theinitiatives he undertook during the past session.The disintegration of the bipolar world structure andthe end of the cold war are creating favourable conditionsfor realizing the goals and principles enshrined in theUnited Nations Charter. Globalization — vigorouseconomic integration and interdependence — is becominga prevailing tendency throughout the world. Thefundamental changes that international relations areundergoing  as well as the new challenges and globalagendas  demand from the United Nations  its specializedagencies and the Member States new visions and collectiveefforts and actions commensurate to these realities. I wishto underline that the overwhelming majority of theinternational community recognizes these changes  isadjusting accordingly and is contributing to this process. Itis hardly possible to visualize our common future if we donot jointly solve the socio-economic problems and thequestions posed by underdevelopment  unemployment hunger  poverty  disease  crime natural disasters.Mongolia stands for making the United Nations aneffective and efficient organization able to meet thechallenges of the new millennium — a political  economicand legal instrument capable of safeguarding the interestsof all nations  especially the small ones  on the basis ofequality and justice.United Nations reform has been a subject ofsubstantive debate in recent years. It is therefore naturalthat the reform agenda  in particular the Secretary-General’s report on a programme for reform  is at thecentre of attention at this session. Mongolia dulycommends the constructive efforts of the Secretary-General to reform the United Nations and overcome itspresent financial crisis. It thus welcomes the reformprogramme he submitted to the General Assembly. Webelieve that thorough consideration should be given to thespecific proposals  such as a reasonable reduction of thestaff of the Secretariat  allocation of the resulting savingsto acceleration of development  establishment of the postof Deputy Secretary-General and creation of a UnitedNations Development Group so as to improvecoordination and management. It is clear that UnitedNations reform is not an event  but rather a process. Weshare the view that it is a continuous process  the endresult of which should be measured by the increase in theefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.Mongolia supports the view that the expansion of theSecurity Council’s permanent and non-permanentmembership should provide equal regional representationand that the Council’s activities should be democratizedand made more transparent. Despite the enlargement ofthe Council membership  the overwhelming majority ofMember States will still not be directly represented.Therefore  Mongolia’s proposal to institutionalize thefuller participation of Member States in the Councilproceedings  including its formal meetings  is findingincreasing support within the Organization.Mongolia appreciates and supports the Secretary-General’s efforts to give priority to socio-economicquestions  to invigorate United Nations developmentactivities and enhance international cooperation fordevelopment. To this end it is vital that the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies and internationaltrade and financial institutions intensify their activities inthis area and better coordinate their interactions.Today it is universally accepted that sustainabledevelopment could be attained if it were approached in acomprehensive manner  and that sustained economicgrowth is closely linked with social development andenvironmental protection. It is gratifying to note that theAgenda for Development  adopted this year  has beendrawn up precisely in this spirit. We consider it an19important document that defines the strategy of internationalcooperation for development  and we believe thatimplementation of its provisions is vitally important.The special session of the General Assembly held lastJune reviewed and assessed the implementation of the Riosummit decisions and outlined future actions. Since Agenda21  adopted five years ago in Rio de Janeiro  has not beenfully realized  the international community should accordgreater attention to its complete implementation.Mongolia believes that implementing the importantdecisions and recommendations of the summit conferencesheld under United Nations auspices in the early 1990s iscrucial for consolidating the positive trends in world socialdevelopment and redoubling international cooperation forpoverty alleviation  human rights protection  food security the environment  advancement of women  protection of therights of the child and sustainable human settlement.While fostering international cooperation fordevelopment  it is important to accord high priority toaddressing the problems of the most disadvantageddeveloping countries that have unfavourable locations severe climate and underdeveloped infrastructure.Landlocked developing countries  handicapped by theirgeographical location and remoteness from world markets face tremendous obstacles and hardships in their efforts fordevelopment and advancement. Reality shows that thesecountries risk becoming marginalized from the ongoingglobalization process in the world economy andinternational trade. Therefore  it is imperative for theinternational community to increase its support of andcooperation with these countries  as envisaged in theAgenda for Development.It is gratifying to note that landlocked developingcountries are taking concrete steps to develop transittransport cooperation with their transit neighbours. MyGovernment believes that the first-ever North-east AsiaSubregional Consultative Meeting on TransitTransportation  held in Ulan Bator this year  has laid thegroundwork for the development of such regionalcooperation.The notion of and criteria for defining internationalpeace and security are undergoing changes. With theimprovement of the international political climate  thedangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race arereceding  while prospects for taking concrete steps onpractical disarmament are improving. The very concept ofsecurity based primarily on the size of armed forces andmilitary alliances or associations has also been changing.It now includes the level of development and progress wealth and the well-being of peoples  as well as theextent to which human rights and fundamental freedomsare insured. All this must find due reflection in UnitedNations activities.I am pleased to inform the General Assembly thatlast July Mongolia ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Given the paramount significance of theTreaty  Mongolia believes that there is an urgent need tohave it enter into force as soon as possible  to implementits provisions strictly and to make operational itsinternational verification system.The international community must take specificmeasures designed to act on the advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice on the obligation to pursueand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nucleardisarmament under strict and effective internationalcontrol.The Government of Mongolia is pleased with theentry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Itsratification by the United States of America and a pledgeby the Russian Federation — these being the two majorPowers possessing substantial arsenals of these weaponsof mass destruction — to ratify that Convention areimportant prerequisites for subsequent successfulenforcement.In the past few years the trend to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones has been gaining momentum.Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size ofits armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowestpossible level and of ensuring its independence andnational security primarily by political and diplomaticmeans. In 1992 Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone  and it is now seeking to institutionalizethis status internationally. Within this framework  wepresented to the last session of the United NationsDisarmament Commission a working paper on the basicprinciples and elements of the concept of the single-Statenuclear-weapon-free zone. I take this opportunity toexpress our firm support for the proposal to establishnuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions  particularlyin Central Asia  and our readiness to work actively forrealizing this.20It is regrettable that sources of tension and conflictpersist in some regions of the world. International peaceand security would be strengthened if the parties concernedwere to display political will and utmost restraint inresolving their differences by negotiation and other peacefulmeans.Bearing in mind the importance of strengthening therule of law in international relations  the internationalcommunity declared the United Nations Decade ofInternational Law and has taken a series of relatedmeasures. It is gratifying to note that on the initiative ofMongolia  the current session is to consider the question ofdrafting guiding principles for international negotiations.Mongolia believes that the adoption of a document definingguiding principles for international negotiations would notonly meet the purposes and principles of the Decade butwould also promote the definition of international criteriafor conducting international negotiations on the basis ofjustice and the sovereign equality of States  irrespective oftheir actual power.Mongolia continues to support the convening in 1998of a diplomatic conference on the establishment of theinternational criminal court. We believe that the jurisdictionof the court should cover  inter alia  crimes of aggressionand grave environmental crimes.The Government of Mongolia is consistently pursuinga policy of democratization  embracing a market economyand opening up to the world. In the last year the newGovernment has undertaken a series of very importantmeasures to accelerate political and economic reforms stabilize the country’s economy and ensure economicgrowth. To cite an example  we have introduced a zeroper cent import tariff and accelerated the pace ofprivatization. These are important steps to attract foreigndirect investment and expand trade with our major partnersand the world at large.Full membership in the World Trade Organization(WTO) early this year greatly contributed to the forward-looking development of Mongolia. We seek to cooperateconstructively with WTO as the main multilateral trade-rule-setting mechanism.As part of our policy of actively joining global andregional economic integration  Mongolia is striving topursue a policy aimed at strengthening peace and securityand developing cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. We arefocusing our attention on North-East Asia in particular andare committed to increasing our cooperation with thecountries of the region  both on a bilateral and amultilateral basis.I should like to express our hope that Mongolia’sinteraction with the United Nations  its agencies and otherinternational organizations and our bilateral cooperationwith Member States will continue to play a valuable partin overcoming underdevelopment  in dealing with thehardships inherent in our transitional period and inmeeting pressing socio-economic challenges. In thisconnection  I wish to express the gratitude of myGovernment to the donor countries  the United Nationsand other international institutions for the support andassistance they have given my country.Mongolia has always viewed the United Nations asan important instrument for safeguarding internationalpeace and security and for promoting social and economicdevelopment  and has always supported it. We remaincommitted to strengthening the United Nations andenhancing its efficiency and effectiveness collectivelywith all Member States."
"114",4814,"MOZ",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of myGovernment and on my own behalf  allow me tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your unanimouselection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. Your election to this office bears testimonyto your commitment to the cause of international peace andsecurity. I am sure that with your guidance and wideexperience in international affairs  our work will record asuccessful outcome. You can rest assured of mydelegation’s full support during your term of office.I would also like to put on record our appreciation ofthe manner in which your predecessor  Ambassador RazaliIsmail of Malaysia  presided over the deliberations of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly. Hisperformance and innovative ideas will indeed help us tacklethe challenges before our Organization in the years tocome.Let me pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisleadership and the commitment to the ideals of internationalpeace and security demonstrated in his first year of office.I wish him well and pledge our full support and cooperationas he discharges his responsibilities in our Organization intimes of change.Within two days  Mozambique will celebrate fiveyears of peace and stability. Looking back  albeit to see thechallenges we have encountered  our nation has  without adoubt  made significant progress in its quest for theconsolidation of peace and tranquillity  democracy anddevelopment  and we are determined further to pursue thesegoals.In the political sphere  we have succeeded increating an enabling environment in which politicaldiscussions are being carried out positively both inParliament and by civil society at large. As we deepenthis positive experience within the framework of apluralistic society  there is broad consensus among allMozambicans that dialogue must continue to be the wayto overcome differences and to address the developmentneeds of our country. To this end  my Government willspare no effort in order to ensure that Parliamentcontinues to function normally  for we believe that thiscourse of action remains a key factor for the consolidationof peace  democracy and national reconciliation. The nextstep will be to hold the country’s first municipal elections which will complement the process initiated in 1994 withthe holding of multi-party general elections.The implementation of the structural adjustmentprogramme initiated in 1987 has indeed created anattractive environment for private investment  bothdomestic and foreign  which is gradually and steadilyleading the country to economic and social progress. It iswithin this multidisciplinary and global action thateconomic reforms are taking place  with results that arealready positive and tangible. Preliminary indications ofthe performance of the economy during the first half of1997 estimate that growth in gross domestic product willreach about 7 per cent by the end of this year  a figurewhich is higher than that originally forecast.In speaking on this very important subject I wouldlike to underscore the high importance we attach to theneed for flexibility with respect to the implementation ofinitiatives for debt relief and sustainability. MyGovernment is encouraged by recent indications frominternational financial institutions concerning theimpending decision on the eligibility of Mozambique tothe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. Iwould hope that once such a decision is made the time-frame between the decision point and the completionpoint might be as short as possible so as to have thedesired impact on the economy. Without far-reaching debtrelief measures  it will be virtually impossible for thecountry to sustain the current growth and stabilization ofthe economy. We hope that as soon as possible all leastdeveloped countries may accede to the Initiative.In this regard  my Government welcomes the recentadmission of Russia to both the Group of 8 and the ParisClub. It is our hope that those steps will enable thatcountry to play a more active and constructive role inmatters related to debt forgiveness and relief  particularly10in relation to countries like Mozambique. For our part  wewill continue to undertake and deepen further our politicaland economic reforms  as we have over the past 10 years with particular emphasis on the provision of basic healthcare and education.The rehabilitation of the economic and social fabrics especially in the rural areas  is seriously hampered by thescourge of landmines. These horrible weapons have killedand continue to kill and wound hundreds of innocentcitizens. With that in mind  at the fourth InternationalConference of Non-Governmental Organizations onLandmines  which met at Maputo in February of this year my Government approved a resolution that prohibits  withimmediate effect  the production  commercialization utilization and non-authorized transportation of anti-personnel landmines in the territory of Mozambique.My Government has been participating fully in thenegotiations within the framework of the Ottawa process.In this respect  we welcome the results achieved at therecently concluded Oslo Diplomatic Conference. We urgeall countries to heed the call of the peoples of the worldand to join the majority of nations in signing theinternational treaty on the total ban of anti-personnellandmines in December this year. We wish to launch avigorous appeal to the international community to ensurethat all the provisions of that treaty with respect to  interalia  the destruction of stockpiled anti-personnel mines andthose laid within minefields and in areas outside minefields and with respect to international cooperation and assistance are fully implemented.In this respect  I wish to highlight the importance myGovernment attaches to the question of assistance to victimsof landmines before  during and following mine clearance in order to ensure the early and safe return and resettlementof displaced persons with a view to ensuring a speedyresumption of economic activity  in particular in rural areas.I would like to express our deep gratitude to thosecountries and organizations that are providing generousassistance in demining activities  and invite others to joinus in implementing our national demining programme.In August this year  the Government and civil societyjointly launched a national campaign for thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which will take place on 10December 1998. The Universal Declaration of HumanRights  with which my country fully associates itself represents the commitment by all peoples of the world totheir faith in human dignity. The nationwide celebrations encompassing a variety of activities  will afford a uniqueopportunity to all Mozambicans — and  indeed  to otherpeoples elsewhere — to review and educate themselveson such an important issue for mankind. It will be anopportunity to underscore the importance of the non-selectivity  indivisibility and universality of human rights.Within that framework  my Government follows withkeen attention the progress being made in the PreparatoryCommittee on the Establishment of an InternationalCriminal Court. The establishment of such a court  withthe purpose of bringing to justice individuals accused ofcommitting the most heinous crimes  is an importantcontribution to the promotion of human rights andfundamental freedoms. The court must be entrusted withclear powers in order fully to discharge its mandate. Inparticular  its competence and jurisdiction should beclearly defined in conformity with its objectives andtaking into account the principle of complementarity.In the African continent  we are participating indiscussions for the establishment of an African court ofhuman and peoples’ rights. It is our hope that the high-level meeting scheduled for next year at Addis Ababa willsucceed in finding the needed consensus on alloutstanding issues pertaining to the court.In the past 12 months  the issue of United Nationsreforms has gained new impetus with new developmentswhich have taken place quite recently. It is a fact thatthere is a broad consensus with regard to the need forsuch reforms. Nevertheless  in carrying them out it will beimportant to find ways and means that will ensure that thelegitimate rights and aspirations of all Member States  andin particular the developing countries  are safeguarded.This is particularly relevant with respect to the proposalsfor the enlargement of the Security Council.Similarly  my Government has taken due note of andwelcomes the reform package presented by the Secretary-General in his report entitled “Renewing the UnitedNations: A Programme for Reform”. The report  the mostcomprehensive and far-reaching ever produced in theannals of the Organization  addresses vital elements thatrequire in-depth discussion by Member States.As a country striving to strengthen peace andsecurity both within its borders and in the regionalcontext  as well as in the world as a whole  Mozambiqueregards preventive diplomacy  peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building as important elements that must be11strengthened in the new international context. In thisconnection  we are participating with other countries of theregion in joint efforts aimed at reinforcing our preparednessfor emergencies. We therefore encourage and support theSecretary-General in his endeavours to enable the UnitedNations to deploy peacekeeping operations rapidly.In the field of human rights  I welcome the proposedconsolidation of the Office of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights and the Centre for Human Rights into asingle new Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. I commend the Secretary-General for this course of action  which is in line with thesentiments expressed by Member States not only in theGeneral Assembly but also within the framework of theCommission on Human Rights. The merging of the twobodies will in fact eliminate the duplication of tasks andexpenditures and streamline the work of the new consolidated body.On behalf of my Government  I wish to take thisopportunity to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson on herassumption of the post of High Commissioner for HumanRights. We pledge to her our full support  both within thecontext of the Commission on Human Rights  of whichMozambique is a member  and also within the context ofpromoting human rights and fundamental freedomsworldwide.With respect to financing our Organization  I fullyagree with the Secretary-General that the current financialcrisis facing us“is directly linked to the failure of ... Member Statesto discharge their ... obligations regarding prompt andfull payment of assessed ... contributions”. [A/51/950 para. 82]We would really hope that the very same countries that sofar have failed to fulfil their treaty obligations  will thistime not only pay their dues but also assist the Secretary-General by contributing to the proposed Revolving CreditFund.I equally commend the proposed establishment of adevelopment account resulting from reductions in non-programme costs over the next few years. We regard theestablishment of such an account as an importantcontribution in addressing the economic and social needs ofdeveloping countries on a more consistent and predictablebasis.We also endorse the proposed establishment of thepost of Deputy Secretary-General within the frameworkof strengthening the leadership capacity of the Secretariat.The creation of a Strategic Planing Unit  in ourview  will further enhance the ability of the Secretary-General to act in accordance with the provisions of theArticle 99 of the Charter. In the light of the new realities it is our firm belief that the information gathered by thisUnit will be brought to the attention not only of that bodybut also of the General Assembly  in accordance with theprovisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter.As for the proposed establishment of the “UNHouse” under a single United Nations flag  it is importantto ensure that the identity and the vast individual andunique experience — as well as the expertise —accumulated by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) are preserved. More significantly  the need fordecentralization and flexibility in decision-making at thecountry level should be safeguarded and further enhancedso as to ensure that everyone benefits from the proposedconsolidation. It is my Government’s hope that the newarrangement will result in a united  cooperative andcoherent framework at the country level. The experienceof coordination of all of the United Nations programmesand funds in Mozambique is positive and encouraging.We have taken due note of the proposal for theestablishment of a ministerial-level commission toexamine possible changes in the Charter with a view topreparing our Organization for the challenges of the nextcentury. Given the complexity of the issues to be lookedat  the commission should be established on the basis ofgeographic representation  after adequate consultations and should be provided with clear and precise terms ofreference in order to guarantee that its views are universaland as consensual as possible.It is our hope that the proposed reforms — thosebeing implemented within the purview of the Secretary-General  as well as the ones under discussion in theWorking Group — will result in greater focus of theUnited Nations in the economic and social spheres. Nowthat we have gathered consensus on an Agenda forDevelopment  we need to ensure that appropriate steps aretaken by a reformed  more efficient United Nations torealize our goals.12The trends towards the establishment of regional andcontinental blocs require deep cooperation and integratedeconomies. Only combined unity of purpose and action canlend greater leverage and capacity to negotiate and makeeconomies competitive for investment. This must becomplemented by political stability and an enablingenvironment for domestic and foreign investment. We insouthern Africa are joining our efforts towards this goalwithin the framework of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC).These efforts will be further enhanced to a great extentby the recently established Indian Ocean Rim-Associationfor Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). The neworganization assembles a variety of countries from Asia andAfrica  plus Australia. Its fundamental principles includethe facilitation and promotion of economic cooperation bringing together representatives of government  businessand academia.My Government follows with renewed interest theefforts towards the mitigation of conflicts throughout theworld. We are conscious of the fact that economic andsocial development are possible only when we live in peaceand political stability. Therefore  prevention  managementand conflict resolution constitute a fundamental issue in ourforeign policy.In this regard  I wish to associate myself with previousspeakers in congratulating most sincerely the establishmentof the Democratic Republic of the Congo following decadesof uncertainty. We hope that the new authorities will playa positive role in our collective efforts for regional peaceand stability  particularly in the Great Lakes region. Thechallenges facing the new Government are indeed immenseand deserve assistance and support from the internationalcommunity.Likewise  we commend the successful outcome of theelectoral process in Liberia  which symbolizes thecompletion of the peace process in that country. We lookforward to the reinvigoration of a united  peaceful andprosperous country which is ready to contribute to theeffort towards the economic stabilization of the entireregion. It is our hope that the international community willspare no efforts in assisting Liberia to overcome the tragedythat has fallen on it for so many years.The Economic Community of West African StatesMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) deserves our specialcommendation for the role it has played in the resolutionof the Liberian crisis and for its current efforts in therestoration of peace and respect for the rule of law inSierra Leone.We equally note with satisfaction the recent progressmade for the settlement of the issue of Western Sahara and we encourage the parties concerned to continue downthis positive path.The peace process in Angola continues to faceserious challenges as a result of the failure of UNITA tocomply fully with the agreed commitments under theLusaka Protocol. With the recent adoption of SecurityCouncil resolution 1130 (1997)  it is now for this body toensure that the provisions of all other relevant resolutionsare fully complied with in order to bring the peaceprocess back on track and to avoid the continued delayswe have been witnessing over the three years of theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol.On the other hand  my Government remainsconcerned about the situation in the Congo. We supportthe initiative of the heads of State and Government of theregion under the leadership of His Excellency PresidentBongo  and we call upon the parties to exercise maximumrestraint in order not to jeopardize any further thoseefforts. All parties concerned must set aside theirdifferences and work together for the attainment of anegotiated settlement to prevent further suffering ofinnocent civilians and destruction of property.Recent events in the Comoros islands underline theneed for full respect of the independence and territorialintegrity of all States  under any circumstances. Weencourage permanent dialogue among all concernedparties so as to find a negotiated settlement of the disputewithin the framework of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) peace initiatives.On behalf of my Government  I would like toexpress our solidarity to the people of East Timor. We dohope that the ongoing negotiations between Portugal andIndonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations  and other initiatives  will finally leadto a successful outcome of this issue in accordance withthe principles and purposes of the Charter.On the Middle East  my Government notes withconcern the deterioration of the security situation in that13area  which poses great danger to the efforts to achieve acomprehensive  just and lasting solution in the region.Peace cannot be achieved at the expense of other peoples’interests. The policy of establishing new settlements in theoccupied Arab and Palestinian territories should bediscontinued. As we have said before  the existence of bothIsrael and Palestine is an undeniable reality which nobodyshould ignore if we are to reach a final settlement of thislong-standing conflict. Dialogue and compliance withsecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions are theinstruments through which a solution should be found in theMiddle East.We are also following with interest the developmentsconcerning the conflict situations in the Persian Gulf region.In the highest interests of its peoples  we urge all theparties concerned to act together with a view to finding aninternationally acceptable solution to all outstanding issues in accordance with the purposes and principles of theCharter.At the dawn of the new millennium  we bear theresponsibility of preparing the United Nations to save notonly succeeding generations from the scourge of war butalso to provide an Organization that will effectively andefficiently promote cooperation and development. We inMozambique are prepared to work towards this goal."
"115",4859,"MRT",52,1997,"﻿At the outset  I would like to say how pleasedwe are to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the fifty-second session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. We are convinced that yourgreat experience and wisdom will promote the success ofthis session. I can assure you of the cooperation of thedelegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania inreaching the results to which we all aspire.I take this opportunity also to express our gratitudeto and esteem for your predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail  forthe great efforts made and the positive results obtainedduring his term of office as President of the past session.5I should also like to express our appreciation toMr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the United Nations for the tireless efforts he has made since his assumption tohis high office to promote the universality of the UnitedNations and to strengthen its credibility and capacity todischarge its responsibilities despite a difficult internationalsituation.In this context  we welcome the initiative taken by theSecretary-General in submitting an outline for reform which includes a number of provisions that could improvethe functioning of the Organization. An in-depth study ofthis outline will undoubtedly facilitate its adoption by allmembers of the international community.While the end of the cold war has created a favourableclimate for the emergence of a new era of internationaldialogue and cooperation  the improvement of the economicconditions of developing countries remains an urgent need.Indeed  with the growing trend towards globalizationand liberalization in international trade  the developingcountries are facing a number of obstacles  including slowergrowth  falling export revenues  and a reduction in thevolume of investments and in official developmentassistance. All of this may prevent these countries frombecoming part of the global economy and furthermarginalize them if the international community does notmobilize swiftly to provide them with the aid they need tomeet these challenges.The increase in the volume of debt is another obstacleto the economic and social development efforts undertakenby these countries for the benefit of their peoples. In thisrespect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that theburden of debt in many of the least developed countries hasreached such a level that it is virtually impossible for themto continue with their economic reforms  which are ofcrucial importance; and that this situation is exacerbated bythe fact that in 1996 official development assistance  whichcan reduce the effect of indebtedness  fell to its lowest levelin real terms in 23 years.International strategies do not seem to have succeededadequately in easing the burden of debt in the developingcountries  which is why more effective solutions  such asincreasing official development assistance  must be foundso that these countries’ development priorities can befinanced.Despite the fragility of the international economicsituation  progress has been made in various areas due toefforts by the United Nations to promote internationalcooperation and to define policies and strategies capableof meeting the economic  social and environmentalchallenges that confront the world today. For instance several important international meetings and conferenceshave been organized during the past five years under theauspices of the United Nations  resulting in somedecisions and undertakings relating to the main issues ofdevelopment that seek to promote internationalcooperation and coordination for development.I am referring in particular to the World Summit forChildren  held in New York; the Earth Summit  held inRio de Janeiro; the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna; the International Conference onPopulation and Development  held in Cairo; the WorldSummit for Social Development  held in Copenhagen; theFourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing; theWorld Food Summit  held in Rome; the second UnitedNations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) held in Istanbul; and the nineteenth special session of theGeneral Assembly  devoted to the overall review andappraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21  which tookplace in New York last June.These initiatives attest to the determination of theUnited Nations to take into account the concerns andinterests of the international community with regard to awhole range of development issues. The United Nationsshould continue on this path and seek to ensureimplementation of the decisions adopted.Under the enlightened guidance of its President  HisExcellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya  theIslamic Republic of Mauritania has completed the processof establishing constitutional institutions within theframework of a democratic process that began 11 yearsago. This ensures that these institutions will be able tofunction normally within a multi-party system and a Statebased on the rule of law. My country is proud to statethat we do not hold any political prisoners.Fundamental freedoms  such as freedom ofexpression and a multi-party system  as well as tradeunion freedoms  are guaranteed and enjoyed by 20political parties and a large number of organizations andtrades unions that can pursue their activities in completefreedom. Likewise  there are dozens of newspapers andmagazines that reflect various political and intellectualsensibilities.6Furthermore  in keeping with the provisions of ourConstitution  the two Houses of Parliament have beenreplenished  and for the second time presidential elections set for 12 December this year  are being prepared in aclimate of freedom  peace and stability.A global strategy that seeks to raise the level of ourpeople’s economic and social development and toconsolidate democracy has been implemented. This goeshand in hand with the democratic process and is in keepingwith the following comments of the President of theRepublic  His Excellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’AhmedTaya:“We are seeking to build a modern societycapable of accompanying the world on its marchforward and of assimilating scientific andtechnological information; a society aware of thechallenges of our time and working to meet thosechallenges”.In this context  the promotion of women’s rights andthe campaign against illiteracy figure prominently in ourdevelopment programmes. A sustained effort is also beingmade to provide as many of our citizens as possible withaccess to education  jobs and health services  therebyguaranteeing them a better standard of living. The resultsobtained in this regard are satisfactory. Indeed  theenrolment rate in our schools has reached 86 per cent andhealth care coverage for our people has been significantlyextended towards meeting the goal defined by the WorldHealth Organization  which is health for all by the year2000. Drinking water supply systems have been built inseveral regions  and the main cities of the country nowhave electricity.Within the framework of a huge programme toprovide access to remote towns in the interior of thecountry  several new roads have been built  and a moderntelecommunications system now covers the entire country.These important achievements attest to our firm desireto combat underdevelopment in all its forms  relying firston our own resources and then on the support of ourdevelopment partners.I should like here to express my gratitude to allbrotherly and friendly countries and internationalorganizations and agencies  as well as to non-governmentalorganizations  for their support of my country’s efforts inthis area.One of the positive features of international relationstoday  which has led to the strengthening of democracyand respect for human rights in several regions of theworld  is the international community’s effort toconsolidate fundamental principles such as transparency the representative character of power  the primacy of law and the independence of the judiciary.While we can be satisfied with the significantprogress made in this area  we should not lose sight ofthe fact that democracy cannot be limited to the narrowconfines of each individual country; it must extend torelations between nations. In this respect we attachparticular importance to the efforts made by the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council. We also hope that these efforts willlead to greater transparency in the decision-makingprocesses of the Security Council as well as to improvedworking methods.In a different area  we need to adopt a new form ofpreventive diplomacy that is capable of preventingconflicts and the human tragedies that result from them such as those we have witnessed recently and those wesee today and yet are unable to resolve.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania expresses itsprofound concern at the difficulties encountered in thepeace process and at the negative developments in theregion of the Middle East  which result from non-compliance with agreements concluded and commitmentsundertaken in accordance with the established timetable.My country believes that there can be no just andlasting peace in the Middle East unless Israel withdrawsfrom all the occupied Palestinian territories  includingAl-Quds  the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon  andunless the Palestinian people regain their right to createan independent State on their territory.My country also calls for the taking of the stepsnecessary for the resumption of the peace negotiationsamong all the parties concerned. We are convinced thatSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and425 (1978) and the principle of “land for peace” remainthe basis of a comprehensive  just and lasting peace.Furthermore  we call upon the two sponsors of thepeace process to redouble their efforts to ensure that thechance for peace is not lost and the hopes for a new eraof cooperation and concord  in which the potential of the7region is dedicated to economic development and socialpromotion  are not dashed.In this context  my country calls for the lifting of theembargo placed on the Palestinian people  and we ask theinternational community to mobilize the necessary resourcesto finance the United Nations Relief and Works Agency forPalestine Refugees in the Near East so that it can do its jobproperly.In the Gulf region  the aftermath of the war continuesto impede the normalization of the situation. The IslamicRepublic of Mauritania  while reaffirming its dedication tointernational law and its commitment to respecting theprinciples thereof  again states its rejection of any violationof Kuwait’s independence  its territorial integrity and thesecurity of its citizens  and calls for a rapid solution to thequestion of Kuwaiti prisoners.We also reaffirm our steadfast position that nomeasures should be taken that threaten Iraq’s unity andterritorial integrity  and we call for the lifting of theembargo imposed against the Iraqi people  so that an endcan be put to their suffering. We hope that theimplementation of the resolution regarding “oil for food”can help to achieve this.Still on the same region  we reiterate our support forthe United Arab Emirates in its desire to regain itssovereignty over the islands of Greater Tumb  Lesser Tumband Abu Mussa.In the Arab Maghreb  my country is acting incooperation with its brothers for the attainment of theaspirations of the States of the Union of the Arab Maghreb.On the subject of Western Sahara  my countrywelcomed with great satisfaction the agreement which wasconcluded on 16 September last in Houston in the UnitedStates under the auspices of Mr. James Baker III  thePersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General  and which dealswith the main issues that have hampered theimplementation of the settlement plan for Western Saharaworked out by the United Nations in coordination with theOrganization of African Unity (OAU). The IslamicRepublic of Mauritania reaffirms its willingness to doeverything it can to promote implementation of the plan forthe settlement of this dispute.Furthermore  we call for the lifting of the embargoimposed against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  and we hopethat the efforts of the League of Arab States and of theOAU to find a peaceful solution based on the principlesof international law  a solution that will put an end to thissituation so detrimental to the Libyan people and all otherMaghreb peoples  will be given favourable consideration.On the question of Africa we hope that the meetingof the Security Council at the ministerial level held twoweeks ago to consider the situation in Africa willcontribute to the achievement of appropriate solutions tothe problems of the continent.My country also wishes to reaffirm its commitmentto the principles of dialogue and negotiation as the onlyway to overcome crises and conflicts and to defusepockets of tension which exist in several parts of thecontinent. Accordingly  my country renews its support forefforts to revitalize the central organ of the OAU thatdeals with prevention  management and settlement ofconflicts in Africa.As for the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros my country hopes that the efforts undertaken by theLeague of Arab States and the OAU will contribute to thesettlement of the crisis in that country.We hope also that in Somalia the parties concernedwill have recourse to constructive dialogue to reach asolution that will guarantee harmony and stability.In regard to the Republic of Congo  my countryhopes that a peaceful solution that will restore securityand stability will be found.We hope that there will again be a normal situationin Sierra Leone  in keeping with international law.The United Nations is today required more than everbefore to react more vigorously to the problems facing theinternational community. The end of the cold war  and theinternational community’s awareness of the importance ofcoordination and dialogue  are positive factors for givingour Organization the necessary momentum to enable it tomeet the challenges and to establish the bases for a newinternational order founded on the principles of justiceand solidarity and guaranteeing the maintenance of peaceand security throughout the world.There is no doubt also that being aware of themagnitude of the challenges and the need to pool ourefforts to meet them is the best way to restore our hopeof moving closer to the fulfilment of the ideal that was8consecrated at the ceremonies commemorating the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization:“We the peoples of the United Nations united for abetter world”."
"116",4905,"MUS",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  I have thedistinct honour and privilege on behalf of my delegation toextend to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations upon yourelection as President of the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly. Your election to this office is a fittingtribute to your personal qualities and recognition of theimportant role of your great nation in world affairs. We areconfident that your wide experience and wisdom will ensurethe success of our deliberations. You may rest assured ofthe fullest support and cooperation of my delegation.I would also like to thank Ambassador Razali Ismailfor his remarkable contribution to the last session. Wethank him for his strong leadership and his hands-onapproach during the discussions of some of the mostdifficult and crucial issues concerning the future of ourOrganization.The changes taking place throughout the world todaypresent new challenges for the United Nations system andcall for a new approach in finding appropriate solutions.It is my firm belief that the success of the United Nationscannot be contemplated without reform and renewal ofthe Organization. We agree that the United Nations standsat a crossroads today. Its continued role and relevancedepend on its ability to adapt to the new worldenvironment.We now have before us a number of proposalscontained in the Secretary-General’s report designed tobetter equip the United Nations to address its tasks in thenew era. I thank the Secretary-General for this in-depthand valuable exercise. I take this opportunity to paytribute to a great son of Africa and to his sterling qualitiesof leadership. The report not only addresses the strengthsand weaknesses of our Organization  but also containsspecific proposals to enable it to face present and futurechallenges on a sound footing. We subscribe fully to hisview that this reform exercise is a process which willhave to be carried out over a continuous period of time given all its complexity and scope. I wish to assure you Mr. President  that my delegation will extend its fullestcooperation and will actively participate in thedeliberations on the report.We also endorse the Secretary-General’s proposalsfor promoting greater synergy within the United Nationssystem. We agree that they will advance complementarityand coherence. The effectiveness of the Organization willcertainly be enhanced if it operates as an orchestrated unitat Headquarters and at country level  rather than as agroup of semi-autonomous players.Likewise  we welcome the Secretary-General’s ideaof setting up a development account to be fed by savingsfrom reductions in non-programme costs. We express thesincere hope that sufficient funds will be made availableto produce a significant impact on developmentprogramme financing. We should ensure that this dividendfor development does indeed benefit the developingworld  unlike the much-trumpeted “peace dividend” of thepost-cold-war era.We uphold the proposals aimed at enhancing thestrategic direction which the General Assembly shouldprovide. However  such proposals should be subjected tothe most careful scrutiny  because of all their10implications  particularly in respect to the smaller and morevulnerable Member States. The General Assembly  as theSecretary-General rightly points out  is the organ that“most fully embodies the universal and democraticcharacter of the Organization.” (A/51/950  para. 40)While we support the long-standing need for focusinglegislative debates and streamlining this Assembly’s agenda we must ensure that this body does not end up beingdominated by the concerns of the strong and powerfulmembers only. Countries — big or small  like mine —should have equal possibilities of articulating any issue theyconsider important. It is by the way in which thisOrganization addresses issues most relevant to its smallestmembers that the international community at large willjudge its significance.The debate on the reform of the Security Councilseems to have registered some notable movement recently.However  the distance separating the main positionsremains quite daunting. We hope that the wide spectrum ofviews expressed so far on this subject will eventuallyconverge and that general agreement will be reached. Suchagreement should ensure that the composition of thereformed Council is based on greater representation transparency and equitable geographical distribution  withthe inclusion of developing countries as permanentmembers. In this regard  we reaffirm our support for theposition of the Non-Aligned Movement calling for theexpansion of the Security Council on the basis of fair andadequate representation.Africa has also stated its position on this matter at therecent Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit. Thecurrent representation of Africa in the Council does notreflect its status as the most sizeable group of theOrganization’s membership. Reform of this body must therefore  restore Africa’s position to the fullest extentpossible.In the same vein  my delegation would like to reiterateits support for India’s claim to a permanent seat in theSecurity Council.The globalization of the world economy is addingincreasing pressures on the developing countries to embracetrade liberalization as a means to achieve economic growth.During the Uruguay Round negotiations developingcountries made significant concessions in the hope ofobtaining improved access to international markets. Manyof them have still not seen the benefits of the new globaltrading system. Instead  they are haunted by the spectre ofimminent erosion of preferences in their major exportmarkets. Several African countries have made strenuousefforts to adhere faithfully to structural adjustmentprogrammes and have adopted trade liberalizationpolicies. Unfortunately  they have registered but aninsignificant  if not declining  percentage of world trade.Africa’s trade should become the top priority of theinternational community; otherwise  the multilateraltrading system will run the risk of becoming fraught withtensions and discrimination.It is unfortunate to note that foreign directinvestment  which plays a central role in the ongoingintegration of the world economy  is still highlyconcentrated in a few countries. The recent findings ofthe United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) indicate that Africa receivedmerely $5 billion out of $349 billion of foreign directinvestment last year. Excluding South Africa  the share ofAfrica in the total investment for the developing countriesfigured at only 4 per cent. This is the lowest share sincethe early 1980s  and is a further indication that theAfrican region is not benefiting from the global foreigndirect investment boom. The 33 sub-Saharan countriesthat are classified among the least developed countries arein fact receiving less that 1 per cent of the total foreigndirect investment for Africa. It is vital that these countriesbe provided with greater assistance and investment and begiven special attention by the international community.Otherwise  they will be further marginalized  with the riskof disappearing from the world economic map.We therefore wish this Assembly to give moreattention to the development needs of the Africancontinent. In this context  we welcome the recent specialministerial meeting of the Security Council  which hashelped focus the attention of the international communityon Africa. After several years of complacency andstagnation  there is now cause for some optimism.We agree that it is incumbent upon us Africans toput our house in order. But unless we are freed from ourdebt burden  future generations may never have theopportunity to have access to clean drinking water  healthcare or proper schooling while scarce resources have tobe utilized for debt payments.For some countries  like Mozambique  which are justemerging from years of civil conflict  the Bretton Woodsinitiative may have to be implemented in order to reducedebt faster. Indeed  not only do these countries have to11reduce their crushing debt load  they also have to freeresources to rehabilitate their economic infrastructure andfund social expenditure.Last week the British Foreign Secretary  Mr. RobinCook  referred to the Commonwealth Finance Ministersmeeting held in Mauritius earlier this month  at which theBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer  Gordon Brown  madespecific proposals with respect to debt. These proposals known as the Mauritius Mandate  are meant to set some ofthe poorest nations on a path towards sustainabledevelopment by the year 2000. We welcome this laudableinitiative by the British Government to write off debtstotalling 132 million pounds of heavily indebted poorcountries of the Commonwealth. We hope that thisimportant measure will encourage major financialinstitutions and creditor nations to come forward andparticipate fully in transforming the destiny of debt-riddenpoor countries.We also welcome the various initiatives recently takenby the United States to promote investment and to developa new trade regime for sub-Saharan Africa.We equally appreciate the partnership between theEuropean Union and the African  Caribbean and Pacific(ACP) countries  which has  through the successive LoméConventions  contributed immensely to the socio-economicdevelopment of the ACP countries. We are confident thatthe successor arrangement to the Fourth Lomé Conventionwill further consolidate this long-standing economic andtrade partnership  and in this context we look forward to thecontinued support of the international community.We welcome the communiqué of the Denver Summit which represents a significant advance over the New GlobalPartnership for Development adopted at the Lyon Summit.The Declaration “Africa: Partnership for development”focuses attention exclusively on the African continent  withparticular emphasis on the least-developed and landlockedcountries. However  in the pledge to integrate the poorestcountries into this world economy through tradeliberalization and investment policies  no specific targetswere defined on trade expansion or tariff reduction. If thesecountries are to be completely weaned from officialdevelopment assistance  not only should their capacity toproduce be strengthened  but they must also be given fullaccess to foreign markets for their products  especiallythose coming from their nascent and developing industries.We are fully conscious of the fact that North-Southcooperation needs to be complemented by effective South-South cooperation. In this regard  the countries in ourregion have intensified their efforts to accomplish thatgoal.For the Southern African Development Community(SADC)  a new promising chapter was opened with therecent admission of the Democratic Republic of Congoand Seychelles. With the inclusion of these two newmembers  the regional grouping has become an even moreimportant economic area in the African continent. It hasthe potential of becoming the driving force in promotinggrowth and development. There is a strong determinationamong the SADC members to achieve regional integrationthrough industrial transformation and trade growth. MyGovernment is fully committed to this goal  and I ampleased to inform this Assembly that Mauritius will havethe honour and privilege of hosting the SADC summitmeeting next year.My Government is equally committed to the IndianOcean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC)  which regroups several countries of the IndianOcean Rim in a tripartite network of Government  privatesector and academia. The IOR-ARC was formallylaunched at a ministerial meeting in Mauritius in Marchthis year with 14 founding members. It has generatedtremendous interest among the countries of the region andinternationally.We remain confident that the internationalcommunity will lend its support to these regionalassociations. We welcome the timely initiative announcedlast week by the United States Secretary of State toenhance dialogue with SADC and encourage investmentsand trade exchanges.It is a matter of regret that the special session of theGeneral Assembly held last June to review the progressmade in the implementation of Agenda 21 was unable toagree on a frank assessment of the commitments enteredinto at Rio. Unfortunately  very little has been done onthe ground. In some areas  particularly with regard to thelevel of official development assistance  the overallsituation has actually worsened. It is disappointing thatthe lack of new and additional resources has not allowedthe special concerns of the small island developingcountries  as expressed in the Barbados Programme ofAction  to be adequately addressed.We also regret that on the question of climaticchange  no consensus on limits relating to the emission ofgreenhouse gases could be reached. We hope that the12Kyoto Conference on Climate Change will seriously addressthis issue and adopt meaningful measures to cut down theproduction of greenhouse gases.This year the General Assembly twice had to convenean emergency session to consider the extremely serioussituation in the occupied Palestinian territories. Unilateralactions have negated the Oslo peace process. This impassemust now be broken. The recent diplomatic effort by theUnited States Secretary of State  Mrs. Madeleine Albright seems to have averted a total deadlock. It is essential thatthe protagonists start talking to each other again.We view with serious concern the recent events in theIslamic Federal Republic of Comoros  which have resultedin the loss of human lives on the Island of Anjouan. Weappeal to all the parties to the conflict to show restraint andto strive together towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis.We reaffirm our support to the United Nations stand on thesovereignty and territorial integrity of the Comoros. Wealso welcome the constructive role played by the OAU andthe League of Arab States in mediating between the variousparties. We look forward to an early convening of theproposed international conference in Addis Ababa for therestoration of peace in the Islamic Federal Republic ofComoros.The situation in Burundi continues to preoccupy theinternational community. We support the Arusha peaceinitiative and reiterate our confidence in MwalimuNyerere’s role as facilitator in the process aimed at findinga lasting solution to the Burundi crisis.Later this year  we will kick off the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of one of the most important seminaldocuments adopted by this body — the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. During the year leading tothis landmark event  Mauritius will work together with allMember States in promoting and strengthening the humanrights situation everywhere  especially in the communitiesto which we are more closely associated through sharedhistory and culture  namely the Commonwealth and thecommunity of French-speaking countries.The promotion of human rights has been an article offaith for my Government. It is also an integral part of ourforeign policy. In this respect we welcome the setting up ofthe Indian Ocean Institute of Human Rights and Democracyin Mauritius for the promotion of human rights anddemocracy. We pledge our full support to this Institute.Human rights for all  including women and children  anddemocratic values are matters of universal concern.As a multi-ethnic democracy  Mauritius has alwaysraised its voice strongly against discrimination based onrace  religion  culture and otherwise. In this regard  wenote with satisfaction the recent developments in Fiji which has finally decided to amend its Constitution inorder to promote social harmony. We hope that theGovernment of Fiji will tackle the remaining issuesstanding in the way of the full enjoyment of fundamentalrights and basic economic security by all segments of thepopulation of Fiji.Mauritius reaffirms its full commitment to totaldisarmament and urges the world community to makeevery effort to rid itself of all weapons of massdestruction. It is in this spirit that Mauritius was amongthe first countries to ratify the Chemical WeaponsConvention and the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free ZoneTreaty. We also reaffirm our support for the Ottawainitiative for a universal ban on anti-personnel landmines.It is regrettable that some major countries have decided tostay out of this process. We make a strong appeal to allGovernments to become part of this unique and historicendeavour to eliminate landmines.Allow me to take this opportunity to reaffirm thefact that my country  Mauritius  a former French island belongs to the great community of French-speakingcountries. This sense of belonging culminated with theholding in 1993 of the sixth summit of the French-speaking countries  whose central theme was “Unity indiversity”  and which celebrated not only the universalvalues of the French-speaking countries but also made itpossible for us to enshrine those same values in oursociety. Our people  who come from Africa  Asia andEurope  have deep roots in all the great cultures that formthe French-speaking community. My compatriots can  inthe course of one day  travel through all these cultures one after another.It is for that reason that my country attaches suchgreat importance to the Francophone plan of promotingdiversity in a world that is increasingly unipolar anduniform. The upcoming summit in Hanoi will mark avery important stage in the future of this French-speakingcommunity  providing it with the effective political meansto make its voice heard on major international issues.This Assembly is by now well aware of the just andlegitimate claim of Mauritius to the restoration of itsterritorial integrity through the return of the ChagosArchipelago  including Diego Garcia  to its nationalheritage. This Assembly should also note that this issue alsohas a tragic human dimension. Before Mauritius acceded toits independence  all of the inhabitants of the Chagos wereforced to leave the land of their birth  where they had livedfor several generations. The plight of those inhabitants mustnow be comprehensively addressed.Likewise  we are still awaiting the return of the islandof Tromelin to Mauritius. As we pursue our efforts torecover these territories  we call upon the former colonialPowers to expedite this process through dialogue in thespirit of the friendship that characterizes our relationships.My Government looks forward to an early resolution ofthese disputes."
"117",4942,"MWI",52,1997,"﻿I would like to extend mysincere congratulations to the President on his assumptionof the office of the presidency of the fifty-second sessionof the United Nations General Assembly. His election topreside during this critical stage of change and reform inthe United Nations system is a reflection of theconfidence that the entire membership has in him and hiscountry  Ukraine. I wish him a successful term of office and assure him of Malawi’s full cooperation.Allow me to pay tribute to last year’s President  HisExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail  for the excellent manner inwhich he handled the recently concluded fifty-first sessionof the General Assembly. President Razali Ismail broughtwith him a refreshing sense of purpose in the work of theGeneral Assembly and the United Nations. Hispunctuality and forthrightness are attributes which willinspire us all as we move forward. My delegation wisheshim well in all his future endeavours.Special tribute is due to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who  within a short period of time  hasdemonstrated that a revitalized United Nations can workmeaningfully towards the full realization of the principlesand purposes of the Charter. He can count on Malawi’ssupport as he continues to discharge his responsibilities.Malawi welcomes the reforms that are taking placewithin the Organization. The Secretary-General’scommendable efforts in this regard will surelycomplement the work that has been  and continues to be undertaken through the various intergovernmentalprocesses. My delegation expresses its satisfaction withthe recent adoption of the report of the GeneralAssembly’s High-level Open-ended Working Group onthe Strengthening of the United Nations System. Byfocusing attention on the institutional aspects and23operations of the United Nations  the outcome of theWorking Group represents an indispensable input to theoverall programme of reform. The two-track programme ofreform submitted to us by the Secretary General adds  inour view  a comprehensive and useful thrust in the reformand transformation of this world body. My delegation looksforward to participating in the consultations that arenecessary to carry through these proposals during thissession.We welcome  too  the conclusion of negotiations onAn Agenda for Development. We need a strong UnitedNations in development — a United Nations that isefficient  effective  relevant  able and well-resourced  torespond to the many needs of Member States. Such anOrganization  however  cannot exist without meaningfulprogress in the other areas of reform. We therefore look forsome tangible progress in the work of the Working Groupson An Agenda for Peace  on Security Council reform andon the financial situation of the United Nations during thecurrent session.Last year my delegation observed that Malawi did notbelieve that the Working Groups that we had establishedwere open-ended in time. We continue to hold this view.We need to seize the opportunity for change when the timeis ripe. While a time-frame may not be imposed  we believethe time for change for the Organization is now  as weapproach the next millennium. Progress in the threeremaining Working Groups will make complete the changesthat we all seek for the Organization.It is now over three years since the dawn of truedemocracy in Malawi. The Government of Malawicontinues to work towards consolidation of goodgovernance and respect for human rights. We seek to builda Malawi that is democratic and economically viable.Malawi has made commendable efforts to improve thepromotion  protection and enforcement of human rights. Anumber of independent institutions for the protection andpromotion of human rights are now in place.Let me also note that Malawi has acceded to the majorinternational human rights instruments. With regard to theSecond Optional Protocol to the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights aiming at the Abolition of theDeath Penalty  the Government has decided to hold nationalconsultations on whether or not the death penalty should beabolished. The initiative  whose modalities are beingworked out  has received wide publicity. In this regard  Iwish to register Malawi’s appreciation for the offer ofassistance by Amnesty International to facilitate theseconsultations. In the meantime  our President  HisExcellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi  has announced a stay untilthe outcome of the national consultations is known.With respect to the combat of illicit trafficking innarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  Malawi hasacceded to the 1988 Convention  and activities are underway to put in place an effective administrative machineryto coordinate the activities of government departmentsand civil society. We expect to establish a nationalcommission on drug control as a focal point for internaland international activities  including the promotion ofcooperation within the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) region in the fight against drug-trafficking. Malawi would greatly appreciate anyassistance from the international community  including theUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme  toimprove our own and the region’s ability to deal with thedrug problem.We continue to make strides in socio-economicdevelopment. Against the background of prudenteconomic management  we have succeeded in arrestingrising inflation and the stagnation in industry andconstruction as well as the total loss of confidence in thebusiness sector. Although the situation is currentlymanageable  we are the first to realize that much moreneeds to be done. Like many other small countries  oureconomy continues to weather stormy turbulence causedby many exogenous factors. Drought has wrought havocin the region in recent years. According to the currentforecast  this season the region will experience yetanother drought. Poverty continues to be the main sourceof concern. There is no doubt that democracy in Malawihas engendered massive expectations among the people especially after having lived in an atmosphere ofdeprivation for decades. The level of expectation hasgenerated insurmountable pressure on the limitedresources which the Government has at its disposal.As a developing country  and one of the leastdeveloped among them  we are not yet able to mobilizeadequate resources to accomplish all our nationaldevelopment programmes. Recurrent drought in thesouthern Africa region this decade  the weak economicbase of the country  which is almost exclusivelyagricultural  a rather unbalanced social infrastructure which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited fromthe previous regime  and the problem of disease including HIV/AIDS  pose a serious threat to our nascentdemocracy. A combination of these domestic as well asother factors of an international character bear the24frightening potential of reversing the noble gains we havemade over the past three years.Despite these adverse forces  the Government isdetermined to broaden the economic base of our country.Political stability now obtaining in the country has createda conducive atmosphere for foreign investment. Malawi hasabolished all retrogressive legislation which hindered bothdomestic and foreign investment. The economy has beenliberalized  and a number of incentives have beenintroduced for potential investors. Measures include acomprehensive privatization programme.In a further effort to tackle the root cause of povertyin my country  our Government has instituted measureswhich seek to empower the common person  includingyouth  and women. Free primary education was introducedin 1994 to develop our human resources. This is coupledwith the provision of free tuition at secondary school forthe girl child. The aim of the Malawi Government is todouble the average literacy rate by 1999.The efforts and impact of globalization are well-knownto us all. Malawi cannot go it alone in the implementationof its development programmes. International cooperationamong all nations in all sectors of human endeavour is nolonger an option  but necessary for the very existence andsurvival of humankind. The truth of this proposition is veryapparent and clear today  particularly in the areas ofenvironment  development and international peace andsecurity.We in Malawi recognize the importance of protectingthe environment for the sustainable livelihood of all thepeople. The Government of Malawi participated in thenineteenth special session of the General Assembly  devotedto the overall review and appraisal of the implementation ofAgenda 21  held in this very Hall from 23 to 27 June 1997.We trust that having candidly taken stock of the state ofimplementation of Agenda 21  and taking into account theshortfall at mid-decade  the international community willnow redouble its efforts to fulfil its commitments in thenext five years and beyond. The common and differentiatedresponsibilities that were agreed upon at the Earth Summitregarding the protection and preservation of theenvironment in order to achieve sustainable developmentwere reaffirmed and accentuated  once again underscoringthe importance of international cooperation. We will playour part in the protection of the environment for the benefitof present and future generations.The critical socio-economic situation of Africacontinues to be an area of priority concern to us. Morethan one year after the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa  the situation still leavessomething to be desired — though there are  of course some hopeful signs for improvement. We findgratification in the fact that African ownership of Africandevelopment is becoming a reality. We look forward tothe consolidation of a global partnership for Africa.Malawi appreciates the assistance that it receives from thedonor community. There is absolutely no doubt thatincreased international assistance and initiatives for debtrelief or cancellation  increased official developmentassistance to meet agreed targets  private capital flows increased foreign direct investment  and improved termsof trade would play a catalytic role in Africa’s efforts toachieve economic development. The remarkable progressachieved in the areas of regional integration and South-South cooperation gives us hope. Africa is indeed not ahopeless case. A genuine partnership in development andfinance is  therefore  imperative.The demise of the cold war rekindled all ouraspirations for lasting global peace and prosperity. Thehighly symbolic tumbling down of the Berlin Wallheightened expectations for a peace dividend.Unfortunately  the situation has not improved. Today  theUnited Nations continues to utilize most of its resourcesin managing or containing conflicts of varying origins andintensity. The role of the Organization in the maintenanceof international peace and security has become morerelevant than before. The situations in Angola  Burundi the Republic of the Congo  the Great Lakes Region Sierra Leone  Western Sahara  Afghanistan  Bosnia andHerzegovina and the Middle East  among many others continue to occupy the work of this Organization.It certainly should be possible to resolve many ofthese problems that beset the world so that the UnitedNations can rechannel its efforts towards promoting themost refreshing aspects of the human experience. Andthere are many examples where the human spirit hastriumphed over forces of doom and despair.Developments in Liberia and in the Democratic Republicof the Congo are among the most recent examples.We congratulate the people of Liberia on choosingthe way of peace. The role played by the United NationsObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)  by theEconomic Community of West African States MonitoringGroup  and by other international observers in theLiberian peace and electoral processes once again25demonstrates that a global partnership for the maintenanceof international peace and security can succeed and isperhaps the only way forward.Democracy  transparent and accountable governanceand the protection and promotion of human rights andfundamental freedoms are necessary for successful people-centred development to take place in our countries. It isunfortunate  though  that there are some around us todaywho believe that they can continue to deprive their ownpeople of their birth rights and freedoms. We deeply regretthat in Sierra Leone a military junta that usurped powerfrom a democratically elected Government is still holdingon  in spite of the international community’s opposition.Malawi calls upon the junta to hand over power to thedemocratically elected Government and President Kabbahso that the people of Sierra Leone can experience the peacethat has eluded them for so long.The situation in Burundi continues to be as depressingas it was last year. We remain convinced that there is noalternative to freedom and democracy. We strongly urge thepeople of Burundi to set aside their differences andnegotiate so that they may put in place a Government thatwould bring that country once again to normalcy.My Government has followed closely developments inthe painstaking peace process for Angola. We have admiredthe magnanimity of the Government of Angola in fulfillingits obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and relatedagreements. We on the other hand regret the continuedintransigence of Dr. Jonas Savimbi and his National Unionfor the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Whilesupporting wholeheartedly the Security Council resolutionson the situation in Angola  we make an earnest appeal tothe UNITA leadership to fulfil its obligations in the peaceprocess without further delay so that the people of Angolaand the entire southern African region may realize theirdesire for a peaceful and prosperous future.We similarly regret the recent developments in theRepublic of the Congo. We appeal to all the major playersin this senseless struggle to exercise restraint and amicablyresolve their differences. The Congolese people definitelydeserve much better.We note with growing concern the apparent lack ofmeaningful progress in the implementation of the settlementplan for Western Sahara. Malawi applauds the indefatigableefforts of the United Nations in its search for a lastingsolution to Western Sahara. It is our sincere hope that therecent appointment by the Secretary-General of Mr. JamesBaker as his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara will helpin the resolution of that problem. We call upon the mainactors to honour their obligations without further delay.My delegation is gravely concerned aboutdevelopments in the Middle East. A few years back  wehailed the Middle East peace process as having acquiredirreversible momentum. Malawi strongly believes thatthere is no alternative to the peace process launched inMadrid on 10 October 1991; there is no cogent alternativeto this process for genuine peace and stability in theMiddle East. However  recent developments haveobviously shown that any provocative moves by any ofthe parties concerned will not help the process. We appealfor the utmost restraint and the quick resumption ofnegotiations.My Government is similarly pleased to note that thetwo Governments on the Korean peninsula are workingtogether  although in a limited sense. It is our hope thatthis is a starting point from which a lasting solution to theexisting tensions on the peninsula will be realized.In recent years the world has made major strides inthe field of disarmament. The adoption last year of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was indeed amajor breakthrough for all peace-loving nations. ForMalawi  however  the recent adoption of the Conventionon the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction stands out as most significant. Our resolve toroot out an evil that has adversely affected the lives ofmany in the world shall remain undeterred. The supportgarnered for the Convention within a short period of timeis a clear sign of what human beings can achieve whenworking together for a common goal. We welcome theConvention and look forward to its universal acceptance.The United Nations today stands at the threshold ofa new millennium. We pray that it continues to play itsrightful role in the many issues that occupy us all in oureveryday life. As we approach the twenty-first century the relevance of the United Nations in enhancinginternational cooperation in all areas of human endeavouris  to us  no longer a matter of doubt but reality. Webelieve that the reforms we all desire will harness thegains already made in the area of internationalcooperation. We all seek a United Nations that respondseffectively and efficiently to the needs of all people.Let me reaffirm the commitment of the Governmentand the people of Malawi to the noble goals and ideals of26the United Nations  an institution that continues to make adifference for humankind. We will continue to make ourmodest contribution to this intergovernmental process  forwhich we find no credible or viable alternative to its serviceto “We the peoples of the United Nations”."
"118",4988,"MYS",52,1997,"﻿Allow me at the outset  Sir to congratulate you on your election as President of thefifty-second session of the General Assembly. We have nodoubt that under your able stewardship this session willsuccessfully address the many and complex issuesconfronting the Assembly and the Organization.May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  and to say howproud we Malaysians are of the manner in which he guidedthe work of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.Malaysia is honoured by the opportunity given him to servethis Assembly and is deeply grateful for the support hereceived from Member States  the Secretariat and othermembers of the international community in the discharge ofhis duties.I would also like to acknowledge the tireless efforts ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who sinceassuming office less than nine months ago has swiftlybegun to energize and revitalize this Organization throughhis proposals for change and reform. We wish him everysuccess in these efforts  for which we extend our fullcooperation and support.The general debate of this Assembly is the only trulyuniversal forum where leaders representing diversesovereign countries and their peoples are able to articulatevery freely their views  without fear or favour. Given themonopoly of international information and communicationby vested interests  the value of this Assembly as a forumfor the free expression of differing views by leadersrepresenting the sovereign Member States cannot beoverstated. As an annual debate which serves the purposeof bringing to the attention of the international communitythe priority issues of concern to sovereign Member States it cannot be replaced.Today  I am privileged to have the benefit of thisforum to share with Members the priority issues of concernto Malaysia. Let me begin with a matter of immediateconcern to us and to a number of other Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries  whichexperienced the severe effects of the turmoil in currencyand stock markets in recent weeks. Stock prices plungedwhile our national currencies depreciated  exacting a heavytoll on economic growth and development. The sequence ofevents did not take place as a result of war  conflict  naturaldisaster or mismanagement. It was precipitated bycurrency speculators - indeed  manipulators - who  drivenby sheer greed  took advantage of the vulnerabilities ofdeveloping economies  especially the fragility of theirnascent financial markets.What happened in South-East Asia could  of course occur in other parts of the world which are increasinglydependent on capital flows for economic growth. Suchrampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in thecurrency and equity markets of developing countries  ata time when they are still feeling their way in a world offierce global competition  would trigger off a defensivereflex on the part of the affected countries  therebyarousing anti-liberalization  which would be detrimentalto free trade.In an interdependent world  the currency crisis inSouth-East Asia warrants the prompt action of themultilateral financial institutions  such as the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund  and the developedcountries  which should assist the affected economies ofEast Asia in overcoming the effects of this excessivemanipulation and in preventing its recurrence. Theirpositive response in this regard is especially important inorder to maintain the developed countries’ continuedcommitment to  and confidence in  globalization  onwhich so much of international free trade depends.Threats to the well-being of States take many formsand can come from within as well as from outside. Thesethreats  including the notion of erosion of sovereignty have been facilitated by the advent of technology. TheSecretary-General alluded to this development in hisreport on the work of this Organization  where herecognized that the same technological means that fosterglobalization and the transnational expansion of civilsociety also provide the infrastructure for expandingglobal networks of “uncivil society” - organized crime drug-traffickers  money-launderers and terrorists.We live in a time when it has become fashionable in some quarters  to distinguish between the security of aState and individual security  especially in the context ofdeveloping regions of the world. The perception has beencreated that the concept of security of the State issomehow inimical to the rights of the individual in thedeveloping world  and this has been highlighted in thecontext of human rights. The elevation of the importanceof human rights in the international agenda  a mostwelcome development  has been exploited and politicizedfor narrow self-serving interests and specific political10agendas. If our interest is to heap scorn and to indulge indouble standards  selectivity and mutual recrimination  thenoble cause of promoting the universal value of humanrights is bound to suffer. Blatant violations of humanrights — whether in Bosnia and Herzegovina  occupiedterritories of the Arabs and Palestinians or in other parts ofthe world — must be condemned and prevented  and nothave a blind eye turned to them  if the United Nations is toplay an effective role in promoting and protecting theserights.As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998 consideration needs to be given to a review of relevanthuman rights documents and their applications. We mustrededicate ourselves to the need for a balanced approach toall aspects of human rights — civil  political  social economic and cultural. Selective interpretation orapplication of human rights will not only demean theirvalue but  more seriously  undermine the well-being ofindividuals in parts of the world that are still engulfed byage-old hatreds and animosities. We should reiterate ourrecognition of cultural peculiarities  which is an inherentand timeless characteristic of human society. We shouldassert that there is no intrinsic contradiction between therights of the individual and those of the community.Individual rights do not exist in a vacuum. Indeed individual and community rights are not mutually exclusive;they thrive on the basis of a mutually reinforcing andbalanced relationship. As one reinforces the other  thereshould be no artificial separation between the two bystressing the importance of one at the expense of the other.Malaysia welcomes the appointment of Mrs. MaryRobinson  former President of Ireland  as the new HighCommissioner for Human Rights  and hopes that  togetherwith the United Nations Secretary-General  she will be ableto improve the United Nations human rights machinery androle  including the depoliticization of human rights and thetimely and full implementation of the right to development.The United Nations remains  as the Secretary-Generalhas put it “the only institution that has the breadth of mandate toaddress the root causes of instability and conflict andto pursue in a comprehensive and integrated mannerthe wide array of economic  social and environmentalissues impinging on development.” (A/51/950  para.128)We must therefore be wary of those seeking to exploitspecific issues designed to marginalize the Organization.More than 50 years after its creation  the pre-eminence ofthe United Nations in multilateral issues can no longer betaken for granted  despite its universal membership andbroad mandates dealing with all issues of peace  security disarmament and development.The commitment of the United Nations todevelopment remains its most significant role. While theOrganization’s forays into peacekeeping make all theheadlines  it is its work in development  in terms ofresources generated and the changes made in peoples’lives  that is most vital and meaningful to Member States.It has become clear that while the eradication of povertyand the enhancement of development are theresponsibilities of individual States  the United Nationssystem has a key conceptual and promotional role to play.The ultimate objective — to secure the developmentof developing countries — remains the same. We need toconstantly re-examine the means by which to attain thisgoal. The United Nations must strongly project the needfor higher levels of growth  accelerated development  andequitable geographical distribution of growth. In thiscontext  we need to ensure that our approach todevelopment takes into account the economic  politicaland technological realities of our time  especially theincreasing influence of the private sector.Regrettably  resources made available fordevelopment have declined substantially in recent years adversely affecting the various United Nationsprogrammes and agencies concerned. Culpability mustrest with those who had promised to assist but failed todeliver. In the light of such a disappointing let-down  theUnited Nations should explore the possibilities for closercooperation with other stakeholders  particularly thecorporate sectors.With their vast resources  expertise  financial cloutand extensive global networking  those in the privatesector should be welcomed as partners to operationalizecertain aspects of sustainable development. They could for example  provide assistance on environmentally soundtechnologies where Governments have left a void. TheUnited Nations should ensure that it involves the privatesector from all over the world. However  it must alsoensure that it will not be dominated by the interests of the11business community  by holding the corporate actorsaccountable.The United Nations must continue to be a democraticinstitution  accountable to all its Members. Unfortunately this cornerstone of the Organization continues to be assailedby those still bent on the quest for geopolitical dominance.In an increasingly unipolar world it is imperative that theUnited Nations preserve its independence or autonomy anddecide in the interests of all Member States  not just thoseof a particular Member State or group of States.The process of the democratization of the UnitedNations is particularly important in the context of thereform of the Organization  especially that of the SecurityCouncil  which is long overdue. Malaysia supports an earlyresolution of the issue. Ambassador Razali Ismail  in hiscapacity as President of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly and as Chairman of the high-level working groupon the reform and restructuring of the Security Council tried his best to move the process forward.Concerted efforts must continue to be made to ensurethat  since the Council’s permanent members cannot beabolished  its continued existence must reflect currentrealities  in particular the significant role of the developingcountries in international affairs. At the same time  as amatter of principle  there should be no discrimination ordifferentiation between the old and the new permanentmembers. If reform of the Council is to be trulycomprehensive and consistent with the spirit and realities ofour time  then we must seek to remove — or at least  as afirst step  restrict — the use of the veto power. Democracyin the United Nations is a mockery if the voice of themajority is rendered meaningless by the narrow interests ofa dominant few.Malaysia believes that genuine global peace andsecurity and the survival of mankind can only be assured ina world free of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  remains aforemost priority of the global community  and we urge theSecretary-General to reaffirm his support —notwithstanding his preoccupation with certain aspects ofproliferation issues  particularly small arms.We are deeply concerned over the trend in somequarters to ignore the need to stop vertical proliferation. Weurge the international community to expedite efforts toachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons  to beformalized in a nuclear weapons convention. We hope thatthe new and reconstituted Department of Disarmament andArms Regulation will place as high a priority ondisarmament as it does on proliferation of weapons andarms regulation. For its part  like a number of otherregional groups  has positively contributed to thedisarmament process by bringing into force the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone  which still awaitsthe support of the nuclear-weapon States.While we stress the importance of non-proliferation real progress in disarmament will only be achieved byaddressing the issue in all its aspects. While nations thataspire to become nuclear Powers should disavow theirintentions  the declared nuclear Powers  which are alsothe world’s largest arms traders  should also embark onthe road towards general and complete disarmament. Inthis regard  we laud the global initiative to ban landmines and call on the producers of these mines to help defraydemining and rehabilitation costs in the affected countries.International peace and security continues to bethreatened by the deteriorating situation in the MiddleEast following the waning of the peace initiative in theMiddle East. Mutual distrust has replaced the synergy forpeace as the modus operandi between Israel and thePalestinian Authority. Malaysia supports the call for theimmediate resumption of peace talks and affirms itssupport for the Palestinian people and their inalienableright to self-determination.We urge the international community to persuade orpressure Israel to honour its part of the Oslo accords bylifting the ban on Palestinian cities and towns  and to giveup its intention to build settlements in what are occupiedterritories. We are further alarmed by Israel’s decision tobuild a dam in the occupied Golan Heights. We view thisas a deliberate act of provocation and bad faith  andquestion its sincerity in seeking genuine and enduringpeace with its Arab neighbours.In the meantime  the international community shouldcontinue to provide the necessary financial support toameliorate the plight of the Palestinians — for example through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency forPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  to whichmy Government has made its modest contribution overthe years  in addition to our own bilateral assistance toPalestine. It is important that UNWRA be provided withadequate resources to fully implement its programmes andactivities.We remain seriously concerned over the situation inBosnia and Herzegovina. Obstacles continue to impede12the full implementation of the Dayton peace accord.Further  mutual mistrust and animosity among the differentethnic groups cast doubts over the future of the country. Itis our fear that the withdrawal of the international forcesfrom that country could trigger a new wave of violence andbloodshed. This fear is real  particularly since indicted warcriminals  who should have been removed from the scenelong ago  are still at large and exercising power andinfluence.Malaysia believes that creating an environment of trustand understanding among the peoples of Bosnia andHerzegovina is a priority. The international communityshould make efforts to promote goodwill among theBosnians and encourage them to live in peace and harmony.One such initiative could take the form of informal round-table conferences  participated in by Bosnians of all ethnicorigins  representing the different sectors of society andprofessions  including academia  and participants from othercountries  to discuss all issues of ethnic relations with theview to enhancing understanding and cooperation amongthem.It is my hope that from this effort will emerge asizeable group of leaders from various professions  actingas catalysts for the promotion of goodwill and cooperationamong the ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Malaysia is prepared to work with like-minded countries tohelp realize this idea. We have to ensure that peace andstability endure in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that wecontribute in the efforts towards its early reconstruction. Atthe same time  we must all work to bring justice back tothe Balkan region by ensuring that just retribution is metedout to those who participated in some of the worst atrocitiesof this century.As we approach the twenty-first century  our energiesand preoccupation must centre on building andstrengthening peace and prosperity. Peace and security aretwo sides of the same coin: peace nurtures prosperity  whileprosperity reinforces peace. Peace at the national level issustained through democracy  good governance and closecollaboration between the different segments of society.Malaysia  a multiracial and multi-religious society which less than a month ago observed its fortiethanniversary  has been blessed with peace and prosperity.While this may partly be due to fortuitous circumstances a lot of it has to do with an effective leadership and apeople determined to improve their lot. It is fortunate thatwe have been able to rule the country by the process of theballot and not the bullet  with regular free and fair electionsand with the different races accommodating and sharingpower on the basis of democratic principles.By engendering social and racial harmony based ona political compact  we have been spared many of thetraumas experienced by less fortunate countries and wewere thus able to achieve our development goals inrelative peace and tranquillity. I am happy to say that wehave been able to share some of our experience in nation-building with a number of our friends in the developingworld.In spite of the many criticisms levelled at the UnitedNations — some of them not entirely justified — thismuch maligned Organization of ours has remainedsteadfast in its mission to serve the internationalcommunity  even as its resources have been dwindling inrecent years. Clearly  in an ever-changing world that isgrowing more complex and increasingly unipolar  theUnited Nations has served as a pillar of internationalorder. Serving as the collective conscience of humanityand the arbiter of its conflicts  the Organization  despiteits deficiencies  has functioned as an indispensable norm-making and institution-creating instrument of internationalrelations.In my view the process of United Nations bashinghas gone on far too long. While the introspection thatfollowed was inevitable and has had a sobering effect onthe Organization  it is time for us to pick up the piecesand allow the Organization to get on with its mission. Forthis purpose  the Secretary-General has put forward acomprehensive package of reform proposals for which hemust be given a lot of credit. Obviously  such a wide-ranging package by its very nature cannot please everyone of the 185 Members of the Organization. TheSecretary-General has attempted to put together proposalsand strategies that are intended to secure the broadestsupport from Member States predicated on a slate ofshared common goals.Malaysia is supportive of the general thrusts of theSecretary-General’s package of reform proposals. Manyof the highlights of these proposals are indeed interestingand deserve our serious consideration. We support theCabinet-style management approach that the Secretary-General is introducing  revolving around the SeniorManagement Group  as well as his proposal to create thepost of Deputy Secretary-General. We hope that theDeputy Secretary-General will not only assist an alreadyoverburdened Secretary-General in the management of theSecretariat  but would also have substantive responsibility13in overseeing the core area of development which is dear tothe hearts of developing countries.Malaysia also welcomes the measures being taken toincrease and improve coordination between United NationsHeadquarters and its field operations. We also support therationalization of the work of the Organization involvingthe reconstitution or amalgamation of the variousdepartments aimed at consolidating and integrating theirwork so as to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency.We trust that in carrying out the reorganization exercise  theSecretary-General will be guided by the need to ensure thatthe changes will benefit all of the Member States particularly those in the developing world.My delegation will take an active part in the detaileddiscussion of the Secretary-General’s reform proposals inany format that will be agreed upon by Member Stateswhich will facilitate their implementation at an early date.In carrying out these reforms  however  we should not losesight of the importance of the financial health of theOrganization  which has been highlighted by the Secretary-General himself. The proposed revolving credit fund is awelcome measure insofar as it provides financial solvencyin the short term. But it is unfair and unethical that the restof the world is held to ransom by the few who disregardinternational treaties and agreements and Charter provisionsfor the sake of their narrow national interests. We join theSecretary-General in urging Member States to work towardsthe speedy resolution of the financial crisis of the UnitedNations by fulfilling their financial obligations towards theOrganization."
"119",5015,"NAM",52,1997,"﻿I congratulate you  Sir  onyour election as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session. We have no doubt that yourdiplomatic tact will steer the deliberations of thisimportant session to a fruitful conclusion. My delegationwill lend you its full cooperation as you embark on thedifficult task ahead of you.Let me now pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. RazaliIsmail  your predecessor  who conducted our work duringthe fifty-first session in a highly remarkable manner.Our tribute goes also to the former Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his distinguishedleadership during his tenure. We are most grateful to himfor his tireless efforts in upholding the objectives of theOrganization.The present Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan hails from a country that paved the road towards freedomand national independence in our part of the world. Thefirst leader of his country  Mr. Kwame Nkrumah  was amain catalyst in Africa’s fight against colonialdomination. We have no doubt that all these attributes together with his long-standing experience in the affairsof the United Nations  will contribute to the revitalizationand democratization of the Organization. We congratulatehim on his election as Secretary-General  and we assurehim of our full support and cooperation.At the fiftieth session of the General Assembly world leaders recaptured the vision of the foundingfathers of our Organization. They did so in recognition ofthe need to map out the institutional framework andoperational parameters necessary to forge theeffectiveness and continued relevance of the UnitedNations in this ever-changing international arena. It is thatmomentum that must be the driving force in our quest fora reformed  revitalized and democratized United Nations.Reform is a process. As long as the United Nationsexists and the world continues to change  reform will benecessary. Namibia therefore welcomes the Secretary-General’s report of 16 July 1997 on the reform of theUnited Nations. Let me place on record that Namibiawelcomes and supports reform which enhances thecapacity of the United Nations to effectively address thecritical development concerns of developing countries. In4this context  let me emphasize that we attach utmostimportance to the operational activities of the UnitedNations  for they complement our development efforts. Anyreform in this area must strengthen their scope ofexcellence. As the Secretary-General rightly puts it in hisreport on the work of the Organization  “times oftransformation can be times of confusion” [A/52/1  para.20]. Managerial issues  therefore  must not and cannot beconfused with policy matters. We have long recognized thatit is the General Assembly that is best equipped by theCharter to provide the necessary representative leadership.And this authority of the General Assembly my delegationshall seek to uphold.Reform must not be retrogressive. It must continue toenhance and build on those gains we have made over theyears. And  therefore  savings to be realized from reformmeasures should be channelled — and rightly so — to“the Organization’s highest priority  alleviatingpoverty and enhancing the prospects of developingcountries”. [A/51/950  letter of transmittal]The recent reform proposals by the Secretary-General are in our view  part of an ongoing process. We must not resistchange; nor should we lose sight of the long-termimplications of our actions of today. We need to do it now but we must do it right.In his address to the General Assembly  the currentChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) President Robert Mugabe  reiterated the position of theOAU on the reform and democratization of the SecurityCouncil. Let me supplement his remarks by emphasizingthat Namibia is opposed to categories of permanentmembership of the Security Council. As we continue toseek ways and means to reform the Security Council  wemust not replace a speedy process with haste. Hence  theOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the SecurityCouncil should be the forum to search for and reach aconsensus on the matter.What besets the United Nations today is not merely anunmanageable structure. The Organization is subjected tofinancial limitations. Reform cannot supplant the Charterobligation of Member States to honour their financialobligations. Voluntary contributions  therefore  must not beseen as a means to pave the way towards resolving thecurrent financial crisis. My Government welcomes the ideaof the establishment of a revolving credit fund  capitalizedat a level of up to $1 billion through voluntarycontributions or through other appropriate means whichmay be agreed. However  our Organization can executeits mandate to the fullest only when all Member Statesequip it to do so. We all must honour our assessedcontributions in line with international agreements  not inline with unilateral decisions.The creation of a development account is viewed bymy Government as a good idea. However  all mandatedprogrammes and activities should be implemented including reimbursement to troop contributors for UnitedNations peacekeeping operations. Furthermore  anyreduction in posts must not compromise the effectivenessof the United Nations; more important  it must be carriedout on the basis of geographical equity.Since 1996 we have witnessed positive progress inthe field of disarmament. A Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has been concluded  and theChemical Weapons Convention has come into force. Inaddition  an agreement was reached by the parties to theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction to intensifyefforts to negotiate verification provisions. However despite these developments  nuclear weapons and theirproliferation continue to be a cause of concern to theinternational community. With the conclusion of theCTBT  it is still our hope that serious negotiations willbegin on the elimination of nuclear weapons.In this connection  we call upon the nuclear-weaponStates to undertake  within the shortest possible timeframe  to carry out effective nuclear disarmamentmeasures. The total elimination of these weapons is theonly genuine guarantee for non-nuclear-weapon Statesagainst the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.Namibia is among many countries still facing thebitter experience of the effects of landmines  which haveclaimed and continue to claim human lives  and whichpose serious obstacles to the reconstruction anddevelopment process. Thus  we support the internationalcommunity’s move towards a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines and its continuous and tireless effortsacross the globe to clear minefields.In this connection  we welcome the treaty recentlyconcluded in Oslo  Norway  to ban anti-personnellandmines. Namibia is ready to sign the treaty in Ottawa.Let me express our profound gratitude and great5appreciation to those countries which are supportingNamibia’s demining activities  thus enhancing ourdevelopment prospects.Our world is merging into one globally encompassingdynamo of change  or so it is perceived  characterized byinter alia economic integration. Are developing countries tobecome victims or beneficiaries of this process? Suffice itto emphasize that globalization and liberalization are notends in themselves. They are means to greater efficiency higher growth and increased welfare. It is commonknowledge that the much talked about benefits ofglobalization and liberalization of the world economycontinue to elude the majority of developing countries particularly those in Africa. At the same time  while thedebt burden continues to hamper many of the developmentefforts of our economies  official development assistance ison the decline. Instead  new and innovative ideas forgenerating funds for globally agreed commitments andpriorities are being brought into play  some of which areclearly shifting the overall burden of financing developmentto the developing countries which already have limitedfinancial resources.Namibia is strongly of the view that if the twinprocess of globalization and liberalization of the worldeconomy is to benefit all countries  developing countriesmust have free access to world markets without conditions.It should not be a matter of the survival of the fittest. Thelimitations of many of our countries to compete should becompensated for by maintaining preferential treatment ofdeveloping countries.Much has been said about global development trends of Africa’s efforts to carve a larger slice of the worldeconomic cake  of our striving for economic empowermentand competitiveness  of our movement towards regionalintegration and harmonization  and of our efforts to put inplace an enabling environment for trade  investment andcapital flows on a national and regional level.At the same time  at the recent International MonetaryFund Economic Forum it was said that over the decadespanning 1985 to 1995 developing countries increased theirshare of world trade from 23 per cent to 29 per cent. Theyalso diversified their trade linkages in response to majorchanges in trade and exchange regimes in the direction ofmore outward-looking and open policies.While it is stated that developing countries have morethan doubled their real per capita income over the last 30years  in reality only Asia has made relative progress; thus the gap in living standards between the advancedeconomies and Africa continues to widen.The distribution of gains from increases in both tradeand foreign direct investment remains very skewed  witha few getting the most. Africa still participates in worldtrade with foreign direct investment flows of less than 4per cent.Therefore  as we continue to welcome the brightprojected global outlook  we should not lose sight of thewide divergence across nations and regions. Today  formany African nations  global optimism coexists with localpessimism. There is a need  then  to open and expand oureconomies  to increase our competitiveness  to empowerour people and to improve their well-being. To this end the international community should support Africa’s needto effectively participate in multilateral trade discussions with a strengthened capacity for negotiations in suchforums. Full implementation of the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa is one effectiveway of addressing Africa’s limited capacity to takeadvantage of the global outlook.We in the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) have long recognized that the pathto globalization is regional integration. To equalize powerrelationships in the global setting  regional integration isa strategic imperative. To this end  all the members ofSADC have embarked upon a common strategy topromote the region as an attractive trading and investmentpartner  and they are actively working towards: deepereconomic cooperation and integration on the basis ofbalance  equity and mutual respect  providing for cross-border investment  trade and movement of productionfactors and services; common economic  political andsocial value systems  enhancing entrepreneurship competitiveness  democracy  good governance  rule oflaw  human rights and the eradication of poverty; andstrengthened regional solidarity  peace and security.While admittedly our region has not yet attracted ahigh share of foreign direct investment  political andeconomic risks have greatly reduced over the past years and increasing trade and investment flows are beingwitnessed.Namibia  as a member of SADC  believes in theregion’s potential  the opportunities for joint developmentand the power of collective advocacy. This will enhanceefforts towards the ideals and objectives of the AfricanEconomic Community. Together we can strengthen our6productivity and competitiveness in the global economy. Bypooling our resources and skills  we can create a far greatermarket for all of us than any of our nations has.For the accelerated development process of developingcountries to take place  a strong industrial base isindispensable. In this regard  we continue to underscore therole of the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization (UNIDO)  which is an agency with a clear vital and indispensable mission. UNIDO has successfullycarried out its reform  and this should be recognized andsupported. At this juncture  let me express Namibia’s greatappreciation to the Government of the United Kingdom forits decision to rejoin UNIDO. We have no doubt that thisexemplary decision will be rightly emulated by otherMember States.This year during the month of June major events werewitnessed here at the United Nations. The adoption of theAgenda for Development and the review and appraisal ofthe implementation of Agenda 21 are cases in point. Weview the outcome of these two events as complementary.Neither replaces the other. The commitments we made inRio remain valid and need full — not selective —implementation.The United Nations has a major role to play inpromoting international cooperation. It took the Ad HocOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on anAgenda for Development four years to reach consensus.Mobilization of resources for its implementation is of theutmost importance  for those who are to benefit from itcannot wait another four years. Development must be oneof the centrepieces of United Nations activities. In thiscontext  we welcome the proposal to appoint a DeputySecretary-General. In our view the Deputy Secretary-General should concentrate on United Nations developmentactivities.Namibia is one of those countries seriously affected bydesertification and drought. In a few days  the firstConference of the Parties to the United Nations Conventionto Combat Desertification in Those Countries ExperiencingSerious Drought and/or Desertification  Particularly inAfrica  will take place in Rome. We underscore the utmostimportance of establishing an independent financialmechanism to make arrangements conducive to theimplementation of this Convention. To this end  we lookforward with great expectation to the outcome of the firstConference of the Parties.Namibia supports the establishment of aninternational criminal court  with its jurisdiction beinglimited to “hard-core crimes”: crimes of genocide  seriousviolations of the laws and customs applicable in armedconflict and crimes against humanity. The principle ofcomplementarity should be clearly spelled out in thestatute. The international criminal court must complementand not supplant national criminal jurisdictions. A balancebetween the international criminal court and the nationaljurisdictions will therefore have to be struck in order tomake the international criminal court fully functional.We are two years from the end of this century andthe beginning of a new millennium. We have theopportunity to reflect on how we have fared in elevatingthe human race to greater heights. In this context  myGovernment would like to congratulate both Mrs. MaryRobinson  the new High Commissioner for HumanRights  and Mr. Olara Otunnu  the Secretary-General’sSpecial Representative to study the impact of armedconflict on children. Both of them have challengingresponsibilities to assist Member States in very importantbut difficult tasks.In 1998 we will commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The Government and people of Namibia haveembraced the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsinasmuch as our Constitution embodies those principlesand values that we were denied for so long and that wewill cherish and pass on to new generations to come.Furthermore  1998 will mark the fifth anniversary of theWorld Conference on Human Rights. This will be a timeto reflect and to rededicate ourselves to our collectiveresponsibility to save successive generations from thescourge of massive and grave human rights violations.It is also our responsibility to redouble our effortstowards the implementation of the Declaration on theRight to Development as well as to pay equal attention tothe implementation of economic  social and culturalrights.No country has been spared the onslaught of drugtrafficking and the alarming geographical spread oforganized crime in its various forms. This undermines ourdevelopment process and threatens human rights andfundamental freedoms  and thus causes regression in thequality of our lives. In this context  my Governmentsupports the convening of the special session of theGeneral Assembly on the question of drugs next year.This will provide the international community with an7ample opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to combatthis global problem.Time and again we have all affirmed the link betweenpeace and development. In this context  we are pleased thatthe United Nations has decided to discuss the concept ofthe “culture of peace” during this session of the GeneralAssembly. We support the current efforts before the UnitedNations for a comprehensive strategy to be adopted towardsthis end.My delegation remains deeply perturbed by thesituation in Angola. In this regard  we feel strongly that thephasing out of a United Nations presence in Angola musthinge on the situation on the ground. The United NationsObserver Mission in Angola was established to keep thepeace in that country. It should not break the fragile peacethrough premature withdrawal. In this respect  thecommitment of the parties to the full and unconditionalimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol is paramount.UNITA must therefore rise above the present impasse tocontribute to a final and lasting solution to the problem inAngola.We commend the Secretary-General’s efforts in theRepublic of Congo  and we are keeping our hopes alive fora speedy resolution to that problem.We welcome the new Government in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  and we call upon the internationalcommunity to render all necessary assistance to theGovernment and people of that country as they embark onthe road to national reconciliation and reconstruction.After seven years of tragic civil war in Liberia  mydelegation hails the peace which has finally dawned in thatcountry. It is our hope that it will be a lasting peace. Wesalute the people of Liberia for their good sense. Peacecannot sustain itself. It is therefore incumbent upon theinternational community to support the Government andpeople of Liberia in their national reconciliation andreconstruction efforts to keep and consolidate peace andstability.Our hearts bleed when we consider the situation thathas unfolded in Sierra Leone  which has been responsiblefor the regression of the reconstruction efforts in thatcountry. The Government of the Republic of Namibiacondemned the coup d’état in Sierra Leone then and doesso now. Namibia calls for the continued isolation of themilitary regime in that country. We therefore welcome theappointment of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General.We note with satisfaction the progress made duringthe recent negotiations between the parties on WesternSahara. We encourage them to continue to search for afinal solution to that problem. We reiterate our call forthe early exercise by the Sahraoui people of their right toself-determination on the basis of a free  fair andtransparent referendum in Western Sahara  under the jointsupervision and control of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU).We reiterate the concern of the OAU about theconflict between Libya and the United States of Americaand the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie tragedy.While we regret the loss of life as a result of this tragedy other innocent people continue to suffer as a result of thesubsequent sanctions imposed on Libya. We call for anurgent solution to this problem.The Government of Namibia has reiterated on manyoccasions that the United States of America and theRepublic of Cuba should start to walk the distance of 90miles towards reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. Wehoped to see our aspirations come about. However  theseaspirations are being shattered by the new escalation inthe economic  commercial and financial embargo againstCuba through the application of the Helms-Burton Act.Notwithstanding this  we shall keep our hopes alive.The construction of new settlements in the occupiedterritories of Palestine is not conducive to peace in theMiddle East. We therefore call on the Governmentauthorities in Israel to desist from such acts. Peace in theMiddle East is in the interest of all parties concerned. Wecall on the parties to resume negotiations.Let me conclude by stating the obvious: Peace ischeaper than war. Let us all unite our efforts to make theworld a haven of peace."
"120",5060,"NER",52,1997,"﻿Onbehalf of the delegation of Niger  I should like Sir  toexpress my warm congratulations on your unanimouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session. We regard your election as a justtribute to your country  the Republic of Ukraine  whosecommitment to the ideals of our Organization is wellknown.I would also like to congratulate the other members ofthe Bureau  who I am convinced will help you in theaccomplishment of your delicate mission.In addition  I wish to express to your predecessor Mr. Razali Ismail  our deep appreciation for the remarkablework he did during his presidency.To Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  may I express my Government's full supportand brotherly encouragement for the commendable actionhe is carrying out in order to promote greater cooperationbetween our peoples and nations in order to build a worldof peace and progress.Once again  Niger is pleased to take part in a sessionof the General Assembly  which is an ideal framework forthe Member States of our Organization to debate  in aspirit of partnership  complex matters affecting the destinyof humanity.We must all agree that over its 52 years of existencethe United Nations has gained a more than honourablerecord in achieving its purposes  especially in the areas ofpeacekeeping  decolonization  and the promotion of  andrespect for  human rights  as well as in the search forglobal solutions to the major problems of our times —development  the environment  population and theprotection of women and children  to mention just a few.The immense work accomplished so far is above allthe result of our capacity to work together in our commoninterest and in the interest of future generations. Nigertherefore believes that international cooperation  which isthe basis of these major achievements  must bestrengthened  because it is the source of stability andprogress.The maintenance of international peace and security the primary purpose of our Organization  deserveseveryone's special attention at a time when theinternational community  with the cold war finally ended is getting down to establishing a new world order thatstrictly respects the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter.Niger welcomes the report presented by the Secretary-General last July on the reform of our Organization. Wesupport this process and hope that it will provide synergy giving the means and flexibility indispensable for theOrganization if it is to meet the numerous challenges itfaces at the dawn of the third millennium.My delegation believes too that the Security Councilmust be reformed in order to make it more effective  givenits responsibilities in the sphere of collective security. Inparticular  such reform must address the expansion of theCouncil on the basis of the principles of equitablegeographical distribution and of the sovereign equality ofStates.In the same vein  we consider that better handling ofthe emergencies that constantly arise in so many placesmust include an improvement in the Organization's capacityto deploy peacekeeping forces in a timely fashion wherevernecessary.Let me express Niger's deep concern at the conflictsand tensions in Africa and in the Middle East. Turning firstto Africa  we note with distress that internal confrontationsand disruptions are the main cause of the politicalinstability in some countries and of the massive movementsof refugees that are at the root of a tragic humanitariancrisis. Niger has a deep commitment to peace  and mustonce again urge the warring parties in the States concernedto renounce violence and engage in productive dialogue tofind solutions to their disputes  thus restoring stability totheir respective countries.I take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tributeto the people of Liberia  who after seven years of cruel waraccepted the peace plan proposed by the States members ofthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS). The Liberian people's will for peace is clearlyreflected in their respect for the ceasefire and  above all  inthe 19 July national elections  which were conducted in anatmosphere of calm and openness. I am pleased to paytribute to the valuable role played by our great brothercountry  Nigeria  in the process of restoring peace toLiberia.In Congo (Brazzaville)  we hail the tireless efforts ofneighbouring African countries  of the Organization ofAfrican Unity and of the United Nations to calm thesituation. More than ever  that crisis highlights the urgentneed to create an African peacekeeping force. I can todayassure the Assembly that my country is fully prepared tocontribute to the establishment of such a force  as it didin the cases of Rwanda  Burundi and Liberia.Turning to the situation in Western Sahara  mycountry welcomes the recent agreement by the twoparties; we hope that the referendum will take place inconditions of peace and calm.To promote peace and security in the Middle East the international community must pay sustained attentionto the tension in the occupied Palestinian territories which has been steadily rising since the IsraeliGovernment decision to build a new settlement inoccupied East Jerusalem. That Israeli decision endangersthe peace process that began in Madrid on the basis ofSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and425 (1978) and on the basis of the principle of land forpeace.In the face of that Israeli Government position  theinternational community has no choice but to redouble itsefforts to secure dialogue and  above all  justice — whichform the foundation of a peaceful future in the MiddleEast  along with the necessary exercise by the Palestinianpeople of its inalienable rights  including the right to theestablishment of an independent State  and scrupulousrespect for agreements reached between the IsraeliGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization onthe basis of the relevant Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions.Since its creation  the United Nations has alwaysgiven high priority to disarmament  and in particular tothe elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons ofmass destruction. There has been good progress on thisissue with the conclusion of a number of internationalinstruments  the most notable of which  in our view  arethe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the Chemical Weapons Convention and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Niger is deeplyconvinced that disarmament is an essential element in themaintenance of international peace and security and hasacceded to those important agreements  which are aimedat preventing the development of nuclear weapons and ofother weapons of mass destruction.My country is keenly aware also of other  no lessimportant  issues relating to illegal trafficking in smallarms and to a complete ban on the anti-personnel minesthat constitute a harsh scourge that continues to inflictunspeakable human suffering.2Civil wars and political upheaval in Africa havefostered the proliferation of illicit weapons. To collect andmonitor weapons illicitly held by individuals  Niger hasjoined the United Nations and several neighbouringcountries to take wide-ranging action against this scourge.On the domestic level  we created in 1994 a nationalcommission for the collection and monitoring of illicitweapons.My country is genuinely pleased also at the existenceof regional disarmament initiatives  some of which have ledto the conclusion of arrangements such as the Treaty on theDenuclearization of Africa.In our view  it is essential to benefit from the climateof confidence and cooperation now prevailing on theinternational scene to give new impetus to multilateralnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament. That is theonly way to make progress towards building a safer world which is a legitimate aspiration of all our peoples.The tragic effects of poverty in a large number ofcountries merely exacerbate instability in the world.Despite the remarkable progress made in recent yearsin the economic and social fields  following theimplementation of structural economic reforms  Africaremains in many respects a region where poverty hasincreased spectacularly. On this continent are found themajority of countries with the lowest indices with respectto human development.For this reason  as a Sahelian country  we feel that thereform process proposed by the Secretary-General muststrengthen the role of the United Nations and its functionsin development matters  making priorities of reducingpoverty and strengthening the participation of morecountries in an expanding world economy. The remarkablecontribution made by the development institutions  such asthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  theUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the UnitedNations Population Fund (UNFPA)  in our country must behighlighted. We encourage the Secretary-General to ensurethat in the reform process there will be respect for theautonomy of these bodies in order to preserve theireffectiveness.We welcomed the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s  adopted in 1991 which has been supplemented by the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa launched by theSecretary-General in March 1996. Their purpose was tohelp Africa in its recovery efforts. Today it is moreurgent than ever that the industrialized countries grantbroad support to these programmes  and establish fundsfor diversification to allow African countries to obtain abetter return for their commodities and thus assure vitalresources for their populations. This support in particularmust take the form of resources to be invested in prioritysectors  such as basic education  health and security offood and water supplies  sectors capable of laying downsolid bases for sustainable development in Africa.Africa certainly needs assistance. But my countryremains convinced that the resources the continent needsfor its development efforts can be generated by increasingtrade with the developed countries. African countries arewaiting for the industrialized countries to implement themeasures adopted as part of the Final Act of the UruguayRound negotiations  supplemented by specific preferenceprovisions in the Marrakesh Agreements  to mitigate thenegative effects the reforms envisaged in the negotiationscould have on countries which are net importers of foodproducts.Similarly  the external debt of African countries is aproblem requiring viable and fair solutions  going beyondthe measures taken in the Paris Club framework. The newinitiative taken recently by the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund to significantly reduce themultilateral debt of the poorest countries  should extendto all those countries  without any eligibility conditions ordeadlines.Nonetheless  the cancellation of all the debt is themost appropriate solution in order to ensure accelerateddevelopment by the least developed countries. Suchactions  in my delegation's view  will make it possible toreduce poverty noticeably.These recommendations are set out in the Agendafor Development  adopted during the last Assemblysession. It is up to the international community toeffectively implement this programme to bring aboutdevelopment and growth in our countries.Because of its lack of resources  successive droughtsand high population growth  Niger is part of the group ofAfrican countries where poverty is omnipresent. In thelight of its high level of poverty  His ExcellencyMr. Ibrahim Maïnassara Baré  President of the Republicof Niger  and the Government decided that for society toprogress we needed stable and democratic institutionsguaranteeing respect for and the promotion of human3rights. It was also decided to make all our developmentactions part of our battle against poverty.In liaison with its development partners  theGovernment of Niger has therefore agreed on a plan tocombat poverty  with policies to stimulate sustainablegrowth  improve rural income  give better access to socialservices and slow population growth  in particular. Wewould like to take this opportunity to invite bilateral andmultilateral donors to play an active part in implementingthis plan to combat poverty in Niger.Our Government is firmly committed to ensuring goodmanagement of our economy  deepening thedemocratization process and bringing about the participationat all levels of those who would benefit from the executionof this plan  which is based on principles of goodgovernment. That commitment undoubtedly guarantees itssuccess.Moreover  I am particularly pleased to inform theAssembly  and thus to reassure the my country's backersand partners that peace in Niger has become anunquestioned reality. Indeed  since the signing of the peaceagreement of 24 April 1995 in Niamey between theGovernment of the Republic of Niger and the Organizationof the Armed Resistance  the peace process has maderemarkable progress. For example  action has been takenwith respect to decentralization  the return of refugees  thecelebration each year of a day of harmony and theimplementation of an emergency programme for therehabilitation of our agricultural region. I solemnly appealto the international community to contribute to thecompletion of the peace progress already begun.Before concluding  I would like to reaffirm thecomplete commitment of a Sahelian country such as Nigerto protecting the environment  whose continuousdegradation is a source of real concern. Niger welcomed therecent holding in New York of the nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly  devoted to a review ofthe implementation of Agenda 21 and the establishment ofnew policies for the future.The special session showed us that while notableprogress has been made with respect to climate change biodiversity  combating desertification and the use ofrenewable sources of energy  that is not the case withregard to no less important questions  such as access todrinking water  which is a real problem for humankind  theunbridled exploitation of the oceans and deforestation.Thus  we have to recognize that  at the conclusion ofits proceedings  the special session did not live up to thehopes placed in it. In particular  it failed to create newlevels of international cooperation or to establish a basisfor legally binding codes of conduct on improvedenvironmental protection.In that context  my delegation confines itself here torecalling Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration  whichemphasizes the concept of common but differentiatedresponsibilities for the entire international communitywith respect to environmental matters. Thecomplementarity between economic  social andenvironmental questions obliges all our countries toacknowledge the need for solidarity and joint action toreach the goals laid down in Agenda 21. We owe thissolidarity to future generations."
"121",5106,"NGA",52,1997,"﻿There is an overwhelming airof expectancy across the world as we gather at this fifty-second session of the General Assembly. It is hoped thatthe events of this session over the next few weeks willpresent a new vision for our Organization. The success ofthis session will depend upon Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  theForeign Minister of Ukraine and current President of thisAssembly. His reputation for excellence and hard workassures us all that under his presidency  the affairs of thissession will be well ordered.May I therefore take this opportunity  on behalf ofmy Head of State  General Sani Abacha  and theGovernment and the people of Nigeria  to extend to himour congratulations on his election. Let me also availmyself of this opportunity to extend to his predecessor Ambassador Razali of Malaysia  our praises and highesteem for the purposeful and dynamic leadership he gaveto the General Assembly during the past year.My delegation notes with satisfaction the excellentmanner in which our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan has settled down to his onerous tasks and conducted theaffairs of our Organization since he took office. He hasdemonstrated through his reform proposals his capacity tolead the United Nations into the twenty-first century. Wewill continue to extend to him our fullest cooperation andsupport.As we gather here to contemplate the present stateof our world  it is tempting to be optimistic that theUnited Nations will provide a solution to the problems ofnations. The truth however  is that all around the worldlies evidence of the Organization’s unfinished tasks  andeven of some of its failures to meet mankind’s hopes andaspirations. Nonetheless  the fact that Member Statescontinue to participate in the annual sessions of theGeneral Assembly signifies that the search for peace andthe pursuit of development are indeed ongoing processes.There still subsists an abiding faith in the United Nationsand the willingness on the part of all of us to continue tostrive for a better and more peaceful world.That is why many nations have come here from timeto time seeking understanding for their individual travails believing passionately that here they would findaccommodation and support. Many of them have returnedhome disappointed  confounded by the realities of today’sworld  as they come to terms with the awesome powerwielded by the strong against the weak. We must remainmindful that international relations represent a complexmix of national circumstances and the demands anddictates of a changing external environment. Internationalrelations must be based on a perceived goal of thecommon good  on mutual respect for sovereignty and onaccommodation and consideration for nationalcircumstances and sensitivities. The United Nations musttherefore continue to serve as the bulwark against theimposition of the will of the strong on that of the weak.23No nation ever addresses this body without a point ofview peculiarly its own. We all come here with ourhistories  our cultures and our traditions  which givemeaning and substance to the values we seek to impart tothis Organization. In the case of my country  Nigeria  wehave the added burden of manifest destiny. While we didnot choose our destiny  we welcome its concomitantobligations and opportunities. For it is destiny  not nationalambition  that motivates us in the discharge of ourresponsibilities.In this regard  we see in the predicament of eachtroubled African State a mirror image of ourselves and acall to duty to render assistance in the best tradition ofAfrican brotherhood. Our exertions on behalf of regionaland subregional peace and security arise from thecircumstances of our history as the largest black nation onearth and the fortunate circumstances of our bountifulendowment. It is our destiny that we are home to one ofevery four Africans and one of every five blacks on earth.How could we be indifferent to the plight of the black race?It is our unshakeable destiny to champion the promotionand defence of the rights of all black people in Africa andin the diaspora. So  let no one imagine that we have onlyjust embraced our peacekeeping role  because  as is wellknown  we nurse no expansionist or hegemonistic interests.We simply cannot be indifferent to the plight of ourbrothers in other African States when their lives areimperilled.Since our admission to the United Nations on 7October 1960  we have given a firm indication of ourcountry’s determination to chart an independent course inworld affairs and also to resolutely defend the interests ofAfrica. When  for example  an atomic device was detonatedin the Sahara in 1960  Nigeria did not hesitate to express itsdisapproval by breaking diplomatic relations with thecountry concerned. Furthermore  we are proud to have beenpart of the effort that brought about the formation of theOrganization of African Unity in 1963. We have sincespared no effort to ensure the survival of that continentalOrganization. We were also in the vanguard of the strugglefor the total liberation of Africa from colonial dominationand of the campaign to eradicate apartheid in South Africa.We regarded the apartheid system as an affront to thedignity of the black race.Similarly  our contributions to United Nationspeacekeeping operations span nearly three and a halfdecades. Starting with the Congo in 1960  we havecommitted in excess of a quarter of a million troops toUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts. They have beenvariously deployed to preserve peace and security in ourown region and elsewhere around the globe including inBosnia  Cambodia and Lebanon.At the inception of our Organization over half acentury ago  its founding fathers captured  in the preambleto the Charter  a vision and an expectation of savingsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. It washoped that a global order would emerge in whichhumanity would live at peace with itself and nationswould be able to cooperate in furtherance of peace andsecurity. In spite of the end of the cold war  which formany years was perceived as the main obstacle to therealization of United Nations goals  our world is stilllargely unsafe  insecure and unstable.The threat of nuclear war still truly exists. Thismakes it imperative that the total elimination of nuclearweapons remains a priority item on the United Nationsagenda. Over and above the threat posed by nuclearweapons  there has been a proliferation of inter-State andintra-State conflicts with attendant negative consequencesfor global peace and security. In Central Europe  Asia andin our continent  Africa  these conflicts have devastatedsocieties  resulting in millions of refugees and displacedpersons. Africa is the area worst affected by theseconflicts.The United Nations has primary responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security.However  it also recognizes the crucial role whichregional and subregional organizations may play in therealization of these objectives. It was in the light of thisrecognition that the 16 countries of the West Africansubregion launched  in 1990  the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group(ECOMOG) to address the conflict in Liberia  which atthe time was rightly perceived as a threat not only to thecorporate existence of a Member State but  indeed  topeace and security in the entire subregion.As a result of the firm resolve of the leaders ofECOWAS and the determination of ECOMOG  coupledwith the enhanced material and logistic support receivedfrom friendly countries within and outside the subregion the disarmament of the warring factions was successfullyaccomplished as scheduled  on 31 January 1997. Anenvironment of peace and security was then establishedthroughout Liberia. It then became possible for free andfair legislative and presidential elections to be held asscheduled  on 19 July 1997. On 2 August this year  HisExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor was installed as24President of Liberia. That event brought to an end a sadchapter in the history of Liberia. As Nigeria is currentlychairing ECOWAS  we take this opportunity to convey tothe international community our profound appreciation forits support and assistance in bringing the Liberian conflictto a successful end.It is ironic that as peace came to Liberia events inneighbouring Sierra Leone took a turn for the worse following the violent overthrow of the legitimateGovernment of President Tejan Kabbah by a section of thatcountry’s military on 25 May 1997. That action wascharacterized by massive looting and wanton destruction oflives and property. Vital national assets  including theCentral Bank  were looted and burnt down. Virtually allembassies and residences were either looted or vandalizedby the ravaging group of coup plotters now in Freetown.All diplomatic missions have since evacuated Sierra Leone.These developments have been roundly condemned bythe OAU  the United Nations and the internationalcommunity. It is encouraging that no foreign Governmentor organization has to date given recognition or support tothe regime in Freetown. We urge that this position bemaintained.Meanwhile  ECOWAS has spared no effort in seekinga peaceful resolution of the problem created in SierraLeone. At Conakry  in June 1997  ECOWAS objectiveswere defined to include: first  the early reinstatement of thelegitimate Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah;secondly  the return of peace and security; and  thirdly  theresolution of the issues of refugees and displaced persons.Accordingly  ECOWAS adopted a combination of threestrategies  namely dialogue and negotiations  sanctions andembargo  and the possible use of force. A mechanism tomonitor and implement the ECOWAS response to thesituation in Sierra Leone was established  comprising fourcountries: Nigeria  Guinea  Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.During the last ECOWAS summit  held recently at Abuja the committee was expanded to five with the addition ofLiberia  and was raised to the status of Heads of State.At that same summit  additional measures wereimposed on the illegal regime in order to strengthen thenegotiation process towards the peaceful resolution of thecrisis in Sierra Leone. ECOMOG was mandated to overseethe implementation of these measures. In pursuing this goalof the peaceful resolution of the Sierra Leone crisis  weseek the support of the international community.Africa has of late witnessed a series of inter-Stateconflicts which have in some cases led either to thedisintegration of some countries or to the total collapse ofcentral government authority. Consequently  many well-meaning members of the international community havetried to propose solutions for prevention and resolution ofconflicts in Africa. Regrettably  these various initiativeshave not only been made outside the framework of theUnited Nations  but  more seriously  have tended to ignorethe existing framework and mechanisms within theAfrican continent. Yet it is obvious that the existingmechanisms at both the subregional and the continentallevels have demonstrated a proven capacity to resolveAfrican problems. ECOWAS  the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community and the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development have all established areputation as viable instruments for conflict resolution. Ofcourse  most of the regional and subregional bodiesrequire material and logistical support from the UnitedNations as well as from individual members of theinternational community.Nigeria believes that no initiative  however wellintentioned  can succeed in resolving conflicts if it is notdiscussed and adopted within the framework of the OAUCentral Organ’s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution. Accordingly  we recommendthat all current initiatives should be first channelledthrough the existing organs of the OAU.It is our view that national sovereignty and thefundamental rights of the individual are not necessarilymutually exclusive  provided a proper balance is struck.Indeed  they can be mutually reinforcing. The problemarises when  either deliberately or inadvertently  theprerogative of sovereignty is made subject to the absoluterights of the individual. This is a disservice both to thecause of freedom and to the true purpose of democracy.What is required in the interest both of the State and ofthe enhancement of human rights is a proper recognitionthat the right of the individual only begins at the pointwhere the sovereign right of the State terminates. Wemust resist the attempt in some quarters to use humanrights as a ploy to engage in activities designed toundermine the sovereignty of some Member States in theUnited Nations family.Two years ago  the present Administration in mycountry announced a programme of return to civil rule.Since then  commendable progress has been made in theimplementation of that programme. We are encouraged bythe successful outcome of the elections held so far and of25the processes which we have undertaken to ensure asuccessful transition. The rest of the programme is firmlyon course. We remain firmly confident that all theprocesses entailed in the transition programme will becompleted on schedule  by 1 October 1998.We have always given due recognition andappreciation to all friendly countries in the internationalsystem which have shown genuine concern for andunderstanding of the complexities of the Nigerian situation.After all  in 1960 we as a country willingly embraced theWestminster model of Government put in place by thedeparting colonial Power. That system took little or noaccount of our traditional institutions  or indeed of ourcustoms and cultures. Indeed  that system collapsed aftersix years. In 1979  my country  being more adventurous looked far across the Atlantic Ocean and adopted thepresidential system of government. However  the cost ofrunning the system placed a huge burden on our country’seconomy. Not surprisingly  that system too collapsed afterfive years.Today  no one can blame us as a country for searchingfor a system of government best suited for Nigeria  asystem which takes into account the realities of our nation.You may call it by whatever name  but the peace  stability development and good governance of our people remainsuppermost in our minds.At 37  Nigeria is by all standards a relatively youngnation. Even those countries that have been nations forcenturies and have inherited relatively stable societies arestill grappling with the complexities of nationhood andexperimenting with new formulas to cope with theexigencies of state. They were not present when theirforefathers  who also fought bitter civil wars  struggled tohand them their present inheritance. They should thereforeshow greater understanding for those of us engaged at thistime in the arduous task of forging new and stable societiesfrom the ruins of colonialism.If Nigeria appears concerned and indeed preoccupiedwith the vital issues of peace and stability at home  in WestAfrica and in Africa as a whole  it is because we areconvinced that the urgent demands of socio-economicdevelopment cannot be effectively tackled without peaceand stability. Nigeria believes that peace and stability inAfrica will facilitate the channelling of our limitedresources into the critical areas of political  social andeconomic development. Consequently  since the end of ourcivil war in 1970  we have embarked on a deliberate andsubstantial reduction of the Nigerian armed forces from astrength of 500 000 in all ranks to the barely 100 000 thatit is today. This has resulted in a corresponding reductionin military expenditure.Security considerations have sometimes compelledcountries to allocate a disproportionate share of theirnational budgets to military expenditure. This has had theeffect of reducing resources available for development.The end of the cold war had raised hopes that substantialresources would be available in the form of a peacedividend for development. Unfortunately  the proliferationof regional conflicts and civil wars has led even theUnited Nations into allocating enormous resources forpeacekeeping and conflict resolution  thus weakening itscapacity to fulfil its Charter obligations regarding socialand economic development.Since its establishment 52 years ago  the UnitedNations has served as an instrument for implementing aglobal agenda of a diverse  complex and pressing nature.As has been evident from the debates that have takenplace in the General Assembly  no one today can deny theneed for and the urgency of reform.In this regard  the Secretary-General has now madea number of proposals  in addition to the ongoing effortsof the General Assembly on the subject of reform. Mydelegation will actively participate in the consideration ofthese proposals. In doing so  it is important to stress thatthe outcome should encompass and take on board theviews and interests of all Member States.The reforms of the United Nations  as proposed forthe Secretariat  the General Assembly and the specializedagencies  would be incomplete without a correspondingreform of the Security Council. A reform of the Councilwould entail a restructuring and expansion of itsmembership in both categories to take account of  amongother things  the increased membership of ourOrganization and the need to reflect the interests of all theconstituent regions.Happily  there is now broad agreement on the needfor the expansion of the membership of the SecurityCouncil in both categories. With almost a third of themembership of the United Nations  Africa should haveadequate representation in an expanded Security Council.At the thirty-third summit of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) held in Harare  Zimbabwe  last June leaders of Africa reaffirmed the need for the region tohave two permanent seats with full veto powers. Nigeriaconsiders this demand legitimate and well deserved.26We stand here today as guardians of the heritage ofour cherished Organization  even as we gaze at the futurehorizon and the dawning of the new millennium. The visionwe harbour about the future of the United Nations isinevitably conditioned by the objective realities of thepresent and the vigour with which we shall pursue thehopes and challenges of the new millennium.It is within our means and our grasp to make the next50 years of the United Nations different  more exciting andgenerally more beneficial to the world at large. We canplead no alibi or extenuating circumstances should we failto do so. For  unlike in San Francisco  when nearly twothirds of the present membership of the United Nations didnot participate in the creation of the bold new world  thistime around  we  all 185 nations at the United Nations  arethe world  and we are present at the reordering of the newinternational world order  as envisaged by the reformproposals of the United Nations and its organs. We shouldtake the opportunity to establish a revamped UnitedNations of shared values and interests and to promote agreater equality of States.Students of history will bear testimony to the factthat over the centuries  centres of power and influencehave shifted constantly from one part of the world toanother. The rise and fall of great empires has been aconstant phenomenon in human history. A gale wind ofchange is now blowing across the globe. My country Nigeria  identifies with that change  which inevitably willresult in new centres of power and influence. It is not tobe imagined that any one continent will forever remain atthe periphery of the emerging new world order.The millennium bell tolls for the nations of theworld as we await the dawning of the new age. We mustnot shirk our responsibility for the regeneration of theUnited Nations. We are the world. Let us  from thishistoric Hall  reaffirm our faith in humankind. Let ourdream come true for a new and vibrant inner vision thatwill light our paths into the next century. Now is thetime; as the late Mother Teresa so gently reminded us “Tomorrow has not yet come  yesterday isalready gone  and we have only today — let usbegin”."
"122",5151,"NIC",52,1997,"﻿Iwould like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession.It is a principle of today’s world that politicallegitimacy and democracy constitute the most civilized formof government. The United Nations must reflect thisincreasingly universal principle by supporting the effortsbeing made by the Governments and peoples of the worldthat are struggling to democratize their countries.After a decade of totalitarianism and struggles ofresistance  the Nicaraguan people have chosen democracyas our system of government. Proof of this is the electionsthat were successfully conducted in 1990 and in 1996 when I was elected President of Nicaragua and undertookto build a state of law and to lead my country along thepath of democracy  reconciliation with justice and theinstitutionalization of the State.We know that this is a difficult challenge. TheGovernment over which I preside has made thecommitment to achieve economic and social developmentthat will make it possible to meet the basic needs of thepopulation and to guarantee sustainable growth in themedium and long term.We are aware of the need to promote a nationalcommitment to democracy. To that end we have initiatedan open  sincere national dialogue with different sectorsof society  including the political parties  civil society andnon-governmental organizations  so that together we canfind the key elements for building a democratic politicalculture.My Government is pleased to support thehemisphere’s efforts  as coordinator of item 18 on theagenda of the Summit of the Americas  “Strengthening ofthe role of women in society”. The Summit meetingwished to emphasize that the exclusion of women fromthe tasks and benefits of development is a big obstacle tothe attainment of growth and democracy.The entire world is in a process of change  and webelieve that the United Nations system cannot remain onthe sidelines. Nicaragua congratulates the Secretary-General on his dynamic vision  and we thank him for hisreport entitled “Renewing the United Nations: AProgramme for Reform” (A/51/950).Nicaragua has benefited from many programmes ofthe system and its agencies  programmes which have had animpact on its economy  health  social well-being  educationand employment  to name just a few areas  and ultimatelyon democratic development.My Government considers the time has come forMember States to approve a greater leadership role for theSecretary-General. We are glad that the Secretary-Generalattaches special importance to peace processes and the needto improve the system’s capacity to combat drug traffickingand terrorism. We support programmes to reduce arms andenhance human rights  as well as to strengthen the abilityto respond in the best possible way to emergency situations.Likewise  my Government considers that developmentprogrammes and programmes for strengthening democraticsystems must not be affected. Our democracies still haveenemies. A rapid response capacity is essential today.The Security Council’s present structure and itsMembers’ prerogatives belong to a bygone era. The days ofthe cold war and a bipolar world are a thing of the past and the number of States making up the internationalcommunity has increased substantially since 1965  the dateof the last enlargement of the Council. It is therefore clearthat its present structure is neither equitable nor democratic.The days of armed conflict in the Central Americanregion are over. In this very forum  all the nations of theworld have declared Central America to be a region ofpeace  democracy and development. Fortunately  we CentralAmericans are daily getting closer to real and effectiveintegration.We are aware of the urgent need to bring aboutprofound change in our institutional system in such a wayas to respect our sovereignty  and laws  and the differentcharacteristics of each nation  while allowing us to faceeffectively the challenges of the next century and to blendsuccessfully into global flows of trade and investment.Deeply resolved  the Central American Presidents haveagreed to initiate a process of gradually establishing theCentral American union. To that effect  we announced inManagua on 2 September the decision to designate a high-level group to prepare the bases and the conditions forconstituting the union. We ask the international communityto support this process unreservedly  for we consider itinvaluable for the strengthening of our democracy and thewell-being of our peoples.We Central Americans do not want the destructiveconsequences of war experienced in the 1980s to continueinto the twenty-first century. We still face humanitarianand economic problems because of the damage caused bythe presence of landmines and other explosive devices which have caused irreparable losses to the civilianpopulation and the national economy.The United Nations has seen profound changes inworld events  including great transformations in EasternEurope and the former Soviet Union. We are pleased tosee how democracy  the ideas of civil society and respectfor fundamental human rights are becoming predominantcharacteristics of today’s world.I therefore note with great regret that the 21.5million people who live in the Republic of China are notrepresented in this great Assembly. What is going on Mr. President? Everyone knows that the Republic ofChina signed the United Nations Charter in 1945.Domestically  it maintains government structuresguaranteeing its people the exercise of their fundamentalrights and freedoms. In no international forum dealingwith this subject has the Government of the Republic ofChina been described as a violator of inalienable rights.The countries of South-East Asia have seen how theeconomy and democratic development of the Republic ofChina have been significant factors in the region’sstability. The international community can attest to thefact that the Republic of China bases its attitude on theprinciples that govern the United Nations Charter particularly in its peace-loving nature and its capacity tomake a positive response to the needs of the internationalcommunity.Bearing these facts in mind  I appeal to theAssembly to amend resolution 2758 (XXVI)  whichexcludes the Republic of China from the United Nations.We ought to maintain the principle of universality throughthe equal participation of all the States of the world. TheGovernment of Nicaragua considers that the Republic ofChina should enjoy equal opportunity to participate in theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. We cannotforget the right of those who freely chose to live in andto build the Republic of China and who want theircountry to be recognized with full and effectiveparticipation at the heart of this Organization.2We have a broad programme of work  which willcontribute not only to overcoming the obstacles that peoplesand Governments face in achieving their goal ofmaintaining and implementing fundamental values ofdevelopment  social well-being and justice  but also topreparing for our entry into the twenty-first century with arenewed and strengthened world Organization that canassist Governments to attain the well-being of their peoples.On behalf of the Nicaraguan people  I ask God tobless the United Nations and all the peoples of the world."
"123",5198,"NLD",52,1997,"﻿First of all  allow meto subscribe to the statement delivered this morning by theForeign Minister of Luxembourg  Mr. Jacques Poos  onbehalf of the European Union. In particular  Sir  I wish tojoin him in his congratulations to you on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly.As the year 2000 draws closer  our feelings somehowmake us ponder more keenly the achievements andmisfortunes of the present century  and make us look aheadto the next one. As I do this  central to my thoughts is theUnited Nations  an institution created when I was anadolescent  at the end of a war whose horrors were justthen coming to light. I remember having been elated at thetime about the purposes and principles of the newOrganization  and I remember how intrigued I was to seethat  in a way  devastation and despair had given rise to thebelief that a better world could yet be built  a world markedby peace  development and respect for human rights notions I was just beginning to learn about. Soon enough I came to realize that such a world would be rather longerin the making than the Charter had led me to hope; that oldquestions were giving way to new ones; that the UnitedNations was not a panacea for all the troubles of mankind;and  more to the point  that the United Nations could neverbe stronger than its Member States collectively willed it tobe.Yet somehow my expectations remained  expectationswhich I shared with a growing audience around the globe and which one generation was passing on to the next.Rightly or wrongly  nations and individuals  Governments civil society and the public at large: they all haveexpectations about what the United Nations can do forthem  and about how it might change their lives and theirdestiny for the better.The question then is not so much whether the UnitedNations can meet all of those expectations. For it cannot and it probably should not even try. The United Nationshas neither the mandate  nor the resources  nor the powerto be the world’s keeper. The question is rather how wecan exploit the strong points of the Charter  how we canmake the United Nations play a role that only the UnitedNations can play  and how we can better equip theOrganization to do more by doing what it does better.With that in mind  I wish to highlight three matters thisafternoon: the fitness of the Organization; the potential ofthe United Nations to manage crises in the wider contextof development; and the Organization’s action in the fieldof human rights.Part of the reason why the United Nations hasproblems in meeting expectations is what it has turnedinto over the past 30 years: an amazing structure ofboards and committees populated by a growingmembership and assisted by an army of civil servants. Forthat reason alone  the Organization has lost credibility.Efforts to streamline and revitalize the Organization aretherefore long overdue. United Nations reform is a must.The proposals put forward by the Secretary-General arean important first step in that process  as the ForeignMinister of Luxembourg  Mr. Poos  said this morning  aprocess that will have to incorporate more ambitious ideasas it unfolds. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supportsthe Secretary-General in his reform drive  we applaud thefact that he has made reform his number-one agenda item and we welcome the reform package Mr. Kofi Annan hasput in our care.But we should get on with it. The world cannotafford to wait. We are looking at an Organization that isfar behind on its maintenance schedule. Yet over the pastthree years  the reform debate has inched forward as ifoblivious to the need to produce results. Fortunately  theSecretary-General has injected new momentum into thedebate  and we should all welcome this.As we are about to engage in this “ReformAssembly”  as the Secretary-General has called it  weshould be conscious of the underlying concerns that havesurfaced in the reform debate from time to time. Theseconcerns are real  and dismissing them would jeopardizea promising outcome for the present session. Indeed various groups of nations have doubts about what othergroups of nations are ultimately aiming for in thisexercise. Developing countries have even expressedmisgivings about the reform process as a whole. Some ofthem are clearly afraid that major Western Governments15are out to recast the United Nations as an institution thatwould run on the lowest possible budget and concentrate onpeacekeeping  humanitarian aid and human rights. Anotherconcern is that the development programme of thisOrganization — perhaps its single most importantachievement over the past 30 years — might actually sufferas a result of reform.Understandably  many nations see the decline in recentyears of official aid levels as the writing on the wall. Theyare disheartened by the empty promises of Rio de Janeiroin 1992. Moreover  they are worried about the currentfinancial crisis of the United Nations. And finally  a handfulof nations describe the Secretary-General’s proposals as a“northern” package — one that caters mainly to the needsof the industrialized world.Instead  developing nations would wish to see theUnited Nations strengthened in what to them is perhaps itsmost critical field of action  a field of action thatcorresponds to one of the main purposes mentioned in theCharter: social and economic development. They rightlyargue that if the United Nations membership wants to beserious about that objective  it needs to equip theOrganization accordingly. And so  in their view  moreresources should flow into the Organization. Beforeconsenting to change anything  they are inclined to play itsafe and to hold on to what is there.This line of thought  assuming I am reading itcorrectly  calls for comments. My first remark is that clearly  the Secretary-General was well-advised in havingmost of his package focus on the economic and socialsectors. This is indeed the area that commands the widestinterest among the membership. If we look at the merits ofthe package  it seems fair to say that many industrializednations might have wanted to see more ambitious andcomprehensive proposals. Still  speaking for theNetherlands Government  I would argue that the presentpackage of reform measures is well-directed  substantial andworthwhile. Evidently  the Secretary-General  on the basisof consultations which only he could undertake  hasconcluded that the contents of the package represent themaximum of what is achievable in the present state of play.And we should all accept that as a given.Furthermore  it is important to remember that reformmight strengthen the development sector of the UnitedNations to the point where it can actually deliver betterservice with the resources that are presently available. Thisexercise is not about cutting costs. Yet a leaner and meanerOrganization might give better value for the money. At thesame time  we welcome the idea of a developmentdividend  as put forward by the Secretary-General.A stronger development sector may help make theUnited Nations a more attractive Organization not only torecipients  but to donor countries as well. Voluntarycontributions should not come only from the same smallgroup of traditional donors year after year. For a longtime now  the Netherlands has been among the topcontributors to the United Nations system  and we intendto remain so. We appreciate the spectacular gesture byMr. Ted Turner. But donor contributions should alsocome from those nations that fall far below the 0.7 percent mark  as well as from newly industrialized countriesin Asia and elsewhere.Finally  all Member States should become currentand stay current on their financial obligations under theregular and peacekeeping budgets; and payments shouldbe prompt  in full and certainly without conditions.All in all  the heart of the matter is not about coreconcepts and not about mindset; it is about trust. It isabout feeling comfortable with the idea that among 185Member States  a difference of views is inevitable particularly when they are asked to discuss such a wide-ranging matter as the future of this Organization.We have arrived at a crossroads where we face acritical choice. This is a moment when we have to riseabove the level of squabbling over details in workinggroups. No doubt  we all have a point to raise  a questionto ask and a change to make. But that avenue would leadus nowhere  for soon enough the package would fallapart. Now is the time to start trusting each other. This isa time for vision and political courage. We  as statesmen should be ready to accept our responsibility in this regard to join forces and to forge a breakthrough. We should allrise to the occasion and accept the package of theSecretary-General as it is before us now and work out thedetails and implementation later. Endorsement in generalterms needs to be expressed before we all adjourn nextDecember. Without such endorsement  the momentum inthe reform process will be lost.We  the Member States of the United Nations pledged ourselves  in the words of the Charter:“to take effective collective measures for theprevention and removal of threats to thepeace”.16Next to the United Nations development effort peacekeeping and peace-building are perhaps the mostvisible part of what the United Nations does — animpression refreshed by Cable News Network (CNN)almost daily. More importantly  those who are on the run who are afraid for their lives  who watch their homesteadsinvaded  who are occupied and repressed  who lookstarvation and genocide in the face — they haveexpectations of the United Nations. They expect theOrganization to bail them out.We need to improve the capacity of the UnitedNations to deal with crises  be they military  political orhumanitarian ones  whether man-made or not. There isconsiderable room for improvement here  as illustrated bythe situations in Bosnia  Somalia  Rwanda and Zaire. As wespeak  innocent blood is flowing in many places around theworld. Yet all too often the United Nations remainsimpotent. We cannot allow this to continue. Here again liesa major area where reform is indispensable  and theSecretary-General has duly underlined this.A number of Member States  including the Kingdomof the Netherlands  have been trying to develop the conceptof a standby high-readiness brigade within the frameworkof the United Nations standby agreements. They have beenmaking modest progress over the last three years. A rapidlydeployable headquarters is now being established.Tomorrow a small group of nations will informallydeliberate on how to promote further steps. Several otherinitiatives are under way  including regional ones. Given thecomplexities  this is going to be an incremental process  butone where we cannot afford to let up.The real test is where to position peacekeeping in thewider context of the overall concerns of the United Nations.Our agenda should be wider and should include conflictprevention and peace-building.The difficulty we need to address here is how tointegrate different policy instruments — political  military relief  rehabilitation and social and economic development— into one comprehensive framework. Crises require acoherent and effective international response  a responsethat should integrate preventive diplomacy  politicalmediation and humanitarian relief  but also social action economic alternatives and cultural communication. In sum:development.Of course  prevention is the key. The United Nationscan be much more effective when we invest in prevention.Diplomacy  economic sanctions  arms embargoes andpolitical pressure will reduce risk and costs as comparedto military intervention in an escalated conflict. We couldavoid the loss of life and escape generalized humanmisery. As a result of timely prevention  we could alsoavoid the immense costs for rehabilitation  resettlementand reconstruction that arise after violence is over.Military intervention  under United Nations auspices  forhumanitarian purposes may be necessary in certainconflict situations. But it should always be a means oflast resort. Intervention implies that prevention has failed.The link between development on the one hand andpeace and security on the other is a tenuous one in theUnited Nations system. Yet experience has proved thatmaking the link is imperative. We need to find the bestcombination of conflict management  humanitarianassistance and social and economic programmes to pavethe way for sustainable development and for sustainablepeace.In San Francisco we promised to promote andencourage“respect for human rights and for fundamentalfreedoms for all”.It is a pledge we will have to renew again and again perhaps indefinitely. Yet such a pledge may notdegenerate into lipservice. Commitments must be turnedinto reality; obligations must be implemented. We cannotlet our guard down as we face reports on violations ofhuman rights. Torture is still being practised on a widescale. People continue to disappear. Arrest and detentionwithout cause take place routinely. And freedom of thepress is non-existent in too many countries.Still  we recognize that human rights are in bettershape worldwide than they were 10 years ago  andcertainly 50 years ago. Totalitarian regimes have all butdisappeared; democracy is on the rise. Also  there is moreinterest than ever before in the triangle of democracy good governance and human rights.Today  human rights are well established as animportant objective in their own right and a major field ofactivity for the United Nations. But  perhaps moreimportant  human rights have become a leitmotif in awide variety of other areas of United Nations policy  fromsustainable development to population  from trade tohumanitarian aid  and from peacekeeping to humansettlements. That human rights is a “cross-cutting” issueis evident from the reform proposals of the Secretary-17General and from the way he has revised the topmanagement structure in the Secretariat — both of whichwe welcome warmly.Expectations on what the United Nations can achievein the field of human rights have run high  among victimsof human-rights violations  among mothers of thedisappeared  among grass-roots groups  and amongnon-governmental organizations. Then again  there areGovernments that expect the United Nations to stay out oftheir precincts entirely: Governments that accept theuniversality of human rights  but only as a debating point;Governments that accept the United Nations actions againsthuman rights-violations  but only at a theoretical level andnot when it concerns them.All in all  the instruments the United Nations canapply have become the core of an extensive machinery thatin many cases has worked strikingly well. Examples arenumerous and expanding. I refer to such diverse methodsas international dialogue  the integration of human rightsactivities into cooperation arrangements  the work of humanrights field offices  human rights education andstrengthening regional supervisory machinery.More recently  a new High Commissioner for HumanRights took up her position. If this is indeed the age ofhuman rights  as the Secretary-General says  thenMrs. Mary Robinson will be one of its key personalities.We wish her courage and wisdom in her new assignment and she can be sure of our commitment.One major platform in the realization of human rightsand the international administration of justice is soon totake its definitive shape. Next summer  a diplomaticconference will convene in Rome — we should all begrateful to the Italian Government for hosting it — thatwill  hopefully  adopt a convention establishing aninternational criminal court. Once established  the court willbe the natural counterpart to the International Court ofJustice. My Government is looking forward withanticipation to this new offspring in the international legalorder  and I take pride in announcing that my country isoffering to house the seat of the court  in the city of TheHague.The fitness of the United Nations as an Organization its capacity to manage crises in the wider context ofdevelopment  and its action in the field of human rights areareas of ongoing concern to all Member States. ThisAssembly will continue to address them  either on theirown merits or in the context of United Nations reform. TheUnited Nations is expected to perform in these areas andto produce results. Yet there is only one way this is goingto happen: if all of us join forces  join forces to make theUnited Nations a viable and credible institution  joinforces to make it a centre for harmonizing the actions ofnations in the attainment of these common ends. For onlythen will we keep the promise of San Francisco."
"124",5243,"NOR",52,1997,"﻿First  I join other speakers incongratulating my Ukrainian colleague upon his election tohis high office.Last week in Oslo  almost 100 countries agreed to aConvention text for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.Who would have imagined  only a year ago  such aremarkable achievement in such a short time? Thanks to thetireless efforts and model cooperation of Governments  non-governmental organizations and civil society  we havereached this milestone event. I would like to extend aspecial tribute to the International Campaign to BanLandmines and the International Committee of the RedCross. They have been a driving force in our efforts to getrid of the scourge that landmines represent in the lives ofmen  women and children in conflict areas around theworld.At the beginning of December we will meet in Ottawafor the signing of the Convention. I appeal to all countriesengaged in this process to ratify the Convention. To thosewho have not yet joined us  I say: “Please do so as soon aspossible”. Landmines cannot be allowed to terrorize  maimor kill more innocent civilians. The United Nations and itsMembers have an important role to play and responsibilityfor bringing success to the Ottawa process. I appreciate thesupport of the Secretary-General and welcome the fact thathe will be the depositary of the treaty. We all have a strongmoral obligation to increase our efforts to reduce thesuffering and prevent new casualties caused by landmines.Norway intends to provide $100 million over a five-yearperiod for mine clearance and assistance to victims.The spread of landmines  small arms and weapons ofmass destruction is unfortunately only one of the manyinterlinked global challenges illustrating that the world now more than ever  needs the United Nations as a well-functioning global Organization. At the threshold of thethird millennium  it is unacceptable that poverty andpollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of peopleall over the world; it is unacceptable that hostilities andhatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitariandisasters  between and within States on all continents; andit is unacceptable that basic human and individual rightsare still widely violated through injustice by Governmentsand the negligence of the international community.Only the United Nations can tackle these universaland interdependent problems in a comprehensive andintegrated manner. But the world has surely undergoneradical changes since 1945  and so has the nature of thetasks confronting us. Hence  the United Nations alsoneeds to change in order to do better what the MemberStates want it to do. I was therefore very pleased by theletter that Mr. Kofi Annan sent to all of our Governmentslast month. In clear and concise terms  the Secretary-General set out the elements of what is without doubt themost comprehensive reform package in the history of theUnited Nations.Let me state clearly that Norway warmly welcomesand fully supports the Secretary-General’s programme forreform and renewal of the United Nations. Together withthe other Nordic countries  we have given our strongpolitical backing to his reform proposals. We will workactively with other Member States to ensure that theGeneral Assembly endorses the reform package thisautumn. We want the reform plans to be implemented assoon as possible. Norway urgently wants a stronger andmore efficient United Nations. Without such reform  wewill have an Organization less able to promotedevelopment  peace and progress.Norway is  as many know  one of the maincontributors to the United Nations system. We are one ofthe group of countries that fulfil the aim of allocatingmore than 0.7 per cent of our gross national product todevelopment. One out of every 100 Norwegians hasparticipated in peacekeeping operations around the world.In terms of money  resources and personnel  our voluntaryassistance to humanitarian relief activities  is  I am proudto say  second to none. But we want to make sure thatour contribution is put to good use. We want to see itutilized by the United Nations to improve the lives ofpeople where the needs are the greatest. That is why wesupport the Secretary-General’s reform proposals.First of all  the reforms will ensure that moreresources are allocated more efficiently for development.11The Secretary-General’s excellent proposal to useadministrative savings for a “development dividend” is butone element in the process. We encourage him to continuefurther on the course that he has taken. United Nationsactivities targeting sustainable development  poverty population  education  the promotion of the role of womenin development and the implementation of the results of theBeijing Conference must be strengthened and integrated atthe headquarters and field levels. Health should be amongthe main priorities. Increased international efforts areneeded to assist developing countries in improving theirnational health policies and to combat emerging andre-emerging diseases  such as malaria  tuberculosis andAIDS. Member States must follow up by fulfilling theirobligations to increase their transfers of aid to thedeveloping countries and peoples that need it the most.Hopefully  this will also have the effect of creating theconfidence needed to bring us forward in the Rio process towards renewed environmental commitments which canpave the way for a successful meeting in Kyoto later thisyear.Secondly  the reforms will strengthen the ability of theUnited Nations to manage conflicts. Too often  the UnitedNations has shown a lack of capacity to act rapidly in theface of emerging crises. Therefore  we believe it is hightime to establish a rapid-deployment mission headquartersfor peacekeeping and other operations. Norway has offeredto provide funding for personnel for this headquarters.Furthermore  we encourage other Member States tocontribute to the Trust Fund for Preventive Action  whichwas established this year. We are pleased to note that theFund has already facilitated the work of the Special Envoyof the Secretary-General in Central Africa. We want tocooperate closely on conflict resolution with our friends andpartners in Africa  including through our trainingprogrammes for peacekeeping tasks in that region.Thirdly  the reforms will extend the capacity of theUnited Nations in the human rights field. Norway welcomesthe proposals to strengthen the human rights secretariat andthe excellent choice of Mary Robinson as HighCommissioner for Human Rights. We pledge to workclosely with her to ensure that the international communityincreases its focus on human rights violations. Humanrights concerns must become an integral part of all coreareas of the Organization’s work  including at Headquartersin New York.We must follow up reform of the Security Council.Our position is  I believe  well known: the Council must bemade more representative and should better reflect changesin political and economic realities. We want newpermanent seats for Germany and Japan and for thedeveloping countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America.At the same time  a limited number of new non-permanent seats should be added.We need financial reform and changes to the scaleof assessments. Some countries have experienced highand sustained economic growth  but still resist reformswhich would better reflect their increased capacity to pay.Other countries feel that they are paying too much. Weagree that the time has come to show flexibility in thediscussions on lowering the ceiling on the scale ofassessments to the United Nations budgets  as part of anoverall solution. It cannot be justified that some countriesunilaterally pay less than their legally binding share  ornothing at all. Non-payment is unacceptable. How canthose of us who always make a point of paying in fulland on time  without conditions  expect our citizens andtaxpayers to continue financing free riders?We need better integration and coordination withinthe United Nations system and between the UnitedNations  regional organizations  Governments  civilsociety and non-governmental actors. For Norway  this isnot least important in the area of humanitarian assistance.We welcome the proposal to enhance the capacity of theEmergency Relief Coordinator to deal more effectivelywith complex emergencies.In Bosnia we are engaged in peace-building undervery difficult conditions. Men and women are serving awide range of different organizations: the North AtlanticTreaty Organization  the United Nations civilian police the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and humanitarian non-governmentalorganizations. Without the excellent coordination andcooperation that has evolved between the HighRepresentative  the United Nations Special Representative the Stabilization Force Commander  the OSCE Head ofMission and others  the peace-implementation processwould have been in dire straits indeed.Nationalist leaders in Bosnia are still inciting hatred.Refugees are being denied their right to return to theirhomes. Our personnel are being threatened. War criminalsare still at large. But despite the failure of local leaders tofulfil their obligations  the recently held elections showthat the international community has given this countryhope for the future. We will stay the course and remainengaged in Bosnia until peace is consolidated. We willinsist that wanted war criminals be brought to justice. The12convening of a United Nations conference to establish apermanent international criminal court in 1998 must begiven priority.Norway remains committed to the Middle East peaceprocess. While we will continue to work actively with otherdonor countries to ensure the availability of funding  we areextremely concerned by the current deadlock. The partiesmust realize that there is no alternative to the peace processand to the fulfilment of the spirit and the letter of the Osloaccords. Further credible efforts to combat terrorism mustbe undertaken. The current settlements policy is notconducive to the peace process. We must redouble ourefforts to bring the parties back into dialogue about theremaining issues.We must not forget the success stories of UnitedNations conflict resolution. Just since last year  forexample  the decades-long civil war in Guatemala hasended peacefully. We have had the pleasure of workingwith the United Nations and others  like the Group ofFriends for Guatemala  in seeing through the ceasefireagreement signed in Oslo and the other peace accords.I would like to take this opportunity to commend theGovernment of Guatemala and the Unidad RevolucionariaNacional Guatemalteca for their courage and determinationto see the peace process succeed.Finally  our experience in Guatemala and otherconflict areas corroborates the importance that theSecretary-General attaches to the close interaction betweenthe civil society  Governments and the United Nations.

"125",5289,"NPL",52,1997,"﻿First of all  on behalf of theGovernment and people of Nepal and on my own behalf I should like to extend to you  Sir  our warmestcongratulations on your election as President of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. I am confidentthat with your rich experience in international affairs youwill guide the work of the Assembly to a successfulconclusion. I wish also to assure you of the fullcooperation of my delegation in the discharge of yourresponsibilities.I would like to take this opportunity to offer ourdeep appreciation and thanks to the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session  AmbassadorRazali Ismail of the friendly country of Malaysia  for theenthusiasm  dedication and zeal he brought to bear on thework of the previous session.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  I bring greetingsand best wishes from Nepal. In every way  he is provinghimself worthy of the great trust the membership hasplaced in him. Having shown his deep commitment toUnited Nations reform from the day of his appointment asSecretary-General  he has presented us with a set of veryserious and far-reaching proposals of impressive breadthand scope  with a view to reshaping the United Nationsso that it can better serve humanity in the years ahead.The Secretary-General has asked us to make thissession of the General Assembly one of reform. We agreewith him that United Nations reform is the shared concernof all Member States and that the purpose of the reformis to strengthen the role of the United Nations andenhance its efficiency. In the aftermath of the end of thecold war  the world situation is continuously undergoingprofound changes  evolving progressively towards a world25of multipolarity which reinforces the core of the UnitedNations Charter: peace and development in larger freedom.The universal cause  therefore  is to make the UnitedNations a more vibrant world Organization that is moreproperly equipped  institutionally and financially  to meetthe evolving challenges of the next century.The proposals of the Secretary-General complementthe ongoing intergovernmental process regarding therevitalization of the United Nations  particularly financialreform and reform of the Security Council.The United Nations  if it is to perform the mission setout in its Charter  cannot limp from one year to another onthe verge of bankruptcy. No country should bear anexcessive burden  but the fundamental principle of anyscale of assessments should be the capacity to pay calculated on the basis of the country’s share of globalgross national product. It also does not make sense that halfthe total membership is assessed the same amount incontributions. A change in the scale of assessments isoverdue. Countries  rich and poor  must pay their assessedshare in full  on time and without conditions.With regard to the reform of the Security Council  theorgan which bears the primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security  Nepal’sposition coincides basically with the position taken by theNon-Aligned Movement  as reflected  in particular  in theCartagena summit Declaration and the subsequentDeclarations of the meetings of Foreign Ministers of theNon-Aligned Movement. The Security Council shouldbetter reflect changes in contemporary political andeconomic realities. It should be more representative incomposition and more transparent in its functioning. It mustbe more democratic in character. It must be more reflectiveof balance between the North and South. It must  above all be capable of prompt action when peace is threatened. Thecontribution of Member States to international peace andsecurity should be the guiding criterion for the selection ofMembers of the expanded Security Council in bothpermanent and non-permanent categories. Since the SecurityCouncil is the principal instrument of the internationalcommunity in the area of collective security  I mustemphasize here that any reform must be the fruit ofratifiable global consensus and must in no way diminish theCouncil’s capacity for prompt and effective action tomaintain international peace and security.In the view of my delegation  the reform proposals ofthe Secretary-General  which deserve our appreciation andsupport  are categorized in three broad areas: managementof conflicts and peacekeeping; strengthening andintegration at headquarters  and field levels of UnitedNations development activities; and protection andpromotion of human rights.Too often in the past  the United Nations hassuffered from a sore need for a capacity to act in the faceof conflicts. The Secretary-General must be encouragedand supported financially to make use of his high officefor the resolution of emerging conflicts. Whenpeacekeeping operations are mandated by the SecurityCouncil  the capacity of the Secretary-General to organizeand mount them in time should be strengthened.Peacekeeping  to be effective  is dependent largely on themaintenance of elements within the national armed forcesof Member States that can be made available promptly tothe United Nations. Sixty-six countries are nowparticipating in United Nations standby arrangements  andI am happy to say that Nepal is one of the 10 countries tosign the Memorandum of Understanding which commitsmy country to contribute 2 000 troops  including doctors engineers  observers and headquarters staff and 200civilian monitors for peacekeeping purposes  at shortnotice. It is high time that the rapidly deployable missionheadquarters became operational.Nepal is confident that the Secretary-General’sproposals for a new United Nations Development Groupand a United Nations Development Assistance Frameworkwill provide clearer focus and direction to United Nationsdevelopment activities aimed at sustainable developmentand the eradication of poverty. In Nepal  many of thedevelopment activities carried out by the United Nationsare already practically integrated at the field level. Carehas to be taken  however  that in the name of integrationor merger  the demonstrated strength of individualprogrammes  funds or agencies is not lost. We also findthe proposal for a Special Commission to look at thedivision of labour among the various specialized agenciesacross the United Nations system very interesting anddeserving of careful consideration. With a view toachieving greater harmonization of internationaldevelopment efforts  Nepal feels the need for a closerrelationship between the United Nations and internationalfinancial institutions and the World Trade Organization.Since peace  progress and humanity are the coreconcern of the United Nations  Nepal  as a functioningdemocracy with a deep commitment to human rights appreciates the intention of the Secretary-General tostrengthen and broaden the capacity of the United Nations26in the field of human rights. We welcome the strengtheningof the Human Rights secretariat and the choice of Mrs.Mary Robinson  former President of Ireland  as HighCommissioner for Human Rights. There could hardly be abetter choice. I wish to congratulate the new HighCommissioner and express the confidence of my delegationthat she will be an independent and credible defender ofhuman rights. We welcome her determination to narrow thegap in the perception of human rights. She has rightlyobserved that collective and individual rights are notmutually exclusive and that the scope of human rights isinterlinked with social  cultural and economic issuesrequiring a broad approach.As a signatory of all basic international human rightsinstruments and a participant in the World Conference onHuman Rights in Vienna  Nepal looks forward to thefiftieth anniversary next year of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights. Together with freedom of speech andbelief  the Declaration characterizes freedom from fear andfreedom from want as the highest aspirations of humanbeings. Along with concerns for peace and sustainabledevelopment  it is right that concerns for human rightsshould also be made an integral part of the work of theUnited Nations.Peace in many parts of the world continues to remainfragile. Nepal is deeply concerned over the setbacks in thepeace process in the Middle East. The settlements policyhas retarded the process. Nor has the spate of violence inthe region helped restore the mutual confidence withoutwhich no peace process can succeed.Without a resolution to the Palestinian problem  nocomprehensive  just and lasting peace will be possible inthe Middle East. We urge the concerned parties not todeviate from their professed commitment to resolving theproblem through peaceful means.The extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons and the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty represent a finemoment in the history of nuclear-arms control anddisarmament. The Convention on Chemical Weapons hascome into force  to our great satisfaction. With the creationof nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia and Africalast year  we hope that efforts to create such zones in otherregions  such as the Middle East and South Asia  will berelentlessly pursued.Disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  meansnothing if it does not provide security to nations andpeoples. Only a complete elimination of nuclear weaponswill provide such security. It is in this spirit that we havesupported the programme of action advanced by 28 NAMand neutral countries  members of the Conference onDisarmament  for the elimination of nuclear weaponsthrough phases over a period of time. We aredisappointed by the complete lack of progress in thisyear’s session of the Conference on Disarmament.Nepal is in favour of strengthening the role of theConference on Disarmament as the principal globaldisarmament negotiating forum.Nepal welcomes the agreement in Oslo this monthon the text of a convention for the total ban on anti-personnel landmines and will seriously consider signingthe convention in Ottawa in December. Landmines shouldnot be allowed to be used indiscriminately and to maimand take innocent lives  including those of women andchildren.While the importance of the issues of weapons ofmass destruction cannot be overemphasized  it is to benoted that it is conventional weapons that have killed themost people throughout history. Therein lies theimportance of the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms. The work of the United NationsPanel of Experts on Small Arms  one of whose sessionswas hosted in Kathmandu this year  has laid thefoundation for future United Nations action in this area.Confidence-building measures and regular dialoguesin informal settings represent an indispensable element inthe long and arduous efforts undertaken on behalf ofdisarmament and security. I am pleased to note that theUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace andDisarmament in Asia and the Pacific  located inKathmandu  has been found to be a useful forum for suchinformal dialogues on disarmament and security issues.Nepal’s consistent participation in United Nationspeacekeeping operations reflects our abiding faith in theideals of the United Nations. Over the past four decades Nepal’s peacekeepers have served with pride in allregions of the world under the United Nations for thecause of peace. Many of the Nepalese Blue Helmets havelost their lives and limbs in the pursuit of peace. Nepalesesoldiers have served the United Nations with dedicationand professionalism. Nepal will continue to serve thecause of peace by responding positively and promptly toevery call for assistance from the United Nations.27The adoption of An Agenda for Development thisyear  following protracted and tortuous negotiations over aperiod of three years  is a welcome sign for the renewal ofdevelopment cooperation between the North and South. TheAgenda identifies groups of countries in special need: leastdeveloped countries  Africa  landlocked developingcountries  small island developing countries and countrieswith transitional economies. The usefulness of the Agendawill be measured only in terms of its faithfulimplementation. The provision of additional resources on anassured and predictable basis is a prerequisite to thesustainable development of the least developed andlandlocked countries.The decision of the General Assembly last yearestablishing the First United Nations Decade for theEradication of Poverty represents the long-awaitedrecognition by the international community of the pervasivenature of poverty  which today is the greatest threat topeace  sustainable development and human rights. Theeradication of poverty  therefore  should be a core activityof the United Nations. We recognize that this is theprincipal thrust of the reform measures and proposals of theSecretary-General. I wish once again to pledge mycountry’s full support and cooperation to the Secretary-General in this regard. Poverty alleviation is the priorityarea of sustainable development planning in Nepal. Amassive programme is needed to reduce poverty in ameaningful way.The rapid decline of living standards today in almostall the least developed countries and developing landlockedcountries is an ironic testimony to the gross marginalizationof those countries  despite the new trade regime that issupposed to usher in an era of prosperity throughout theworld. This anomaly is further compounded by theaccelerating reduction of official development assistance tothe least developed countries. For the least developedcountries  and the landlocked among them  which sufferfrom additional physical handicaps  foreign directinvestment cannot be a substitute for official developmentassistance for some time to come.I would like to affirm Nepal’s unreservedcondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and ourdetermination to prevent terrorists from deriving benefitfrom their acts. It is our firm position that terrorism is athreat to both internal and international security and topeaceful relations between States. It is  moreover  a threatto the growth and functioning of democratic institutions andto the enjoyment of human rights all over the world. Nepalwill never allow its territory to be used by terroristsagainst other countries.Nepal holds the view that States should create anenvironment in which people do not have to be displacedor flee their countries as refugees. The number of suchpeople is in millions and  in the words of the Secretary-General  unquantifiable. Nepal is also bearing the burdenof refugees. Nepal being a least developed and landlockedcountry struggling to cope with the rising aspirations ofits people in a parliamentary set-up with deep human-rights commitments  the burden is painful for us. We havereceived international humanitarian assistance  for whichwe are grateful. The magnitude of the problem for us canbe judged by the fact that one in every 200 people inNepal today is a refugee. We uphold the right of therefugees to return to their home in peace and honour. HisMajesty’s Government of Nepal is determined to solvethe problem peacefully by dialogue.Nepal is a founding member of the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Nepal isactively pursuing a policy of promoting regionalcooperation and understanding under the umbrella ofSAARC  an Association which forms a critical part of ourbroad policy of peace  friendship and cooperation with allcountries of the world in conformity with the Charter ofthe United Nations and non-alignment.The seven countries of the region are engaged invarious areas of cooperation  including the suppression ofterrorism and drug abuse  environmental preservation poverty alleviation and the promotion of regional trade.We are endeavouring to harmonize the policies of theseven member countries on important global issues. Wedid so during the nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to environment and sustainabledevelopment. Many ministerial meetings in the region arenow annual events. Foreign Ministers of the region willbe meeting in New York in an informal setting during theannual session of the General Assembly. SAARC haslagged behind other similar associations  but the countriesof the region are persevering in their efforts to developboth the habit and concrete measures of cooperation."
"126",5353,"NZL",52,1997,"﻿May I begin bycongratulating the President on his election to preside overthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We are ingood hands as we begin our work during what theSecretary-General has called “the reform Assembly.”I know  too  that my Foreign Minister  on whosebehalf I am speaking  would want to warmly congratulatethe outgoing President  Ambassador Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  on his efforts during the past 12 months. It hasbeen a challenging time  and he has demonstrated thedecisive leadership we all expected of him.Two years ago  at the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  world leaders undertook to give the twenty-first century an Organization equipped  financed andstructured to serve effectively the peoples in whose nameit was established. With the year 2000 now only 27 monthsaway  we are still far from that goal. This is a matter ofgreat concern to New Zealand. We firmly believe in theUnited Nations as a vehicle to a better life for the world'scitizens  and not just for those who live now. We have aresponsibility to strengthen the Organization for ourgrandchildren and beyond. We must not let them andourselves down by allowing an unreformed United Nationsto slide into increasing irrelevance.We do not pretend the process of reform is easy orfinite. As the Secretary-General has said  “Reform is not anevent; it is a process.” [A/51/950  para. 25] Our own involvement on the intergovernmental track  including co-chairing the Working Group on the Strengthening of theUnited Nations System and the Working Group on anAgenda for Development  has given us a good appreciationof the complexities involved in producing positive outcomesacceptable to 185 Member States.We know the Secretary-General faces the sameissues with his 16 July package. As with any package  itis inevitable that some Member States will find fault withindividual elements. But we are firmly of the belief thatthe package should be viewed as a whole. This will befor the greater good of the Organization. Difficulties withindividual elements of the package should not be allowedto unpick the overall good which is in it. We appeal toMember States to acknowledge this reality and to give theSecretary-General their generous support. It is smallcountries like New Zealand  and developing countries which  as we see it  stand most to benefit from what theSecretary-General is trying to achieve.To reform and strengthen the United Nationseffectively  we see a need to redistribute resources awayfrom administration and into areas which are importantfor those of us who place a high priority on the UnitedNations itself. We support efficiencies  not cost-cutting.The crucial difference between the two is that oneapproach seeks simply to save money without regard tothe impact on the Organization. We cannot support this.The United Nations is too important to us to allow sucha downgrading.An approach based on efficiencies allows us toreinvigorate the United Nations by reinvesting the moneysaved from outdated administrative practices. This iscentral to the Secretary-General's package. In particular the proposal for a “development dividend” channellingresources freed by administrative efficiencies intostrengthening the development activities of the UnitedNations is most welcome. We can certify from our ownnational experience that the sort of management reformsproposed in the package do indeed lead to a reduction inadministrative overheads  allowing more to be deliveredin terms of substantive programmes.At a time when development funds are diminishing the significance of this step should not be lost. NewZealand is a country that is increasing its overseas aid —by 40 per cent since the 1992 United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development  the Rio Summit. Ourcontributions through the United Nations system have alsoincreased by nearly 50 per cent over the last five years.But the global trend is the opposite  particularly amongthe larger traditional donors. It is becoming harder andharder for Governments to meet their Charter commitmentto promote the economic and social advancement of allpeoples. One of the modest outcomes of the last twoyears of reform efforts within the United Nations hasbeen the elaboration of an Agenda for Development19reaffirming the primacy of development  setting objectivesand recommending ways of achieving them. But  with thebest will in the world  implementing that Agenda will cometo naught in the absence of adequate funding.The Secretary-General's reforms are designed todeliver more for development. Equally important  they aredesigned to boost confidence in the United Nations confidence which two weeks ago was given tangible formby Mr. Ted Turner's billion-dollar grant to assist UnitedNations agencies in key development activities. Thatgenerous offer has given the Organization a real boost andcould be a catalyst for leveraging further private-sectorfunds for development. We must support the Secretary-General's efforts to make the United Nations the bestvehicle for delivering such assistance.Member States need to trust the Secretary-General tofulfil his responsibilities under the Charter: to give effect tothe policy directions which they set. We need to be clearand realistic in the priorities we set for the United Nations.We cannot mandate the Organization with more and morenew tasks and somehow expect these to be achieved withincurrent resources. And  having set the priorities  we mustresist the temptation to micro-manage. This will involve asea-change in the way Member States have becomeaccustomed to operating. The Fifth Committee still makesdecisions about staff numbers and placement within theSecretariat  administrative decisions that in any modernorganization would be the responsibility of its managers.We know that the transitional process of change willnot be easy for those working in the Secretariat either.But — and we are conscious of our own experience in NewZealand in instituting public-sector reform — themanagerial and results-based budgeting proposals in theJuly package will improve work performance and willdeliver greater job satisfaction to those working for theUnited Nations. The Organization's most important resourceis its people. The package recognizes the vital importanceof investment in staff. If the best and brightest are to beattracted to and retained by the United Nations  they mustbe recruited  trained  promoted and paid according toprocedures which are as good as the best employed byMember States.It is also important to stress here the loyalty owed tothe Secretary-General by those who work for him. He hasthe right to expect their full support for his leadership andfor the initiatives he puts forward. Anything less would bedishonourable  would subvert due process and wouldpotentially disenfranchise Member States. It could not betolerated.I referred earlier to the intergovernmental track. It isworth touching on the key issues of Security Council andfinancial reform.On the former  New Zealand will judge specificproposals for enlargement of the Security Council by theyardstick of democracy and the representativeness of theinstitution as a whole. Increasing the proportion ofpermanent to non-permanent members runs counter to thisprinciple. Nor could a package on Security Councilreform be acceptable to us without substantive proposalsopening up and modernizing the workings of the Council.Sunshine  an American jurist once observed  is the bestdisinfectant. Member States must continue to participatein the debate in the search for a consensus solution.On financial reform  New Zealand is stronglyconcerned about the crisis facing the United Nations. It istrue that there are problems with the scales of assessmentsfor both the regular and the peacekeeping budgets. Thepresent floor has a negative impact on smaller  vulnerablenations  such as the South Pacific island countries  NewZealand's neighbours. This is just one example of the kindof problem that needs to be addressed.But those who want to see changes made to thescale need to offer genuine inducements  not threats. Wecannot accept that any Member State is entitled towithhold payments unilaterally or that the assessment ofthose countries that will not pay their dues should bepicked up by others. All assessed contributions must bepaid in full  on time and unconditionally. It is a violationof international legal obligations to do otherwise. Thismust be regarded with the utmost seriousness by MemberStates. It undermines the Organization's ability to operate.It penalizes  through damage to the Organization  thoseMember States that abide by their obligations. When theState responsible for the largest percentage of arrearsowed to the United Nations is also the richest  and whenthat State in addition attaches conditions to the paymentof only a portion of what it owes  it is understandable thatthese actions should generate real scepticism in thisAssembly.This sorry state of affairs must be resolved quickly.But it can be resolved only on the basis of a crediblecommitment that all conditions will be eliminated nowand that all payments will be made on time. And thatmeans in January each year.20I would like to raise another reform issue which hasnot featured prominently in discussions to date  namelyUnited Nations regional groupings. It seems to us that thisis an issue that deserves examination. The groupings are inneed of revision to bring them up to date with present-daygeopolitical realities. It is anomalous  for example  that ourPacific island neighbours  members with us of the SouthPacific Forum grouping  belong to the Asian Group while for historical reasons  New Zealand belongs to the Groupof Western European and Other States. The fundamentalimportance we accord our membership of the institutions ofthe South Pacific Forum  of the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council and of the Regional Forum of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and ourrelationship with ASEAN itself  should be able to be betterreflected in the regional groupings. We accordingly seevalue in a reconfiguration of New York electoral groupingsto bring them more in line with those used elsewhere in theUnited Nations system  where New Zealand in most casessits with our South Pacific partners and our East Asianneighbours.Developments in other regions will result in furtheranomalies in the present structure. We see at a future stagesome long and complex negotiations over regional seatallocations for a revised system of regional groups. NewZealand of course will join with others in negotiating newand equitable allocations of seats. While we look forwardto the outcome of that process  we realize that it will notcome overnight. In the meantime  and as a matter of highpriority  my delegation is working to forge a closerrelationship with the Asian regional group in New York.I would like to close my statement by focusing oncemore on the utmost importance of Member States' givingpositive endorsement to the Secretary-General's package atthis General Assembly  as New Zealand will be doing —not only because it provides a positive and concrete start toa reform process  but also because the alternative of notsupporting the Secretary-General will  in our view seriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations.For two years the United Nations has been involved inthe current reform exercise. But none of us can pretend thatreform is an end in itself  or that introspection is anongoing excuse for inaction. The United Nations exists todeliver concrete  substantive assistance to the hundreds ofmillions most in need. No amount of self-analysis is asubstitute for that. Moreover  sustained emphasis onintrospection will erode the Organization's capacity  andpossibly also its will  to perform the tasks for which it wascreated.The challenge now is to embrace the boldprogramme of reform outlined by the Secretary-General to use this General Assembly to begin to implement it and then to direct our energy where it rightly belongs  totaking practical steps to reduce suffering and build abetter and more peaceful world: like drawing up a solid practical programme for alleviating poverty in the comingdecade; like establishing an international criminal courtwhich will ensure that individuals are held responsible forwar crimes; like supporting and enhancing the UnitedNations capability for preventive diplomacy; and likeinvigorating the United Nations capacity forpeacekeeping.These are the standards by which the real success orfailure of the United Nations will be judged. New Zealandis determined that the verdict will be a positive one.Working together  we can ensure that it is."
"127",5398,"OMN",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  at the outset allow me to take thisopportunity to congratulate you on your election to presideover the work of this  the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly. Your unanimous election reflects theactive role of your country  Ukraine  with which mycountry  the Sultanate of Oman  enjoys relations offriendship and cooperation. We are fully confident that yourdiplomatic capabilities and skills will stand you in goodstead in managing the work of the Assembly at its presentsession. My delegation assures you of its fullest cooperationin making this session a success and in achieving itsdesired objectives.I would also like to pay special tribute to AmbassadorRazali Ismail of friendly Malaysia for his successful andconstructive efforts in steering the work of the GeneralAssembly at its previous session.By the same token  I wish to stress our continuedsupport for the genuine efforts of the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  in restructuring theUnited Nations and in revitalizing its role in all areas ofendeavours.Owing to the arbitrary policy of the current IsraeliGovernment since it came to power in late May of lastyear  the peace process in the middle East is goingthrough a difficult phase. The rigidity of the IsraeliGovernment has manifested itself in the non-implementation of what had been agreed upon with thePalestinian National Authority in Oslo and in its non-recognition of the land-for-peace formula  a principle onwhich the whole of the Madrid Conference was built anda measure which was accepted by all the parties as afoundation for reaching a just and lasting peace.Israel’s failure to comply in good faith with itsinternational commitments and its continuation of buildingsettlements in occupied Arab Jerusalem and otheroccupied Palestinian territories have resulted in thedisruption of the peace process. Therefore  we fullyunderstand the awesome responsibility that falls on thetwo sponsors of the peace process. We are confident thatthey  as well as other peace-supporting nations particularly those of the European Union  are capable ofnarrowing the existing chasm between the Government ofIsrael and the Government of the Palestinian NationalAuthority on the basis of justice and equity that willproduce substantial progress which will restore a climateof trust and cooperation between the Israeli andPalestinian Governments and that will renew hope oncemore among the fraternal people of Palestine as well asamong the people of Israel for life in peace and harmony.My delegation wishes to recall that the status ofJerusalem was one of those issues that were agreed to bedeferred to the final stage of negotiations. However  themeasures being taken by the Israeli Government inJerusalem and its vicinity totally run counter to what wasagreed upon in Madrid in 1991.We therefore call upon the international community toexpress solidarity with the Government of the PalestinianNational Authority in resisting these Israeli policies whichlead to more tension  violence and bloodshed.Proceeding from its conviction of the importance ofthe peace process in the Middle East and the need tocontribute to giving it impetus for further progress  mycountry  the Sultanate of Oman  has actively participated insupporting that process. It continues to adhere to the goalsof establishing peace in the Middle East in accordance withthe relevant resolutions and agreements which have beenconcluded. Therefore  we demand that those agreements beimplemented  since peace is an imperative  and is in theinterests of all peoples in the region  ridding them of allforms of repression  terror  poverty  and hunger.The Sultanate of Oman reaffirms its solidarity with thefraternal people of Palestine and supports the peacefulposition of the Government of the Palestinian NationalAuthority  which aims at Israeli withdrawal from thePalestinian territories occupied since 1967.We call upon the international community to enhancethe peace process by providing its support to theGovernment of the Palestinian National Authority  bothmaterially and psychologically  thus enabling it to establishthe foundations for stability and security in the Palestinianterritories and to build the necessary infrastructures for thePalestinian economy  which is an important factor that willsafeguard what has been achieved and what we hope willbe achieved in the future.We also call upon the people of Israel and all politicalactors in that country to promote and defend the peaceprocess. We also reject all forms of terror  repression andfear  which have had an adverse impact on the nationalinterests of all the peoples in the region  including Israelitself.We reaffirm the desire of Syria to establish a just andcomprehensive peace  a desire it has always reiterated in allinternational forums. We support the Syrian position callingfor the resumption of the negotiations with the currentIsraeli Government from where they ended with theprevious Israeli Government  based on full and completeIsraeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to theboundaries prior to 4 June 1967  with the concomitantmutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a justand comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and inthe region at large.We would also like to reaffirm the importance ofIsraeli withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territoriesto internationally recognized borders  in accordance withSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978). The world haswitnessed the increased tension between Israel andLebanon over the past two years  which has inflictedtremendous financial losses on the Lebanese economy not to mention the killing of innocent civilians and thespread of terror and destruction  which is a natural resultof the continuation of Israel’s occupation of a part ofLebanese territory.The phenomena of violence and terrorism that targetthe lives of innocents require strengthened internationalefforts and a firmer will to stand against these heinousacts. In this regard  I reiterate my country’s condemnationof these phenomena and its absolute rejection of all formsof violence and terrorism. We call on the internationalcommunity to coordinate its efforts to put an end to theseacts and to guarantee that those who commit or advocatesuch crimes be brought to justice.With regard to the situation between the UnitedNations and Iraq  we believe that the implementation ofresolution 986 (1995) and its further extension areimportant steps that deserve the acknowledgement and thecommendation of the international community  for it willalleviate some of the sufferings endured by the brotherlypeople of Iraq. My country has welcomed this andexpresses its satisfaction that the cooperation between Iraqand the Special Commission is being built on afoundation of trust that will certainly enable its newChairman  Ambassador Richard Butler  to submit anappropriate final report on the future of the economicsanctions imposed on Iraq.Despite these encouraging indicators between theUnited Nations and Iraq  some fundamental issues remainthat have yet to register any progress  particularly thequestion of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees of othernationalities  and the return of Kuwaiti properties. Thisquestion is of particular importance and we wouldreaffirm here the urgent need for the United Nations tomake greater efforts and to establish further contacts with2Iraq with the aim of putting this issue to rest  since it islargely related to humanitarian and social matters.My country attaches primary importance to the peaceand security of the Gulf region  cooperation and coexistenceamong its nations and peoples in accordance with theprinciples of international law  peaceful neighbourlyrelations  mutual respect and non-interference in eachother’s internal affairs. On this understanding  we havebeen striving  in the context of the combined efforts of theGulf Cooperation Council  to solve all disputes and sourcesof tension  whatever they may be  between the countries ofthe region through dialogue and peaceful means. Thus  thequestion of Lesser Tunb  Greater Tunb and Abu Musaislands constitutes a dispute that might jeopardize the peaceand stability which we are seeking. In this regard  wesupport all efforts aimed at solving this question throughdirect peaceful dialogue and legal means between theconcerned parties  the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran  in a manner that will safeguardneighbourly relations  stability  security and peace in theregion.With regard to the situation in Somalia  my countryapplauds the efforts recently made by Egypt that led to thesigning of an agreement between the leaders of the Somalifactions. We call on those factions to pursue the peacedialogue among them in order to attain Somali nationalunity. We call upon the United Nations to render concretesupport to Egypt’s efforts to help the Somali factions toimplement their national programme.My country has continuously supported internationalefforts aimed at strengthening international peace andsecurity. In this regard  my country’s announcement at theprevious session of the General Assembly of its accessionto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) emphasizes our policy  which was followed by othersteps represented by its deposit of the instrument ofratification in early 1997 and its initiation of negotiationswith the International Atomic Energy Agency to finalize asafeguards agreement  in accordance with our obligations asset down in the Treaty.The Sultanate of Oman  while taking this historic step certainly hopes to bestow more strength and credibility onthe Treaty  which it considers to be the most importantmultilateral disarmament treaty  by encouraging allcountries that have not yet joined the NPT to do so. In thisregard  we call on Israel in particular to expedite itsaccession to the Treaty and to place all its nuclear facilitiesunder international supervision  which we believe willcreate an atmosphere of trust and confidence and limit thelevel of armament in the Middle East — a move thatwould bring about just and permanent peace to the region.The Chemical Weapon Convention is no doubt animportant multilateral disarmament treaty prohibiting awhole category of weapons of mass destruction amenableto verification measures. All of us have an obligation touphold these measures for the benefit and welfare ofhumanity at large. In order to avoid a similar fate for theNPT  we believe that all nations should accede to it.Preserving the universality and comprehensive nature ofthis Treaty should constitute one of the highest goals onthe international community’s list of priorities.At a time when the international community ispreparing to enter the twenty-first century  the Africancontinent continues to suffer the blight of endless successive wars. These wars have taken the lives ofhundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and createdmore than 6 million refugees and about 12 milliondisplaced persons in the continent.We add our voice to those who have called on theAfrican nations within areas of conflict to exert everypossible effort  including regular negotiations  to providean environment conducive to national reconciliationamong the warring factions and to enable the refugees toreturn securely to their lands through safe passages.My country supports the United Nations role incoordinating worldwide efforts — through internationaldonor agencies  the regional efforts represented by thework of the Organization of African Unity  and countriesthat border those areas of conflict — aimed at achievingprogress and development for the individual in Africa who has and continues to suffer from deprivation  despair poverty  natural disasters and other man-madecatastrophes.The environment is a gift from God  the Almighty to man. Its preservation is a collective responsibilitywhich is not limited by political boundaries. This fact hasbeen proven repeatedly. Therefore  wherever man lives he should do his share to protect the environment and totreat it with wisdom and logic  and be aware of thediverse causes of pollution. We are called upon to commitourselves constantly to the implementation of Agenda 21and its principles declared at the Earth Summit. Suchactions and principles constitute the foundation uponwhich a global partnership and a collective responsibilityhave been erected. Their goal is to end poverty and3hunger and to prevent a decline in health standards and thedegradation of environmental systems. All of these arenecessary preconditions to obtaining sustainabledevelopment  which is the only option open to humanitythat guarantees the future of coming generations and offersprosperity and progress to the present ones.The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a nationalstrategy to protect the environment that aims at achievingbalanced and sustainable development  a strategy that wouldtreat economic  social and environmental considerations onan equal footing. My country has also prepared a nationalplan to combat desertification in the Sultanate in dueimplementation of the United Nations Convention toCombat Desertification. Furthermore  the Sultanate hasestablished an integrated network of natural reservesthroughout the country that will accord with the objectivesof the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Sultanate ofOman has supported various environmental bodies introducing new legislation and updating old environmentallaws in order to meet the requirements of environmentalprotection from the dangers of pollution resulting fromdiverse development activities with a view to guaranteeingthe full implementation of regional and internationalenvironmental agreements. It has also declared every 8January as Omani Day of the Environment.On the regional level  the Sultanate of Oman  in itsefforts to implement the recommendations that stem fromthe Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution byDumping Wastes and Other Matter from ships at sea  hasdeclared its intention to build a bunkering port for ships onits shores in preparation for their adoption in othercountries of the Gulf region.On the international level  the Sultan Qaboos Prize forEnvironmental Preservation  set up by UNESCO  is a truetestimony to the effort by the Sultanate of Oman and itsleader to translate the concept of collective responsibilityfor environmental protection into a practical reality.Protecting the environment and striking a balance betweenthe needs of development and the environment form acornerstone of the declared policy of the Sultanate ofOman. My country looks forward to complementing itseffort with that of the international community in the areasof training  transfer of technology and exchange ofinformation and to getting acquainted with the latestmodern techniques and scientific discoveries in theenvironmental field. In this regard  we call on theinternational community  in particular the developedcountries  to provide the necessary financial and technicalresources to rescue our planet and its natural resources.Since the individual is the centre of development andthe moving force behind the renaissance of modern Omanand is the real support of all development operations  theSultanate of Oman  as of the inception of its moderndevelopment  has focused its attention on improving thewelfare of Omani citizens.In the social domain  the national plans for thedevelopment of the family and of women have beenaccorded the highest priority. Our social developmentplans accord special attention to issues relating to thefamily and to projects that aim at providing the best carefor women and children. The efforts of the Governmentin this regard have culminated in the establishment ofwomen’s rehabilitation centres in different parts of theSultanate. These centres aim to develop women’spotential and to promote their cultural and social standing.Moreover  the Government has played its part byintroducing new laws and legislation that are geared toachieve social security for the family in cases of old age disability and handicap  in order to allow those withdisabilities to be reintegrated in society and to rehabilitatethem for participation in society’s development.The Government has also established developmentplans for women and children with a view to theirpreparation for the future through setting up women’sorganizations based on volunteerism and throughlaunching children’s social services in remote and ruralareas of the country.In this regard  we are happy to note that internationalagencies such as the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF)  have praised the efforts of the Government. Inits report entitled The Progress of Nations 1997  UNICEFillustrated the accomplishments achieved by the Sultanateof Oman in child protection and the country’scommitment to ensuring the rights of the child through itsaccession in 1996 to the Convention on the Rights of theChild. The Sultanate of Oman is the number-one countryin the world in terms of reducing infant under-fivemortality by 74 per cent between 1980 and 1995. Thereport notes:“The proportion of children who reach theirfifth birthday is one of the most fundamentalindicators of a country’s concern for its people.Child survival statistics are a poignant indicator ofthe priority given to the services that help a child toflourish: adequate supplies of nutritious food  theavailability of high-quality health care and easyaccess to safe water and sanitation facilities  as well4as the family’s overall economic condition and thehealth and status of women in the community.” [SeeThe Progress of Nations 1997  page 28]The UNICEF report for the year 1994 also notes that based on the 1992 indicators  the Sultanate of Oman rankedas the number-two nation in the Middle East and NorthAfrica region in terms of girls’ enrolment in primaryeducation.Recently  the achievement of modern development inthe Sultanate of Oman has culminated in the significantachievement of the introduction of the Basic Law of theState  which is considered a milestone in the Sultanate’smodern history. Other serious steps are also under way tostrengthen the participation of women in the legislature  theMajlis Al-Shura.On the economic level  achieving balance and stabilityin macroeconomics and encouraging private enterprise in acompetitive and free environment constitute the futurevision that will guide the Omani economy for the next 25years.We believe that the reaffirmation of the previouslymentioned Basic Law of the State and the adherence tothese principles will be the guiding factor in the country’spolicy of openness that should engender confidence in oureconomy and create the necessary conditions forinvestments.In the area of diversifying the sources of its nationalrevenue  the Sultanate of Oman is in the process ofimplementing several other major projects that are expectedto capitalize on its natural gas discoveries and reserves. Inthis respect  we would like to note in particular that theliquefied natural gas project should begin operation with thefirst shipment in the year 2000. Work has also begun onbuilding the container port in Raysút  in the south of theSultanate  with a view to its becoming a regional andinternational port. It is our hope that this port will serve asa regional focal point for exporters and transitional trade.In addition to these efforts  the Omani Government isin the process of implementing various privatizationprojects through careful study. It is also updating its tax andinvestment laws in accordance with the new spirit of globalpartnership prevailing throughout the world.In accord with this global partnership  the Sultanate ofOman has adopted important measures to implement thenecessary requirements for its membership in the WorldTrade Organization (WTO). It is our fervent hope that thesemeasures will be finalized in order to allow Oman toassume its rightful place in the organization in the nearfuture. Here I would like to recall that  in compliancewith the guidelines of the WTO in the area of intellectualproperty  Oman has completed the formal procedures forbecoming a member of the World Intellectual PropertyOrganization (WIPO). In this vein  the Convention signedat Stockholm on 14 July 1967 has been in force in Omanas of 19 February 1997.On the regional plane  the economic cooperationamong the States members of the GCC is beingstrengthened every day. Moreover  there is agreementamong them with regard to international treaties andorganizations. The member States of the GCC areseriously striving to join the WTO. Coordination betweenthe GCC and other regional and international economicgroupings is something that ought to be noted here aswell.The Sultanate of Oman adheres to a free-marketeconomy and vigorously promotes foreign investments.And in this regard  it has introduced various incentives created the appropriate environment and enacted flexiblelegislation in order to eliminate all the barriers andimpediments that might stand in the way of attractingforeign investors and protecting their rights.Based on this conviction  given our nationaleconomic strategies and in response to internationaldevelopments that attest to the importance of economicgroupings  the Sultanate of Oman participated in the firstMinisterial Meeting for the formal launching of the IndianOcean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) which was held in Mauritius in March 1997. As aresult of many years’ work  in which my country had thehonour to initiate and take part in formative meetings  theIndian Ocean Rim Economic Association was officiallyestablished. This has paved the way for its members towork together towards strengthening economic and tradecooperation between them in one of the important regionsof the world in accordance with the goals and objectivesenshrined in the Association’s charter. These goalsinclude increasing economic linkages  cooperation andinterdependence between the member States and theirpeoples. Besides working with the private and academicsector  members of the Indian Ocean Rim EconomicAssociation are working towards establishing stronger tiesin the areas of technical and scientific cooperation andalso promoting the exchange of investment opportunitiesand mutual economic benefits.5We welcome the national-level initiatives to set upprogrammes to pay arrears to the United Nations. Theadoption of such measures will revitalize the work of theOrganization in all areas  particularly in those areas relatingto organization  administration and finance. This shouldstrengthen the performance of the Organization in the years1998 and 1999 in accordance with the practical frameworkestablished by the General Assembly. At the same time  weurge all States to refrain from setting conditions for theUnited Nations during the payment of their late dues. Suchconditions ignore the will and interests of the internationalcommunity  and are characterized as focusing entirely onshort-term national interests of the States involved. Suchconditions could lead to the further escalation of old andexisting tensions in the world  until appropriate solutionsfor their radical elimination are found. Here we advocatecaution and deliberateness in connection with theelimination of some of the United Nations missions — suchas the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization presently stationed in Jerusalem  and the United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon. These cutbacks might havenegative political and legal implications.Through the United Nations the internationalcommunity has proved its ability to renew its determinationand muster the necessary political will for serious collectivework and cooperation in fostering international peace andsecurity. In this regard the Organization has shoulderedhuge responsibilities and faced complex challenges in itsefforts to restructure its system for the next millenniumthrough the adoption of less costly and more effectivemechanisms for attaining the desired goals.In our view  after all the debates and deliberations inthe General Assembly  the time has now come to have afinal vision of how to expand the Security Council and torestructure it  that Council being the most importantpolitical body charged with the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. While bearing in mind the globaleconomic and political realities  which cannot be ignored the reforms should be of a holistic nature  based on equalityamong nations and equitable geographic distribution. Thereis also the need to establish democracy in the work anddecision-making of the Security Council. The Council’swork also encompasses the development of an actual andprecise picture of the new international order  which shouldbe characterized by justice  security and peace."
"128",5444,"PAK",52,1997,"﻿May I begin with a verse fromthe Holy Koran:(spoke in Arabic)“To each is a goalTo which God turns him;Then strive togetherTowards all that is good.Wheresoever ye are God will bring youTogether. For GodHath power over all things.” (The Holy Koran  II:148)(spoke in English)I convey to you  Sir  and to the nations assembledhere the greetings of our people in this golden jubilee yearof Pakistan’s independence.Soon after achieving its independence  Pakistan wasadmitted to the United Nations. The half-century ofPakistan’s and the United Nations existence has beeneventful. Through years of upheavals and dislocations through turbulence and brief moments of tranquillity  wenow stand at the threshold of a new century and a newmillennium. The theme of world affairs has beentransformed.During these 50 years  Pakistan has demonstrated itscommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charterof the United Nations in word and deed. We havefulfilled our obligations to this Organization. We haveadhered to its resolutions. We have contributed politicallyand materially to its collective endeavour to build peaceand promote prosperity. We are especially proud of ourcontribution to United Nations peacekeeping operationsworldwide.I wish to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his determination and vision in carrying outhis responsibilities. I would like to assure him thatPakistan will  as always  support all initiatives for therealization of the objectives set out in the United NationsCharter.We are fortunate to have a person of your statureand experience  Sir  to guide this session of the GeneralAssembly. The items on its agenda are important andconsequential  particularly the crucial issue of UnitedNations reform. I wish you every success.Doctrines of confrontation and containment are nolonger valid. The new idea of our times is that of globalpartnership between the North and the South  the East andthe West. The United Nations must forge this globalcompact. The creed of our era is peace and development.This is what the United Nations must focus on as itstrives to bring about organizational reform. We supportthe process of reform in the United Nations. In pursuingthis objective  we must bear in mind our successes andfailures of the past 50 years. The centrality and sanctityof the Charter must be preserved as we move towardsreconfiguring the United Nations.The United Nations today stands at the brink ofbankruptcy. The reform cannot and must not be victim tothe narrow strategic  political and administrativepreferences of a chosen few as a means of regaining theOrganization’s solvency. True reform has to take intoaccount the interests of all. The United Nations is auniversal Organization of 185 States and their 6 billionpeople. The purpose of its creation was to serve theinterests of all humankind. This should be the guidingprinciple for its reform.There is undoubtedly need for reform. The map ofthe world has been redrawn. Many new States haveemerged since 1945  when the United Nations wasestablished. The reform that is envisaged must bedesigned to facilitate the objectives for which the United7Nations was created: to promote global peace  security cooperation and prosperity.More than mere lip service must be done to theprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter  such asthe sovereign equality of all its Members and equal rightsfor all nations  large or small. The emergence of five veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council wasthe consequence of an unfortunate afterthought. It wascompletely incompatible with the democratic ethos of theUnited Nations Charter. The result was the impotence andinaction of the United Nations during the cold war years.The legitimization and enlargement of the privileged clubof veto powers would deal a crippling body blow to theability of the United Nations to carry out its responsibilities.The contours of a multipolar world are graduallyemerging. In the event of a resumption of great-Powerrivalries  the proliferation of the veto will once again freezethe Security Council into irrelevance.It is ironical that the countries which practicedemocracy at home and advocate it abroad should want tocreate a new aristocracy of States. Any decision on SecurityCouncil reform that is not backed by the consensus of allthe Member States of the United Nations will erode thecredibility and undermine the legitimacy of the Council andof the United Nations.The Charter of the United Nations rejects hegemony.International peace and security have to be built throughcooperative efforts. This entails the resolution of disputesthrough negotiations  mediation and arbitration. It meansremoving the causes of war and conflict. It involves thepromotion of global prosperity and development. Itnecessitates adherence to the resolutions of the UnitedNations  particularly those of the Security Council.The enforcement of peace should be undertaken onlyin response to actual acts of aggression or breaches. It mustbe pursued collectively and fairly  not imposed arbitrarilyby the strong over the weak. Nowhere does the Charterprovide for pre-emptive penalties against States for armsproliferation or presumed threats to peace.A central weakness of the United Nations is that somemembers are expected to pay their contributions to itsbudget fully  unconditionally and on time  while othersdelay payments. The principle of capacity-to-pay-is fair; itshould not be unilaterally discarded. At the same time alternate sources of funding have to be explored in order tomake the United Nations immune to pressure  unhealthyinfluence and hostile onslaughts.The intention of the Charter was to place the UnitedNations at the apex of the system of internationalorganizations that were created at the end of the SecondWorld War. The Charter rightly perceived political security  economic  social  cultural and humanitarianissues to be interrelated. It therefore called forcoordinated approaches and policies to address thoseissues. To achieve this  it is essential for the UnitedNations to become the central link for the entire family ofinternational organizations  without exception. Only thenwill the world community be able to address successfullythe host of diverse  complex and interrelated problems itconfronts.On its fiftieth anniversary  Pakistan — like theUnited Nations — has embarked upon the course ofreform and renewal. In this endeavour  we are inspired bythe eternal ideals of Islam in which justice  equity andhuman rights  especially those of women and minorities are the central pillars. Islam draws no distinction betweencreeds. It accepts all religions. Thus  the Holy Korandeclares:(spoke in Arabic)“Say ye: We believeIn God  and the revelationGiven to us  and to Abraham Isma¯ ı¯l  Isaac  Jacob And the Tribes  and that givenTo Moses and Jesus  and that givenTo (all) Prophets from their Lord:We make no differenceBetween one and another of them:And we bow to God (in Islam).'” (The Holy Koran II:136)(spoke in English)My Government is vigorously addressing thepolitical  economic and social problems we inherited fromthe past. We have taken measures to consolidateparliamentary democracy through constitutional means; torestore financial equilibrium through austerity andstructural adjustments while enhancing business incentivesand economic liberalization; to combat corruption  drugsand terrorism — which is often sponsored from abroad —through effective law enforcement and speedy and fairjustice.8These policies have yielded dividends. We look to thefuture with hope and optimism. Our economy is open anddynamic. Domestic and foreign investment is growingrapidly. Our people are imaginative  skilful and hard-working. We have demonstrated that we can master themost advanced technologies. We can now deter externalaggression. With confidence in ourselves  we seekfriendship and cooperation with all our neighbours on thebasis of equality.Pakistan strives for peace and stability in its region.We seek an early end to the conflict in Afghanistan; a justand fair settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute inaccordance with the resolutions of the United Nations; anend to the wasteful arms race in South Asia; and thedevelopment of the immense economic and commercialpotential of South and Central Asia.We have the courage to strive for peace and thewisdom to know that it is essential for development. SouthAsia  with one-fifth of the world’s population  remainsmired in poverty and deprivation. I call upon India to joinus in liberating our peoples from the dreadful grip ofpoverty. This can only be achieved by removing the causesof conflict and hostility.The conflict that has ravaged Afghanistan for almosttwo decades must be brought to an end. No country in theworld has suffered more than Pakistan as a consequence ofthe turmoil. We therefore have a vital interest in therestoration of durable peace and stability in Afghanistan.Towards this end we have been in contact with all Afghangroups in support of the efforts of the United Nationsaimed at promoting an intra-Afghan peace process.We favour no faction in Afghanistan. We haverecognized the present authorities in Kabul  as we did theprevious entities that controlled the capital. We haveencouraged moderation and dialogue so that a stable  multi-ethnic Government can emerge. We request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to take specific initiatives forthe early restoration of peace and the preservation of thesovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.My Government has also taken initiatives to resumethe stalled dialogue with India. We had agreed last June ona comprehensive agenda and a mechanism to deal with allissues  including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir  ina sustained manner. We have  unfortunately  not yetsucceeded in setting up the agreed mechanism to launchsubstantive negotiations on all the issues on the agenda ofour dialogue. We hope that India will reciprocate oursincerity of purpose in substantively addressing all theissues and carrying forward this process of dialogue to apositive outcome.The resolutions of the Security Council defineKashmir as a disputed territory whose accession to eitherPakistan or India is to be determined through a plebiscitesupervised by the United Nations. Under the SimlaAgreement of 1972  India agreed to a final settlement ofthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute with Pakistan.The existence of the Kashmir dispute cannot bedenied. The right of self-determination is sacrosanct. Ithas repeatedly been affirmed by the United Nations. Thepeople of Kashmir are justified in asking why this pledgeby the international community has not been honoured asyet. The Security Council cannot be selective in theimplementation of its resolutions.The Kashmiri people have risen against Indianoccupation. Their resolute struggle for the restitution oftheir fundamental rights belies the claim that Kashmir isan integral part of India.I am sad to say that the repression of the people ofJammu and Kashmir continues unabated. More than600 000 Indian troops in Kashmir continue to brutalizethe people. Custodial killings  disappearances  arbitraryarrests and summary executions are daily occurrences.Thousands of Kashmiri civilians have been killed  while32 000 languish in detention centres. I learned just thismorning of the shelling of Arin in Kashmir by the Indianforces yesterday  a mortar attack in which 11 personswere killed and 12 injured. Six children and three womenwere among the dead. This is an altogether familiaroccurrence in occupied Kashmir.If India is serious in its allegation that the conflict inKashmir is being stoked by interference from Pakistan itshould have no hesitation in allowing the United Nationsobservers present in Kashmir to verify this claim. Wehope that the United Nations will increase the number ofthese observers and ask India to allow their stationing onits side of the line of control as well.The international community has a responsibility tobring about a just settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Thepledge of self-determination given to the people ofJammu and Kashmir has to be redeemed. On our part  wewelcome the offers made by the Secretary-General  theUnited States and others to help in resolving the Kashmirdispute.9My Government will persevere in the dialogue withIndia for the sake of our people and the peoples of SouthAsia. We hope that India can be persuaded to take somesteps to create a climate conducive to the success of thetalks. These could include  first  a halt in its campaign ofrepression against the people of Kashmir; secondly  thewithdrawal of at least those Indian troops which areengaged in internal repression in Kashmir; and  finally  theevolution of a mechanism to take into account the wishesof the Kashmiri people  as stipulated by the United Nations for a final settlement.It is imperative now to negotiate arrangements tostrengthen peace and security between India and Pakistan.Since 1974 Pakistan has pursued its proposal for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. On the other hand  Indiahas taken successive steps to escalate its nuclear andmissile capabilities. What does India mean when itrepeatedly asserts that its nuclear option is “open”? Doesthis imply that  like chemical weapons  India has alreadymanufactured nuclear weapons? In the absence of anyassurances to the contrary  Pakistan will have to assume theworst.India’s nuclear-capable Prithvi missile is being seriallyproduced. These missiles specifically target Pakistan. Theyhave been moved adjacent to our borders. This creates ahair-trigger security environment. The development andpossible deployment of the medium-range Agni missile andIndia’s planned acquisition of theatre missile-defencesystems will further aggravate this tense securityenvironment. It will evoke the natural response fromPakistan to safeguard and augment its security anddeterrence capability. India must be persuaded to reverse itsmissile programme.To preserve peace and stability in South Asia andbeyond  we propose that Pakistan and India should reachagreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear andballistic fields. In this context  we are deeply concernedabout India’s acquisition of missiles and its plans for theacquisition of anti-missile systems. We also propose asimilar arrangement for mutual and equitable restraint onconventional weapons which ensures equal security to bothPakistan and India.We are prepared to conclude and strengthenconfidence- building measures. As a first step  we couldagree on a set of principles to guide future bilateral arms-control arrangements.We believe that a just settlement of the Jammu andKashmir dispute and progress on the issues of peace andsecurity will usher in an era of amity and progress inSouth Asia. To facilitate the realization of this objective I offer today  from this rostrum  to open negotiations ona treaty of non-aggression between Pakistan and India.There are many areas in which we can cooperate formutual benefit. Trade liberalization can take place on anequitable basis. Significant foreign investment can bedrawn to the region.In the expectation that the Pakistan-India dialoguewill have made a heartening advance by next year  myGovernment intends to host a regional economic summitin 1998  which could help to open new vistas foreconomic progress and prosperity for our region.All this and much more can be achieved if Indiajoins us in pursuing our current dialogue to its successfulculmination. We have demonstrated our sincerity ofpurpose. It is for India to reciprocate.Located at the nexus of Central Asia  South Asia andthe Middle East  Pakistan can contribute to and gain fromthe economic growth and interaction between thesedynamic regions. The United Nations and its family oforganizations have a crucial role to play in generatingprosperity and restoring peace with justice to these vitalregions of the world.Today  I wish to renew Pakistan’s commitment tothe United Nations  to its purposes and principles and toits vision of a world where genuine peace reigns andprosperity is universal. The vision of the founding fathersof the United Nations must continue to serve as a beaconguiding us across the uncharted waters of the comingmillennium. The Charter of the United Nations and itstimeless principles provide us the anchor to weatherturmoil and turbulence. Let us renew our determination todefend and preserve this anchor of hope and faith. Let notpolitical expediencies infringe or erode the fundamentalsof international cooperation enshrined in the Charter.We in Pakistan  who had dared to dream of freedom50 years ago  are resolved to defend freedom — freedomfrom war  oppression  injustice  poverty and deprivation.Let us all move together towards realizing the vision ofthe United Nations.10"
"129",5487,"PAN",52,1997,"﻿The tragedy of the millions of human beings who aresuffering the ravages of poverty affects Panama verydeeply. This is a deplorable scourge which has reachedintolerable levels. Those of us present here are facing theshameful paradox of having produced the highest level ofwealth ever known to mankind while at the same timehaving the highest level of unemployment in oureconomies in history.Poverty and exclusion are the battlefronts that callfor political and moral will. From this standpoint  Panamais concerned that the tenor of this debate on the financialor military attributes of the many aspirants to membershipof the Security Council may make us forget why theOrganization was created.Panama  a founding Member of the United Nations signed the Charter of the United Nations to give a voiceto those who had been silenced by colonialism and tothose who clamoured for justice  freedom and18development; to restore dignity to peoples such as mine thathad been deprived of their sovereign rights; and to givethose who had been discriminated against and persecutedthe right to dream about a better world in which no onewould be hated for the color of his skin or his beliefs  orfor being part of a given ethnic group  or of one gender orthe other.Panama signed that beautiful document  a tribute tothe humble of the Earth  in order to give democraticinstitutions  civil and political rights and multilateral forumsto all those people — men and women of good will — whodid not want war to return  destroying their homes  legacies cities and towns and plots of land. They also did not wantto see war rub out entire generations by sacrificing them toobsession  fanaticism and extremism.Like many others here  Panama signed the SanFrancisco Charter so that the poor of the world and thosesuffering from disease and malnutrition would have two ofthe simplest and most moving of human attributes: faithand hope.The more than 50 years that have passed since thenhave brought about considerable advances that havechanged the face of the world. Many of them would nothave been possible  however  if cooperation had notimprinted a new meaning and purpose on our Organization.In fact  few vestiges of colonialism remain to be solved;ethnic groups and nationalities  prohibited cultures and theprosecuted now work together in pride to design apolychromatic world that calls for equality in difference andtolerance towards diversity.The number of nations which are Members of theUnited Nations has increased three-fold  and its agendareflects their pain  suffering  struggles and aspirations. Itsorientation and contents have changed  and everyone hasbeen given a forum in which to express his opinions andfind support and understanding.If a planning board had tried to identify  as is nowproposed  which problem had priority and deservedattention  financing and debate  the Security Council wouldnever have met in my country  Panama  nor would thatevent have changed so decisively the course of negotiationswhen Panama attempted to regain its sovereignty and itsCanal.There are important achievements in the daily life ofthe United Nations. However  none of them would havebeen possible if the United Nations had not attained thequality  the representative nature and the legitimacy thatit has achieved through universality. It must be recognizedthat there remain unacceptably acute differences anddeficiencies  which are becoming more serious and areconstantly and forcibly knocking at the very doors of ourhomes.At the same time  thousands of people are dyingbefore our very eyes because of hunger  intolerance hatred  terrorism  fratricidal warfare  authoritarianism andviolence; thousands of children are looking at us throughtelevision screens with languid and sad eyes  only tobecome mere statistics at the end of the programme.There are still those who peddle illusions  who wouldhave us believe that conflicts reside at the end of a rifleand that they can be resolved by having more powerfulrifles. The figures on what the world spends on weaponsare so disproportionate when compared to expendituresfor development that only mentioning them makes usashamed.We should have already learned the lesson that whenpeople are motivated  for whatever reason  there is nobullet or defence system  no matter how sophisticated that can eliminate the causes of conflict; that theinstruments of force can lower the fever but they cannoteliminate the turmoil which causes it; and that there is nomilitary solution to social and political problems. History life's teacher  shows us that violence usually is the result not the cause  of conflict; that war is more often than notthe symptom rather than the cause of the ills; and that theonly way to resolve conflicts and the violence that goesalong with them is to act on their true  underlying causes:hunger  malnutrition and extreme poverty and the lack ofmeans to overcome them; ethnic  gender and culturaldiscrimination; intolerance and authoritarianism;fundamentalism and political and religious persecution;unemployment  slave labour and immoral salaries;humiliation and national oppression. The majority of uswho came here over 50 years ago  as well as the manywho arrived later  did so in order to find solidarity and totake refuge in the realm of law  not to shield ourselves ina new military alliance or to take shelter in the shadow ofa cannon. Circumstances then forced us to live under anominous nuclear balance which made the interrelations ofmilitary forces the determining factor in internationalrelations.19Today — under a completely different setting in whichthe balance of power is measured in terms of the potentialand economic strength of markets — nothing compels us tocontinue to live under the model of the cold war.The greatest impending threat to international peaceand security is poverty  whose reach is as extensive as thatof the most pervasive of plagues. Which current or futureSecurity Council member's army will be able to put an endto the threat if it is the mother of all illnesses andresentments and harvests more human lives than anybacteria  virus or ancient or modern plague?If what we are contemplating is a resurgence of theold and festering conflicts which were frozen by the coldwar  would we not be substituting the ancient balance ofbipolar nuclear terror for a new and expanded militaryalliance to resolve those conflicts under the umbrella of theUnited Nations?Panama certainly does not believe that force is notnecessary as a deterrent  nor are we unaware that such atool in responsible hands is useful  particularly when it islegitimated by world-wide consensus  as the Charterproposes.What concerns us is that most of the discussion in theworld about the reform of the United Nationsdisproportionately stresses the use of force and disregardswhat is important  and indeed imperative — that is to say cooperation for development.Hence  to assert that the most important function ofthe United Nations is to have a big force to maintaininternational peace and security  while at the same timeproposing the reduction  streamlining and elimination of theOrganization's social and humanitarian components  raisesimportant questions about the final nature of our reform andmodernization exercise.To maintain that financial and material contributionsto peacekeeping operations should be decisive indetermining who can and who cannot sit on the Council while at the same time stating that social and humanitariantasks  development programmes and environmentalprotection programmes should be placed in other kinds ofmanagement and organization categories  greatly concernsus. This compendium of proposals must be rebalanced andgiven its proper dimension.If what we are going to discuss is the package  thenthe only one we should talk about is the package of thefundamental principles of the United Nations alreadyenshrined in the Charter.From that integral perspective  the purpose ofpolitically and financially strengthening the Organization and the Security Council in particular  is to ensure that itcan fully discharge its major mission: the promotion ofsocial and economic and human development as the mosteffective way to prevent conflicts.The profound developments in the last 50 years havechanged the international community. The deepest changehas occurred in the parameters of  and the language usedto define  relations among countries. The Powers of thepast no longer exist  and new Powers are emerging —even though there are obvious military weaknesses.It is no longer war that marks the trend towardscontemporary development or the course or content ofinternational life. Why organize the United Nations on thebasis of what no longer exists? Now it is peace  trade  thesharing of the fruits of knowledge and technology  andthe deep changes designed to ensure higher levels oftolerance and open-mindedness that are features ofinternational coexistence. It is not military tools to preventwar that have to be strengthened but  rather  the tools tobuild peace  to achieve international cooperation  as isstated in the Charter  in solving international problems ofan economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for humanrights and for fundamental freedoms for all (Article 3).International peace is not guaranteed by rifles or cannons or by one or several allied Powers. This has been provedby recent  and not so recent but no less painful experiences.The small and brave country Uruguay  which makesthe highest per capita contribution for peace-keeping  hastaught us such a good lesson in this respect.If it is true that the greatest restriction on creativity thought and intelligence is dialectically established bylanguage itself  then we have to cast aside once and forall the language and the thinking process left over fromthe cold war. We must design something that moreappropriately represents what we wish to do.Panama does not feel that its juridical status hasbeen diminished when it acknowledges that somecountries have special attributes or can better dischargethe tasks of the Security Council. On the one hand  theproblem is to define these tasks  to determine whether20what we want is a guardian or a promoter of developmentand cooperation. On the other hand  the problem relates tothe degree of responsibility a member of the Council hasvis-a-vis the rest of us. For  if its membership of theCouncil is based solely on its individual attributes —rejecting any kind of representation of us — then it can sitin that seat in the Council until someone simply wrests theseat from it by violence.Everything indicates that we should define these tasksin a coherent manner in keeping with the whole set ofpurposes of the United Nations. From this standpoint  eachregion has to determine the degree of representativity andresponsibility that its members should have  as well as whocan occupy those seats. It is difficult to think that after theMembers of the United Nations have acquired such longand productive experience of working in regional groupsand organizations  everything would be discarded in orderto vote for a country on an individual basis. We would liketo know what benefit there would be in reigning in avacuum.Furthermore  neither ideological nor military blocsappear any longer on the map of the world  nor shouldgeographical distribution alone. These have been nothingbut obsolete instruments which have served to drawsimplistic and arbitrary borders and  hence  to face us attimes with tragedies.This new international reality must be fullyrecognized. The new borders that are now forming aretrade  ethnic  religious  and cultural borders  and it isprecisely because they were disregarded during the coldwar that we are still faced today with all these upheavals.It is those upheavals that seduce even the most conservativeamong us into being guided by one of the left-over thoughtsof the bipolar world — vis pacem para bellum.On the other hand  if we really feel comfortable withone-third of the membership not rotating and two-thirds ofthe membership rotating  then it would be sane andjudicious for any expansion to maintain those proportions which practice has shown to be efficient and which havebeen agreed to.Why  then  should we go on using language that drawsa distinction between the regular budget and thepeacekeeping budget? This accounting dichotomy becamea policy and crudely revealed how individual interests couldseparate the package from the founding principles  to suchan extent that they would be truly contradictory. There arethose who say that it is shameful for the regular budget tohave to be financed out of the peacekeeping budget. Iwould say that it is even more shameful that thedisproportion in amounts  both in payments and involuntary contributions  is so overwhelming that the socialand humanitarian functions are now secondary to thesecurity functions  as if  in the final analysis  civic-actionprogrammes are dependent upon military operations. Thisreflects the unstated reversal of focus between thesecondary: the operations for the maintenance of security and the primary: the human-development programmes.A single budget  which conforms to a periodicallyagreed-upon political strategy  should respond in eachcase to the changing challenges of the new internationaldynamism. In our view  it is not compatible with the newspirit of democratization in our Organization or with thenew international realities for one or a few countries tosubsidize the entire budget in a disproportionate way  forthis can lead to the danger of concentrating the decision-making power and thereby affecting the Organization'sfunctioning.In the final analysis — and we do not want to givelessons to anyone — we feel that what is necessary is agood arsenal of general and flexible criteria  the key tothe search for consensus — that is  representativity legitimacy  non-discrimination  equity and legal equality.We must move from the particular and discuss individualaspirations  in order to design a compendium of criteriathat would be applicable to all  whether or not their seatson the Security Council rotated.From that standpoint  we think that we should notdiscuss the veto in the abstract  as a privilege or as acategory in and of itself. With the passage of time  therehas been a distortion in the original spirit of the Charter under which the members of the Security Council were torepresent in the Security Council the general interests ofthe international community  not act in accordance withtheir exclusive military or political strategic interests.In that context  part of the reform should be thenegotiation of an agreement restricting the use of the vetoto what is stipulated in Chapter VII and to what wasagreed in the gentlemen's agreement in London 1948.From that standpoint  we need a formula that canprevent a single country from standing in the way of thegeneral interest. One such formula would be allowingvetoes to be overridden by a two-thirds majority. Theoptimal solution  of course  would be to get rid of theveto.21Let me here and now thank the public and privatesectors of the international community for the support andsolidarity given to my country during the UniversalCongress on the Panama Canal.This is a good opportunity to report that Panama iscontinuing to take the necessary legislative andadministrative steps to turn this international public serviceover to an agency that would be constitutionallyautonomous — administratively  politically and financially.Panama is certain that scrupulous observance of thisautonomous status will make the interocean waterway morecompetitive and more efficient and will also allow theagency to take advantage of the many opportunities thatwill be created by the Canal’s upcoming incorporation intothe Panamanian economy.We must remember that until now military needs forthe Canal have always been dominant  and this has made itimpossible to exploit the Canal’s many competitiveadvantages for trade and international civil-maritimeactivities. From this standpoint  Panama’s greatest strategicconcern during the transition process has been to gaincomplete control of the Canal so as to undertake a vast multimillion-dollar programme to modernize and widen it.This programme includes widening the Gaillard Cut — acritical area for ships crossing from the waters of LakeGatun — as well as the systematic studies undertaken incooperation with the United States  Japan and the EuropeanUnion in order to construct the third system of locks  whichwill allow passage of ships weighing up to 150 000 dead-weight tons.Given the international importance of the Panamanianinteroceanic waterway  we intend to announce formally tothis General Assembly session that  in order to ensurerespect for the neutrality of the Panama Canal  Panama willconduct its external relations in such a way as to reduceinternational tension and conflict and not to get embroiledin issues that would require us to take sides for or againstmembers of the international community with which wehave friendly relations  or for or against the community asa whole. We are convinced that this new policy is the mostimportant contribution Panama can make to internationalpeace and security.From this standpoint  we will concentrate our effortson contributing to understanding  cooperation and friendlyrelations among peoples and governments. The PanamaCanal  as an international public service  must be open toall users  public and private  regardless of the flag they flyor the economic system they represent.In this regard  we are pleased by our admission tothe pro tem secretariat of the Rio Group as of 1998  andwe are committed from now on to undertaking intensivediplomatic efforts to strengthen the Group’s role as aleading forum for interregional and intra-regionaldiscussion and political understanding."
"130",5534,"PER",52,1997,"﻿It is an honour for me to take part in thisGeneral Assembly as the representative of the people andGovernment of Peru  under the leadership of PresidentAlberto Fujimori. I extend my congratulations to you  Mr.President  on your election to preside over this sessionand assure you of the fullest support by the delegation ofPeru. We likewise congratulate Ambassador Razali Ismail President of the previous session.Peru reaffirms its unfailing dedication to thepurposes  principles and norms enshrined in the Charterof the United Nations  without whose faithful applicationit is not possible to achieve peace and harmoniouscoexistence among States. We must all ensure respect forinternational law  especially scrupulous and good-faithcompliance with treaties  and must contribute to themaintenance of international peace and security andparticipate in the promotion of economic and socialdevelopment. Accordingly  effective observance of theCharter and respect for its principles are today morenecessary than ever in order to endow multilateralismwith renewed credibility and vigour. We live in a day ofmarked change in the organization of power and ofglobalizing trends in the international system whichrequire  in keeping with the Charter  a scrupulousegalitarianism in relations between States and accordingly  multilateral policies in keeping with thetimes as an appropriate means of conferring priority onthe common goals of mankind in our era.Institutional reform of the United Nations system isimperative to make it more efficient  adapt it to thepresent needs of the international community andconsolidate institutions that will be truly representative ofthe interests we all share.For four years now the General Assembly has beenat work on the reform of the Security Council. Nationalpositions have already been made known and reiterated.We should now decide whether we shall embark on thenegotiations proper or whether that should be deferreduntil better political conditions prevail  for theunproductive prolongation of this debate could affect the8prestige and authority of the Organization at a juncturewhen it is essential instead to strengthen it as the supremeworld forum for dialogue  understanding and cooperation.We are aware of the difficulty of this process. Tothose who have a duty to exercise their power with self-restraint we address an invitation to be flexible. We alsobelieve that pressures or haste would be ill advised  sincethey could hinder the achievement of a legitimate and vitalgoal.Peru believes it is necessary to make the SecurityCouncil representative  to enhance its legitimacy  to secureequitable geographical representation through its expansion to give it greater transparency  and to take the first stepstowards the abolition of the veto through strict limits on itsuse. Accordingly  Peru supports the increase of bothcategories of members. All of the foregoing should beachieved through a legitimate agreement that does notdiscriminate against developing countries.To keep pace with the momentum generated by globalproblems  a new institutional structure is needed  such asthat proposed by the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  in his“A Programme for Reform.” In order better to serveinternational peace and stability and the sustained growth ofthe world economy  renewed efforts are needed that will bein keeping with the diversity of Member States.We support the strengthening of the Secretariat  theemphasis on the promotion of development and therecommendation for rationalizing and optimizing the use ofits financial resources  as well as the transfer of theresources thus released to development cooperationactivities.The Human Development Report for 1977 reveals thatthe problem of internally displaced persons has taken ondramatic dimensions; the numbers increased fivefold duringthe decade 1984-1994. At the same time  we note in thereport submitted by the representative of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights concerninginstitutional lacunae in this area of the United Nations thatthere is no institution with exclusive responsibility for suchdisplaced persons.We propose that at this session of the GeneralAssembly  which the Secretary General has called thereform Assembly  the question of institutional responsibilityfor the internally displaced be addressed.Peru favours the idea of unifying the country officesand operations of the agencies to facilitate theimplementation of comprehensive programmes in whichthe United Nations system will be able to put itsrecognized capacities to full use.No reform can be successful without the necessaryfinancial resources. The financial situation of theOrganization is a subject of widespread concern. Peru isof the view that contributions to the regular budget are alegal obligation that should be fully and promptlydischarged. The principle of capacity to pay shouldremain the fundamental criterion in the apportionment ofassessments. Accordingly  if States in arrears do not takeconcrete measures to clear their indebtedness  certainlywithout setting conditions  it will not be possible in atimely manner to earmark resources for activities essentialto the majority of our countries. Such is the case  forexample  with the campaign against poverty.There are other key questions on our increasinglyabundant international agenda. We must place increasingemphasis on economic and social issues  cooperation fordevelopment  environmental protection  humanitarianassistance  the advancement and defence of human rightsand  of course  the fight against illegal drug trafficking terrorism and corruption.Peru approaches the development of the internationalsystem on the basis of four criteria that guide its foreignpolicy: the pre-eminence of representative democracy andthe rule of law; the promotion of the fundamental rightsof the human person; consolidation of the marketeconomy and development of regional economicintegration agreements; and the search for peace and theadvancement of cooperation for development.In the era of globalization  Peru views internationalpeace and security as multidimensional tasks. If States areto assume them as real commitments and priorities  theymust be associated with a higher purpose  namely  withimproving the intolerable lot of some 60 per cent of theworld's population.Problems such as poverty  acute poverty  illiteracy malnutrition  infant mortality  discrimination andmarginalization in general constitute a picture of potentialsocial violence that threatens the universal ideal of apeaceful and orderly life. The plight of poverty and thechallenge of promoting human development haveradically altered the direction and pace of internationalrelations.9The international system is tending towards a gradualdemilitarization. With the end of the cold war and thereduced risk of a global military confrontation  conditionshave been created to give priority  on the basis of dialogueand cooperation  to the long-delayed task of advancingeconomic and social development.General and complete disarmament continues to be akey element in security and an abiding goal of theinternational community. Peru attaches special importanceto non-proliferation in all its aspects  primarily nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. My countryparticipated actively in the arduous negotiations thatculminated in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyand signed it on the day it was opened for signature.We are gratified at the outcome of the OsloDiplomatic Conference  in the context of the Ottawaprocess to prohibit the production  transfer andindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines  in whichPeru has participated as a full member from the outset. Weare preparing to sign the global agreement in December.The Rio Group has undertaken to make our region the firstin the world to be free of these odious devices  which dayafter day continue to take their toll of thousands of innocentvictims.Peru is a peace-loving country that works for peaceand repudiates conflict. We want to strengthen political andeconomic cooperation with all countries and groups ofcountries in various regions on the basis of commoninterests and mutual benefit. We emphasize especially theforging of closer ties of friendship and cooperation withneighbouring countries and fostering mutual trust throughspecific processes  mechanisms and measures that we arevigorously pursuing.Without economic growth  there can be no creation ofwealth or jobs  and without these there can be nodevelopment or prosperity. That is the great challenge ofour time. We must act to create conditions of markettransparency and social convergence in order to sustain thegrowth of the world economy  the opening andliberalization of trade  services and capital flows and thetransfer of technology. Developed and developing countriesmust reach an understanding in order to avoid a return tothat not-so-distant past when narrow forms of protectionismand conditionalities failed to overcome inequality and indeed  aggravated it.Globalization must not lead to greater poverty anddiscrimination  for they are one of the principal obstacles tostability  and  on the eve of the twenty-first century  theyalso pose a moral challenge. We must adopt measures toincorporate disadvantaged societies into policies andprocesses that promote economic growth and socialdevelopment.In Peru  the campaign for the gradual reduction ofpoverty until its eradication has taken a comprehensiveapproach. Its focal points are openness  modernization andliberalization of the economy  reform of the State and alegal framework that guarantees property and promotesinvestment. In addition  we are pursuing consistentsectoral policies  financed by 40 per cent of our nationalbudget going to items in the social sphere  such as health housing  education  population and justice. The resultsalready achieved in economic and social growth are wellknown  and Peru is considered a stable  secure countrywith a bright future. Around the year 2000  the PeruvianGovernment hopes significantly to reduce acute povertyand poverty in general.The United Nations has primary responsibility foraddressing three negatives trends of universal scope: illicitdrug trafficking  terrorism and corruption. We arecombating vigorously these criminal phenomena becausethey erode fundamental values and threaten the stabilityof democracies. The upcoming special session of theGeneral Assembly on the question of drugs — a sessionthat we fully support — calls for unity of purpose. Theinternational community will have an excellentopportunity to tackle this problem in all of its dimensions.Peru has been achieving concrete results in all facets ofthis comprehensive campaign  not only in interdiction butalso in crop eradication and alternative development. Wehope to see a substantial increase in internationalcooperation that would help step up our anti-drug policyand would complement  even if only partially  thetremendous national efforts that we have been making.We hope that this enhanced cooperation will materialize in view of the increased awareness and greater politicalwill that have emerged worldwide regarding a problemfor which all of us  without exception  shareresponsibility.The Eighth International Anti-CorruptionConference  which took place three weeks ago in thecapital of Peru  brought together more than 600representatives from 93 countries. I wish to highlight theset of recommendations that emerged for combatingpublic and private corruption. These are contained in theLima Declaration  the first global document of its kind. Itestablishes an evaluation and follow-up mechanism that10will bring these recommendations to the attention ofGovernments and international institutions. The goalhenceforth in this endeavour  which concerns Governmentsand citizens equally  will be to identify specific problemareas  taking into account public opinion and with theeffective participation of civil society.The United Nations  as the global framework forcombating corruption in all its manifestations  mustparticipate in these efforts  just as the inter-Americansystem has been doing within its own geographical area.The phenomenon of terrorism has  at the cost ofcountless innocent human lives and huge material losses today placed itself on the agenda of contemporaryinternational relations. We have already unequivocally andat all levels condemned terrorist acts and the criminalgroups that perpetrate them  and we have also agreed thatterrorist acts represent human rights violations. It is nowtime to undertake a process of consultation that will enablethe international community to avail itself of universal legalinstruments with which to combat effectively terrorism inall its forms and manifestations  as we are striving to do onour continent.Five years after the adoption of the plan of action ofthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992  the lack ofprogress on Agenda 21 is discouraging. There has been anerosion of the political commitment entered into  especiallywith respect to the allocation of new and additionalresources  as well as scant willingness to transfertechnology to the developing countries.We reaffirm that only a comprehensive approach canlead to the achievement of sustainable development because this requires a consolidation of the process of theopening and liberalization of trade  as well as commercialand environmental policies that are mutually supportive. Anadequate transfer of financial resources and technologies tosupport national policies is also required. In this task  noState should shirk its individual responsibility.One of the challenges facing the internationalcommunity is to ensure the effective promotion and fullobservance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.The advancement and protection of human rights are centralconcerns of the Peruvian Government. The concept ofhuman development  which underlies the entire economicand social policy of our State  focuses on a revalorizationof life and of the human being. The cooperation of theUnited Nations is essential  through a realistic approach thattakes due account of regional and national characteristicsand that is geared primarily to achieving a culture ofhuman rights.Many countries  including Peru  are currently facinga cyclical  worldwide natural phenomenon known as ElNiño  whose severe economic  environmental and socialconsequences are drastically changing the marineenvironment  which is a source of food and employmentfor broad sectors of humankind. The damage that theselarge-scale oceanic and atmospheric changes did in thepast prompted my country some decades ago to promotethe study of this phenomenon. Thus in 1974 a regionalstudy of El Niño was carried out in the framework of thePermanent South Pacific Commission  a subregionalorgan of the South-East Pacific Action Plan  which hascontinued to address this problem with the valuablesupport of organizations such as the IntergovernmentalOceanographic Commission and the WorldMeteorological Organization.The knowledge acquired by Peru and other countries as well as by international  regional  and world bodies needs to be integrated and systematized. Accordingly Peru proposes the establishment of a global programmeof integrated cooperation on the El Niño phenomenon which would enable our countries to mitigate its effectsand the ensuing material damage. In order to lay thefoundations of this program and set it in motion  weshould consider holding an international meeting with theparticipation of the relevant agencies of the system regional organs and the respective national programmesof the countries concerned. In this context  we proposethat  as part of the reform of the United Nations system its operational capacity in the area of the monitoring andthe mobilization of assistance for natural disasters bemaintained and strengthened.The development policy now being implemented inPeru is anchored in the universal concepts  values andprinciples propounded by the United Nations: democracy economic freedom  respect for the fundamental rights ofthe human person  environmental conservation  theadvancement of women and protection of the rights ofindigenous populations.Responding to the dictates of its history andgeography  Peruvian society has since ancient timesembodied the ideal of unity within diversity. WePeruvians are laying the foundations of our own future. Ishall not dwell on the policies that we have been pursuingfor the last seven years  their impressive results or the11vicissitudes in this process that have tested our resolve andperseverance. But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat theprincipal characteristic of our development model  which isa harmonious and rational complementary relationshipbetween economic and social policies  which for the firsttime in many years is enabling us to carry out a realisticstrategy for sustainable human development. Accordingly the modern and efficient functioning of the United Nationssystem of cooperation is now  more than ever  of strategicvalue to Peru. I should like in particular to express thanksfor the cooperation that the United Nations system has beenproviding to the Peruvian people  which is stimulating andcomplementing our national effort.The United Nations is the best instrument available ata global level to consolidate international peace andsecurity  respect for the sovereignty and independence ofStates and international law  and for the promotion ofeconomic and social development. Accordingly  itsoperations  approaches and strategies should provideeffective answers to the challenges of the contemporaryworld and the needs of our peoples  who continue to placetheir hopes in our Organization. Peru will always remaincommitted to that endeavour."
"131",5581,"PHL",52,1997,"﻿I am pleased to extend toyou  Sir  on behalf of my delegation  our most sincerefelicitations on your election to the presidency of thefifty-second session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly.8We also wish to congratulate His Excellency Tan SriRazali Ismail  our colleague in the Assembly and ourpartner in the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)  for his strong leadership as the President of thefifty-first session.We take great pleasure in congratulating HisExcellency Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We commitourselves to working with him for the improvement of ourOrganization.Next year the Philippines will commemorate thecentenary of its proclamation of independence. Next yearalso the Philippines is scheduled to conduct the most sacredexercise that democracy requires: electing national leadersthrough the popular will. As we mark our first century asthe first Republic to arise in Asia  and as we prepare tochoose those who will lead our country into the twenty-firstcentury  we reflect on what we have achieved as a countryand as a member of our community of nations. Todaypeace reigns in my country. Where there was strife  thereis now national reconciliation. Where there was violentrebellion  there is now progress and hope.Last year  with the wisdom and guidance of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  in particularthe OIC’s Committee of Six  under the enlightenedleadership of Indonesia and with the active support ofLibya  the Philippine Government and the Moro NationalLiberation Front (MNLF) concluded a historic agreementthat brought peace to Mindanao after more than a quartercentury of open secessionist rebellion. The leader of theMNLF is now the elected Governor of the AutonomousRegion of Muslim Mindanao and Chairman of the SouthernPhilippines Council for Peace and Development. MNLFfighters are now being integrated into the armed forces ofthe Philippines and the Philippine National Police.Indeed  there is much for us to celebrate as a nationand as a Republic. And this gives us even greater reason toreflect on the world and to ask ourselves fundamentalquestions about its present state and its emerging future.One such question that comes to mind is this: Is ourworld a safer place? The end of the cold war has in a sensemade it so. But is the world safe enough when we continueto live under the threat posed by weapons of massdestruction? Fortunately  the conclusion of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year and theongoing review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons give us some added security.We must not stop here. Let us pursue negotiationson the complete and total elimination of nuclear weaponsby a certain time. This call is already supported by theInternational Court of Justice  which last year recognizedthat all States have an obligation to pursue suchnegotiations in good faith.On 27 March 1997 the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty entered into force. On that day the world of nuclear weapons became much smaller. Wenow urge the nuclear-weapon States to support the Treatyby becoming parties to its Protocol. At this session wewill once again consider the initiative of consolidatingexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones and of promotingcooperation among them with a view to the totalelimination of such weapons.Global safety also demands control of theproliferation of conventional arms  particularly small armsand anti-personnel landmines  whether deployed or innational stockpiles. In Oslo earlier this month the Ottawaprocess produced  after less than a year  the text of atreaty banning anti-personnel landmines. We will sign thistreaty in December. We will also continue to support thenoble efforts of the Organization  of individualGovernments and of non-governmental organizations toclear minefields  to assist mine victims and to rehabilitateareas plagued by these infernal devices.At the dawn of the post-cold-war era  we mustacknowledge that the potential for the most seriousconflict has shifted almost entirely from the global to theregional level. In the Asia-Pacific region  the Associationof South-East Asian Nations  in response to this newreality  has led in creating the ASEAN Regional Forum a ministerial-level  multilateral forum for promotingregional-security dialogue and cooperation. Today in theAsia-Pacific region dialogue and cooperation are the pre-eminent modes for securing peace.However  the disputes in the South China Searemain a source of tension for our region. In 1992 ASEAN issued  at Manila  a Declaration on the SouthChina Sea  which called for the settlement of disputesexclusively by peaceful means and for the exercise ofself-restraint by all of the claimants. Other States haveendorsed this Declaration. We are determined to advancetowards a settlement of these disputes in conformity withinternational law  including the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea  while avoiding all actsinimical to stability and a sense of security in the region.9Like many here  we were saddened by the recentevents in the political life of Cambodia. We in ASEANhave initiated a dialogue to address the Cambodian issue even as we look forward to the early admission ofCambodia into the ASEAN family.On the Korean peninsula  we hope that the currenttalks will lead not only to large dividends of peace but alsoto greater cooperation towards economic growth andprogress for East Asia.In South Africa  following the collapse of apartheid we are witnessing bold and sincere efforts towards deepernational reconciliation. In other parts of Africa we seeactive regional cooperation to promote peace and justice inthe aftermath of terrible conflicts. In Liberia  in particular we welcome the holding of free and fair elections with thesupport of the international community  led by theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).In the Middle East  peace is gravely imperilled byterrorism and political aggression. We call on all parties torenounce all forms of violence and intimidation to preservethe peace process that was begun only a few years ago tothe applause of the whole world.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  where much remains to bedone  we regret the deterioration of civil order andcondemn the violence directed against United Nationspersonnel.In Latin America  we welcome the honourabletermination of the civil war that had raged in Guatemala for36 years.Is the world a safer place for the world itself? Theenvironment of our planet is under threat. Our responsemust be to accelerate implementation of Agenda 21 in linewith the programme adopted last June. As a priority  wemust address the lack of financial resources  technology know-how and international cooperation that inhibits thepromotion of worldwide sustainable development.This December we will meet again to discuss a legallybinding instrument under the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change to control harmfulemissions. We must agree now on emission reductiontargets  particularly for those who have emitted too muchfor far too long.How safe  we should also ask  is the world for theindividual human being? We can answer positively onlywhen it becomes universally accepted that every humanbeing has rights inherent in his or her person  and that allbasic rights — political  civil  social and economic —must be in balanced harmony with one another. Thus  aslong as human rights are violated  as long as the right todevelopment is vitiated  as long as the rights of womenare not fully respected  as long as people are traded likechattels  as long as migrant workers  especially womenmigrant workers  are abused and exploited  we cannot saythat the world is a safer place for the individual humanperson.We must protect our women. We must act on thedecisions we reached in Beijing  and we must do more todeepen and broaden respect for the rights of womenthrough the use of existing human rights agreements andmechanisms.We must protect our children. We must effectivelyimplement the Convention on the Rights of the Child  andwe must append to this Convention a protocol that wouldorganize global measures against child slavery prostitution and pornography.In addition  we call for universal adherence to theInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rightsof All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.The protection of human rights finds its mosteffective guarantees in democracy. Any threat todemocracy also poses a direct and indirect threat to therights of the human person. Today  in many countries including my own  democracy is no longer endangered bythe extreme political left or right. Rather  the threats todemocracy are more base and more insidious. Amongthem are terrorism and the illicit traffic in narcotics.With the objective of creating a regional consensuson how best to address the issue of illicit drugs and othertransnational crimes  the Philippines will next year hostthe regional ministerial meeting for Asia and the Pacificon organized transnational crime and corruption. For thismeeting  we hope to take inspiration from and add to theconsensus achieved in the regional meetings held inAfrica and Latin America.Our efforts to make the world a safer place  and tosafeguard the rights of the individual  would lose much oftheir meaning if we were unable to answer the basicquestion: have the opportunities for growth and economicprogress improved?10The rising tide of globalization has broughtunprecedented opportunities for the developed anddeveloping worlds alike. The acceptance of market-orienteddevelopment and of free trade by an increasing number ofdeveloping nations has expanded their participation in thegrowth and commerce of the global economy. Yet thebenefits of globalization remain unevenly distributed.Developing countries still suffer from the old problems ofexternal debt and of protectionism in developed-countrymarkets.The recent currency turbulence in East Asia  theregion with the best long-term growth prospects in theworld  is a sobering reminder that globalization can causeinstability even where it has generated the greatest growth.The existence of unbridled international speculation and ofother market ills that hinder rather than help developmentis a powerful rationale for strengthening the United Nationsrole in global development.Only in the United Nations can we work to share among rich and poor nations alike  the burden of structuraladjustment imposed by globalization. Only within theUnited Nations system can we mobilize concerted globalaction to support progress in the poor regions of the globe particularly in Africa  whose needs call for specialattention.The Bretton Woods system and the multilateraldevelopment banks also need reform. Global flows ofmultilateral development financing have to be increased especially since bilateral official development assistance isdeclining.Countries that wish to reduce their share in thefinancing of the United Nations should be willing to do thesame in international financial institutions  so that those thatwant to increase their contributions to these institutions areable to do so without hindrance.Another fundamental question we must ask is: are weready  as an Organization of States  as nations united  toface the challenges of tomorrow? The short answer is “No”.For this reason  the Philippines strongly believes thatwe must immediately embark upon the reform of theUnited Nations. We need to enhance the capacity of theworld body to meet the exigencies of modern times. Afundamental objective of reform should be to restoredevelopment to the centre of the United Nations agenda.The Philippines  therefore  endorses therecommendations of the Open-ended High Level WorkingGroup on the Strengthening of the United NationsSystem. If properly implemented  they could render theGeneral Assembly more effective in fulfilling its Charterresponsibilities.Our Secretary-General has given us a report on hisown reform proposals. These deserve the seriousconsideration of the General Assembly. We appreciate theemphasis placed by the Secretary-General ondevelopment.We also need to accelerate discussions on the reformof the Security Council. In this regard  we welcome theprogress that has been made in clarifying and identifyingthe elements that must be negotiated if we are to movetowards any expansion of the membership of the Council.The Philippines favours the enlargement of themembership of the Council in order to enhance itsefficiency and effectiveness. Security Council membershipshould be more representative of the world’s developingregions and more reflective of modern global realities.New permanent members should enjoy the same rights ascurrent permanent members. The use of the veto shouldbe limited to actions under Chapter VII of the Charter.Talking of reform is good. But our talk will leadnowhere if our Organization does not have the resourcesrequired to improve and revitalize itself. We survived thebalance of terror of the cold war. Let us now work onbalancing our cheque-books in the post-cold-war era.There is much irony in this. The end of the cold warshould also have meant an end to the astronomicalfinances spent on deterrence. It might have beenreasonable to expect that a fraction of those financescould now be shared to help the United Nations promoteworld peace  progress and prosperity.Yet this is obviously not the case. The Secretary-General’s proposed revolving credit fund of $1 billion  tobe financed though voluntary contributions or othermeans — if it materializes — may provide temporaryrelief. However  there is a real danger that this proposalwill encourage those in arrears to delay further theirpayments to the Organization.The Philippines is in favour of reform. Butreforming the United Nations should not be seen as anopportunity to hold our Organization to ransom. We areall in favour of reforming and strengthening the United11Nations. But setting benchmarks of reform should not be aprecondition for a Member State to pay its assessedcontributions.In the 100 years since my country declared itsindependence  war and occupation  dictatorship and partisanpolitics have at one time or another endangered ourdemocracy. And in those eventful 100 years  we havecultivated certain insights that might prove relevant to ushere today. We have learned  as a country  that we mustcherish the ideals of democracy in all aspects of ournational life  including in our dealings with other nations.After my people emerged victorious in our last majorbattle with forces opposed to democracy over a decade ago we resolved to share our experience with the rest of theworld. Thus  we organized in Manila the first meeting ofthe International Conference of New or RestoredDemocracies (ICNRD) in 1988. From the 13 nations thatfirst met in Manila  ICNRD has grown to 76 countriestoday. I congratulate Romania for its successful hosting ofICNRD’s third meeting earlier this month.Given the diversity of the membership of ourOrganization  it is not surprising that we may have somedifferences even on such fundamental issues as internationalpeace  global development and the protection of theindividual. However  I submit that  if our Organization is tofunction properly and if Member States are to relate to eachother in an effective manner  then we must all followcertain basic principles and ideals. These principles andideals are those that democracy has taught us. Let us worktogether with all the creative energy at our command andwith the ideals of democracy as our guiding light."

They pledged their support for thepivotal role of the United Nations in building internationalcooperation and partnership in development and inengendering trust and confidence among nations andpeoples in order to foster world peace and security.No human institution is perfect  and the UnitedNations is no exception. It has nonetheless withstood thetest of time. The shortcomings of our collectiveendeavours have necessitated efforts for constructivereform and measures directed at strengthening andreinvigorating the United Nations  our paramountOrganization.Papua New Guinea has always believed  andcontinues to believe  in the utility of the United Nations and in this context commends the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his bold initiative inproposing for our consideration a comprehensive reformpackage aimed at making the United Nations moreresponsive to the changing international situation.In his proposal  the Secretary-General emphasizedthat the principal objective of the reform is not only tomake the United Nations efficient and effective but alsoto improve its delivery system and operational coherencythrough management innovations. Papua New Guineafully supports these principal objectives of the proposedreform package. The overall direction of reform shouldand must be tailored towards strengthening the UnitedNations system in order to better serve the needs andaspirations of its Members. It makes eminent sense for usto move from merely debating issues to determiningpractical steps and strategies that would make ourOrganization more responsive and capable of meeting theever-changing challenges of globalization andmodernization as we enter the next century.These changes are necessary to enhance publicconfidence in the United Nations and to improve itscapacity to build partnership between Governments andcivil society. This will enable the Organization to meet thedaunting challenges of economic development faced by ourglobal community and those posed by the political andideological differences afflicting nations today.The proposed reforms stem in part from the need toensure the operational viability and sustainability of theactivities of the United Nations. Papua New Guinea is fullyaware of the predicament of the United Nations — starvedof much needed financial resources for its operations to thepoint of being insolvent. We cannot allow such a situationto persist.We agree with and applaud the role of theOrganization in development — in framing structures andpolicies that will enhance the technological capacities ofdeveloping countries and improve their effectiveparticipation in international markets  including their accessto credit and their ability to acquire informationtechnologies.Regarding priorities  Papua New Guinea is gravelyconcerned at the lack of full implementation of a number ofinitiatives and programmes undertaken by the UnitedNations  in particular with respect to such critical areas asthe empowerment of women  child care  the protection ofour global environment  poverty eradication and sustainabledevelopment.It is critical to be aware that organizational reformalone cannot guarantee the effective delivery of services.The United Nations needs more than bureaucratic andtechnocratic innovations. It needs our concerted action. It istherefore imperative that we as Members commit ourselvesto encouraging the development of genuine partnerships andseriously take urgent and practical measures to remove theobstacles and barriers that exist between developed anddeveloping countries.In addition to its traditional role in the maintenance ofpeace and security  this paramount international body mustbe equipped and strengthened to do more in framinginternational treaties and standards and in encouraginginternational norms and practices that will bring aboutequitable economic development and social justice for allpeoples. Equity and justice in all spheres of developmentshould be our ultimate objective.Consistent with the reform process  we see merit andvalue in revising the regional groupings within the contextof the United Nations to reflect present geopoliticalrealities. In this regard  we support the calls made byNew Zealand and others in the South Pacific region forthe consideration of their inclusion in the Asia-Pacificgrouping.I now turn to the question of the reform of theSecurity Council  which is an important decision-makingorgan of the United Nations on global security concerns.As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Papua NewGuinea fully supports the declaration adopted by the non-aligned Ministers at the twelfth Ministerial Conference ofthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries — held in NewDelhi  India  in April 1997 — and reaffirmed morerecently in New York on 26 September last. Thecomposition and modus operandi of the Security Councilmust reflect the changes that have taken place since itsformative years  and  more importantly  must mirrorcurrent geopolitical and economic realities.Papua New Guinea believes that the reform andexpansion of the Security Council should be guided bythe principle of the sovereign equality of States andequitable geographical distribution. It should also takeinto consideration the need for transparency accountability and democratization of the workingmethods and procedures of the Security Council including its decision-making processes.The reform of the Security Council should becomprehensive and based on universal values in order toenhance its legitimacy. More importantly  the reformedSecurity Council should allow for equitable representationby developing countries. On the question of permanentmembership  we reiterate our position on the inclusion ofJapan and Germany from the industrialized States andalso support the fair representation of developingcountries as additional permanent members  particularlythose that have the capacity and ability to contribute toworld affairs.Papua New Guinea strongly supports the view thatthere should be no distinction in terms of the privilegesaccorded to permanent members  particularly in relationto the exercise of the veto power. In other words  allpermanent members of a reformed Security Councilshould enjoy the same privileges so as to maintaingeopolitical equity and balance.2It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly thecontradictory positions of some of our members  whopurport to be champions and defenders of human rightsissues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations thatdirectly deny genuine democratic representation and therights of people to govern themselves in a mannerconsistent with their political aspirations.Having achieved decolonization in many parts of theglobe — of which the United Nations can be proud — wewould be failing in our noble duty if we were to ignore theconcerns and aspirations of the peoples of the remaining 17Non-Self-Governing Territories  some of them in the SouthPacific  which are still struggling to establish their ownpolitical autonomy  and even to exercise their right of self-determination. Given the importance we attach to this issue Papua New Guinea is gravely concerned that recentinitiatives in relation to the United Nations programme ondecolonization have seriously eroded the importance of thepolitical essence of that programme and have impactednegatively on it. We hope that this anomaly can be resolvedquickly and amicably.Papua New Guinea wishes to recall that many of usrepresented here would not have taken our place in thisforum had we not been allowed the opportunity to exercisethat right. We therefore urge this body to adopt a moreserious and aggressive approach to the implementation ofthe decolonization programme of the United Nations. At therecent meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga Cook Islands  the States members of the South PacificForum reaffirmed their support for the decolonizationprocess.The Non-Self-Governing Territory of New Caledoniacontinues to be of great interest to the South Pacific Forum and we have over the years followed developments there inrelation to the Matignon Accords. Early this year wemounted  with the help of the Government of France andthe authorities in New Caledonia  a Forum ministerialmission to the Territory. We are pleased to note that allparties to the Matignon Accords appear to be satisfied withthe progress made in implementing the Accords. PapuaNew Guinea continues to recognize the right of the peopleof New Caledonia to self-determination and urges allparties in the Territory to maintain their commitment toreaching a negotiated solution as a successor arrangementto the 1988 Matignon Accords. This negotiated successorsolution must take into account the wishes of allcommunities  including concerns on the changingdemographic composition of New Caledonia.The economic prosperity and political developmentsand changes in the Asia-Pacific region continue to be ofinterest to Papua New Guinea. As a special observer ofthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) we were heartened by the initiatives taken by ASEANleaders to bring the belligerent parties in Cambodia to thetable for urgent negotiations for peace and security. It isour hope that the people of that ancient civilization willreturn to their daily lives in a peaceful and secureenvironment once more.The ongoing difficulties in the Korean peninsula andthe competing territorial claims in the South China Seacontinue to concern my Government  because they allhave a bearing on the overall maintenance of regional andinternational security  as well as on other forms ofcooperation.While we do not understate the importance andvalue of our diplomatic relations with the People’sRepublic of China  we have  however  on a number ofoccasions urged both Beijing and Taipei to resolve theirfundamental differences with the aim of maintaining anamicable coexistence.In view of the changing international climatecharacterized by global interdependence  it is importantfor all peace-loving States to make every effort tominimize areas of hostility that could seriously undermineinternational peace and security. The United Nationstherefore has an obligation to assist in maintaining asecure global environment in which economic growth andother forms of development can continue to thrive for thebenefit and common good of all peoples of the world.In its efforts to attain economic prosperity  PapuaNew Guinea has had to engage all economic entities inour trade and commercial relations. Consistent with ourobligation to assure our people of a better future  weintend to expand our economic ties with trading partnersthat have demonstrated their willingness to assist withoutour having to compromise various aspects of our existingrelations with our partners.It is in this regard that we recognize Taiwan as adynamic economy and trading partner withoutcompromising our one-China policy. Since Taiwanparticipates in such organizations as the AsianDevelopment Bank  the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council  the World Trade Organization andthe South Pacific Forum as a dialogue partner  I cannot3see any reason why we should not deal directly withTaiwan on trade and economic matters.The world has witnessed once again the derailment ofthe peace process in the Middle East. We call on theleaders of both Israel and Palestine to cooperate withUnited Nations efforts to reach an amicable solution toavert further violence  and to focus on the path to peace.Papua New Guinea strongly believes that the rights of thePalestinian people over their homeland and their freedom toestablish their own Government and identity are paramountamong the conditions that could lead to enduring peace.We are encouraged to see positive signs ofappeasement in Rwanda  Burundi and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. Nevertheless  given the tensesituation that exists in that region  we urge those inpositions of authority  including all leaders in that part ofthe world  to resolve their differences peacefully to preventfurther bloodshed. In this context  we are heartened to seethe Organization of African Unity playing a critical role inthe endeavour to bring about peace and stability in theGreat Lakes region. The crisis in Sierra Leone needs urgentattention  and we join the Secretary-General’s call to theleaders of the military junta and support his continuingefforts to encourage them to respect the rule of law andmake every effort to restore democracy in that country.On the regional front  Papua New Guinea is taking amajor initiative in setting up the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council (APEC) regional centre in PortMoresby. We would like to offer our gratitude for thesupport given by the States members of the South PacificForum in our efforts to set up this centre. The objective ofthe APEC centre is to assist in the area of capacity-buildingin the economies of 13 small island developing States inour region as we prepare to meet the challenges ofglobalization and liberalization. We are also grateful for thesupport provided by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme.At the recent summit of the Heads of the SouthPacific Forum countries  the leaders reaffirmed ourcommitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone in the SouthPacific consistent with the overall objectives of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Wewelcomed the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and reiterated our support for banning thetransboundary movement of radioactive and other hazardouswastes in the region  and in particular for the ViennaConvention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and thedraft Convention on Supplementary Funding.In this context  we welcome the ratification by theUnited Kingdom of the protocols to the South PacificNuclear-Free Zone Treaty  known as the Treaty ofRarotonga. We are still hopeful that the United States ofAmerica will do likewise  and call upon it to do so at theearliest possible opportunity.At the last session of the General Assembly  wesought and forged new agreements  including ourrelationship with the Organization for the Prohibition ofChemical Weapons. We also expressed our support for aninternational convention to ban all anti-personnel mines and have participated in the Ottawa process  most recentlyat Oslo. Like other members of this body  Papua NewGuinea is making the necessary arrangements to becomea party to that historic Treaty when it opens for signaturelater this year.In a few months we will usher in the InternationalYear of the Ocean. Like other South Pacific Forumcountries  Papua New Guinea has an affinity for the seawhich cannot be overstated. It is  for the greater part  thesource of our livelihood.We urge the United Nations to continue to play amajor role in ensuring global awareness of sustainableuse  conservation and management of marine resources.In this regard  we call on the international community tocoordinate efforts to implement the priorities agreed uponduring the special session of the General Assembly on theenvironment and sustainable development. We are gravelyconcerned that much of the outcome of the special sessionwill remain the province of historians and academics  ifnot given practical effect. We urge that greater attentionbe given to the special needs and concerns of the smallisland developing countries.An environmental issue of great importance andrelevance to Papua New Guinea and other small islandStates in the South Pacific region is the impact ofgreenhouse gas emissions  which are causing rising sealevels and changing weather patterns in many membercountries  especially low lying island nations.This issue was given priority attention at the recentSouth Pacific Forum meeting in Rarotonga  Cook Islands where the Forum countries expressed deep concerns aboutthe insufficient progress made by the countries whichcontribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.As a member of the South Pacific Forum  PapuaNew Guinea strongly urges all countries concerned to4make additional efforts in meeting commitments under theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(FCCC). We also urge all parties to the FCCC to considerfully the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) draftprotocol during the ongoing negotiations  especially at theforthcoming Kyoto conference  in order to pursue thegreatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhousegas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol orother legal instrument.On Bougainville  let me reassure this body that PapuaNew Guinea  as I stated earlier this year in the UnitedNations Commission on Human Rights  remains fullycommitted to a peaceful and enduring resolution of thecrisis. It is absolutely clear that the people of Papua NewGuinea  including the majority of Bougainvillians  wantpeace and will pursue a peaceful solution by every availablemeans. As in the past  we will continue to give the peopleof Bougainville every opportunity to participate fully in thereconciliation process.My Government is mindful of the effects of the crisison our region  particularly of the spillover effects on ourclose neighbours. We wish to take this opportunity to thankthe neighbouring countries in our region for their assistancein the peace process. I would like to acknowledge thecontributions of Australia and  in particular  New Zealand in initiating and facilitating the peace conference of allBougainvillian leaders which resulted in the signing of theBurnham Declaration last July. A follow-up meeting —Burnham Talks II — between Bougainvillian leaders andrepresentatives of Papua New Guinea’s Government iscurrently under way in New Zealand. We are optimistic andconfident that we can resolve the crisis within theframework of the Papua New Guinea Constitution.Let me also take this opportunity to thank  on behalfof my Government and people  the previous and currentGovernments of the Solomon Islands and their people fortheir tolerance and understanding  particularly when theyhave had to bear the full weight of the spillover effects. Iwant to thank them also for agreeing with us to put in placein the last 12 months two important bilateral treaties: thecomprehensive framework treaty guiding bilateral relationsand the basic border agreement. These treaties set theparameters within which our bilateral relations areconducted  including the legal mechanisms for consultationand dialogue relating to a more effective management ofour common border  which is critical to the containment ofthe Bougainville crisis  including its spillover effects.My Government also offers its gratitude to theleaders of the South Pacific Forum for recognizingBougainville as an integral part of Papua New Guinea and for their acknowledgment of the peace effortsconcerning Bougainville by all parties involved  includingBougainvillians and their leaders  the Papua New GuineaGovernment  and the Governments of the SolomonIslands  Australia and New Zealand.In conclusion  let me echo what other speakers havesaid before me. As we prepare to meet the dawn of thenext millennium  let us commit ourselves to buildinggenuine partnerships in development that will ensure asecure environment for our present and future generations.We do not and should not expect guarantees  but weshall look far and wide in our search for safeguards. Wedo not want and shall not seek handouts; however  wedemand equity and greater participation to foster andexpand opportunities for our peoples.It is only through the development of genuinepartnerships and the enhancement of equity and justice inglobal trade and investments that we can improve thesocio-economic conditions of our people  ensure theirprosperity  and guarantee the safety of our globalenvironment  without which there is no hope for theattainment of enduring peace in our societies today and infuture. Only when such peace has been attained can wetruly say that we have lived up to our obligations  for theinterests and common good of humanity."
"133",5687,"POL",52,1997,"﻿At the outset I would like tooffer my sincere congratulations upon Mr. Udovenko’selection to the honourable post of President of the UnitedNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. ThePolish delegation expresses its satisfaction that thepresidency of this session has been entrusted to an eminentstatesman from Ukraine  a country with which we have tiesof friendship and cooperation based on common values andaspirations. The President may count on my delegation’sfull cooperation in the performance of his important tasks.Please also allow me to extend expressions ofappreciation and respect to Mr. Razali Ismail  a prominentrepresentative of Malaysia  for his excellent guidance of thework of the General Assembly during its fifty-first session.I would also like to address words of the deepest respectto Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  for theoutstanding manner in which he has demonstrated hisqualities of leadership and good judgement.Seven years since the downfall of a polarized worldand less than three years away from the year 2000  weare already living in a new era. Are we  the citizens ofthe Earth  aware of the momentous changes and the newresponsibilities which they entail? When looking atourselves from the perspective of the Pathfinder on Mars or of the space station Mir  do we see humanity in itsentirety or  rather  spasmodic movements of an anthill always prepared to fight over every scrap  devoid of thegift of synthesis and without ability to perceive thewhole?These are the questions which all of us  especiallyhere in this Hall  are confronted with. The burden ofresponsibility of the United Nations for resisting dangersand facing challenges  for eliminating tensions andconstantly building foundations for the future  has notbeen relieved. It has not diminished. Perhaps it weighseven heavier today than ever before.From that moment in 1945  in San Francisco  whenArthur Rubinstein  an outstanding piano virtuoso and agreat Polish patriot  proudly inaugurated the UnitedNations era with the notes of the Polish national anthem until today  our Organization has given the impression ofbeing oriented towards emergency actions rather thansystematic and comprehensive work programmes. TheGeneral Assembly and the Security Council areexcessively preoccupied with current issues. Nonetheless torn apart by the global confrontation between the freeworld and totalitarianism  they attempted to findmechanisms of dialogue and negotiation that wouldprotect the world from global conflict. They have fulfilledthat role. No one  neither the fiercest opponents of theidea of the United Nations nor the greatest promoters ofits radical modernization  can deny the United Nationsachievements in maintaining world peace and security andresolving local conflicts. One has to bow to the visionaryskills and political genius of the creators of the AtlanticCharter  which provided the foundation for ourOrganization. Their work has stood the test of time incircumstances unforeseeable when the system wasestablished.Until now we have been concentrating on avoidingwar. Shocked by the tragedy of the Second World Warand the experience of ravages of previous wars  we have14put all our energy into the creed “Never again”. However concentrating on avoiding war  the United Nations has notalways been able to pay sufficient attention to building aworld for people  a world of harmonious existence andbalanced development. I should like to emphasize this pointagain and again.The time has come to pay more attention to buildinga world for all people  of all races  all religions and allcultures  for people in the wealthier North and the poorerSouth.An important area of international cooperation hasbeen the effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction:nuclear  chemical and biological. This Organization hasmade a significant contribution to this activity. Among therecent milestones in this domain  I should mention theenactment of the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use of ChemicalWeapons and on Their Destruction  as well as the signingof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We alsoconsider extremely important the ongoing work towardswider application and universalization of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the basis for aglobal regime of nuclear-arms non-proliferation.We attach particular significance to the willingness ofthe United States and the Russian Federation  as confirmedat the Helsinki summit this year  to continue the STARTnegotiations  taking them to a qualitatively new stageinvolving the radical reduction of nuclear arsenals. We trustthat the ratification of START II by the Russian Federation upon which these negotiations are conditioned  will soon bea fact  just as we hope that our expectations with regard tothe immediate ratification by Russia of the ChemicalWeapons Convention will become a reality in the nearfuture. We welcome President Clinton’s decision to submitto the Senate for ratification the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  as he announced from this rostrum.Both for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of ourcountry’s security interests  we attach great importance toeffective actions aimed at limiting or banning conventionalweapons  including anti-personnel landmines. We welcomethe momentous arrangements concerning this issue thatwere agreed at the recent Oslo Diplomatic Conference. Webelieve  however  that the consolidation and universalizationof these agreements should continue to be soughtpersistently at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.This would guarantee participation in the negotiations of themain manufacturers and exporters  which in turn wouldserve to take better into account the legitimate securityinterests of all countries.In this context of conventional disarmament  allowme to confess that it was with immense sadness that mydelegation — just like everyone else in the world —received the news of the tragic death of Diana  Princessof Wales  a great supporter of a ban on landmines.We are currently starting a new and different stagein the history of the United Nations. The moment hascome to pose truly fundamental questions about the futureand to provide answers. Global peace is a primary value but should we not reach beyond that? In our view  globalpeace is a fundamental precondition to the preservation ofhuman dignity and the observance of human rights  to theenhancement of economic and political justice and toharmonious and sustainable development. But the timehas come for the United Nations to open up more so asto meet other challenges of contemporary civilization.United Nations agencies have already made progressin this direction. The experience they have accumulated as well as their lasting achievements in the definiteimprovement of living conditions for millions of people constitute an important starting point. In this respect sufficient funding aimed at specific programmes is theprerequisite for success. We welcome donations andphilanthropy  which are an important source of additionalfunding and a clear sign of public support. However  theUnited Nations needs a solid foundation for its activities and regular contributions by all Members areindispensable.The reforms proposed by the Secretary-General inhis report  “Renewing the United Nations: A Programmefor Reform”  provide the basis for fundamental changesin the activities of our Organization that will allow it toserve better the needs and expectations of all the Membernations facing the challenges of the twenty-first century.It is with hope and optimism that we welcome theinitiatives of the Secretary-General. We believe they willlead to improved effectiveness and better management ofthe United Nations system. They increase the focus ondevelopment programmes and enhance the credibility ofthe Organization. They strengthen the relationshipbetween Member States and the United Nations. Polandsupports the proposed direction of the United Nationsreforms. We are prepared to cooperate actively in thisprocess  and we are vitally interested in further efforts toreinvigorate the United Nations system  including itseconomic and social sectors.15There is no immediate threat of a global conflict  butlocal conflicts might often lead to conflicts on a muchgreater scale. The world was not free of regional or eveninternal conflicts before  but either their importance andramifications seemed less significant in the face of a threatof worldwide conflict  or they were temporarily frozen bythe cold war. With the ice melting  local conflicts ignitedwith renewed intensity. The international community  fullyaware of the threat they presented  made efforts to assist indefusing them  with varying degree of success.Understandably  the United Nations had a perception of itsresponsibility and took action using the means at thedisposal of the Security Council. Poland supports all theefforts to institute the concept of rapid deployment in orderto improve the capability of the United Nations to respondquickly to crisis situations. Our experience proves that theability to address local conflicts should be one of thepriorities in our efforts to reform the Security Council.The basic premise for balanced enlargement andreform of the Council should be the increased effectivenessof its work in an international environment which isundergoing fundamental changes. With our experience ofnearly two years of participation in the Security Council we are inclined to conclude that the effectiveness ofSecurity Council activities is greatly enhanced when itenjoys the full support of the respective regions representedin the United Nations. Therefore  we support the aspirationsof various regional groups to additional seats in the Councilif its membership is expanded. At the same time  Polandwould find it necessary to increase the representation ofCentral and Eastern Europe in the Council by an additionalmember. Thus  my Government is in favour of theaccession of Japan and Germany to permanent seats.Poland is among the countries convinced of thenecessity of reforming the Council to adapt it to current andfuture tasks. While implementing these reforms  we shouldtake into consideration two parallel and sometimesconflicting tendencies: globalization and regionalization.The emerging concept of regional responsibility shouldundergo consolidation. Its burden is being carried byregional organizations engaged in resolving regionalconflicts  prominent cases in point being the activities ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Bosniaand Herzegovina as well as those of the Organization ofAfrican Unity.We believe that regional organizations should be moreengaged in preventive diplomacy and maintaining peacewhile ensuring full compatibility with the United NationsCharter. Thus  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is contributing to thefulfillment of the basic task of the United Nations —maintaining international peace and security — throughactive regional cooperation in both conflict prevention andcrisis management  as well as in post-conflictrehabilitation.When Poland assumes the duties of OSCEChairman-in-Office in 1998  it will make every effort tomaintain and develop further a high standard ofcooperation between that Organization and the UnitedNations.In an atmosphere of global peace there is a muchbetter chance to stand up to conflicts as old as humanity such as religious conflicts  those between rich and poorand those between various ethnic groups.The Polish people  with its historical experience oftimes of freedom and times of bondage  is gaining newexperience today. As the pioneer of the 1990sbreakthrough  which led to the end of a polarized world today Poland is experiencing both joy and hardship: thejoy of returning to the family of free nations and thehardship of a transformation period and the restructuringof our economy.This year Poland has been undergoing a bitter test fighting against a natural disaster unparalleled incenturies: the catastrophic flood in the south and west ofthe country. May I take this opportunity to extend ourheartfelt thanks to the countries  organizations and personsof goodwill that have come to our assistance. If there isany lesson to be drawn from this horrible experience  itis that massive natural disasters are a kind of danger thatwe all have to learn to withstand together.This year’s flood  whose destructive force struck ourcountry  also had a disastrous effect on our neighbors  inparticular the Czech Republic and Germany. We foundthat such disasters can be faced much more effectively ifthe preventive and rescue operations are organized on aninternational and  especially  a transboundary scale.There is an old saying that a friend in need is afriend indeed. But one can also find friends in momentsof success and moments of joy. Thanks to the help of ourfriends  and to their satisfaction  Poland crossed two greatthresholds this year. It was invited to the North AtlanticTreaty Organization and to the European Union.Negotiations with NATO are already under way  andthose with the European Union will commence at the16beginning of next year. Our readiness to shoulderresponsibility and our ability to meet the requirements havebeen recognized. Poland is now considered a reliable andrespected member of the community of democratic nations.The outcome of our recently held parliamentaryelections has confirmed that this basic orientation of ourforeign policy will remain unchanged and is supported bythe overwhelming majority of the Polish people.The world is still imperfect. Millions of people arepaying — with their freedom  their dignity and sometimeseven their lives — the price of lack of democracy and lackof respect for human rights. There are forces that feed onethnic antagonisms. Poverty is the fate of millions of peopleacross vast territories. But other problems on a global scaleare also visible — climate changes and diverseenvironmental concerns  the constantly widening gapbetween rich and poor and the insufficient reach ofeducation and health care. The reforms which we undertakeshould increase the United Nations capability to addressthese important issues. Let me now elaborate on some ofthem.Through deep and carefully thought-out reform  weshould equip the United Nations with mechanisms capableof ensuring respect for the human rights of all the world’scitizens to a greater degree than before. The United Nationsevolution and reform introduce the human rights issue inquite a natural way to the Security Council agenda. Wewelcome this trend. There is a clear connection betweeninternational security and respect for human rights  whichshould be reflected in the activities of the Security Council.The events of the past few years in Africa have againdramatically confirmed the existence of such a relationship.1998 will be a special year for human rights. Half acentury ago the General Assembly adopted the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  a catalogue of theindividual’s rights and duties. However  the concept ofhuman rights still varies from region to region. I think thaton the threshold of the twenty-first century  as weemphasized in Warsaw this January when inaugurating thecelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  it is worth considering howto use this variety to build a universal concept of humanrights  just as the Declaration initially assumed. At the sametime  however  we oppose any attempt at the so-calledrevision of the Universal Declaration  which must remaina common minimal standard for all humanity.As a member of the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights starting on 1 January 1998  Polandconfirms its willingness to continue the dialogue andcooperation with representatives of all regional groups.Observance and promotion of human rights are for all ofus a great challenge at the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury.We also believe that closer economic cooperationwith developing countries will help them overcomedifficulties and actively participate in the world economy.Poland is undertaking and will continue to undertakeimportant projects in this field. We also want to point outthe important role of international institutions in providingdevelopment assistance for partners with lower levels ofincome. We will continue to give them our support astheir tasks require and our capacity allows.A year ago  in this General Assembly Hall  thePresident of Poland  Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski formulated a proposal for the elaboration of aninternational convention against organized transnationalcrime. We were encouraged by the massive support thatthe Polish initiative received from the membership of thisOrganization. We think that the international communityshould take active measures to stop the spreading cancerof transnational crime. We must secure the effectivecooperation of countries and organizations concerned.We believe that the United Nations will find foritself a creative and constructive role through theCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice which has been entrusted with the task of elaborating thisconvention. Poland is ready to cooperate with othercountries to extend the scope and range of the conventionif such extension would meet the needs and expectationsof Member States. We appreciate the work of theCommission on this subject and hope that the Assemblywill receive a final draft of the convention at its nextsession.Equally important are the environmental issues. Themost important among them are those related to climatechanges. To deal effectively with such problems as thegreenhouse effect  melting of glaciers and the protectionof tropical forests is a task far exceeding the ability ofany single country or even region. It is hard to imagineeffective action in this area unless we all join forces.It is justifiable to reconsider whether the UnitedNations is an organization capable of dealing with thesetasks. The doubts voiced by the skeptics should not be17ignored. However  Poland is among the countries thatbelieve that the United Nations system can  through thecollective effort of its Members  meet the challenges. Thiseffort has to be directed towards  among other things understanding current and future dilemmas which reachbeyond this century. It must be sustained with a vision shared by all Members of the system  of the shape theywish to give to tomorrow. It must involve the will todevelop an organizational system and make it effective with each Member bearing its share of responsibility.Today’s Poland — democratic  economically successful enjoying good relations with all its neighbours  bindingitself to alliances with the European Union and NATO —is ready to participate in carrying out this task.We must rise to the expectations of the UnitedNations. As one of the Organization’s founding Members Poland will not cease in its support of the United Nationsas a global forum for resolving problems and conflicts  andespecially for ensuring a just and effective system of globalgovernance aimed at eliminating threats to humanity.Poland stands ready to do its part for the purpose ofachieving these lofty goals."
"134",5713,"PRK",52,1997,"﻿Allow me first of all  on behalf of thedelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  the Minister ForForeign Affairs of Ukraine  on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.We believe that his rich experience and diplomatic skillin dealing with international affairs will lead this sessionto fruitful results.I also express my gratitude to the former President Mr. Razali Ismail  Malaysian Ambassador to the UnitedNations  for his great contributions to the successfulconclusion of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. At the same time  I take this opportunity toexpress appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his efforts devoted to the activities of theUnited Nations.The fifty-second session of the General Assembly isnow being held just two years before we enter a newcentury. The twenty-first century should be different fromthe present century  characterized by a history of hot andcold wars. It is the desire of humankind and the commontask of the international community to make theforthcoming century peaceful and prosperous.17Though we are at the end of the twentieth century  weare still facing complex and intricate challenges. Atendency towards domination continues to prevail ininternational relations even after the abolition ofcolonialism. Today the United Nations  which oncecontributed to eradicating colonialism  has been placed indanger of being converted into a tool that would allowhigh-handedness and arbitrariness.Though the cold war has ended  the nuclear stockpilesremain as enormous as ever before  and the thinking of thecold-war era dominates international relations. Today suchchallenges are clearest in North-East Asia and  moreprecisely  in the Korean peninsula. In the Korean peninsula national division  the legacy of the cold war era  continues the power and confrontation politics of the cold war erapersist and relations between the North and South of Koreaare ever worsening. The aggressive military alliances vestiges of the cold war  are being rearranged  andprovocative joint military exercises are being conductedagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea withannually increased military expenditures amid the tensesituation in the Korean peninsula. In addition to the militarypressures  which have continued since the cold war era issues such as human rights  terrorism  economic sanctions food aid and so on are also being abused as tools for high-handedness and interference in our internal affairs. All theseattempts are aimed at stifling our socialist system.Like all other United Nations Member States  theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is a sovereign Statewith the right to choose its own political system  and itdeserves respect for this. Our style of socialism is the oneour people have chosen by themselves  and it is not asystem doomed to collapse even though others may attemptto bring this about. The single-hearted unity between theleader  the party and the masses is the source of theinvincibility of our system.On 8 July this year  which marked the third year ofthe demise of the great leader President Kim Il Sung  allour people became mourners and observed the memorialservice. Simultaneously with the end of the mourningperiod  we instituted a Juche calendar with the year 1912as the base year  and designated 15 April as the Day of Sunin memory of the birthday of the great leader PresidentKim Il Sung. This affords a good illustration of theunanimous will of our people who are determined to handdown  forever  the revolutionary life and the immortalexploits of the fatherly leader who created the Juche ideaand built socialism centred on the popular masses. Todayis 2 October  Juche 86 in our country  according to ourJuche Calendar.For our Korean people  the last three years havebeen a period of severe trials during which our peoplesuffered the greatest loss of the nation  confronted thepersistent manoeuvres of the hostile forces to stifle oursocialist system and suffered from a series of naturalcalamities.Nevertheless  our people have been always optimisticand able to continue their victorious advancement byovercoming all sorts of challenges  because they hold inhigh esteem another great leader  General Kim Jong Il  aniron-willed and brilliant commander.Currently  the nomination process is under way inmy country to elect the great leader Comrade Kim JongIl as the General Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party and all our people are full of boundless joy and emotionover their long-cherished desire being realized.This clearly demonstrates the firm will andconviction of our people to carry through the Juche cause holding in high esteem forever the great leader ComradeKim Jong Il as the head of our Party and our revolution.This is the reality of socialist Korea  where thepeople enjoy the blessing of the leadership and the leaderenjoys the blessing of the people through the generations.I take this opportunity to reiterate our deep thanks tothe Governments  organizations and individuals of variouscountries  and to the governmental and non-governmentalinternational organizations  including the United Nations for their deep sympathy and condolences  as well as forthe humanitarian assistance extended to our people whosuffered the deepest sorrow and natural calamities.Korea’s reunification question is  in essence  aquestion of regaining national sovereignty throughout thecountry  which is being trampled by foreign forces and ofabolishing the legacy of the cold war era.The Government of our Republic regards as itsThree Charters for National Reunification the threeprinciples of independence  peaceful reunification andgreat national unity  the 10-Point Programme of the GreatUnity of the Whole Nation and the proposal for thefounding of the Democratic Confederal Republic ofKoryo.18The great leader General Kim Jong Il  in hisprogrammatic work published on 4 August of this year made clear our firm will and determination to clearlyreunify the country  holding aloft the Three Charters ofNational Reunification set forth by the fatherly leader. Thethree principles of national reunification constitute the greatcommon reunification programme for the Korean nation which was confirmed by the north and south through their4 July Joint Statement and was supported by the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly aswell.The 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of theWhole Nation for National Reunification is a politicalprogramme aimed at attaining the unity of the whole nationto strengthen the driving force of national reunification.This programme indicates comprehensively the objectiveand ideological basis  as well as the principles and methods for achieving the great national unity.The proposed Democratic Confederal Republic ofKoryo is the blueprint which gives the full picture of areunified State and the ways for its realization as well.More than half a century has passed since the northand south of Korea have existed with different systems.Under such circumstances  the establishment of a unifiednational State through the confederation formula — basedon one nation and one State  two systems and twoGovernments — becomes the most reasonable way ofefficiently resolving the issues pertaining to nationalreunification.The emergence of a unified national State —independent  peaceful and neutral — in the Koreanpeninsula will make a great contribution to lasting peaceand stability in North-East Asia  where the great Powers arecontiguous to each other.No matter how the situation and circumstances maychange in the future  our people will remain unshakeable intheir will  and the Government of our Republic will adhereto its consistent reunification policy in reunifying thecountry  on the basis of the Three Charters for NationalReunification.Improved relations between the north and south ofKorea are an urgent requirement for achieving theindependent and peaceful reunification of the country. If thesouth Korean authorities give up their anti-national andanti-reunification confrontation policies and make a positivechange in practice  we will meet them at any time to haveopen-minded negotiations on the destiny of the nation andmake joint efforts for the country’s reunification.For a correct solution to the Korean question  thecountries concerned must also play positive roles with asincere attitude about helping Korea’s reunification. TheUnited States  a State party which is directly responsiblefor the Korean question  should make a radical change inits anachronistic policy towards Korea and refrain fromlaying obstacles in the way of the independent andpeaceful reunification of Korea. Japan  which imposedimmeasurable misfortune and disaster upon the Koreanpeople in the past  must sincerely reflect upon its past discontinue its hostile policy towards our Republic andstop provoking Korea’s division and hindering itsreunification.It is the consistent stand of the Government of ourRepublic to prevent war and to ensure a lasting peace inthe Korean peninsula. This becomes our primary task inthe efforts to reunify the country peacefully  withoutrecourse to the armed forces. In order to ensure peace inthe Korean peninsula  it is imperative to opposeaggression and war manoeuvres and to remove the dangerof war.The prevailing situation in the Korean peninsula isso tense that a war could break out at any moment  dueto the attempts of the United States  Japan and SouthKorean authorities against our socialist Republic. In recentyears alone  the United States introduced over $3 billionworth of war equipment into South Korea. At the sametime  it has been conducting joint military exercises morefrequently than ever before  and even directing the gunsof the United States forces in Japan and the Pacific fleettowards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Of late  Japan is also accelerating its political  legaland diplomatic moves with a view to legalizing itsengagement of the self-defence force in a possible Koreanwar under the signboard of the “revision” of the“Guidelines for United States-Japan MilitaryCooperation”.In addition  the South Korean authorities increasedtheir military budget up to $17 billion for this year andagain decided to increase next year’s military budget upto $19 billion  while bolstering military “cooperation”with foreign forces against their fellow countrymen.Such moves  reflecting the policies of the cold-warera  inevitably provoke self-defensive counter-measures19from our Republic  thus maintaining the present tensesituation in a vicious cycle of aggravation.This situation of the Korean peninsula urgentlyrequires the establishment of a new peace arrangement. Inorder to ease tension and avert the danger of a war in theKorean peninsula  the United States should  before anythingelse  abandon its hostile policy against our Republic andsign a peace agreement with the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea. The Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States are still in a state of temporaryceasefire. The United States is in direct confrontation withthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  maintainingtens of thousands of its troops in and around South Korea.Removing the danger of war and ensuring peace in theKorean peninsula presupposes the withdrawal of the UnitedStates troops and the conclusion of a peace agreementbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea andthe United States. Hence  the resolution of the major issuespertaining to the maintenance of peace and security in theKorean peninsula falls under the responsibilities of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates. We recognize that these issues should be the toppriority on the agenda to be considered at the proposedfour-party talks if the talks are to be held to discuss theissues of ensuring peace and security in the Koreanpeninsula.If the United States is sincerely interested in ensuringpeace in the Korean peninsula  it should  inter alia  showits credibility by taking practical steps to discontinuemilitary threats and lift economic sanctions against theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.The countries concerned should refrain from any actsthat would be likely to impede the withdrawal of the UnitedStates troops from South Korea and the conclusion of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United States peaceagreement.The Government of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea will continue  as in the past  to make every effortto ensure peace in the Korean peninsula and to bring aboutthe peaceful reunification of the country  thus contributingtowards peace and security in North-East Asia and the restof the world.In order to prepare itself for the demands of the nextcentury  the United Nations should make an early departurefrom outdated structures that serve the interests of only afew countries  allowing them privileges and high-handedness. First of all  international society should bedemocratized through the democratic reform of the UnitedNations. The United Nations should be restructured so asto reflect the will of developing countries  which make upthe majority of United Nations Members  and to enablethem to exercise their sovereignty on an equal footing.The General Assembly  in which all United NationsMember States are equally represented  has beendemocratized  compared to the Security Council. Yet itsauthority has been severely restricted. On the other hand the Security Council lacks democracy to a great extent although it enjoys powerful authority. The presentcomposition of the permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil does not fully represent the developing countries which form the overwhelming majority of Member States.Neither does the non-permanent membership reflectgeographical representation.The end of the cold war has provided possibilitiesfor channelling more resources into the field ofdevelopment cooperation  but the present structure of theUnited Nations system does not correspond to thissituation.At this session of the General Assembly thedelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Koreawill exert constructive efforts to resolve such problemsand seek active cooperation with other Member States including the non-aligned countries.Despite the end of the cold war  the arms build-upcontinues unabated in different parts of the world. TheUnited Nations has long called for comprehensive andcomplete disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament.However  some nuclear and military Powers are stillboosting their efforts aimed at the qualitativemodernization of military strength under cover of calls forselective disarmament. As a result  in most casesdisarmament is now being replaced by the process ofreplacing with more sophisticated weapons those thathave become obsolete as a result of technicaldevelopments.Today  after the conclusion of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the nuclear Powers are resortingto subcritical nuclear tests to further modernize theirnuclear arsenals.International society  and the non-nuclear-weaponStates in particular  should give due attention to takingmeasures to overcome this phenomenon. It is in this20context that we support the proposal to convene the fourthspecial session of the General Assembly devoted todisarmament.In recent years there have been ample discussions onhuman rights at the United Nations and in otherinternational forums. However  the desired results have notyet been achieved. This is mainly attributable to the factthat United Nations Member States are pursuing differentends in their deliberations on human rights and haveconflicting views with regard to standards for human rights.As long as human rights issues continue to be abusedas a political means to put pressure on and interfere in theinternal affairs of others  any deliberations on human rightswill only have adverse effects upon international relations as is the case today. Furthermore  the application of doublestandards has not ceased with regard to other crucial issuessuch as disarmament and terrorism.In order to eliminate high-handedness andarbitrariness  and also to ensure fairness and justice inresolving international issues  international society shouldbe democratized at the earliest possible date.The twenty-first century should be a century devotedto development and cooperation. Development is directlylinked to international peace and security.In recent years major conferences  such as WorldSummit for Social Development  the United NationsConference on Human Settlements and the World FoodSummit  were convened under the auspices of the UnitedNations. These conferences made significant contributionsto elaborating action programmes and providing guidancefor international society with regard to cooperation in thefield of economic and social development.The role of the United Nations should be furtherstrengthened to translate these documents into tangibleresults. The United Nations has an important role inpersuading developed countries fully to implement theircommitments concerning official development assistanceand should pay due attention to resolving the issue ofexternal debt.We are of the view that the ongoing reform process ofUnited Nations-affiliated organizations dealing witheconomic and social issues and of the United NationsSecretariat should be carried out in such a way as to enablethem to make the best use of their potential fordevelopment and cooperation.Developed countries are urged to be wise enough toforesee that replacing the present unfair internationaleconomic relations with new ones that are more fair  will in the long term  be beneficial to them  and they shouldcooperate fully with other Member States in enhancingthe role of the United Nations in that direction.We appreciate and support the joint efforts of thecountries of Asia  Africa and Latin America to expandand strengthen regional cooperation for politicalsovereignty and socio-economic development in a spiritof collective self-reliance.We support Syria and other Arab countries in theirjust struggle to seek a fair and comprehensive solution tothe Middle East problem based on the principle of landfor peace  and hold that Israel should withdraw from alloccupied Arab territories.The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea adheres to the main ideal of ourforeign policy of independence  peace and friendship inconformity with the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter  and will continue to do so in the future.The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea will make every sincere effort for the success ofdeliberations on all agenda items that are before theGeneral Assembly at this session."
"135",5758,"PRT",52,1997,"﻿Allow me first tocongratulate my colleague from Ukraine  Minister HennadiyUdovenko  on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly  and to convey to him our appreciation and theconfidence we place in his personal qualities and experienceto steer the work of the current session. In his election  Isee also the recognition of the role played on theinternational stage by Ukraine  a European nation withwhich we have friendly ties. I am pleased to recall theoccasion on the margins of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) meeting in Portugal last May whenhe initialled a “letter on the special partnership betweenNATO and Ukraine”.I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoingPresident  Ambassador Razali Ismail  for the dedicated andcompetent manner in which he presided over the work ofthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly  and notablyfor his promotion of United Nations reform  which weconsider to be essential.I wish to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General for the new dynamism he has brought to theOrganization and for the proposals he has made for itsmodernization.My colleague from Luxembourg has already addressedthe Assembly on behalf of the 15 member States of theEuropean Union. However  I would like to reflect on anumber of questions of particular importance to mycountry.The main question on our agenda is undoubtedly thereform of the United Nations. Despite its achievements andincreasing importance on the international stage  the UnitedNations today needs a profound transformation to enable itto face the challenges of the next millennium.Portugal expresses its appreciation for the programmeof reforms presented by the Secretary-General and reaffirmsits readiness to participate in the further development ofthis initiative  taking up the challenge to build up a moreeffective Organization  with a better capacity to respondand a more rational utilization of its resources. ThePortuguese Government supports in general terms theproposals contained in that programme.Among the instrumental measures proposed  Portugalsees merit in the creation of the post of Deputy Secretary-General. We also welcome the proposal to rationalize thedebates of the General Assembly so that it may focus onspecific themes.With regard to the area of peace and security  theprimary focus of the action of the United Nations  wesupport the strengthening of its institutional capacity inthe field of preventive diplomacy and of post-conflictpeace-building. The creation of a rapidly deployablemission headquarters and the initiative of some MemberStates to constitute a high-readiness brigade areinstruments that will permit the United Nations tostrengthen its capacity to react to emerging crises. I ampleased to note that Portugal is ranked twenty-sixthamong nations contributing troops for United Nationspeacekeeping operations.We also believe that cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations should continue to beencouraged  particularly as concerns the Africancontinent.With regard to the defence and promotion of humanrights  I would like to commend the emphasis given bythe Secretary-General to its cross-sectoral nature  whichmust be taken into due account in all the activities andprogrammes of the United Nations.In this context  we are also particularly pleased tosee the proposal to fuse the Centre for Human Rightswith the Office of the High Commissioner for HumanRights. The process of reform in this area will be carriedout by the new High Commissioner  Mrs. Mary Robinson whom I congratulate on her recent appointment.The effectiveness of intervention by the UnitedNations in humanitarian assistance is of special concernto us  including within the framework of the SecurityCouncil. Therefore  Portugal welcomes the proposal of theSecretary-General to restructure this sector bystrengthening the role of the Emergency ReliefCoordinator  as well as the suggestion for theestablishment of an Economic and Social Councilsegment for humanitarian affairs.The promotion of social and economic progress is afundamental goal of the United Nations. As the Secretary-11General rightly reminded us in an Agenda for Development development cannot be attained in the absence of peace andsecurity or in absence of respect for all human rights andfundamental freedoms.Portugal notes with satisfaction the process ofreadjustment proposed by the Secretary-General tostrengthen the macroeconomic coordinating mechanisms ofthe activities of the United Nations and its specializedagencies.In the area of assistance for development  we see withequal satisfaction the focus on guaranteeing an integrated coherent and coordinated activity of all funds  programmesand agencies involved. As we see it  however  such effortsmust not jeopardize their respective autonomy andspecificity.We understand the goals of the challenge launched bythe Secretary-General to replenish the levels of financingfor development activities of the United Nations. For ourpart  we pledge to continue our efforts  within the limits ofour capabilities. We also believe that the persuasion andmobilization of the private sector may turn out to be veryuseful at a time of acute budgetary restrictions.In this context  and in the light of the increasingdisparity between developed and developing countries  theproposal of the Secretary-General to channel savingsresulting from reforms towards development activities isparticularly welcome to us. The promotion of sustainable equitable and socially just development has increasinglybecome a top priority for the United Nations. The guaranteeof a balance between economic growth  the conservation ofthe environment and the protection of natural resources isessential for the future of our planet. Portugal thereforesupports the proposals of the Secretary-General aimed atstrengthening the United Nations Environment Programmeas the core environmental agency of the United Nations.Finally  we cannot fail to underline that the goal of thereforms  particularly in the economic and social sector should not be exclusively to reduce costs but to rationalizestructures and consequently to improve the capacity of theOrganization.We support a reform and enlargement of the SecurityCouncil that reflects the increase in the Members of theUnited Nations  takes into account the new political andeconomic realities and ensures fairer geographicaldistribution. In this way  the Security Council will be moredemocratic and therefore more effective in theformulation and implementation of its decisions.With regard to the composition of the SecurityCouncil  we advocate an equitable increase in bothcategories of membership  encompassing all regionalgroups  in order to make it more representative.As to the selection of new permanent members  webelieve that certain criteria should be applied  namely respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter full acceptance of the jurisdiction of the InternationalCourt of Justice and the capacity and will to contribute tothe maintenance of international peace and security  aswell as global influence.The Portuguese Government reaffirms its support forthe inclusion of Germany and Japan as permanentmembers of the Security Council. But it would bedifficult to understand if the increase in the number ofpermanent members did not also include States from theregions of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean.In this context  among eligible countries  there is Brazil a founding Member of the United Nations  the largestcountry in Latin America and a State that is committed tothe principles of the Charter.Portugal believes particular emphasis should begiven to the review of the working methods of theSecurity Council  not only in order to strengthen thetransparency of its decision-making process  but also tocreate the conditions for an improved ability fornon-members to accompany the work of the Council. Infact  this was one of the concerns of the Portuguesecandidature for the Security Council for 1997-1998 andwas one of the main priorities of the Portuguesepresidency of the Council last April. Within the SecurityCouncil  we have advocated the holding of open Councildebates to allow non-members to participate indiscussions of matters of direct interest to them.We have also encouraged the involvement of theSecurity Council in debating themes which have particularrelevance to its work  such as the promotion of humanrights  the protection of refugees  humanitarian assistanceand the impact of sanctions  aiming at providing a morecoherent framework for the Council to act in the future.One of the most pressing concerns requiring anurgent response is resolution of the Organization’s seriousfinancial crisis. We believe that the solution lies in thefull and timely fulfilment of obligations  the unconditional12payment of arrears to the Organization  review of the scalesof assessment so as to reflect the real capacity to pay ofMember States  and applying financial rigour andrationalizing the use of existing resources. These proposalsseek to guarantee a sound financial base for the UnitedNations.Portugal  a member of the troika of observer countriesof the peace process in Angola  and a member of theSecurity Council  continues to pay particular attention todevelopments in that African country. We were particularlyencouraged to witness the positive events of March thisyear: the formation of a Government of Unity and NationalReconciliation including members of UNITA  as well as thereturn to the National Assembly of that movement’sparliamentary group. These important fulfilments of the1994 Lusaka Protocol  which is the framework for theentire process  were undoubtedly an important step forwardin the eyes of all those  foremost among them the Angolanpeople themselves  who yearn to see this great Africancountry enter fully into a future of peace  nationalreconciliation and economic and social development. Weare therefore understandably concerned about the newdifficulties affecting the peace process  which have alreadyresulted in the timely  and we hope decisive  interventionby the Security Council through its resolution 1127 (1997) adopted last month. As we stated on the occasion of itsadoption  we consider the terms of the resolution — theability to impose sanctions — to be a stimulus for UNITAto fulfil its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol  which itaccepted freely. This is not an attempt to condemn UNITAto isolation or to exclude it from the peace process  ofwhich it is  and should continue to be  an integral part.Peace in Angola is possible and necessary. But  as wehave stated before  in the final analysis it depends on thepolitical will of the Lusaka Protocol signatories. They mustnot  however  ignore the human  financial and materialinvestments the international community has already madein Angola in defence of the peace process. Should thecurrent impasse in the Angolan peace process continue  theinternational community will undoubtedly adopt themeasures required under the circumstances. We thereforereiterate our appeal to the parties  and in particular toUNITA  to show the international community  by takingconcrete steps  that they have decidedly opted for the roadto peace  once and for all relegating to the past the spectreof a fratricidal war.Finally  I could not end this reference to Angolawithout saluting the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Angola  Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye  who hasbeen tireless in his mission to defend the peace process.We would also like to place on record our sincereappreciation to all those who  working with either greatcommitment with the United Nations Angola VerificationMission (UNAVEM III) or the United Nations ObserverMission in Angola (MONUA)  embody the internationalcommunity’s hope that a brighter future awaits theAngolan people.Year after year Portugal has brought to the attentionof this Assembly the question of East Timor. Some mayhave thought that time would consign this question tooblivion. But the events of this last year have confirmedthat the problem of East Timor is more alive than everbefore in the conscience of the international community.I recall the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 toMonsignor Ximenes Belo and José Ramos-Horta  twoEast Timorese who  in different fields  have greatlydistinguished themselves in taking up the rights and theidentity of the people of East Timor. The award of thatPrize also demonstrates the respect and solidarity of worldpublic opinion for the struggle of a people for freedomand for their inalienable right to self-determination  whichall Members of the United Nations are duty-bound torespect.Here  I would like to praise the recent initiative ofthe President of South Africa  Nelson Mandela  in supportof the efforts of the Secretary-General  aimed at therelease of the East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao andof all other East Timorese political prisoners.Unfortunately  this increasing international attentionto the question of East Timor has not resulted in animprovement of the situation in the territory  where thesystematic violation of the most basic human rightspersists and whose people continue to be denied the rightto express and affirm their identity  despite thedeliberations  year after year  of the Human RightsCommission.I would like to express our recognition of the newimpetus which  in accordance with the mandate given tohim by resolution 37/30  the Secretary-General has soughtto give to the search for a negotiated settlement to theproblem of East Timor by: appointing a PersonalRepresentative dedicated exclusively to this matter  in theeminent person of Ambassador Jamsheed Marker;providing a more operational and active impulse to thetripartite negotiations under his auspices; and relaunching13the all-inclusive East Timorese dialogue which involves theactive participation of the East Timorese in this process involvement that is essential to its success.Only through negotiations will it be possible to find alasting solution to the problem of East Timor. Portugal iscontributing  with hope and commitment  to this new cycleof negotiations aimed at achieving a just  comprehensiveand internationally acceptable solution for East Timor according to the terms of the Charter and the relevantresolutions of the United Nations.Portugal has sought to give fresh impetus to itsparticipation in international organizations  recognizing thedynamism and increased importance of multilateral forumsin international life. Since the last General Assemblysession  Portugal has hosted two important internationalmeetings: the Summit Meeting of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the springministerial meeting of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO). Portugal has also recently hostedtwo rounds of negotiations on Western Sahara. Wewelcome the positive results achieved on this question bythe special envoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. JamesBaker.In 1998  Portugal will be hosting the eighth Ibero-American Summit  and will organize  in close cooperationwith the United Nations  the first world conference of youthministers  which will take action on the United NationsWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000and Beyond.I would like also to refer to the Community ofPortuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP). The promotion ofthe Portuguese language  spoken today by more than 200million people  the new modalities of institutionalcooperation which have been established and thecoordination of the diplomatic and political positions of thefounder countries in the many international forumsinvolved  have made this organization  despite its youth  anattentive participant within the international community.The problems associated with the many components ofthe drug phenomenon are among the biggest challengesfaced by our societies today. The phenomenon particularlyaffects our young people  and its global nature certainlyrequires a concerted response on the part of the entireinternational community. In this context  and given thatPortugal is presiding over the preparatory work for thespecial session of the General Assembly on drugs  whichwill take place in June 1998  I would like to underline theimportance we attribute to that event. We sincerely hopethat that session will produce a clear political commitmenton the part of Governments to combat the drug plague and that concrete steps will be taken in that direction.With a view to achieving these objectives  I appeal toMember States to be represented at the special session atthe highest political level.With regard to sustainable development  Portugal hasclosely followed the implementation of the principlesestablished by the Rio Summit. The nineteenth specialsession of the General Assembly confirmed  however  thatwe are still far from implementing fully the goalsestablished there. Allow me to underline the threecomponents to which Portugal attributes particularimportance: combating desertification  protecting theforests and protecting the oceans. Portugal considers thatin the fight against desertification the United NationsConvention is the fundamental legal instrument for theimplementation of new international actions on thismatter. With regard to the northern Mediterranean  wewill continue to promote the most extensive cooperationwith our partners  and we are open to closer associationwith the countries of North Africa in a joint effortinvolving the entire Mediterranean region.In the area of the preservation of forests  we supportaction undertaken  particularly in the context of theUnited Nations  with a view to the conservation integrated development and sustainable management ofthis important heritage of mankind. I would like to drawattention to the holding in Lisbon in June 1998 of thethird Pan-European ministerial Meeting on the protectionof the forests  which we hope will contribute significantlyto protecting forest ecosystems that have deteriorated.As regards the oceans and seas  Portugal willcontinue to support efforts to preserve them  advocatingin particular the more effective protection of marinebiodiversity and the integrated management of coastal continental and insular zones.Following the proclamation of 1998 as theInternational Year of the Ocean  Portugal is proud to beorganizing in Lisbon the last universal exposition of thiscentury  Expo 98  which will be dedicated to the theme“Oceans: a heritage for the future”.Particularly relevant in this context will be the workof the Independent World Commission on the Oceans chaired by the former President of the PortugueseRepublic  Mr. Mario Soares  the conclusions of which14will be presented to the General Assembly at its nextsession.I would like to end my statement with a word of hopeand optimism for the future of the Organization. We believein a revitalized and even stronger United Nations for thetwenty-first century. The Assembly can count on our effortsto work towards that goal."
"136",5804,"PRY",52,1997,"﻿Itis a great honour for me to address this great Assembly inmy capacity as President of the Republic of Paraguay. Itake this opportunity to express my deepest thanks to thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko. Also  I would note the excellentwork done by Ambassador Razali Ismail  who so efficientlyguided the work of the last session. In addition  I shouldlike to extend my best wishes to Mr. Kofi Annan  inconnection with his responsibilities as he exercises hisfunctions as Secretary-General of the Organization.For the people of Paraguay  throughout the longstruggle to acquire and strengthen their democraticinstitutions  the United Nations has always been auniversal forum that ensures the free debate of ideas andthe participation of all the peoples of the world  withoutexclusion or discrimination  the vital issues involvingdevelopment  equity  the maintenance of peace and thepreservation of the environment.Because of the great importance my country attachesto this forum  we recognize the urgent need to support theinstitutional reform of the United Nations bystrengthening the General Assembly and democratizingthe Security Council — adding both permanent and non-permanent members — so that this institution will be ableto respond appropriately to the new challenges facing theinternational community.Last August last I had the great honour of chairingin Asunción the eleventh summit of the Heads of Stateand Government of the Permanent Mechanism forConsultation and Policy Coordination — the RioGroup — the members of which are Argentina  Bolivia Brazil  Chile  Colombia  Ecuador  Mexico  Guyana Honduras  Panama  Paraguay  Peru  Uruguay andVenezuela. There a Declaration was adopted on thestrengthening of the United Nations and the reform ofSecurity Council  stressing certain principles andguidelines that I shall now describe.The Declaration of Asunción expresses  first  fullsupport for multilateralism  sovereign equality of Statesand steadfast respect for the rule of law.Second  it expresses support for the Secretary-General’s initiative in putting forward a broad programmefor reform  presented on 16 July of this year  particularlyreforms designed to strengthen the effectiveness of theSecretariat and to emphasize activities to promote economicand social development.Third  it notes the relevance of the process ofincreasing the membership of the Security Council and toreforming it to correct the imbalances in its currentmembership  improve its decision-making mechanisms make it more transparent so that it will reflect in a morelegitimate and representative manner the overallmembership of the Organization.Fourth  it states that  because of its legal traditions andcontribution to the cause of peace  the Latin American andCaribbean region should be given special consideration inany proposal to increase the membership of the SecurityCouncil.Fifth  it expresses the conviction that reform of theSecurity Council must respect the principles of equitablegeographical distribution and the sovereign equality ofStates  and that any reform that entails discrimination bydeveloped countries against developing countries would beunacceptable.Sixth  it expresses the ideal of moving towards thetotal elimination of the veto and  as a first step  limiting itsuse to actions taken under Chapter VII of the UnitedNations Charter.Seventh  it expresses the importance of transparencyin management and decision-making in the Security Counciland increasing the number of open meetings and orientationmeetings at which the Secretary-General or his specialrepresentatives present reports.Eighth  it considers that the increase in the SecurityCouncil’s membership  the reform of its working methodsand the question of the veto are integral parts of Councilreform and must be addressed in the same agreement.Ninth  it expresses the explicit resolve of ourGovernments to continue to participate actively in theWorking Group in order to reach general agreement on thismatter.Let me say once again that this increase in thepermanent and non-permanent membership of the Councilmust necessarily envisage the presence of Latin Americaand the Caribbean and other geographical groups withoutany form of discrimination whatsoever. In this connection Paraguay reaffirms its support for permanent membershipfor Brazil  Germany and Japan.It is also important to note that the process ofreforming the Organization must include a plan toeliminate unnecessary expenditures and an attempt tomerge programmes designed to further the developmentof our peoples  which will lead to an optimum utilizationof available resources as well as to the elimination ofduplication in the use of human  technical or economicresources. The serious financial problems of the UnitedNations deserve sincere and determined consideration.I am pleased to say that my country has always  inso far as it has been able  honoured its internationalcommitments  aware that the Organization’s properfunctioning requires the appropriate and equitabledistribution of its administrative costs among all MemberStates.This moment in history is indeed a very special one.Alliances are now being replaced by complementarity.Isolationism and confrontation have given way toglobalization and cooperation. We no longer speak ofrivalry and struggle but  rather  of honest and creativecompetition. The asymmetries in the world order thathave historically meant that some nations have beensubordinate to others are now themselves beingsubordinated to this influx of solidarity and mutualassistance.It is of course true that many serious conflict areascontinue to exist  but Paraguay is pleased to note thecommendable efforts that the United Nations has made inthe maintenance of peace in various areas of tension  andwe have followed closely the Organization’s initiatives insuch new areas of conflict as Cambodia and Sierra Leone for whose peoples my country most sincerely wishes theimmeasurable benefits of peace and harmony.We have also followed with keen interest thedisturbing developments in the Middle East situation  andwe urge the parties there to redouble their efforts to seeka lasting and stable peace. We warmly welcome theactions taken by the mediating nations  which untiringlycontinue to participate in all negotiations.With regard to the particular case of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  Paraguay welcomes the attitude adoptedby that country’s Government and expresses its hope that2there will be movement towards reconciliation and that itwill be possible to resolve the differences with the People’sRepublic of China.In keeping with the principle of the universality of theUnited Nations  all States that meet the requirements setforth in the Charter have the right to seek admission ormembership. In this respect  we believe that it would beadvisable to reconsider General Assembly resolution 2758(XXVI)  which completely denies the 21 million inhabitantsof the Republic of China on Taiwan the fundamental rightto participate in international organizations and theiractivities.The challenges of peace  security and equilibrium aremore relevant to us today than ever before  and they are anabsolute imperative for building a world that guaranteesdevelopment to nations in a context of universal harmony.On the crucial issue of world disarmament  allow meto reiterate Paraguay’s position of support for UnitedNations efforts in this sphere. My country welcomesoptimistically the preparatory work for the ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be held in theyear 2000  hoping that by then the Treaty will have becomeuniversal. That Treaty  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the efforts of States to reduce their arsenalsand the establishment of new nuclear-weapon-free zones areall important elements that will help prevent theproliferation of nuclear weapons and eventually achievegeneral and complete nuclear disarmament.True to its pacifist principles  the Republic ofParaguay has been following the Ottowa process with greatinterest. We recently took part in the Oslo DiplomaticConference  which adopted the definitive text of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction  and we supported the majority positionof the principal States to seek appropriate and effectivelegal mechanisms to prohibit the manufacture  use anddistribution of the cruel devices of death and pain that areanti-personnel landmines.We congratulate the international community on thatdecisive step  and we reaffirm our unswerving decision tosign the Convention. We urge other Governments to do thesame without any doubt or delay  so as to ensure its earliestpossible entry into force.I should also like to reaffirm my country’sunswerving commitment to continue the struggle againstterrorism  a destabilizing force that negates human rightsand threatens to undermine the very foundations ofsecurity in our regions.It is fitting here to stress that Paraguay  along withthe entire international community  is concerned about thegrowth of drug trafficking. We therefore firmly reiteratethe Paraguayan people’s determination to combat thatscourge and its resolve to take integrated and concertedaction  within the context of international cooperation andin conjunction with producing  transit and consumingcountries.In this connection  I am pleased to inform theAssembly that in October 1996 my country’s Parliament at the initiative of the Executive  adopted a law thatestablishes norms and punishments for the crime oflaundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic innarcotics  psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs thereby significantly improving the legal framework forcombating such crimes head on.On 10 December 1998 we shall celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the proclamation of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  a major landmark in thehistory of humankind and its endless struggle to ensuredignity and reciprocity among human beings. Much ofwhat we have achieved along the way has been theproduct of blood and pain  but with due satisfaction wecan now confirm that the principles and objectives of theDeclaration are increasingly being put into effect and thatthe concept of a State based on the rule of law isgradually becoming part of our national realities.Moreover  the new culture of democratic solidarity hasmanaged convincingly to combat any aspirations for areturn to anachronistic times in our political historycharacterized by authoritarianism and the denial of humanrights.For Paraguay  the road to freedom and theestablishment of an institutional basis which sits well withour republican ideals has been long. During this journey my Government has helped make the dream of everyParaguayan a reality: the establishment of a systemguaranteeing full freedom and a strengthened democracyallowing the peaceful transfer of the presidential mandateto another candidate  elected by the people  who will takeup the office of President of the Republic in August 1998.3This is in keeping with the undeniableachievements of the World Conference on Human Rightsheld in Vienna in 1993  which reaffirmed the universalityand indivisibility of human rights  while recommending thatgreater attention be paid to the links between democracy development and the satisfaction of the basic needs of themost disadvantaged sectors of the population.My Government has therefore tried to strengthen theinterrelationship between democracy  development andhuman rights  thus combining these democraticachievements  through a plan for social action designed tocreate opportunities so that all citizens  through their ownefforts  can enjoy all the benefits of human development.Obviously  a central feature of democratic governanceis concern for social problems. If our democracies do notadapt to these new realities  not only will they beimpossible to govern  but they will remain on the sidelinesof history. Even worse  that all the sacrifices made tostrengthen our institutions may have to yield to populist andMessianic pressures.I am pleased to state today that my Government hasbeen able to lay the foundations for true development without making any Messianic promises or pandering to thepopulists. I should highlight the significant progress madein the institutional framework of this process  with electoralreform that has enabled us to move satisfactorily throughall the stages of the democratic schedule. Equally historicis the balance achieved in civil and military relations following the successes of April 1996  when popularpressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on thecontinent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdatedforms of autocracy.I am convinced that our fledgling democracy hasgathered new strength since those events and that it will bean insuperable obstacle to any attempts to bring down ourinstitutions. Furthermore  the changes to the administrationof justice  with a multiparty Supreme Court  prevent anymanipulation or distortion of the mechanisms laid down bythe Constitution and the laws of the Republic.Management by parliament has become part of theprocess of joint cooperation in government  and this hasbeen an enriching experience in the democratic life of thecountry.Paraguay has a young population which is eager tolearn. Current and future generations must be able to equatea free economy with democracy and democracy with aState based on the rule of law  with guarantees for humandignity.During the Eleventh Summit of Heads of State andGovernment of the Rio Group  which was held in mycountry  I spoke enthusiastically about the need for a boldstrategy to back up the ideals of democracy  sustainabledevelopment  equity and integration  and placed particularemphasis on what I called “education for democracy”.The training of young people in this emerging worldmust include guidelines based on sound ethical anddoctrinaire principles. The young must be givenexperience in how to handle modern technological tools so that they can deal with the requirements of the newpolitical  economic and social processes which aredefining the current and future development of ournations.Further thought needs to be given to theenvironmental issue. Five years after the Rio Conference the Republic of Paraguay is building on the increasingawareness of the need to preserve the ecosystem  whosepriority nature is reflected in the 1992 Constitution. ButI must also emphasize how urgent it is to give full effectto the principle of common but differentiatedresponsibility put forward in Rio. If it is to be valid  thisprinciple must enjoy the support of richer countries interms of financial and technical assistance  so that we canput an end once and for all to the “ecology of poverty”which forces many sectors of poor countries to destroytheir environmental basis with the simple and tragic aimof ensuring their subsistence from day to day.I have every reason to be satisfied that myGovernment has been able to institutionalize variousinstruments to improve the quality of the environment inour country — in particular  the strategy for managing using  preserving and protecting natural resources in thecontext of the programme for change in Agenda 21 whose basic aim it is to strengthen the process ofsustainable development.Highlights of the new environmental legislation nowin force include laws on evaluating the environmentalimpact  on wildlife  on protected rural areas and onpenalties for ecological offences. In the context of theAgenda for Change  we are ratifying internationalagreements  and taking account of the importance ofinternational cooperation on the environment. With regardto the United Nations Convention to CombatDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious4Drought and/or Desertification  particularly in Africa  wesubmitted the legal instrument for ratifying the instrumentin January this year. In this context  the countries that sharethe Gran Chaco Americano — Paraguay  Bolivia andArgentina — have entered into a new relationship based ona model of cooperation for sustainable development in thisvast region.There is an old saying that nobody is so rich that hedoes not need anything and nobody is so poor that he hasnothing to give. In line with those words of wisdom  everyMember State of this Organization has given and received.In the particular case of Paraguay  I have to point out thatinternational cooperation has played a decisive role  and itstrue dimensions can therefore be assessed and appreciated.For this reason  I am particularly grateful to the UnitedNations  whose presence in Paraguay  through its variousspecialized agencies  has been and continues to be sopositive and dynamic.Just over six years ago the Argentine Republic  Brazil Paraguay and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay  and later the Republic of Chile and the Republic of Bolivia  asassociated members of the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR)  decided to cooperate in a spirit of solidarityin order to gain an increasingly advantageous position inthis globalized and dynamic world. In that context we havereached undeniably relevant milestones for the present andfuture of our peoples.Today  it is recognized that in MERCOSUR we are onthe right path  and we are receiving an encouragingmessage from the outside world concerning our integration.Our efforts are focused on trying to establish a commonmarket  within a gradual and continuous process in whichthe basic stages still need to be rounded off  improved andstudied in depth.MERCOSUR’s experience is expanding. This is animportant regional bloc. We have opened negotiations withthe Andean Community and the United Mexican States  andwe hope that by the end of this year agreements will besigned allowing for trade preferences in the region.Moreover  MERCOSUR participates in the Free Trade Areaof the Americas  and there are proposals to conclude shortlya hemispheric free trade initiative involving the 34 countriesof the Americas.MERCOSUR is also expanding towards the EuropeanUnion. We are making progress in defining politicaldecisions which would encourage the establishment of afree trade zone between the two customs unions.This has been my third address to the GeneralAssembly as President of the Republic of Paraguay. I amhere today to reconfirm on behalf of my country — afounding Member of the United Nations — ourcommitment to the lofty ideals that inspire us. OurOrganization needs to be adapted and reformed so as tobe able to respond effectively to the major challenges ofthe next millennium. Paraguay undertakes to make itscontribution to attaining those noble objectives.At this very special moment I warmly embrace theAssembly  not only in the name of my people  but also onbehalf of myself  Juan Carlos Wasmosy  a citizen withfaith in democracy  struggled for his country’s freedomand won."
"137",5869,"QAT",52,1997,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I am confident that your politicalexperience will help you conduct the work of the sessionwisely and successfully.I should also like to commend your predecessor  HisExcellency Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for theexcellent way in which he presided over the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session.I also wish to extend our congratulations to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his election to hiscurrent position  and to express our appreciation for hisprogramme for the reform of the Organization. He can beassured of our full support for any measures he takes tothat end.As we approach a new millennium  the world iswitnessing a series of internal and external conflicts thatrepresent a great regression when compared to theoptimistic expectations that followed the end of the coldwar and the collapse of ideological conflicts. A newworld characterized by balance and equitable relationsamong States was expected to emerge  with a view to thecreation of innovative cooperation among our States andpeoples in different areas of concern. However  I regretto say that the world is still facing severe problems  suchas political conflict  poverty  famine and intensivemigratory movements. These are the result of pooreconomic conditions  refugee flows caused by wars  thedeterioration of the environment  trafficking in illicitdrugs and the proliferation of organized crime.In the context of these changes  and more than halfa century after the United Nations was established  thereis an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drasticreforms  both structural and functional  so as to establishrules and principles for a new international order free ofdouble standards. Such a new order would allow us torise to the new challenges and achieve the goals set forthin the Charter more than 50 years ago for themaintenance of international peace and security and theintensification of international cooperation for the benefitof the peoples of the world.To this end  the process of reform must begin byactivating the role of the General Assembly and enablingit to fulfil its duty in an effective manner that would giveits democratic resolutions vitality and credibility beforeinternational public opinion. The Security Council mustalso be reformed  so that it can carry out the role it hasbeen entrusted with  because it has a special status amongthe United Nations bodies  as defined in the Charter. In ourview  this cannot be achieved except through a generalagreement that would regulate the use of the veto power limiting such use to cases covered by Chapter VII of theUnited Nations Charter  namely  threats to internationalpeace.In order for the Security Council to reflect the newpolitical and economic realities of a changing world  it mustincrease the number of its non-permanent members toprovide for just and balanced representation and to enablethe Council to deal with the new international realities andshoulder its responsibilities by becoming more democraticthrough the adoption of a rotation system  not limitingmembership to certain States  and by giving all States theopportunity to participate in its work and assume their shareof international responsibility.Although we understand the opinions advocating anincrease in the number of permanent members  we believethat the coexistence of permanent members that have thepower of veto with permanent members that do not  plusnon-permanent members  runs counter to the concepts ofequality among States  geographic and culturalrepresentation and international participation. It also runscounter to the principle of democratic decision-making. Inorder to achieve the required balance  fairness  justice equality and reason call for an increase in Security Councilmembership for Asia  Africa and Latin America. Together those three continents have the majority of world populationand States. Nevertheless  their representation on theSecurity Council is less than 50 per cent. In order for theSecretary-General to be able to carry out the reforms thatfall within his competence  the financial crisis of the UnitedNations must be addressed by making Member Stateshonour their legal commitments and pay their dues withoutdelay. In this regard  we would like to express our deepgratitude to Mr. Ted Turner for his generous donation tosome United Nations humanitarian programmes. We hopethis will be an encouraging initiative for others to follow.The task of maintaining international peace andsecurity has particular importance. Therefore  measuresrecommended by the General Assembly or taken by theSecurity Council should not be limited to post-conflict orwar situations. More attention should be given toappropriate and timely preventive measures  because webelieve that early measures adopted by the internationalcommunity are the ideal way to avert the outbreak ofconflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessarypolitical and military measures in the aftermath of theconflict — let alone imposing half solutions that are oftenunfair.The question of disarmament plays an essential rolein building the foundation of international peace andsecurity. To achieve this goal  we believe that renewingthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) indefinitely is a decision that requires more supportand endorsement  so that the Treaty can acquire auniversal character  with the adherence of all States. Inthis context  the State of Qatar affirms that Israel shouldadhere to that Treaty and should place its nuclearfacilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency’ssafeguards regime. This will be a basic step towardsestablishing a zone free from nuclear and other weaponsof mass destruction in the Middle East. It would alsocontribute to achieving equitable and balanced peace andstability in that important area of the world so that therewould be no multiple criteria for defining the conduct ofStates.In the same context  we cannot fail to mention thespecial importance of the Convention to ban anti-personnel mines  which was finalized in Oslo recently. Itwill be ready for signature in Ottawa next December. Wehope it will be signed by all States.The world has witnessed fundamental economicchanges  such as the end of State control of economic lifein many States  the withering away of numerous restraintson international trade  the easy transfer of capital andhuge investments across the world. Meanwhile  manyeconomies in developing countries are still deteriorating.This requires that urgent and effective solutions beprovided by the international community to enable thoseStates to progress and develop their societies throughbuilding strong and effective economies. Such anendeavour requires us to take a new look at expenditureson armaments  in order to save such huge sums andallocate them to supporting education and healthprogrammes. This would also enable us to address theproblems of poverty and the environment and to developthe economies of developing nations. This is an absolutenecessity for any new international economic order basedon integration and balance  and is capable of devisingdesired solutions for the aforementioned problems. Theproblems of poverty  backwardness and lack of access toeducation and medical care are among the problems thataffect developing countries. The societies of such Statesalso suffer from a population explosion that isdisproportionate to their resources. At the same time fortunes are being wasted on armaments  arms races or2luxuries. This causes huge discrepancies in consumptionrates between the peoples of rich countries and those ofpoor countries.Such problems compel us to be fully aware of the factthat solving them requires reconsidering the question ofmilitary expenditures. It is no secret to anybody in authoritythat while the programmes implemented by the UnitedNations Children’s Fund  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and the World Food Programme cost less than$4.6 billion a year  Governments all over the world arespending about $800 billion every year on armaments while 1.3 billion people are still living in a state of abjectpoverty.Now I would like to address the situation in theMiddle East and the crisis of the peace process.The Israeli Government is still stalling in theimplementation of agreements and putting impediments andobstacles in the way of achieving a just and comprehensivepeace. Israel is undermining the peace process by buildingsettlements  reneging on agreements and commitmentsreached with the Palestinian Authority  imposing a blockadeon the Palestinian people  depriving them of their rights andflouting international legality. This generates violence andcounter-violence. The Israeli policy runs counter to GeneralAssembly resolutions and Security Council resolutions especially resolutions 242 (1967)  271 (1969)  298 (1971) 478 (1980) and 672 (1990). They all provide that alllegislative and administrative measures taken by Israelaimed at altering the legal status and demographiccomposition of the occupied Arab territories  including thecity of Jerusalem  are null and void  and have no legalrelevance. They also run counter to the Fourth GenevaConvention of 1949 concerning the protection of civiliansand their properties in time of war. Therefore  theinternational community is called upon to exert pressure onthe Israeli Government to make it desist immediately fromimplementing the policies that jeopardize the peace processas a whole.The Arab leaders affirmed last year at the Cairosummit that peace in the Middle East is a strategic option.They underlined the importance of having all the partiescommitted to the Madrid formula that calls for a peacebased on the principle of land for peace. This means thatIsrael should withdraw completely from all the occupiedPalestinian and Arab territories  including East Jerusalem to enable the Palestinian people to establish theirindependent State  with Arab Jerusalem as its capital. Itshould also withdraw completely from the Syrian Golan andfrom southern Lebanon to the internationally recognizedborders  in keeping with Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).There has been a noticeable improvement over thelast five years on the road to achieving a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It started withthe Madrid Conference and moved on to Oslo and thesubsequent peace accords. Several economic conferenceswere held to promote the Middle East peace process andto contribute to moving it forward by underscoring thecommon interests of the peoples of the region.To that effect  arrangements are being made to holda fourth economic summit conference for the Middle Eastand North Africa next November in Doha  the capital ofmy country. In this connection  I would emphasize thatthe State of Qatar has no private interest in acting as hostfor this conference. Our interest in holding it is based onthe following reasons.First  we believe that peace is a strategic choice thatthe Arab countries have adopted since the MadridConference.Secondly  such a conference would manifest ourdesire for the peace process to continue. Failure of thepeace process would have serious implications and wouldthreaten peace both at the regional and at the internationallevel.Thirdly  our region has witnessed many wars in pastyears  the last of which was the 1991 Gulf War  whichhave impeded economic and political progress in ourregion and imposed on us huge expenditures onarmaments at the expense of the social development andwell-being of our peoples.Fourthly  at the 1995 Amman Economic Summit theState of Qatar committed itself to acting as host to thefourth summit conference  and honouring thatcommitment is a question of our credibility as a State thatrespects its commitments.Some are of the opinion that the conference shouldbe cancelled due to current Israeli policy that does notrespect undertakings and agreements  flouts internationallegality and tries to marginalize the role of the UnitedNations. Although we in Qatar understand the reasonsbehind such an opinion  which calls for the cancellationof the conference in response to the practices of theIsraeli Government  which has not respected its3international commitments  we do respect our internationalcommitments  and we believe that no State should haveveto power with regard to the peace process. We havetherefore decided to act as host to the conference on itsappointed date. If it does not prove to be successful andfails to achieve the desired results  the Government of Israelwill bear sole responsibility.The State of Qatar welcomes the position of theUnited States of America  as expressed by its Secretary ofState during our meeting in Saudi Arabia and here in NewYork. We also welcome the resolve it has shown in dealingwith the disruption of the peace process in the Middle East as well as the fact that it has underlined the principle ofland for peace  the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil and the inadmissibility of taking unilateralmeasures that run counter to the peace process.My country also appreciates the position of the Statesof the European Union  as well as the Russian Federationfor their support of the peace process in the Middle East.The State of Qatar views with satisfaction andappreciation the positions taken by States that support theMiddle East peace process and reject the Israeli settlementpolicies that are obstructing that process. At the same time my country stresses the importance of the role of theUnited Nations in the Middle East peace process andopposes any attempts to exclude it.The State of Qatar joins the other fraternal membersof the Gulf Cooperation Council in their endeavour topromote security and stability in the Gulf region  which isof strategic and vital importance to the entire world. TheState of Qatar is making a constructive effort in thatcontext with the aim of establishing good and constructiverelations with all countries of the region on the basis ofgood-neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-intervention inthe internal affairs of others  respect for internationallegality and the settlement of disputes through peacefulmeans  dialogue and mediation or by arbitration underinternational law. The State of Qatar supports the settlementof the dispute between the United Arab Emirates and theIslamic Republic of Iran over the three islands of AbuMusa and Greater and Lesser Tunb by those means.My Government and people have expressed theirfraternal feelings and strong empathy towards the brotherlypeople of Iraq  who are living in extremely difficultcircumstances resulting from the sanctions imposed onthem. We have therefore welcomed the oil-for-foodagreement between the United Nations and Iraq to alleviatethe suffering of the fraternal people of Iraq and to providethem with such basic necessities as food and medicine.My Government has also emphasized the importance ofrespecting Iraq’s sovereignty  territorial integrity andregional security. We condemn any foreign interferencein its internal affairs. In the same context  myGovernment affirms the importance of implementation bythe Government of Iraq of the relevant resolutions of theSecurity Council  in particular those concerning therelease of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees and othernationals in the same conditions. Such steps would helpthe international community to lift the embargo imposedon Iraq and would also enable Iraq to carry out aconstructive role in achieving security  stability andrehabilitation in the region.My Government also expresses its concern for thesuffering to which the brotherly people of Libya are beingsubjected due to the sanctions imposed against thatcountry because of the Lockerbie issue. In thatconnection  the State of Qatar calls for the creation of auniform and agreed regime for imposing sanctions and ofmechanisms to lift them subsequently in a manner thatdoes not distinguish among States and peoples and thatstrikes a balance between international interests  on theone hand  and the suffering to which peoples aresubjected  on the other.Last week the Security Council devoted a meeting toaddressing the problems of disputes and wars in someAfrican countries. It considered ways of containing andsolving such problems. The State of Qatar  which hasfraternal relations with the African countries  is pained towitness the current state of affairs in States such as theSudan  Somalia  the Comoros  Rwanda  Sierra Leone andthe Congo. We believe that the African States are capableof overcoming their plight if they receive the necessaryinternational support  particularly for the purpose ofimproving their economies and the transfer of technologyin an international partnership in which all wouldparticipate.My country was one of the first to welcome theDayton Peace Agreement because we believe in theimportance of peace and cooperation in the Balkans. Wehave therefore supported the reconstruction of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have also madecontacts with our neighbour countries to urge them tocooperate with each other to help rehabilitate the region develop its resources  link it to the international economyand improve the situation of its peoples.4In conclusion  I would like to point out that in orderto solve the problems the world is facing it is imperativefor us to work together for the benefit of mankind.Address by The Honourable Edison James  PrimeMinister and Minister for External Affairs  LegalAffairs  Labour and Immigration of the Commonwealthof Dominica"
"138",5915,"ROU",52,1997,"﻿At the outset  I would like to extend to Mr.Udovenko our most sincere congratulations on hiselection to the high office of President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session  as a representativeboth of a neighbourly and friendly country and of aregion that has significantly increased its presence in theUnited Nations family in recent years. At such a decisivemoment for the future of our Organization  he has amandate of high responsibility and I offer him our fullsupport.It is a great honour for me to address  for the firsttime  this prestigious forum  with its wide participationand global vocation  in my capacity as the representative17of a coalition Government that arose 10 months ago in ademocratic transition of power. From the outset  I wouldassure the Assembly that the new Romanian Government in its strategy of consolidating the rule of law and a free-market economy  means to cooperate with and rely on theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. We areinterested in making the Organization capable of reactingmore rapidly and efficiently to the current needs of MemberStates and to the new global challenges at this twilight ofthe millennium.A few weeks ago  the Romanian Government  withsupport from the United Nations Development Programme convened in Bucharest the third International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies. The Conference focused onthe link between democracy and human centreddevelopment  both as a subject and as the target of politicalaction  a theme of great interest that is currently enjoyingtop priority on the United Nations agenda.In my capacity as Acting President of the Conference I have the honour to submit to the Assembly’s attention thedocument containing its proceedings and results.Government representatives from 77 States and  for the firsttime  non-governmental actors of civil societies  along with14 international organizations  examined in a constructiveand positive manner the current status and future issues ofthe process of consolidating their democratic systems andadopted by consensus a review and a set ofrecommendations  distributed as an official document of theGeneral Assembly at this session.These recommendations spell out the need for goodgovernance and for broad participation by civil society inthe democratic exercise  as well as for strengtheningdemocratic institutions in order to face the challengesgenerated by globalization  corruption and organized crime.At the same time  Romania believes that it is of the utmostimportance to ensure the continuity of the BucharestConference’s efforts and its practical consequences. That iswhy  in keeping with the recommendations advanced inBucharest  we suggest that a follow-up mechanism beestablished for the consolidation process of new or restoreddemocracies.We plan to continue consultations with the Secretary-General and with interested States and internationalorganizations on these themes and on the proposal toconvene a summit of the new or restored democracies inthe year 2000.I am confident that the results of the BucharestConference will act as points of reference in the debatesof the current session. We shall work for the adoption bythe General Assembly of a resolution reaffirming thesupport of the United Nations system for the efforts ofGovernments to consolidate the new or restoreddemocracies.In line with the collective commitment we made atthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary ceremonies  we areamong those who believe that the strengthening of theOrganization’s capacity to respond adequately to the newneeds and challenges of the twenty-first century is ofhighest priority. It is in the interests of our Organizationto achieve  even at this session  realistic and balancedresults  of mutual interest and the widest possible benefit to enhance its credibility and viability. We welcome theSecretary-General’s report on a programme for reformand we assure him of our confidence and support inachieving its objectives.We associate ourselves with the European Union’sposition. Indeed  reform should be not a cost-cuttingexercise  but rather a matter of strengthening theOrganization’s role as an active and efficient worldforum. Our objective is to make the United Nations moreefficient  more transparent  more responsible and  last butnot least  more credible.We also believe that the dividends obtained throughbetter financial and personnel management — the so-called “dividends of reform” — should be reallocated todevelopment activities for the developing countries. It isin this spirit that the delegation of Romania will take partin the reform process and cooperate with all interesteddelegations in identifying solutions enabling the GeneralAssembly to reach a general agreement on a coherent andconstructive response to the Secretary-General’sproposals.We have the opportunity today to live in a worldawakened from the cold-war nightmare that divided usirreconcilably into friends and enemies  a world ofcommunications and interaction in which closed societiescannot survive. Increasing globalization should help us toknow each other better and bring us closer together tobuild common projects. We are even invited to rethinkour global society  the relations among us and thedirection of our political actions. A new politicalphilosophy  the philosophy of partnership  asserts itself inthe context of relations between States  whereby what a18country gains is added to and not deducted from itspartner’s benefit.This philosophy was promoted in the last half centuryin European and Euro-Atlantic structures  withacknowledged positive results in the field of stability andcooperation on the continent. This is also why Central andEastern European countries are naturally keen to integratethemselves into such structures.That is also the philosophy Romania uses as a basis indeveloping a solidarity and cooperation policy at thesubregional  regional and international levels aimed atconsolidating and activating stability in its geographicregion and throughout the world. We have tried fully tonormalize relations with our neighbours  and we haveproposed trilateral cooperation plans to our partners in theregion. At the same time  we launched the idea of revivingthe traditional commercial routes to Northern Europe andCentral Asia. The same concept of building a network ofcommunication and mutually beneficial cooperation is thebasis for the development of economic cooperation in theBlack Sea region and for our involvement in the CentralEuropean Initiative  the Central European Free TradeAgreement  the Southeast European Cooperative Initiativeand so forth.The participation of Romania in the United Nationspeacekeeping Mission in Angola  in the stabilization effortsof operation Alba in Albania and in Bosnia andHerzegovina  under the auspices of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO)  are testimony to our politicalwillingness to act as a stabilization factor. At the sametime  I would like to point out that Romania is ready toincrease its contribution to the Stabilization Force (SFOR)in Bosnia and to contribute to other similar actions  such asthe United Nations Preventive Deployment Force(UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia and other forces that remain necessary in thatarea.All these efforts to establish an environment ofconfidence and cooperation that generates peace andsecurity in Central and South-East Europe  as well as insome hot spots of the world  reveal not only a newapproach  but also a new stage that Romania is passingthrough on its way from totalitarianism to democracy. Inthe current “post-transition” phase  the results achieved inthe democratic processes and economic reform  which havebeen recognized by the international community andfinancial institutions  qualify Romania legitimately to playa clearer and more active role in defining and designingcommon projects of security and progress in the regionand in the world  including within the United Nations andits specialized agencies.I would like to make a few remarks on some otherimportant items on the agenda.From the experience we have gained in our regionand in neighbouring regions — Central and South-EastEurope  the Middle East and the Caucasus — it can beconcluded that poverty  the absence or weakness ofinstitutions that are characteristic of the moderndemocratic State and distrust are among the causes ofcrises and conflict situations. Specific steps by the UnitedNations system and the entire international community arerequired to eradicate poverty. They should be aimed atsupporting the countries of the region that are confrontedwith this phenomenon so that they can increase theirproduction through the adequate use of their own specificresources and economic capabilities. Hampering such aprocess can have only negative consequences in the fieldof security and stability.With regard to strengthening institutions that are partof a State based on the rule of law  it is necessary tocreate  alongside rapid-reaction forces for peacekeeping a so-called civilian rapid-reaction force to support theestablishment of institutions capable of maintaining Stateorder and coherence in an open and free society.Building up confidence involves dialogue andcommunication  as well as the elimination of any form ofisolation. The United Nations should be efficientlyinvolved in the dismantlement of terrorist infrastructuresall over the world. At the same time  it is necessary togive up rhetoric and spectacular gestures in favour ofdirect negotiations between the interested parties  in aquiet and discreet atmosphere.We would like to point out the importance Romaniaattaches to dialogue conducive to solutions negotiated bythe parties directly involved  be it in the Middle East Cyprus or the former Yugoslavia. It is our firm belief particularly since our latest political contacts in theMiddle East and in Bucharest  that the resumption ofnegotiations between the interested parties  based on theprinciples agreed in the Madrid and Oslo accords  is theonly way to achieve an equitable and lasting peace in theregion.We welcome and support the recent United Statesinitiative  as well as the efforts of other countries  to19unblock the peace process. We also welcome the directnegotiations  under the auspices of the United Nations between the two communities of Cyprus with a view to anequitable and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue  and weexpress our willingness to take part in the peacekeepingoperation in that country.As main guarantor of peace and international security the United Nations should play an active role in crisisprevention and management  using preventive diplomacyand  when necessary  peacekeeping operations. Romaniawill support such United Nations actions and intends todiversify its contribution by including civilian componentsin its contributions.In the field of arms control and disarmament  weconsider that the United Nations can and should set anexample of change in concept and approach that go beyondthe vestiges of the bloc mentality and lead to arms controland disarmament solutions capable of ensuring globalsecurity  with the existence of several centres of economicand cultural power. We attach special importance to nuclearnon-proliferation issues  including the negotiation of atreaty to ban the production of fissionable materials formilitary purposes  the implementation of the ChemicalWeapons Convention  the United Nations Register ofConventional arms and the processes aimed at banning anti-personnel landmines.The debates on economic and social issues shouldcreate the foundations for the necessary relaunching of theNorth-South dialogue on development  as such issues havebeen largely ignored in the context of the politicaldevelopments subsequent to the collapse of the Soviet blocand the end of the cold war or on matters linked to theexpansion of NATO and the European Union. Our debateswill have to take into account the recent trends in worldeconomy — such as high rates of growth  far exceedingthose of gross world product achieved by world trade;transportation; and the volume of direct investment andinternational financial transactions — and the necessity ofensuring a wider access of goods produced in developingcountries to the developed countries’ markets and enhancedcooperation on third markets. All these elements call for aconceptual reconsideration of the development process thatgives due attention to the social component and ensures theparticipation of the main actors: Governments  privatesectors  transnational corporations and civil society. In thisrespect  we suggest that thought be given to the idea ofsetting up a social solidarity fund to help disadvantagedpersons and support the integration of unemployed andmarginalized persons into productive activities.The Romanian economy has reached macroeconomicstability  by decreasing the inflation rate and thebudgetary deficit  and started structural reform  inparticular in the agricultural sector. Consistent efforts arebeing made to speed up privatization and attract foreigninvestors. With all this going on  we are interested inparticipating in a debate that can highlight measuresenvisaged by Governments for what the ManagingDirector of the International Monetary Fund recentlycalled “second generation reform”  which will focus onmicroeconomics and social protection policies.We believe that development assistance requires newand increased mobilization from the internationalcommunity  and we favour enhanced coherence in thecountry programmes undertaken by United Nations bodiesand funds  and more efficient use of resources allocatedfor development.In view of the new threats facing our societies andinstitutions  we support measures aimed at strengtheningthe capacity of the United Nations in international drugcontrol and the fight against corruption and organizedcrime. We welcome the establishment in Vienna of asingle Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention  aswell as the convening  in 1998  of a special session of theGeneral Assembly on drug control. Furthermore  wepropose consideration of the United Nations declaring aninternational year for the fight against corruption andorganized crime. This major issue could also be thesubject of a special high-level segment of the GeneralAssembly. Our objective is to elaborate and put intopractice international cooperation instruments that enableus to work together to protect ourselves and eradicatethese scourges.We shall soon begin preparations for celebrating  in1998  the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights. Let us take this opportunity to reaffirmour firm commitment to the universality of all humanrights  whose promotion and protection should alwaysremain a priority for the United Nations. We support themeasures envisaged by the Secretary-General tostrengthen the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and we welcome theappointment of the former Irish President  Mrs. MaryRobinson  as High Commissioner.With regard to administrative and budgetaryquestions  the Romanian delegation is in favour of theSecretary-General's proposals for the regular budget forthe 1998-1999 biennium  with the understanding that the20reductions will not affect the future capacity of theOrganization to fulfil its mandate. We support the efforts toimprove the Organization's financial situation and place iton a sound and predictable footing. It is particularlyimportant that  through open and constructive negotiations we achieve feasible solutions with regard to the futurepayments of arrears and a new scale of assessments for theregular and peacekeeping budgets  thus reflecting the newrealities and real capacity to pay of each State.Finally  I assure the Assembly  once again  of the fullcooperation of the Romanian delegation in our joint effortsto strengthen and enhance the efficiency of the UnitedNations."
"139",5961,"RUS",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  allow me sincerely tocongratulate you  a representative of friendly Ukraine  onyour election to this responsible and honoured post. Weare confident that under your Presidency  the GeneralAssembly will be able to achieve significant results.In just a little over 800 days  mankind will enterupon the twenty-first century. From a historical point ofview  this is indeed no more than a sprinter’s lap  andthus the need to look at what lies ahead  at what awaitsus  would appear quite natural.One year ago  in speaking from this rostrum  I spokeabout the emerging process of a transition to a multipolarworld order. The developments of the past year supportthat. There is a growing diversity in the political economic and cultural development of countries. Newcentres of economic and political influence in the worldare shaping up  coupled  at the same time  with increasedintermeshing of the interests of different States andpeoples.The horizons opening up to the internationalcommunity in the twenty-first century are making newdemands. These are the assertion of the ideals ofinterdependency and partnership in inter-State relations;the prevention of the emergence of new dividing lines orexclusive bloc structures; and strict adherence by all tothe principles and rules of international law. As a separateissue  I should like to cite not only the creation ofconditions for economic and social progress of allcountries  but also the maintenance of environmentalbalance.There is also a need to mention that the transitionfrom a confrontational bipolar world to a multipolarsystem per se would not provide a solution to these17problems. Furthermore  realistically minded people realizethat although we are moving farther away from thesimplistic stereotypes of the ideological confrontation era the number of existing risks and threats in the world is notdecreasing.Regional conflicts continue to be one of the majorsources of instability on the global level; they should not beallowed to continue into the twenty-first century. How canthis be achieved? A characteristic of our days is theincreasing number of intra-State problems — conflicts of anethnic rather than social nature. There are manymultinational States in the world today  and we support theinitiatives designed to prevent their forcible disintegration.The formula for settling such conflicts in today’sworld — and  of course  in the twenty-first century — canand must combine the need to preserve the territorialintegrity of those States with the provision of the maximumpossible number of rights to their national minorities. Toabandon any of the principles of this two-track formulawould result not only in the continuation but in thedangerous escalation of such conflict situations.Likewise  I wish to draw the Assembly’s particularattention to a dangerous aspect of regional conflicts: theirability to trigger terrorist waves and spread them far andwide beyond the borders of the actual conflict zone. Forexample  many of the militants who launched a bloodycampaign of terror in a number of countries emerged out ofthe ongoing armed conflict that still rages in Afghanistan.We strongly support the combat against terrorism whatever trappings it may don  be it in Ireland or in Israel.Today  we will not be able to prevail in this fight withoutall States pooling their efforts to combat this greatest ofevils. While we oppose the backing of terrorism in anyform by any Government  we believe that we cannotstigmatize individual Member States forever as internationalrogues  irrespective of changes in their policies  simplybecause of their suspected links to terrorists.In the present-day world  no country can hold amonopoly on any kind of conflict-resolution effort. Thisfully applies as well to the long-standing conflict in theMiddle East  where the settlement process has beenstalemated. As the saying goes  “it takes two hands toapplaud”. Broad-based international efforts are required toundo the taut Middle East knot. Russia  as one of the co-sponsors of the peace process launched in 1991 in Madrid is prepared actively to cooperate actively with all to attainthis goal.For many years  so too has the Cyprus issue beenawaiting the effective international cooperation needed forits resolution.A synergy of efforts would provide the shortest cutto the resolution of both long-standing and of relativelynew conflicts. But our stance by no means implies — andI wish to emphasize this — that any individual countrythat has influence in a zone of conflict or that can exertit over conflicting parties should not make active use ofits own potential. It must do so  however  without puttingup a high fence around itself to ward off others.I should like in this connection to draw theAssembly’s attention to Russia’s peacekeeping efforts inthe Commonwealth of Independent States region. First ofall  as concerns Tajikistan  Russia is doing a great dealsince we are equipped with the particular tools needed todo the job  in part for historical reasons. Our efforts haveproved rather effective. Recently in Moscow anagreement was signed that put an end to the armed strifebetween the Government and the opposition in thatcountry. The return to Dushanbe of Mr. Nuri  theopposition leader  shows that the agreement is alreadyworking.Nevertheless  we want only our fair share of thedeal. We note with satisfaction that the attitudes of Russiaand the United Nations towards the parameters of theoperation in Tajikistan are in concurrence  based on theclose cooperation between the United Nations ObserverMission  the collective Commonwealth of IndependentStates peacekeeping force  and the contingent of Russianborder troops. We welcome the intention of the UnitedNations to expand the mandate of its observers and toincrease their number.Nagorny Karabakh provides yet another example.Acting on its own  Russia has done a great deal tostabilize the situation in the region. But I believe that wehave quite productively cooperated with the United Statesand France  which  jointly with Russia  are acting as co-chairmen of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe’s Minsk process to settle theNagorny Karabakh conflict. The Georgian-Abkhazconflict offers a similar example.I should now like to say a few words aboutpeacekeeping as a whole. Over the last few years  a trendhas been observed towards its decentralization. Naturally there are objective reasons for this: the financialconstraints placed on the United Nations  and the increase18in the number of regional organizations working  inter alia in peacekeeping. We see nothing wrong with suchdecentralization.However  it is extremely important that peacekeepingactivities  whatever their sponsorship  should rely first andforemost on the underlying principles developed within theUnited Nations framework. We need here to be extremelycautious in dealing with peacekeeping activities. We believethat actions involving force should be carried out solelywhen authorized by the Security Council and under itsdirect supervision  as provided for in the Charter of theUnited Nations.As we move towards a multipolar world in the twenty-first century  it is essential to create conditions that willbring stability to a new world order. To that end  workmust be completed to demolish the hurdles of the past and above all  the legacy of the massive  decades-long armsrace.We are moving together along this path  and we aredetermined to proceed further. Together with the UnitedStates  we have been steadily reducing our national strategicarsenals. President Yeltsin of Russia and President Clintonof the United States have reached an understanding on thebasic parameters for agreement in this area.On the agenda now are systematic measures for areduction in the nuclear arsenals of all the nuclear Powers.But let us be perfectly clear here: the stability of amultipolar world cannot be ensured simply by ending thenuclear-arms race of the past. It is also essential to haveguarantees against the re-emergence of that arms race on anew basis  and here I have in mind the desire of individualcountries to acquire nuclear weapons. This once againproves the need for urgent measures to relieve tensions inthe relations between India and Pakistan.Hence the essential need for the entire internationalcommunity to give a universal dimension to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Those fewcountries that have so far remained outside the Treaty must in our view  come to grips with their responsibility. Theymust realize that their own security is an integral part ofglobal security  and they must assume those obligations towhich over 180 States have already committed themselvesas parties to the Treaty.The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) on a global scale  as well as theforthcoming talks to ban the production of weapon-gradefissile materials  figures likewise among those badlyneeded steps intended to impart stability to global securityin the twenty-first century.The implementation of the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destructionis getting under way. We consider this document as oneof the major instruments designed to eliminate one of theweapons of mass destruction subject to the greatestproliferation. We have been working together with thedeputies of the State Duma to ratify the Convention  andwe look forward to the early  successful completion ofthose efforts.But even now it is conventional weaponry that iskilling people in local conflicts  often in situations wherehostilities have already stopped. In this connection  we arefully aware of the humanitarian dimension of the problemof landmines. We think that the elimination of the threatof landmines to people  especially to civilian populations is long overdue. We advocate active  phased efforts andnegotiations to resolve it.Stability on a global or regional level is impossiblewithout the establishment of security systems. We havemade headway in this direction on the Europeancontinent. We feel confident that only a universalorganization which brings together all the members of theEuropean family of nations can serve as a foundation fora genuinely durable security system in Europe in thetwenty-first century. I am talking here about theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE). It is first and foremost in the frame of thatforum that it is possible to seek agreement with a view tomeeting the new and diverse challenges  which are notnecessarily of a military and political nature.A beneficial effect on the improvement of theEuropean climate has already been exerted by theFounding Act on Mutual Relations  Cooperation andSecurity between the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Russian Federation  which was born out of theagonizing quest for compromise. This document will havebroad international resonance and will doubtless play anessential role in European politics. Of course  the signingof that document has not changed our negative view ofNATO’s enlargement  which  on the one hand  totallyignores current realities and  on the other  is fraught withthe risk of creating new dividing lines.19I must mention yet another contribution to thestrengthening of good-neighbourly relations in Europe. I amreferring to the agreements signed recently by Russia Ukraine and Belarus that have allowed our three countriesto take major steps forward in developing mutuallybeneficial  equitable relations which have strengthenedstability in the region.Russia has an interest in the security and stability ofits Baltic neighbours and is ready to guarantee theirsecurity. Such guarantees could be provided in the form ofour commitment backed by an agreement on good-neighbourly relations between Russia and the Baltic States.Such an agreement could become a kind of pact on regionalsecurity and stability.The Asia-Pacific dimension is also of greatsignificance to us. We are convinced that the Russian-Chinese agreements on borders and military détente in thefrontier zone  which were also signed by Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan  will become a long-term factorfor stability in that vast region. Russia also holds a numberof other Asian countries — including India  Japan and theStates of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) — among its priority partners.At the same time  our future in the twenty-first centuryat both the global and the regional levels depends directlyon whether the international community will be able to stopand reverse the economic impoverishment of a greatnumber of the Member States of the United Nations.A central role in resolving the most important tasksfacing all the countries of the world today belongs to theUnited Nations.Established over half a century ago  the Organizationin general has succeeded in passing the durability test traversed the thorny road of the bloc-confrontation era survived both the ice-age period and the thaw ininternational relations. But today this could be viewed asaxiomatic — the United Nations needs a rationalrenovation  referred to by virtually all the speakers in thisdebate. The substantive report of Secretary-General KofiAnnan gives clear proof of this need. Today  figurativelyspeaking  the image of this Organization in the twenty-firstcentury is being shaped.It is our strong conviction that the priority objectiveof the Organization’s reform is to enhance the usefulnessof the United Nations. Naturally  it is impossible toreform the United Nations in order to increase itseffectiveness without overcoming the financial problems.We must note that the financial problems of the UnitedNations have unfortunately become chronic. It musttherefore be emphasized that the responsibility for thefinancial health of the United Nations is borne by allMember States and that they must all pay their duesproperly.We are also in favour of expanding the membershipof the Security Council. A decision to that effect is longoverdue. But this expansion should not render ourOrganization less efficient.The reform of the United Nations will take placeagainst the background of the ever increasing role ofregional organizations. This is a fully logical process. Atthe same time  we are convinced that the special leadingrole of the United Nations among all other universallyrecognized international organizations must be preserved.We see the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury as a highly efficient Organization  free frombureaucratic constraints  and as a proactive Organizationcapable of swiftly responding to the challenges of thecontemporary world.I began my remarks by encouraging concerted actionby the international community to concentrate on currentproblems and on the prospects for the coming century.And I shall conclude by citing a well-known saying:“Pessimists are no more than casual observers  it is theoptimists who can change the world”. We are optimists and we believe that the United Nations will be able toplay a positive role in the ongoing evolution of theinternational community."
"140",6008,"RWA",52,1997,"﻿Before delivering the message of the Government ofRwanda to the General Assembly  allow me to follow theHeads of State and fellow Ministers who have spoken fromthis rostrum and express to the President our very sincerecongratulations on his outstanding election. We also pay awell-deserved tribute to his eminent predecessor  whodisplayed devotion  skill and readiness to serve during thelast session.Our warmest and fraternal congratulations also go tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for whom thissession of the General Assembly is his first in that office.At the fiftieth anniversary session of the UnitedNations we took the opportunity to express loudly andclearly our views with regard to the essential reforms to becarried out within the United Nations. We welcome theproposals made by the Secretary-General  and we assurehim of our support and cooperation. We also madeproposals on Security Council reform. We will continue tomake our contribution and lend our support to the collectiveefforts aimed at ensuring greater democracy in the Council.The Government of Rwanda also wishes to take thisopportunity to express its great satisfaction at theappointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson as United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. We assure both herand the Secretary-General of our assistance andcooperation.At this session the Government of Rwanda wishes tomake its modest contribution to our consideration of somematters of concern both to Africa and to the entireinternational community. These primarily relate to thedifficulties encountered in the process of bringing to life anew Africa and problems related to the prevention management and resolution of conflicts in Africa. We shallalso offer some thoughts on how our peoples may enjoy arelatively smooth passage into the next millennium. We willconclude with an appeal for international solidarity forRwanda and the Rwandan people.The hope of the peoples of Africa and the thirdworld is first of all for an understanding of their realproblems  and today that understanding must be a priority.Much of the international community supports the newpolitical order in Africa and the new African leadershipand leaders who wish to create new realities for a newAfrica. We had the opportunity and pleasure  at thespecial meeting of the Security Council on Africa held on25 September under the presidency of the Secretary ofState of the United States  of hearing comments insupport of the new African leadership. We stand firmlytogether. The others  those who do not trust in Africa andthe Africans  who attempt to hinder our continent’s effortsto free itself from neocolonialism and dictatorships  whoare today trying to discredit and undermine our leaders atany cost  they are the ones we will obviously be forced todeal with when we come to them.I should like now to speak of the problems ofconflict prevention and conflict resolution in Africa andother third world countries. Again  we extend ourwarmest thanks to the Security Council for having takenthe positive initiative of convening a ministerial-levelmeeting on Africa on 25 September.Our contribution  beyond general considerations andsome specific cases  will focus primarily on identifyingthe underlying causes of conflicts in Africa  conflictswhich in turn create the economic and political recessionsof which we in our continent — and elsewhere in certainthird world countries as well — are aware on almost adaily basis.Africa and the third world in general are sufferingfrom various ills  principal among which are ignorance poverty  bad political leadership  coups d’état and foreignintervention. Those are the ills that have eaten away atAfrica  continue to eat away at it and are the sources ofevery conflict on our continent.Ignorance  it is said  is the root of all evils. Povertyis the cause of all misfortune. What United Nationsprogramme will combat ignorance and poverty in Africaand the countries of the third world  and when will thesetwo terrible ills that ravage our continent be cured?Bad political leadership in Africa has led manycountries to ruin and even led to the first genocide on theAfrican continent  which occurred in Rwanda from Aprilto July 1994. The United Nations was present with amilitary force of 2 500 men  who packed up and left abandoning the Rwandan people to the mercy of the26Interahamwe militiamen of the erstwhile single party andarmed forces of the day. The planning and carrying out ofthe genocide was the ignoble act of a bad politicalleadership that viewed the ignorance and poverty of thepeoples of Rwanda — and  consequently  of the peoples ofAfrica and the third world — as a political asset toconsolidate and perpetuate its dictatorship in power or tousurp power.We hope that the United Nations will support the newpolitical order in Africa and its new leadership  and that itwill oppose any manoeuvre aimed at using United Nationsstructures to nip in the bud the new political order that isemerging on our continent.The conflicts of which we are all aware in Africatoday are the bitter fruit of the famous so-called Africa ofthe Generals that emerged in the mid-1960s. Those coupsd’état sapped Africa with all their attendant tragedies  ofwhich all here are only too keenly aware. What are ourstrategies for fighting coups d’état in Africa today? Whatare the strategies of the United Nations for eradicating thisscourge  whose effects are realized by its creators onlywhen they themselves fall victim to it?All of the coups d’état in Africa since 1965  whoserotten fruits we are harvesting today  were fomented bycertain Western capitals in their own interests and to thedetriment of the African people. Today  unfortunately foreign manipulation is continuing in Africa  creating a newcycle of coups d’état in Africa.We urge the United Nations resolutely to attack thefive scourges I have just named  which still infect Africaand are the source of all the conflicts on our continent.These problems exist and we are familiar with them. Let usnot make them taboo — let us talk about them within thisprestigious building; let us talk about them in the SecurityCouncil. That  perhaps  would mark the beginning ofimproved conflict prevention and resolution in Africa.We cannot close this chapter on African conflictswithout referring specifically to some that worry us morethan others. I am referring in particular to the CentralAfrican Republic  where we feel the United Nations shouldbe on its toes and assist a country in which the keepers ofthe old order and their opportunistic acolytes are usingviolence against an elected Government. I am also referringto Congo (Brazzaville)  where precisely the same scenarioas in the Central African Republic is being played out ona scale far larger than in the latter country.In our humble opinion  the United Nations shouldalso send a clear and unambiguous message to theComorians of the island of Anjouan that the Comoros isa State Member of the United Nations and that its unityand integrity are not negotiable. We ask the partiesconcerned to work with the Organization of African Unity(OAU) to find an appropriate solution to their problem.Western Sahara strikes a strong note of hope in thearea of decolonization. We welcome and encourage thedue implementation of the agreements that have just beensigned between the Saharan Arab Democratic Republicand the Kingdom of Morocco to promote the process ofself-determination and independence for the Saharanpeople.In Somalia  the Government of the RwandeseRepublic urges all the parties to the conflict to promotedialogue under the aegis of the OAU and theIntergovernmental Authority on Development.Two years from the advent of the new millennium we all have the ultimate duty of leading our peoples tothe year 2000 without setback or fear of the unknown unlike the people of the year 997 as they approached theeve of the second millennium.The twentieth century  leading into the awaited thirdmillennium  has deeded to us the two most horrendousgenocides in the history of humanity: the genocide of theJews during the Second World War and the genocide ofthe Rwandans in 1994. Will we cross the threshold of thethird millennium with the same racist graffiti covering thewalls of our cities and airport corridors? Will those withuneasy consciences continue forever to play dumb withregard to the Rwandan genocide  the very first in thehistory of our continent? Will religious fundamentalismthrive at the cost of human lives?Extreme selfishness  despair  suicide  racism  crime terrorism  drugs  paedophilia  battered women  rape: Arewe going to bring all this luggage with us into the thirdmillennium? What are we doing now? What are ourstrategies to eradicate all these evils? Resignation?Fatalism? Will the third millennium hold anything toshock us?We all claim to govern on behalf of our respectivepeoples. What actions are we undertaking today to ensurethat they advance calmly  smoothly  without panic oranxiety into the year 2000? If we do nothing  how willwe explain it to them on the eve of 1 January 2000 or on27the first day of the year 2000? Will we use the language ofcynicism  pain  realism  politics  diplomacy or ritual — injust enough to get them off our backs and hustle themalong into the year 2000 as into a lifeboat?What strategies do the United Nations and itsagencies  present throughout Africa and other countries ofthe third world  have to help the Governments and peoplesthat must confront the anxieties of passing from onecentury to another  one millennium to another? In mycountry  Rwanda  I see no sign of any such strategy  whilethe country is gripped by the many traumas born from thetearing  or rather the shredding  of the social fabric by thegenocide of 1994. When the traumas of genocide arecomplemented by millennial anxieties  what is to becomeof such a people if it is not helped by increasedinternational solidarity?I have seen no or almost no sign of such solidarity inall my travels  no hint of such a project. Apparently  no oneis concerned. And yet  we are only 26 months from 1January 2000. Why such indifference from countries andfrom the United Nations? Should not our concerns be thoseof the peoples on whose behalf we govern? We should beone step ahead and thereby allay them.Before closing  I wish to appeal to the GeneralAssembly that the United Nations adopt a mini-MarshallPlan for the moral and physical rehabilitation andreconstruction of the first African country to have fallenvictim to the catastrophe of genocide: Rwanda. This mini-Marshall Plan for the rehabilitation and reconstruction ofpost-genocide Rwanda was drafted by AmbassadorSahnoun  Special Representative for the Great Lakes regionof the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and theOAU  at the request of the Rwandan Government ofNational Unity.We also make a ringing appeal to the United Nationsand the entire international community to provide Rwandawith substantial assistance  as it has received sinceNovember 1996 more than 1.4 million repatriatedpersons — one fifth of its population — who had fled tothe former Zaire  now the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Tanzania and Burundi. Following this mass returnof refugees  famine has today struck heavily in over four ofour provinces. For the victims of this famine  we requestemergency food relief and development assistance for everysector of national life — agriculture  health  education  thesocial and socio-economic reintegration of the repatriated the survivors of genocide  justice and the rehabilitation andreconstruction of basic infrastructures  including those forwater  electricity and roads.As for the social and socio-economic reintegration ofthe repatriated  since November 1996 the RwandanGovernment has been sending into the field teams led bytwo Ministers for each province and composed of otherministers  members of Parliament and high-leveladministrators. These field missions aim at supporting thelocal administrative authorities in their tasks of receivingand reintegrating the repatriates. The exercise has gonewell and is still being successfully pursued.At the communal and municipal level  we have alsocreated reception committees composed of localauthorities and members of the United NationsCommission on Human Rights.Unfortunately  some troublemakers have filtered inwith the 1.4 million refugees who have recently returnedto Rwanda. Since February 1997  these fugitives havebeen committing murders among the civilian population.They have primarily targeted the survivors of genocide in order to do away with anyone who might be a witnessin a court of law  and local authorities who are devotedto the cause of national unity and reconciliation.The Rwandan Government has taken the necessarymeasures to ensure the safety of the people in the northof the country  which has been the site of these murders.Again  results in this area have also been quitesatisfactory.In fact  a month ago I organized a meeting of theentire diplomatic and consular community at Ruhengeri one of the provinces in the north of the country. Afterthat meeting the diplomats had the opportunity to visitany areas of Ruhengeri they chose.Likewise  before I came to New York for theGeneral Assembly  Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu  President ofthe Republic of Rwanda  headed a meeting of ministersat Gisenyi  one of the country’s three northern provinces.After the meeting the President of the Republic and themembers of the Government went into the field for threedays. They visited and spoke with people from all sectorsof the population  including peasants on communes andin municipalities and students and State officials who hadbeen repatriated and who were participating in orientationseminars on the positive aspects of national unity tolerance  reconciliation  respect for human life and28solidarity. They also spoke with local authorities who areworking to train our people.The Government of Rwanda needs support for thisexercise. It needs the assistance of the internationalcommunity.Before concluding  we would like to say from thislofty rostrum that we welcome the progress made towardsresolving the misunderstanding on the question of theInternational Commission of Inquiry sent to theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  as the Minister forForeign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congoannounced at his press conference yesterday afternoon.The Rwandan Government therefore encouragesthose specifically involved in this matter — namely  theSecretary-General of the United Nations  the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and theGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo —to work together to put an end to this problem. They haveour confidence and support.In order to support the efforts of the Secretary-General  the High Commissioner for Refugees and theGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to enlighten better the international community aboutthe refugee problem in eastern Zaire  the RwandanGovernment calls on the United Nations to publish andcirculate as a document of the Security Council the reportof the International Commission of Inquiry on thetrafficking in and distribution of weapons in refugeecamps in eastern Zaire.The United Nations International Commission ofInquiry was established under Security Council resolution1013 (1995) of 7 September 1995. The Commissionsubmitted its report  duly signed by its members  one yearlater  on 28 October 1996. The embargo on this report which has hindered its publication  should be liftedimmediately in order to facilitate everyone’s efforts."
"141",6090,"SDN",52,1997,"﻿Atthe outset I would like to express my congratulations tothe President on the confidence the General Assemblyshowed in him by electing him to preside over fifty-second session. We have no doubt that his experience andcapability in multilateral diplomacy will assist him inconducting the deliberations of this session towardssuccess. We assure him of the cooperation and support ofthe delegation of the Sudan.I would also like to express my gratitude andappreciation to the President's predecessor  His ExcellencyAmbassador Razali Ismail  for his distinguished effortsand bold initiatives within the context of strengthening therole of the United Nations and the improvement of itsmethods of work.Likewise  we would like to extend ourcongratulations to the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a very short time since the assumption ofhis post  he has demonstrated enthusiasm  ability andpatience in leading this Organization. This has beenembodied in his initiative to reform it  improve itsmethods of work and enhance its stature.We commend the genuine endeavours of theSecretary-General to reform the United Nations system.In this connection  the Sudan will stand by his side until21the United Nations realizes the purposes for which it wasestablished  chief among which is the strengthening ofpeace and international cooperation for the achievement ofdevelopment and the eradication of poverty  particularly inAfrica and in developing countries.We would also like to affirm the keenness of theSudan that the programme of reform should result instrengthening the ability of the United Nations to respondto humanitarian  social and developmental issues undertakenby the Organization. Furthermore  the reform should leadto the consolidation of the participation of developingcountries in the Organization and their equitablerepresentation in the Secretariat.The Sudan calls for giving the reform endeavoursenough time. The results and recommendations of theOpen-ended High Level Working Group on theStrengthening of the United Nations System  adopted by theGeneral Assembly  should be given special attention. Mycountry reaffirms its intention to participate effectively inthe meetings to be agreed upon within the properframework  with the aim of reaching a consensus on allaspects of the reform.The Sudan attaches special attention and interest to theissue of reform of the Security Council through theenlargement of its permanent and non-permanentmembership  and the improvement of its methods of work.Our interest derives from our deep-rooted conviction aboutthe importance of enhancing transparency and democracyin the work of the Council  so as to respond to thechanging realities and the current challenges facinginternational peace and security  in accordance with theprinciples and provisions of the Charter which define theduties of the Council in the peaceful resolution ofconflict — far from using it as an instrument of peoples'punishment.The Sudan  while welcoming the efforts made for thereform of the Security Council  reaffirms the necessity ofobserving equitable geographical representation andpreserving the principle of state sovereignty. In thisconnection  we would like to reiterate our commitment tothe New Delhi Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement as well as our commitment to the African position taken atthe Harare summit.We wish to stress the importance of linking the rightof veto to the aspects relating to enlargement of the Counciland improvement of its methods of work  in a way thatwould secure a comprehensive consideration throughdeliberate negotiations relative to all aspects  within ademocratic and open-ended membership.It is important to deal with the points that theForeign Minister of Singapore made in his statement thismorning. At this time last year I informed the Assemblyof our efforts to establish peace in the Sudan  whichresulted at that time in the signing of the “Peace Charter”.Today  it is with honour and pride that I convey to thisdistinguished gathering that we have succeeded inevolving that “Peace Charter” into a comprehensive“Peace Agreement” signed in April this year by theGovernment and the fighting factions and political entitiesin southern Sudan. The Agreement has been endorsed bythe Sudanese Parliament  and thus it has  par excellence become one of the most important political events in thehistory of the Sudan.The Khartoum Peace Agreement provides for alasting settlement to the Sudanese problem. Thenegotiating parties have reached a formula whichidentifies a framework for peaceful coexistence in thecountry. In the Agreement  the principle of citizenshipconstitutes the basis for rights  duties and equality ofparticipation of all Sudanese in the responsibilities ofpublic life  without discrimination as to race or religion.It further consolidates the principle of democraticevolution in the Sudan. It clearly defines the question ofpower sharing between the state governments and thefederal authority within the federal system in the country.In addition  it provides for the bases and criteria forwealth-sharing in the country.With regard to public liberties and human rights  theagreement guarantees the same liberties and rightsembodied in divine revelation and in the texts of relevantinternational instruments and agreements. In that way itwill have a considerable influence in consolidating andguaranteeing human rights. Furthermore  the agreementallows for the people of southern Sudan to exercise theirright to self-determination through a free referendum tobe held at the end of a four-year transitional period.An additional  complementary arrangement wasagreed upon to prevent hostilities and ensure a ceasefirebetween the signatory parties with the aim of enhancingthe requisites for peace and stability. Furthermore  inaccordance with the collective will of the people of theSudan  a presidential decree granted an unconditionalgeneral amnesty in respect of all crimes committed andall civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 yearspreceding the signing of the agreement.22In our quest to enhance the scope of a comprehensiveand lasting peace  an agreement was reached last week withthe only remaining faction that was still carrying arms thereby allowing for the resumption of peace talks on 28October 1997 in the Kenyan capital under the auspices ofthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).I am honoured to be able to renew the determination and toexpress the eagerness of the Government of the Sudan formaking the forthcoming talks a success.The courageous steps taken by the Government of theSudan towards achieving a just and lasting peace have beenwidely commended and appreciated by many States in theworld. One of its early positive results was the beginningof the voluntary repatriation of displaced persons andrefugees from neighbouring countries.We call upon the United Nations  the internationalfinancial institutions and our development partners tocontribute to the resettlement of the returnees by shiftingfrom humanitarian assistance to programmes ofrehabilitation and the provision of developmental assistanceneeded to consolidate the foundations of peace  which hasbeen sought for many decades. This call derives itslegitimacy from the spirit and content of the SecurityCouncil ministerial-level meeting held on 25 September todiscuss the current situation in Africa. The meetingconsolidated the link between peace and development  thelatter being one of the basic human rights.In the same context  in striving to develop a system ofgood and responsible governance  the Sudan has witnessedimportant constitutional developments  which have beenmanifested in the establishment of a national committee forpreparing the draft of a permanent constitution to besubmitted to the legislative body and then presented to thepeople in a referendum.In the economic field  in support of a market economyand policies of liberalization  we have taken serious stepstowards the rationalization of public expenditure  theprivatization of the public sector  the abolition ofrestrictions on internal and external trade and the promotionof investment. These policies have led to the reactivation ofthe economy and reduced the inflation rate from 114 percent at the beginning of this year to 28.5 per cent in Augustof this year. Furthermore  we have achieved a positivegrowth rate of 5.5 per cent and stability in the rate ofexchange of the national currency. This progress wascommended by the International Monetary Fund mission inits report to the Executive Council of the Fund last August.However  the major obstacle to the accomplishment of theeconomic reform programme continues to be aninsufficiency of external resources needed to boostproduction. We therefore appeal to the donor countriesand the international financial institutions to provide thenecessary resources for the completion of the process ofeconomic reform. We also reaffirm that the Sudanwelcomes and encourages private and joint investments inall fields.As for the problem of debt  it is imperative toaddress it within a comprehensive international frameworkand not on a bilateral basis  so as to make possible thebuilding of a world economic system based on justice andequality among all States without distinction.In recognition of the importance of regionaleconomic cooperation  African States have taken stepstowards the revitalization of the African EconomicCommunity  in addition to the subregional economicorganizations  all of which need the support andassistance of the international community.We should not fail to stress the aspirations of Africawith regard to the implementation of the United NationsConvention to Combat Desertification and the importanceof following up on the outcome of the World FoodSummit in the context of achieving food security for thenations of the continent and of the necessity to providethe required resources to the countries concerned. In thiscontext  the Sudan reaffirms its readiness to effectivelycontribute to the programmes and action plans for theprovision of food  with the serious participation of theinternational community.Economic development on the one hand and securityand stability on the other are two sides of the same coin.In speaking about poverty eradication in the Africancontinent  we must stress the need for the realization ofpeace as a means to guarantee the security of the Africanpeoples on the one hand and to accelerate the continent'sdevelopment on the other hand. In this respect wecommend the positive developments in Liberia and wehope that this model will encourage our brothers inSomalia and Congo (Brazzaville) to stop the bloodshed.We also hope that in Sierra Leone the endeavours beingled by the countries of West Africa will succeed insolving the problems facing that country. Africa's need forsecurity  stability and development requires it to becomea zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of massdestruction. Africa needs assistance in clearing anti-personnel landmines  left behind by civil wars in anumber of its countries  including my own.23The Sudan supports the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and of its Secretary-General  Mr.Salim Ahmed Salim  to restore peace and stability in manyAfrican States. With regard to the formation of Africanpeacekeeping forces  we stress the need to harmonize anymeasures taken in this matter with the resolutions andpositions of the OAU. Africa should have the right  throughits regional organizations  to take the initiative and to leadin this matter.While addressing the subject of economic hardship inAfrica  it is incumbent upon us to mention the exasperatingeffects of the imposition of sanctions  in particular thoseimposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We call for thesettlement of this issue on the basis of the proposalpresented by the OAU and the League of Arab States supported by the Non-Aligned Movement.We support the proposal of the Non-AlignedMovement to lay down specific measures and rules forsanctions and to strictly observe the provisions of theCharter. We share the concerns expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization forthis year about the negative effects of sanctions on peoples.We look forward to the proposals he has promised topresent in this regard.In Asia  we welcome the return of Hong Kong to theparent country  the People's Republic of China. We arefollowing with interest the efforts of the Secretary-General'sSpecial Envoy to Afghanistan. We hope that the parties inconflict will cooperate with the United Nations so as toreach a formula for understanding and agreement. We alsocall upon the international community to support thecontinuous efforts to establish peace in the Koreanpeninsula.With regard to developments in the Middle East  theSudan believes that a comprehensive  just and lasting peacecannot be achieved without a total commitment to theprinciples of justice and the complete preservation of therights of the Palestinian people and the Arab States in theregion  or without a commitment to the agreements andaccords reached by the parties concerned. Israel shouldabandon its settlement policies and withdraw from the allthe occupied Arab territories on the basis of the relevantSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions  whichcontinue to be the point of reference for a peacefulsettlement and for the achievement of a comprehensivepeace in the Middle East.We agree with what the Secretary-General stated inhis report to the tenth emergency special session of theGeneral Assembly about the seriousness of the situationin the region. The Secretary-General warned of theconsequences of the settlement policies in the occupiedArab territories and the attempts to effect demographicand legal changes in Al-Quds aimed at its Judaization andthe alteration of its legal  geographical  historical religious and civilizational status. The Sudan calls uponthe international community to shoulder its responsibilitiesin the face of the deterioration of the situation and theescalation of confrontation to save the region from thespectre of war that appears over the horizon as a result ofthe unacceptable Israeli practices. Furthermore  the Sudanis strongly opposed to Israeli attempts to imposecollective sanctions on the Palestinian people whateverthe justification or the pretext.In the domain of international relations  the Sudanfollows policies and holds firm positions based on itscommitment to international and regional charters  therespect of good- neighbourliness and regional cooperationand the suppression of terrorism and threats to regionaland international security.The Sudan continues to call for the abandonment ofconflict and for regarding the interest of peoples as apriority that supersedes transient disagreements.The application of the slogans of pluralism anddemocracy that characterize the present epoch in theprogress of humanity essentially requires respect for thediverse cultural contexts of the peoples of the world.Those cultures should be allowed the opportunity of freeand equitable self-expression in order to enrich humanexperience and elevate the values of tolerance andacceptance of the other. That would lead to the restrictionof recourse to violent and extreme expressions of injusticeresulting from isolation and cultural arrogance.All religions uphold the principles of tolerance  theacceptance of pluralism and coexistence with others. TheHoly Koran says:“Say Ye: We believe in Allah and the revelationGiven to us  and to Abraham  Ismail  Isaac  Jacob and the Tribes  and that given to Moses and Jesus and that given to all Prophets from their Lord: Wemake no difference Between one and another ofthem: And we submit to Allah.'” (The Holy Koran II:136).24In this context  we support the statement of theGerman Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the need toencourage dialogue between civilizations to replaceconflicts and rivalry  in order to build a world of toleranceand cooperation and so that slogans of pluralism anddemocracy may not themselves become a pretext forcultural hegemony.The adoption by the United Nations of the idea ofsetting up a body to promote dialogue between religionsand civilizations would pave the way for the realization ofthat noble objective and would reinstate respect for loftymoral values. It would act as a strong deterrent to suchsocial ills as drug abuse  the escalation of violence andterrorism and family disintegration  thus clearing the wayfor a better future for humanity as it enters a newmillennium."
"142",6135,"SEN",52,1997,"﻿The General Assembly has unanimously chosen you Mr. President  to guide the work of the fifty-second session.This decision is a tribute to your outstanding personalqualities as a diplomat and a statesman  and at the sametime a tribute to your vast experience in internationalrelations. It also shows how much the internationalcommunity appreciates the role played by your country Ukraine  in the management of the major issues thatcharacterize the evolution of world affairs. My country ispleased to express to you its warmest congratulations andbest wishes for success in the execution of this noblemission.I would like to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for the competenceand open-mindedness with which he guided the work of thefifty-first session of our General Assembly. We extend tohim our deep gratitude.I would like to extend to the new Secretary-Generalof our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan  my warmestcongratulations. The election of Mr. Kofi Annan last 17December was a tribute to the exceptional qualities of aman who has devoted his entire life to United Nationscauses. I wish him every success in the important missionentrusted to him. I am convinced that he will do honourto our continent  Africa  and successfully lead ourOrganization into the next millennium.The world’s family of nations is once again meeting as it does every year  to examine the current situationand  at the same time  to chart the course of progress forthe 12 months to come.While making its contribution to this exercise incollective reflection  my country  Senegal  would like toassociate itself with all of those who find hope for abetter future for humankind in our Organization  becauseit is based on peace and solidarity.In fact  the United Nations remains an irreplaceableinstrument for the promotion of peace  security andprogress in the world  thanks to its universal character  tothe international culture and ethics that it expresses andinspires and to its positive accomplishments.Two years ago  on the occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  the internationalcommunity stressed here  unanimously  the irreplaceablenature of the framework for reflection  discussion synthesis and coordination of international life that theUnited Nations provides. In fact  the United Nations hasbeen and remains a multidimensional symbol. The UnitedNations is  first  an indispensable tool for safeguardingglobal peace and security. Further  the United Nations isabove all a source of new hope for many men and womenwho suffer from exile  hunger  poverty or illness. Andlastly  the United Nations is a tool for the promotion ofdemocracy  human rights and development — in otherwords  of justice among individuals  peoples  cultures andcivilizations.In this light  we have made it one of our highestpriorities to improve the capacities and the ability of theOrganization to better tackle the challenges of today’sworld. We have done so while affirming that“In order to be able to respond effectively to thechallenges of the future and the expectations of theUnited Nations held by peoples around the world  it isessential that the United Nations itself be reformedand modernized.” (Declaration on the Occasion of theFiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations  resolution50/6  para. 14)We are pleased to note today that this conviction hasbegun to be reflected in deeds. In fact  led by thedynamism of our Secretary-General  the United Nations hasnow embarked on a vast reform effort  unprecedented in thehistory of this institution.More specifically  on 16 July last Mr. Kofi Annansubmitted to the General Assembly proposals for reformsthat will make the United Nations the cornerstone of aninternational system better adapted to the realities of thetwenty-first century.I would like to express all my gratitude to theSecretary-General and his collaborators for thecommendable efforts and energy that they have applied tothe development of proposals as bold as they are relevant.Senegal is now examining all these proposals in closecoordination with its fellow members of the United Nations the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Senegal will do this while bearing inmind the political will expressed by all to undertake  withinan appropriate time period  the necessary reforms especially in the fields of development  maintenance ofinternational peace and security  disarmament andpromotion of human rights  so that the Organization canbetter respond to the demands of our day and to theaspirations of the peoples for which it was created.The Head of State of Senegal  His ExcellencyMr. Abdou Diouf  has already provided the necessaryguidelines and resources for this examination.In this framework  the reform of the SecurityCouncil requires the special attention of all MemberStates and  at the same time  a common will to be faithfulto the ideal of peace that was inscribed in the Charter inSan Francisco in 1945.The Working Group charged with examining thisquestion has made considerable progress  even thoughconsensus has yet to be found on such fundamental issuesas expansion  composition and use of the veto in theSecurity Council.Nonetheless  we can and must underscore  welcomeand support the many constructive and oftencomplementary proposals that have been submitted andthat have visibly enriched the debates over the course ofthe past year.We now must stay on track and redouble our effortsin order to take advantage of the momentum thusestablished and to succeed ultimately in our objective ofrestructuring the Security Council while modernizing it making it more democratic and giving it greatercredibility and greater transparency — and thus greaterlegitimacy.Africa has a natural role to play in this reform  arole that must be recognized given Africa’s historicalevolution and its destiny as a continent of the future inthe community of nations.The reform of the United Nations system towardsgreater coherence and greater dynamism is important  butequally urgent is the need for the maintenance andpromotion of peace in the world.It is true that significant progress has been made inthis area in recent years. Thus  the United Nations hassucceeded in substantially strengthening its capacity toplan  establish and conduct peacekeeping missionsthroughout the world. My country  Senegal  is pleased tohave been able to contribute to this progress  through inter alia  the posting of officers from its army to theSecretariat in New York so that the various aspects ofpeacekeeping operations could be better rationalized.2But the desired improvement should not be limited toprocedural matters  even though we must recognize thatthese matters are clearly important.Above all  we must also re-examine the orientation ofUnited Nations missions in all cases in which peace in theworld is threatened or breached.The international community must  in particular  bemore realistic in the missions it confers upon the UnitedNations Blue Helmets.In this context  drawing lessons from operations suchas that conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina  we mustrecognize something quite clear: by the rules of engagementestablished for them  the United Nations forces are not yetlegally equipped to restore peace in theatres of operationwhere peace has been broken.Therefore  it seems to us more appropriate to entrustsuch missions to the Members of the United Nations thatagree to conduct them in the framework of coalitionsplaced under the moral authority  but not the command  ofour Organization. We would thus avoid giving mandates toUnited Nations soldiers without in turn giving them thelegal  human and material means that are essential to theaccomplishment of their missions.This choice is all the more desirable since multifacetedconflicts continue to afflict many regions of the world starting  unfortunately  with Africa  our own continent.There significant progress has been made this year onthe road to restoring peace in a certain number of countries in particular in Liberia  which — thanks to thedetermination of the countries of the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) and the support of theinternational community — has just emerged from sevenyears of fratricidal conflict. But we must recognize that inthe case of other crises  the path towards peace remainsuncertain.This applies in particular to Sierra Leone  where thesituation remains very disturbing in spite of the initiativesof the United Nations  of the OAU and most especially ofECOWAS to restore legitimacy in that country.In the Congo (Brazzaville)  another of our brothercountries  the world witnessed a sudden deterioration of thepolitical situation in the military confrontation that began on5 June 1997. Here again it must be recalled that thecombined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU andthe lucid and commendable actions of President El HadjOmar Bongo  President of the Gabonese Republic andalso of the international mediation committee  have unfortunately  not managed to find a political way out ofthis grave internal crisis  the prolongation of which is aserious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent.Elsewhere on the continent  in Angola and inSomalia  internal conflicts continue to elude resolution.Faced with all the dangers posed by all theseconflicts  Africans have established the OAU Mechanismfor Conflict Prevention  Management and Resolution inAfrica.Nonetheless  it is clear that that pan-Africanorganization does not alone possess the means toundertake the many and complex actions required bypeacekeeping operations in Africa.Massive support from the international communityis therefore particularly needed in this area.This is why I would like once again to commend theconvening last 25 September  on the initiative of thePresident of the Security Council  of a special Councilmeeting at the ministerial level devoted to thepreservation of peace  security and stability in Africa. Wewould also like to thank our colleague  Mrs. MadeleineAlbright  Secretary of State of the United States.That meeting gave eloquent witness to the specialimportance that the international community attaches toAfrican problems.However  I must emphasize that declarations ofintent alone are not enough. We need concrete action.Hence  Senegal attaches great importance to the reportthat the Secretary-General is soon to submit to us andwhich is to contain specifically concrete recommendationson the causes of conflict in Africa  on the means ofpreventing them and  where need be  the means ofresolving them in full agreement with our partners in theinternational community.In this context  we welcome the increasing assistancewe are beginning to receive from certain major countriesof the northern hemisphere in the framework of thestrengthening of Africa’s capacity to maintain peace andreact rapidly to crises. In this respect  we cannot butmention France  the United States of America andCanada  as well as other countries of the North. Along3those same lines  the inauguration in Copenhagen on 2September by the Secretary-General of a planning centrefor the new United Nations Stand-By Forces High-Readiness Brigade was an event of great importance forconflict prevention throughout the world.Also in the framework of these concerns for Africa  Ishould like to mention the ongoing conflict between theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya on the one hand and the UnitedStates of America and the United Kingdom on the otherwith respect to the Lockerbie tragedy. We feel that the timeis ripe for the parties concerned finally to successfullyresolve this matter through dialogue and negotiationbecause — and this must be stressed once again — thepeople of Libya are suffering greatly from the embargo towhich that country is being subjected.We welcome the significant progress made in theframework of efforts to achieve a definitive peace in theWestern Sahara under the auspices of the United Nationsand under the guidance of Mr. James Baker  the PersonalEnvoy of the Secretary-General.The situation in the Middle East continues to be ofconcern to peace-loving people. Recent developments in theoccupied Palestinian territories  the expansion of existingIsraeli settlements or the construction of new ones  delaysin negotiations — these all have had  to our great regret  anegative impact on the peace process. We would mentionalso the clear-cut acts of violence perpetrated againstdefenceless civilians  such as the recent attacks inJerusalem. All of these acts must be condemnedunreservedly because they do enormous damage to thepeace efforts.It is for all these reasons that we wish here to make apressing appeal to the co-sponsors of the peace process andto the entire international community so that the mostappropriate initiatives can be taken in order to salvage thepeace process. For today  more than any other region of theworld  the Middle East truly needs peace and security forits own development. This peace can be achieved onlywithin a framework of mutual trust and the will to livetogether with respect for the rights and the dignity of all thepeoples of the region.Global security also requires arms reduction and theelimination of certain categories of weapons. That is why for more than 50 years now  the United Nations hasattempted to create a world free of all weapons of massdestruction. In the pursuit of this objective  significantprogress has already been made. One year ago  wewelcomed in this very Hall and with deep satisfaction theconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty.From that point on  the international community wasinvolved in negotiations for a treaty for the elimination ofanti-personnel landmines. Senegal  which is a member ofthe Conference on Disarmament  continues to attachspecial importance to this question  whose settlementwould represent a major step forward towards a worldthat would offer greater security for all. In this context we hope to see the Ottawa process  in which we areparticipants  succeed  by the end of this year  in thesigning of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-PersonnelMines and on Their Destruction.Eradicating poverty throughout the world has beenand remains one of the fundamental objectives of theUnited Nations. By proclaiming in the Charter theirdetermination to establish better standards of living inconditions of broader freedom  the founding fatherswanted to make of the United Nations an instrument thatwould fight for the social progress of all humankind.But at the present time  planet Earth is threatened byglobal challenges that know no boundaries and that spareno peoples. The world’s problems — poverty  exclusion terrorism  organized crime and drug-trafficking — havebecome globalized far earlier than the economy has. Thatis why  regardless of the way in which we approach thefuture  the problems that exist at century’s end cannot beresolved except through concerted and integrated actionthat can manage harmoniously all of the upheaval that isaccompanying this changing period of history.It is in this context that Senegal welcomes thesuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the elaborationof an Agenda for Development. The consensus achievedin that Agenda  which draws its substance from earliercommitments in the various plans of action of recentinternational conferences  gives evidence of our sharedfaith in the virtues of a new global partnership fordevelopment based on the imperative of interdependenceand on mutual benefit. Thus the conceptual frameworkhas been set and accepted by all  and it remains for us tomove towards action through a mobilization of resourcescommensurate with the generous intentions formulated inthe Agenda for Development.Along these lines  the settlement of the debt crisis just remuneration for commodities  the lifting of trade4barriers and an increase in official development assistanceare indispensable prerequisites if we are to build a worldthat is more welcoming to everyone  so that our globalvillage can be strengthened  in a spirit of solidarity  in alasting way.In this context  the fight against poverty is of clearpriority  because it is unacceptable  in this era of spacetechnology and the Internet  that millions of men andwomen the world over  and especially in the southernhemisphere  still do not have the minimal conditions for adecent life. They lack water  electricity  medicine  food —in a word  they lack security and well-being. Theaspirations of peoples to a better life is an eternal quest thatwe cannot neglect  as it is true that human beings mustremain at the very beginning and end of development.In this quest for lasting solutions to the challenges ofunderdevelopment  my country took the initiative  at thethirty-third Summit of the OAU  held in Harare in June  tosuggest two resolutions through which the Heads of Stateand Government of Africa unanimously renewed theirsupport for the United Nations system in general and forthe action taken by Africa in particular to raise the standardof living of African peoples. But this need for solidarityshould not cause us to forget that any effort towardssustainable development is  above all  the nationalresponsibility of States. It requires the definition andeffective application of sound macroeconomic policiesbased on transparency  the rule of law  the practice ofdemocracy  respect for human rights  social justice and theparticipation of all in the national development effort: inother words  it is based on what we today call goodgovernance.As my country sees it  this choice  which must besupplemented by solidarity at the global level  is the mostcertain course towards the shared ideal assigned to us bythe Charter of the United Nations.By enshrining in our Charter their attachment torespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  thefounding fathers of the United Nations inspired millions ofmen and women to take what His Holiness Pope John PaulII called two years ago “the risk of freedom”. Theircommendable struggle means that today  respect for theserights and these freedoms is universally considered to be anessential component of any undertaking whose goal is theprogress and well-being of the individual.My country  Senegal  which attaches profoundimportance to the dignity and value of the human being would like here to reiterate its commitment to continue towork alongside those many who are struggling to obtainor regain their right to freedom  justice and peace. Thissolidarity applies to our brothers and sisters in Palestine Bosnia and Herzegovina  Libya  Afghanistan  Somalia  theGreat Lakes region and elsewhere  who aspire only topeace in order to build their own future.I would like  in this framework  to commend theappointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson to the post of UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Weassure her of our support and wish her every success inher noble mission.The universal nature of the United Nations is areality that must be consolidated and strengthened. In thiscontext  we support without reservation the request of theRepublic of China to join again the community of nationsand be admitted to our Organization and its specializedagencies. Acceding to this request would be a significantcontribution to the consolidation of the ideal ofuniversality of the United Nations and do justice to theesteemed people of the Republic of China. Its economicand social development  commitment to democratic valuesand international behaviour have given irrefutable proofof its faith in the noble objectives of the United NationsCharter and of its capacity to assume the responsibilitiesof all Member States.When the Berlin wall crumbled in 1989  great hopewas aroused in the citizens of the world. Hope was bornof rapid movement towards a new international orderwhich would bring with it peace and justice as well assolidarity and progress. In this new international order the Republic of China has a place  a place recognized byinternational law and the demands of a rapidly developingworld.In conclusion  I would like to say that theinternational community must do everything in its powerto have hope triumph over the dangers menacinghumankind. The human race’s God-given intelligenceprovides the possibilities and resources to achieve thisend. We have no choice but to help the United Nationsadapt to the new world and play its proper role as acentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in theattainment of common ends. This is all the more essentialsince the great challenges to our future can only be metin a global framework of solidarity. The only solution —whether in the struggle against terrorism  drug- traffickingand organized crime; in the protection of our environmentand our collective health; or in the promotion of security5through disarmament or the reduction of poverty — is aconcerted and united global effort.Together  we have already begun this effort  and mycountry urges the international community to continue itsteadfastly. Senegal makes this appeal convinced that  withthe intellectual and material resources available tohumankind today  there is no challenge that cannot be met.All we need is the will.We can do it. We must do it. Let us do it together  asbrothers and sisters belonging to one family."
"143",6182,"SGP",52,1997,"﻿Let me congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. I also thank ouroutgoing President  Mr. Razali Ismail  for his untiringefforts. He catalysed a change in our approach to SecurityCouncil reform and set a new trajectory for it.For several years  we have all recognized theimperative of United Nations reform. Today  the issue ofthe moment is still reform. This summer  the Secretary-General challenged us with a package of reforms that heaccurately described as the most extensive and far-reaching in the 52-year history of this Organization. Thisis  of course  not the first time a Secretary-General hasattempted to remake this Organization. But now that themore extravagant of post-cold-war hopes for the UnitedNations have faded  I believe that this package representsa more focused  realistic and practical approach. Wecongratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative.The Secretary-General's objective clearly is to enablethe United Nations to do better what we all require it todo. We all take the United Nations importance asaxiomatic. Therefore  his intention to reconfigure theUnited Nations management and strengthen the UnitedNations ability to perform its core functions should begenerally acceptable to the majority  even if everyparticular element of his proposals has not been fullyelaborated or may not be entirely to everyone's taste.In the larger interests of this Organization  we shouldall welcome the thrust of the Secretary-General'sproposals and not take issue with too many details.Singapore adopts such an approach. We have  forexample  questions about some specific details of hisproposals to place the United Nations finances on asounder footing and to streamline its operations. But wehave nonetheless contributed actively to the effort tostreamline budgetary and administrative procedures in theSecretariat and will continue to do so.By taking a pragmatic and eclectic approach  wehope to help move the reform process forward  even if wemay have questions on specific aspects. We will continueto work with the Secretary-General and other MemberStates to make the United Nations a more efficient andeffective Organization — one that will serve the interestsof all its Members  big and small  developing as well asindustrialized.The Secretary-General's proposals on the UnitedNations management  administration and structure havesometimes been directly or indirectly linked to theongoing effort by Member States to prepare the UnitedNations political leadership for the twenty-first centurythrough Security Council reform. We are not confidentthat this is the correct approach. We have been engagedin this broader effort for almost four years. It is a factthat the process has been difficult. Progress has beenslow. We have reached the conclusion that the prospectsfor further progress are not good.9We have arrived at this conclusion with greatreluctance and without rancour. Progress has not been slowbecause of the ill will of one State or another. Prospects forfurther progress are dim not merely because one country oranother has lacked the will to cut through the web of vestedinterests. The reasons are more fundamental. They gobeyond the volitions and intentions of individual countriesand are embedded in the nature and inescapable realities ofinternational organization in an international system that isstill largely defined by relations between sovereign States.No great Power  or even a Power with aspirations togreatness  has ever been willing to submit its own vitalinterests to United Nations jurisdiction. This fact ofinternational life underlies the current reform stalemate. Thenecessity of United Nations reform may be widelyaccepted. But what the great Powers want is not a strongUnited Nations per se. They want a United Nations juststrong and credible enough to serve as an effectiveinstrument of their will and policies. It is only smallcountries that are more inclined to take the United Nationson its own terms and in its own right. Small countries arenot necessarily more virtuous — we merely have feweroptions.This reality has been underscored by our discussionson Security Council reform. The really crucial decisionsthat will allow Security Council reform to move decisivelyforward or stall it indefinitely are going to be taken inWashington  London  Paris  Beijing or Moscow. It has notbeen clear that the current permanent members really wantchange except on their own terms and in circumstances thatwill not erode their current status and prerogatives. Criticalambiguities in their positions have held up progress andwill continue to do so unless clarified.One school of thought is that we should decide onSecurity Council reform during this General Assembly. Ican well sympathize with the frustrations of those who feelthat the current debate is going nowhere. But preciselybecause this is so  we need to ask: What is it that we aregoing to decide upon? The answer is far from clear. Indeed the entire Security Council reform process is in danger ofbeing lost in a wilderness of logical contradictions andambiguities. Please permit me to spell out some of thesecontradictions and ambiguities.Several permanent members have been categoric onlyin their desire to see Japan and Germany as new permanentmembers. Many other countries  including my own  wouldagree that  when general agreement is reached on theexpansion of the Security Council  Japan and Germanyshould be new permanent members. But an equally largenumber of countries  and I believe Japan and Germanyare among them  would also agree that any generalagreement on expansion must include some developingcountries as new permanent members to reflect newinternational realities.On this point most permanent members have beenfar less clear. When challenged  several of them haverecently for the first time conceded that in addition toJapan and Germany they would in principle be willing toaccept three permanent seats for developing nations fromthe regions of Africa  Asia and Latin America. This iswelcome progress. Nevertheless  important ambiguitiesstill remain.How will the three developing countries be chosen?It has been suggested that individual countries be chosenby a two-thirds vote of the membership as a whole. It hasalso been suggested that they could be subject to somesystem of rotation within the regions.Both  however  are problematic concepts. Can acountry really legitimately represent a region if it ischosen outside the region? Will the two-thirdsmembership prescribed by the Charter really besufficiently familiar with conditions outside their ownrespective regions to make an informed and legitimatechoice  binding on regions of which they are notmembers? Then  conceptually  is it not inherentlycontradictory for a member to be said to be permanentbut nonetheless be subject to rotation? Who will such amember represent: its own national interests or theregion's interests? Can it really represent the latter?Indeed  what is the regional interest? How will it bedetermined? Is the regional interest necessarilysynonymous with the interests of the larger members ofa region? Can a rotational system work for any regionexcept Africa  where it is already an establishedprinciple?None of these questions will be easy to answer.They have been debated for the last three years withoutsatisfactory answers. But unless there are clear answers my concern is that suggestions for a differentiatedselection process for permanent members from among thenewly industrialized and newly developing countries willonly lead to permanent stress  divisions and conflict formost regions  or it will lead to a two-stage decision-making process where the elevation of Germany andJapan will not for many years  if ever  be matched by anydegree of consensus for the developing nations of Asia 10Africa and Latin America. Such a discriminatory situationwould be clearly unacceptable to a majority of MemberStates  including many of those that aspire to permanentstatus.But even if we could simultaneously reach agreementon the identity of the three permanent members fromamong the developing countries  together with Japan andGermany  there are further complexities of equalimportance. What will be the status of the new permanentmembers?Even those current permanent members that havestrongly supported Germany's and Japan's aspirations havebeen silent on whether Germany and Japan should have theveto. Even treaty allies of Japan and Germany  countriesthat have pledged to go to war at their side and for them have taken no position on this crucial question. This  in ourview  makes it even more difficult to believe that anydeveloped country permanent member would ever allowany developing country to acquire the veto  even thoughthey have made it clear that they want to retain unrestricteduse of the veto for themselves.The powers of new permanent members are notquestions that can be deferred to a later date merely tomake it easier to quickly determine the identity of the newpermanent members. They are intrinsic to the very notionand definition of permanent membership. Is a newpermanent member really a permanent member if it doesnot have the same powers as the original five permanentmembers?Article 27 has been controversial from the veryfounding of the United Nations. There is now a wideconsensus that the use of the veto should be curtailed witha view to its eventual abolition. The reality  of course  isthat this is not going to happen any time soon. Any attemptto curtail the veto will be vetoed. Undemocratic though itmay be  the veto will be with us for the foreseeable future.And it is not without a certain utility in so far as it helpsprevent conflicts among the major Powers which couldundermine the United Nations. It has been argued that theveto acts as a fail-safe mechanism. The veto will preventthose countries that are so essential to the maintenance ofpeace and security and to the operation of the UnitedNations that they deserve permanent status from beingcompelled to take any action that would lead to conflictsamong themselves.Now  if this justification for the retention of the vetoby the original five permanent members has any validity then the question that arises is whether any newpermanent member that is not given the veto is reallydeserving of that status? Would such countries reallyenjoy the international stature and the capability and cloutto make such a crucial contribution to international peaceand security as to warrant being given permanent status?And if not  why give them permanent status? Could theynot make financial and other contributions to the UnitedNations in some other  way as many countries with nosuch aspirations already do? If there is a need for newpermanent members  and I believe there is a need  thenthe veto is not a question that can be postponed ordiscussed separately from the issue of their identities.Three out of the five current permanent membershave also been adamantly opposed to the expansion of theSecurity Council beyond a total of 20 or 21 members.This effectively blocks any expansion of the SecurityCouncil.Let us suppose that agreement is reached on theidentity of the five new permanent members: Japan andGermany and three from the developing countries whichever they may be. But if the current permanentmembers that argue against an expansion of the SecurityCouncil beyond 21 members remain firm in their position this would mean only one additional non-permanent seatfor the 165 remaining members of the United Nations  allof which have a desire and a right to serve the UnitedNations on the Security Council at least occasionally. Thisinequitable arrangement would certainly be rejected bythe majority. Moreover  creating five new permanentmembers in a Security Council of 21 will seriously upsetthe present balance between permanent seats and non-permanent seats. This is also a situation which will not beacceptable to the majority of the Member States. It willcertainly not command the support of the two thirds ofthe membership required by the Charter to effect anychange to the Security Council's present composition.Those that have argued for an expansion of theSecurity Council to no more than 21 members have doneso on the grounds that this is the maximum number thatcan function effectively and efficiently. These areconcerns that we should all share. Nobody wants anineffective or inefficient Security Council. But no one hasyet made a convincing argument that a Security Councilof  say  26 members  as has been proposed by the Non-Aligned Movement  would be any less efficient oreffective than a Security Council of 21. This is of courseassuming that effectiveness and efficiency are notnarrowly defined as merely making it more difficult for11any of the current permanent members and their allies toensure that nobody can prevent them from having their ownway.In any case  can we really decide on the effectivenessand efficiency of an expanded Security Council before weknow what the powers of the new permanent members aregoing to be? This leads us into a tautological situation. Wecannot know how an expanded Security Council consistingof an expanded number of permanent members will operatebecause  as I argued a moment ago  the definition of whatconstitutes a new permanent member cannot be separatedfrom the question of the veto. And the current permanentmembers have refused to pronounce on this. At this point effectiveness and efficiency as an argument against aSecurity Council of more than 21 breaks down completely.I could go on with my analysis. But I hope I havedemonstrated that several critical aspects of the positions ofthe major countries on Security Council reform need furtherclarification before progress can be made. I do not believethat the ambiguities and contradictions are going to beresolved soon. They are the natural consequence ofsovereign States pursuing their national interests.The position of permanent members will have adecisive influence on whether or not Security Councilreform moves forward. As things presently stand  it seemsclear that what will not evoke a veto from any of thecurrent permanent members will not command the supportof the two-thirds membership required to make thenecessary Charter changes. At the same time  what wouldattract the support of the vast majority of United NationsMembers is more likely than not to provoke a veto. This iswhere  like it or not  we currently stand.A similar case could be made on the closely relatedquestion of financial reform. This too  has its own deepcomplexities; its own intrinsic contradictions between whatwould be acceptable to the majority and what the majorPowers want. Not every change is necessarily for the better.We should therefore make progress cautiously  especiallyon such fundamental questions. This is why the Non-Aligned Movement has wisely decided that efforts atrestructuring the Security Council should not be subject toany imposed time-frame.Of course  there has been an evolution in the positionsof the major Powers over the last four years. There will befurther positive changes over time. But it will certainly taketime. No country readily changes the status quo if itbenefits from the status quo.My point is therefore that  given this reality  itwould be a historic mistake to artificially link theSecretary-General's managerial  administrative andstructural reforms to far more contentious questions ofSecurity Council or other matters that would require thesupport of the two-thirds membership needed to effectCharter amendments as defined in Article 108. There isno need to handicap ourselves in this way. Not all aspectsof the Secretary-General's proposals are equallyacceptable to all Members. But  taken as a whole  it willbe far easier to reach a general agreement on moreaspects of the Secretary-General's proposals if they areconsidered in themselves and not linked to morepoliticized and therefore more intractable questions.This is not to say that Security Council or financialreforms are unimportant. Of course  they are important.We should continue to work on them. The issues I haveraised are complex. But there is no avoiding them. Iremain confident that with patience and sincerity we willeventually find our way out of the thickets of ambiguityinto which we have wandered. I am confident that we willeventually succeed in our common endeavour to enhancethe ability of the Security Council to exercise leadershipin the management of global affairs and enhance itslegitimacy to do so.But this is only one facet of United Nations reform.The Security Council is not necessarily the only UnitedNations body that is important  nor even always the mostimportant. The Security Council is empowered to act onbehalf of the membership as a whole on questions ofinternational peace and security. It has no direct mandateto act on behalf of the membership as a whole on manyother urgent international questions. International peaceand security are no longer the only definition of highinternational politics. Development and the environmentare two areas that are obvious and of increasingimportance. Such issues in which the Security Council isnot the lead United Nations body have risen inprominence on the post-cold-war international agenda.They will remain high priorities for the majority. Therecan be no legitimate leadership role for the UnitedNations that does not deal with such issues.Herein lies the critical importance of the Secretary-General's proposals. They can make an immediate andtangible difference to issues affecting the entireinternational community which are beyond the scope ofthe Security Council. Action on the Secretary-General'sproposals  therefore  should not have to await generalagreement on Security Council reform. By focusing on12his proposals  by subjecting them to a thorough and positivediscussion  I believe we can move urgently needed UnitedNations reforms forward at a faster pace than has hithertocharacterized the reform process. And we can still remainseized of  but not hostage to  issues that may take moretime to command general agreement or that require Charteramendment."
"144",6215,"SLB",52,1997,"Eight weeks ago  thepeople of Solomon Islands elected a new Parliament thatbrought to office the “Alliance for Change”  a reform-oriented Government committed to revitalizing the nationand its economy. Programmes to fulfil the public’s desirefor sustainable development are being designed andimplemented with professionalism  transparency accountability and due respect for traditional values.The demand for change is being heard in the villagesand towns of Solomon Islands  as it is elsewhere. Changefor the better  however  is not easily achieved. It requirespeople with vision and the judgment and courage to inspireproductive action. The United Nations and the GeneralAssembly are blessed with such people. Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  in less than 10 months in office  hasdemonstrated insight and a refreshing openness that is feltthroughout the Organization. His proposals to create a moreeffective and efficient United Nations are having asignificant impact on our efforts here. The Solomon Islandsdelegation will work to achieve the consensus hisprogramme for reform needs.Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  Minister for Foreign Affairsof Ukraine  brings to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly more than a decade of experience at the UnitedNations and participation in the historic political andeconomic transformation of his country. In this time ofchange at the United Nations  his diplomatic skills willprove indispensable.As President of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly  Malaysia’s Ambassador Razali Ismail providedenthusiastic leadership and challenging proposals thathelped advance the reform process. We thank him.Solomon Islands gratefully recognizes the debt owedto the people of the Secretariat  the specialized agencies the assistance programmes  the humanitarian andpeacekeeping operations of the Organization and allies suchas the International Committee of the Red Cross. Oftenworking under difficult and even dangerous conditions these men and women are heroes of our time. They willcontinue to have our full support.The extraordinary and rapid changes with which thiscentury is ending understandably fuel uncertainty and fearof the future as we participate in the transformation of theworld through international communications  commerce andlaw  as well as medicine  science and technology. Evenhumankind’s successful venture into outer space drawsdoubters and critics alike. During the last years of thenineteenth century  rapid scientific and technologicalinnovation  armed conflict and the migration of vastnumbers of people generated uncertainty and the fear ofcivilization’s decline among the influential circles ofEurope. Intellectuals wrote about the ongoing degenerationof humankind and envisioned cataclysmic wars.In the twentieth century brutal local and globalconflicts  the development and use of the cruellest weapons the attempted extermination of entire peoples and aseemingly endless cold war gave credibility to thenightmare visions of that earlier generation. We are nowengaged in the difficult process of understanding andtransforming this legacy of horror into something we canuse for humankind’s benefit. In this effort the UnitedNations is vital.Solomon Islands welcomes the adoption of theAgenda for Development and looks forward to theconclusion of the discussion of the scale of assessmentsand the issue of the capacity to pay. For the smalldeveloping States  an effective and financially stableUnited Nations that meets the challenges of development as well as of the Organization’s other core activities remains critical.The Solomon Islands Government supports theSecretary-General’s programme of reform. We have noillusions  however  that it will be easy for the MemberStates to reach a consensus on its adoption. Certaincontroversial proposals face intense debate  but we areconfident that the outcome of our deliberations willbenefit all. These discussions should take place in onlyone forum so that small delegations such as my own canfully participate.In an ideal United Nations  the future design of theSecurity Council could be characterized as “equality ofmembership  yes; the veto  no”. Political reality  however requires another approach. The Security Council shouldbe expanded  with permanent and non-permanent seats fordeveloped and developing States. Solomon Islands willgive serious consideration to permanent membership forGermany  Japan and several developing countries. Sincethe present permanent members insist on retaining theveto  it must be restricted to questions relating to ChapterVII of the Charter.Solomon Islands and other States in the greatcontinent of Oceania are especially sensitive toenvironmental change. Our commitment to the principlesof the Rio Declaration and the objectives of Agenda 21 isreflected in Solomon Islands’ ratification of theConvention on Biological Diversity and the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Wevigorously support the Alliance of Small Island Statesdraft protocol to the Framework Convention  and we willcontinue in the joint effort towards the achievement of alegally binding instrument to be negotiated in Kyoto thisDecember. We are moving quickly to enact legislation15that will enable Solomon Islands to meet its obligationsunder the Climate Change Convention.Solomon Islands  which has ratified the Convention onthe Law of the Sea  is committed to the adoption of aseabed mining code with strong provisions for protectingthe marine environment. In 1998 we will activelyparticipate in the International Year of the Ocean.We are committed to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Of special concern to us is thetransport  dumping or storage of radioactive and otherdangerous wastes in the Pacific region. Solomon Islands hassigned the Waigani Convention to Ban the Importation intoForum Island Countries of Hazardous and RadioactiveWastes and the Nouméa Convention to protect the region’smarine and terrestrial environments. For these and similartreaties  it is important that relevant international standardsbe met by the responsible parties.Solomon Islands  which has ratified the Treaty ofRarotonga  continues to support the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere  as well as similar zoneselsewhere. We worked closely with Marshall Islands andWestern Samoa in arguing before the International Court ofJustice that the use of any nuclear weapon would violateinternational and humanitarian law. Our position waslargely upheld by the landmark advisory opinion the Courthanded down last year. We were pleased to co-sponsorGeneral Assembly resolution 51/45 M in support of theInternational Court of Justice opinion. Solomon Islandscontinues its call for the creation of a forum of non-nuclear-weapon States. The forum  committed to theelimination of all nuclear weapons  and in keeping with theCourt’s advisory opinion  would seek agreement on aunified approach to the full implementation of Article VI ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand would monitor progress towards that goal.Solomon Islands  which has closely followed theOttawa process  will enthusiastically sign the treaty banninganti-personnel landmines. We thank Canada for thisinitiative. Recognition must also be given to theInternational Committee of the Red Cross and several non-governmental organizations for their efforts.A deadly legacy of the Second World War continuesto haunt the Solomon Islands. Over 100 ships laden withfuel and unexploded munitions rest on the bottom of ourchannels and on land. A large number of unexplodedbombs still litter our shores. The leaking fuel contaminatesfish breeding grounds and affects the aquatic food chain.Estimates of the costs of clearance run to $1 billion ormore  but a thorough technical and financial assessmentof the problem is required. Those countries that wagedwar in the Solomon Islands have a responsibility to assistus.Recognizing the need to restructure the SolomonIslands economy  my Government is closely reviewingseveral key areas  such as public expenditure  banking andthe taxation regime. We will seek assistance from theinternational lending agencies and the developedcountries. To meet the demands of globalization  we areundertaking the expansion of investment and trade.With 80 per cent of its population of under 400 000living in rural settings on hundreds of islands dispersedover 1 600 kilometres of ocean  Solomon Islands is usinga village-centred development strategy that is democraticin origin and operation and sensitive to the cultural valuesof an ethnically and linguistically diverse people. MyGovernment is placing increased emphasis on educationand recreation for women and youth  who comprise threequarters of our population. Formal as well as informalprogrammes are being used to foster the study ofagriculture  biology and other sciences  health care appropriate technologies and the humanities. We arecommitted to upgrading the Solomon Islands College ofHigher Education and transforming it into our NationalUniversity.The Government is also focusing on programmes toincrease agricultural productivity through research andbetter land use. We are pursuing policies to promotelivestock development and aquaculture. Fishing remainsa vital industry for us  and Solomon Islands has ratifiedthe Agreement on the Conservation and Management ofStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.Over half of my Government’s revenue comes fromforest harvesting. Our ultimate goal is sustainable forestry.Reforestation and the conservation of our preserves arenow essential elements of our environmental policy.Seeking to maximize the economic return to SolomonIslanders  we are reviewing the process of grantinglicences and considering the establishment of facilities forlumber processing entirely within our country.Sustainable development in the Solomon Islandsrequires electrification  especially by means of solar andhydro energy. Whether to enhance rural life or to opennew industries  electrification is essential. My16Government is giving energy resource development highpriority.Embracing the purposes and principles of the Charter Solomon Islands has on several occasions at the UnitedNations called upon the Republic of China on Taiwan andthe People’s Republic of China to take the necessary stepstowards opening negotiations to achieve reunification. TheGovernment of the Republic of China is committed to thepeaceful and equitable reunification of China. Peacefulreunification is also the stated goal of the People’s Republicof China. Both parties have offered strikingly similarproposals. Yet there has been no decisive movementtowards negotiation. Delay makes them ever harder toinitiate  increases tension across the Taiwan Strait andthreatens international peace and security. Responsibility forpeaceful reunification rests with the two parties and theinternational community. Bringing about and successfullycompleting negotiations will be a long and difficult processthat would be greatly assisted by the participation of theRepublic of China in the United Nations. The Republic ofChina  which is fully committed to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter  has the means to be an activecontributor to the Organization’s work.Regrettably  threats have been made and actions takenagainst Solomon Islands and other Member States that havespoken on behalf of the Republic of China. Even the use offorce against us has been threatened  in violation of theCharter’s principles and the letter and spirit of numerousGeneral Assembly resolutions. Threats have no place at theUnited Nations.Finally  as we enter the twenty-first century  a moreeffective Organization requires the participation anddedication of all sectors of civil society. Let us renew ourpledge to cooperate with the United Nations. It is time tojoin hands in shaping the present for the benefit of futuregenerations."
"145",6261,"SLE",52,1997,"﻿It is indeed an honour onceagain to address the General Assembly.On behalf of the people of Sierra Leone  and on myown behalf  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election topreside over the work of this session  which you rightlydescribed as one that can mark the beginning of a newera in United Nations history. Ukraine  a foundingMember of our Organization  is well known for itsdecisive stand on unilateral nuclear disarmament. This initself is a major contribution to the promotion ofinternational peace and security. As an experienceddiplomat and former senior member of the Secretariat you are fully equipped to steer this session to a successfulconclusion.I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for the firm andskilful manner in which he led the Assembly in dealingwith the issues of the fifty-first session.We commend the Secretary-General for the boldeffort he has made so far in mapping out the tracks of hisquiet revolution  a reform of the Secretariat. This isperhaps the first time in the history of the Organization7that we have in the same session a President of the GeneralAssembly and a Secretary-General both of whom were staffmembers of the United Nations Secretariat. I would like toconvey through the Secretary-General our appreciation tothe entire staff of the United Nations system  who havebeen and continue to be pillars supporting the structures ofpeace and economic and social well-being which ourOrganization is building in various parts of the world.When I addressed this body last year  I spoke at lengthabout my Government’s efforts to reach a peace agreementwith the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)  the settlementof people displaced by the conflict and our efforts atnational reconciliation. I also spoke of our hopes: our hopesfor the consolidation of our new democracy  for the revivalof our economy and for the regeneration of communitiesscarred by years of war. These were no starry-eyedpronouncements. We were too well aware of the challengeswhich the achievement of these objectives entailed  but wewere tackling them in a spirit of realism within theframework of a united national effort and  above all  inconfident hope.In the economic sphere  for example  the response waspromising. My Government was credited within a year withthe introduction of a social security scheme and a minimumwage act; accountability and transparency in publicspending; trade liberalization and public enterprise reform including privatization; reduction of the rate of inflationfrom 65 per cent to 6 per cent; achievement of a 5 per centeconomic growth rate  which had been minus 10 per centa year earlier; and plans for an investment code. These aresome of the signposts of confidence which national andinternational investors saw when they concluded that SierraLeone was well on its way to economic recovery. Prospectsfor that recovery were at their highest in more than twodecades.Today I appear before you with a heavy heart. As Ispeak  a great tragedy is unfolding in my country. On 25May 1997  a combination of elements of the Sierra Leonearmy and the Revolutionary United Front violentlyoverthrew my democratically elected Government andunleashed on the country a reign of terror unprecedented inits scope and ferocity. Overnight  Sierra Leone wastransformed into a gulag of horrors: the killing ofdefenceless  innocent civilians  looting  confiscation ofproperty and rape. These atrocities continue. The people ofSierra Leone have been ushered into a long night ofdarkness. For the first time in our history  the survival ofour national society as a morally and socially cohesivewhole has been put into question.It is against the background of these dramaticallychanged conditions in my country that I appear beforeyou today  to make an appeal — a desperate appeal —for help from the international community to save anation and a people. My presence on this podiumsymbolizes the people of Sierra Leone stretching out theirhands to the United Nations  asking it to pull them backfrom the brink of catastrophe.The people of Sierra Leone are united in a commonfear  the fear that unless something is done  and donenow  the barbarism and adventurism of the military juntawill push the country over the brink. Their hope is thatthe international community will not allow the militaryjunta to convert their country into one vast killing field.If the prevailing situation is allowed to drift much longer because of a failure of political will  or for any otherreason  then the hopes of a peace-loving nation for a lifeworthy of normal human beings will have been betrayed.I am more than convinced that this cannot be what theUnited Nations would like to see happen in Sierra Leone.My belief in the United Nations  as the custodian ofworld peace and security  and as the ultimate defence ofthe weak and the defenceless  remains as strong as ever.It is on the strength of this conviction  which has been apart of all my adult life  that I bring the case of SierraLeone to the attention of the Assembly.Only the speedy restoration of the democraticallyelected Government of Sierra Leone can provide a lastingsolution to the crisis and enable the country to return tonormalcy and to resume its place as a responsible memberof the community of nations. This is no self-servingstatement. To insist on the restoration of my Governmentis no more than to insist that the Government which thepeople of Sierra Leone freely and openly elected in themost closely invigilated election in the post-independencehistory of the country be restored to them. Indeed  whenthe Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)held in Harare considered the matter it resolved stronglyand unequivocally to condemn the coup d’état and calledfor the immediate restoration of constitutional order inSierra Leone.My Government emerged as a result of a transitionprocess under the their military regime of the NationalProvisional Ruling Council. It was that regime whichappointed the Interim National Electoral Commission asthe management body responsible for the conduct of boththe parliamentary and presidential elections. At therequest of the Interior National Electoral Commission  theCommonwealth secretariat in London provided three8experts  including a legal draftsman  to help with thepreparations for the elections. None of these people hadbeen to Sierra Leone before and they knew nobody in thecountry. The point of their attachment to the InteriorNational Electoral Commission was to bring to bear on thework of the Commission the highest international electoralpractices. The European Union also provided a votereducation expert from Britain  while the United Nationssupplied a logistical expert.In other words  at the heart of the electionmanagement body  the international community had apresence to ensure the highest standard of probity andtransparency in the conduct of the elections.In January 1996  in the middle of the preparations forthe elections  Brigadier Maada Bio forced CaptainValentine Strasser out of office as Chairman of the NationalProvisional Ruling Council and immediately launched acampaign to postpone the elections. The banner of thatcampaign was “Peace before Elections”. A nationalconsultative conference comprising representatives ofpolitical parties  the army  the police  trade unions women’s organizations  the churches and mosques andother organizations of civil society was convened inFebruary 1996 to pronounce on the matter. I should addthat in attendance were also representatives of theinternational community. The overwhelming majority of thedelegates to the conference supported the holding ofelections. Incidentally  the Revolutionary United Front wasinvited to participate in the democratic process. Clearlyillustrating its attitude towards legitimate democraticprinciples and procedures  the Front categorically refused tohonour the invitation.And so the elections were held on 26 and 27 February1996. There were observers from the Commonwealth  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the African-American Institute  the African-American Labor Center  theCommonwealth Trade Union Council and the WorldCouncil of Churches  all coordinated by no less a body thanthe United Nations itself. At the close of polling  and longbefore the official declaration of the results  theinternational observers made a joint statement on 29February 1996  in which they said that  despite setbacks they had witnessed a remarkably peaceful  orderly andtransparent conduct of the vote  which led them to conclude“that the results will genuinely reflect the will of thepeople of Sierra Leone and usher in an era ofdemocracy”.Having failed to prevent the holding of the electionsthrough political manoeuvring  the anti-democratic forceswithin the army and their Revolutionary United Frontallies launched a campaign of terror and intimidation inthose parts of the countryside where the rebels had apresence to scare away people from voting. Manyinnocent men and women had their hands cut off. Somewere branded with hot irons and many more weremutilated in ways that I cannot describe in public. But nointimidation could overcome the determination of thepeople to put an end to military rule and all its associatedabuses.The elections which brought my Government intooffice were more than an electoral exercise to replace oneGovernment with another. They were no less than anopportunity — indeed  a historic opportunity — for thepeople of Sierra Leone to put an end to nearly 30 yearsof undemocratic rule  the last four of which were anoutright military dictatorship.In retrospect  the victories of the people  first againstthe political sleight of hand to stop the elections  and thenagainst the campaign of terror and intimidation to scareaway the voters from the polling booths  seem to haveleft the reactionary forces in our country with only oneremaining avenue to their objective  the unconstitutionaloverthrow of any civil Government  and that wasprecisely what happened on 25 May.The people of Sierra Leone have responded to thecoup in a manner unique in the history of Africa.Thousands of citizens  some out of fear for their lives andother human rights violations  simply abandoned theirhomes and their country  moved into neighbouringcountries  declaring they would rather live as refugeesoutside Sierra Leone than stay under the rule of the illegaljunta. Those who stayed behind have refused to go towork and have in various ways refused to cooperate withthe junta. This is the manifestation of the determinationof Sierra Leoneans never to surrender their hard-wondemocracy.The struggle under way in my country is betweenthe unarmed millions defending the cause of democracyand the armed reactionary clique of mutinous soldiers andtheir Revolutionary United Front cohorts. In embarking onthat perilous struggle  the people of Sierra Leone werenever in doubt as to where the sheer military advantagelay. What continues to sustain the determined resistanceof the people and to fortify their courage is the belief  andthe expectation  that the international community cannot 9and will not  let them down — indeed  the belief that whatever hardship they are facing at the moment  right willultimately triumph over might.No one who has seen the reign of terror unleashed bythe regime on the defenceless citizenry or witnessed thedaily looting  rape and other brutalities which have nowbecome a way of life in Sierra Leone can mistake this forpeace. There is no peace in Sierra Leone. What ishappening is that the horrors which the RUF inflicted onthe rural communities — the killings  the amputation oflimbs  the looting  the arbitrary and illegal seizure ofprivate property of all kinds and many other crimes — havenow been generalized to encompass the urban centres aswell. To further compound their assault on innocentcivilians  the illegal junta has finally resorted to the layingof anti-personnel landmines throughout the country  andwithin the capital city itself. I need not spell out what ahorrific act this represents as far as innocent men  womenand children are concerned as they begin to fall victim tothese hidden devices.This was precisely what my Government set out toavert. In my inaugural statement as President  I made thepursuit of peace and the end of the rebel war my mosturgent priority. Within a matter of days of assuming office I signed a communiqué at Yamoussoukro  in Côte d’Ivoire with the leader of the RUF  Corporal Foday Sankoh  inwhich we effectively agreed upon a permanent ceasefire.That agreement opened the way for substantive negotiationsbetween the Government and the RUF  culminating in theAbidjan peace accord of 30 November 1996.What my Government did not know was that the RUFwas negotiating in bad faith. We took the RUF at its wordand assumed that its professed commitment to peace wasgenuine. The negotiations were protracted because the RUFwas adamant on certain issues. We conceded on thoseparticular issues with the hope that the RUF would honourthe resulting accord. This is  of course  not to suggest thatthere were no doubters in our ranks who harbouredmisgivings about the sincerity of the RUF. We had ourshare of these doubting Thomases  but on the basis of ourpeoples yearning for peace  we elected to be guided moreby our hopes and less by our fears.After peace  national reconciliation was another centralplank of my Government’s policy. The pursuit of thatpolicy began with the very configuration of myadministration. My party had a substantial majority inParliament  and I myself had won the presidential electionswith a convincing majority. On the basis of the outcome ofthe elections  therefore  I was under no obligation toinclude in my Government people from other parties. ButI took a wider view of the matter and decided that if thecause of national reconciliation was to be advanced itwould be desirable to have a broad-based Government.Accordingly  I appointed the leader of one of the minorityparties to be my Minister of Finance  making him effectively  the third most senior member of theGovernment. Other ministerial and senior positions werefilled by people drawn from other political parties. Whatemerged as a result was a broad-based Government ofnational unity in all but name.The policy of national reconciliation was takenfurther. The previous military regime  the NationalProvisional Ruling Council (NPRC) had confiscated theproperties of many senior Sierra Leoneans not on thebasis of law or due process  but on ad hoc commissionsof inquiry whose findings were not published and weresubject to no appeal. No one pretended that justice hadbeen done by the work of those commissions of inquiry.Yet  on the basis of their findings  not only had manypeople lost their properties  some of them had also beendisqualified from holding public office. If Sierra Leone’snew democracy was to mean anything  this was a state ofaffairs which could not be allowed to continue. Iappointed a National Commission for Reconciliation andapplied to the Commonwealth secretariat for a seniorCommonwealth judge to review the findings of thecommission of inquiry and to put right what had been putwrong. I wanted a judge of suitable seniority anddistinction whose verdict would command respect. TheCommonwealth Secretary-General secured for me theservices of judge Ulric Cross of Trinidad and Tobago. Hewas due to return to Sierra Leone to resume hischairmanship of the National Commission forReconciliation when the coup took place.Following the earlier coup of April 1992  which hadinstalled the NPRC military regime in power  many SierraLeoneans went into exile. They  too  had to be enabled tocome home in security and in dignity. Former PresidentJoseph Saidu Momoh had been living in exile in Guineasince the coup of April 1992. My Government broughthim home and resettled him in a manner befitting a manwho had been our Head of State.I have gone into this background in detail to showwhat my Government did to end the war that had beenraging for the best part of five years  to achieve nationalreconciliation and to usher in lasting peace. All this andmuch else will be erased if the regime is allowed to10remain in power. The burning question before the worldcommunity  therefore  is how best to bring a swift end tothe ruinous regime of the military and to enable SierraLeone to rejoin the mainstream of human society.Some people with the best of intentions but with littleknowledge of the situation have called for negotiations toend the tragedy unfolding in Sierra Leone.I have beeninvolved in negotiations of one kind or another throughoutmy career. In fact  in a sense negotiating is second natureto me. Accordingly  I have no problems with the principleof negotiation. But it would be utterly disingenuous of menot to state the serious reservations I hold about negotiatingwith the junta.In the first place  the junta is an unstable coalition. Onthe surface it presents itself as a government in which everymember shares collective responsibility for decisions jointlytaken. In reality it is nothing of the kind. There is nothingcollective about the junta except the determination of itsconstituent parts to hang on to power. For now the RUFmay be allied with some elements of the army  but there isno pretence that they are motivated by the same long-termobjectives. The RUF is not the army  and it is certainly notunder the command of the mutinous faction of the Army.The RUF has a separate and independent commandstructure  and it takes its instructions from its own highcommand. Therefore  based on our experience  in anyputative negotiations with the RUF it can be expected tocome to the table with its own set of demands. Thedecision of one part of the unstable coalition will not  byany stretch of the imagination  bind the other. Indeed precisely because they have separate and quite possiblyconflicting objectives there is hardly any prospect ofnegotiating with anything like a unified position.In the second place  the RUF is undoubtedly thefaction with the upper hand within the junta. The RUF’sprincipal objective all along has been to take and keeppower by all means  including terror and murder. In itspresent configuration  the RUF has no coherent programmeto speak of. Rather than yield power peacefully  the RUFhas threatened to launch a scorched-earth campaign toreduce the country to ashes. Its position is that if it cannotrule Sierra Leone  nobody else should.And if none of these points is convincing  we haveonly to look at the way in which the junta has handled thenegotiations with the Committee of four Foreign Ministersof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS). The three-point ECOWAS formula for theresolution of the Sierra Leone crisis entailed  in order “the early reinstatement of the legitimateGovernment of President Tejan Kabbah  the returnof peace and security and the resolution of the issuesof refugees and displaced persons”.This was the basis on which the regime entered intonegotiations with the ECOWAS Committee of four. Thethird meeting between the Committee and representativesof the regime in Abidjan took place on 30 July 1997. Itwas expected to be a breakthrough meeting. However while it was in progress  the leader of the junta made aradio and television broadcast in which he stated clearlythat his regime was determined to remain in power for aminimum of four years. His statement was intended towreck the talks  and that was exactly what it did. He hasnot retracted his determination to stay in power for fouryears.If  in spite of the illegal junta’s record of bad faith the international community insists that we must take thepath of negotiations  then I suggest that such negotiationsshould be held between the junta and the Committee ofECOWAS Foreign Ministers  whose membership has nowbeen increased to five. And for those negotiations to bemeaningful  they must proceed on the basis of clearunderstandings. In the first place  if the negotiations areresumed  the three-point ECOWAS negotiating agendamust remain the agenda of such negotiations. Then theymust be time-bound. If they are open-ended  the regimecan be expected to filibuster and to spin them outindefinitely in the hope that it will achieve a creeping defacto recognition by the international community.Then  the junta’s delegation must always be led bythe junta leader himself. The Committee of five shouldinsist on no less  because if the regime’s delegation is ledby anyone else  the scope for subsequent repudiation anddouble-dealing will become infinite. Finally  to ensurethat the regime treats the negotiations with the seriousnessthey deserve  existing international pressures andmeasures must not only be maintained but furtherstrengthened. In that way the genuineness of the regime’sdeclared intention to negotiate will be tested.When all this is done and an agreement is reached we will still have to face the task of achieving genuineand total national reconciliation. What Sierra Leone needstoday more than anything else is peace and reconciliation.I have never lost sight of this need  and it is the oneobjective which has influenced every step that I havetaken since assuming office in March 1996. The events of25 May have only further deepened those divisions within11our society which my policies had begun to heal. As aresult  the adoption of a more vigorous policy of nationalreconciliation has become an absolute necessity.It would not be exaggerating the case to say that thebrand of political persuasion practised by the military-RUFcoalition borders on systematic genocide. Since 25 May1997  whole villages  entire communities and targetedfamilies have been wholly or partially decimated in theeastern  northern and southern provinces of Sierra Leone in Moyamba  Bonthe  Sanda  Bumpe  Kumrabai Foredugu — the list is endless.That is why many Sierra Leoneans strongly believethat a war crimes tribunal should be appointed to try allthose who had a hand in the making of our tragedy. Iunderstand the feelings behind this demand  but I reject it.l reject it because it will add to our already grave problemsand postpone lasting national reconciliation.Throughout this address I have tried to draw adistinction between elements of the army in complicity withthe head of the junta and the bulk of the army  who arebasically decent men and women and loyal to the besttraditions of the Sierra Leone army. Even so  I do notbelieve that any worthwhile national purpose will be servedby a policy of reprisals against the misguided elements ofthe army and others in the junta’s camp.We seek no more from the United Nations than theassurance of 6 August 1997 contained in the statementmade by the President of the Security Council:“The Security Council will  in the absence of asatisfactory response from the military junta  be readyto take appropriate measures with the objective ofrestoring the democratically elected Government ofPresident Kabbah.” (S/PRST/1997/42  p. 1)At the same time  we are asking the Security Councilto assist ECOWAS and the ECOWAS Monitoring Group(ECOMOG) in giving practical effect to that objective. Bydoing so  the Council will not only be saving the lives ofthe people of Sierra Leone  but will also be averting anescalation of the crisis which now threatens peace andsecurity in our subregion. And here I should like to takethis opportunity to express  on behalf of my Governmentand the people of Sierra Leone  our sincere appreciation tothe Heads of State and the Committee of Foreign Ministersof ECOWAS for their efforts over the past four months inpursuit of their objective  which the Security Councilsupports.Once the objective of restoring the democraticallyelected Government is achieved  my Government will  inthe same spirit of reconciliation which had guided itspolicies since the 1996 elections  consider  in anappropriate forum  the serious question of security andfull implementation of the Abidjan Peace Agreement.Security is paramount. Without security  no meaningfulhumanitarian assistance can reach the people of SierraLeone.Notwithstanding the acts of bad faith initiated by theRUF to derail the peace process and despite thedangerous coalition which had emerged since the 25 Maycoup  my Government  the legal Government of SierraLeone  is committed to the Agreement. We are alsocommitted to the Secretary-General’s plan andrecommendations  submitted to the Security Council lastJanuary  for the establishment and maintenance of apeacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone in connectionwith the implementation of the Abidjan Peace Agreement.We are ready to reactivate my Government’s agendafor reconciliation  resettlement of refugees and displacedpersons  and rehabilitation and reconstruction which themilitary-RUF junta so ruthlessly disrupted almost fivemonths ago. We owe it to our people to continue thetransformation of our economy from emergency reliefprogrammes to realistic projects for medium- and long-term self-sufficiency. Of course  we know that this is notgoing to be easy. However  we are confident that theimmediate and unconditional restoration of myGovernment  the Government elected by the people constitutes the first step towards that transformation."
"146",6308,"SLV",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of the people and Government ofEl Salvador  I should like to convey to you  Mr. President our congratulations on your election to preside over thissession. To your predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  we extend our gratitude for his efforts andinitiatives aimed at making progress in the modernizationof the United Nations.We commend the Secretary-General for hisremarkable work during the first year of his term and  inparticular  for the progress made in reforming the Organization.More than five years after the signing of the peaceaccords in El Salvador  we can state with satisfaction thatwe have fulfilled and achieved the objectives that weagreed to. The far-reaching changes that have taken placein Salvadoran society have received universal recognition as they represent one of the most successfulundertakings of greatest scope carried out with thesupport of the Organization.Our Government’s responsibilities and obligations donot end with compliance with the peace agreements  butcontinue throughout time and space with a view tosafeguarding the achievements that we have registered inthe areas of democratization and respect for human rights and also to meet the priority needs of Salvadoran society.We Salvadorans are dedicated to building a newEl Salvador  attacking at their root causes of poverty andsocial marginalization and promoting a fairer and moreequitable society.The successful conclusion of the peace processes inNicaragua  El Salvador and  recently  Guatemala and theestablishment of democratic Governments have created asituation conducive to regional stability  transformingCentral America into a region of peace  freedom democracy and development. Central America has madegreat progress in demilitarization and in the strengtheningof civil society  holding free  transparent and pluralistelections; integrating former combatants into nationalpolitical processes; strengthening democratic institutionsand the rule of law; and implementing a developmentprogramme whose central focus is the human being.In the face of globalization and the processes ofeconomic openness and regionalization  we need to beeven more creative in tackling present and futurechallenges. For this reason we are reviewing the CentralAmerican institutional system so as to make it possiblefor us better and more effectively to take our place in thenew world order.The aspiration of the peoples of Central America topursue a common destiny through the reunification of ourgreater nation has always been latent among our peoples.It is becoming increasingly clear that unity is the bestroad for Central America to take so that it cansuccessfully tackle the challenges of the comingmillennium. It was in this spirit that on 2 September we22signed the Nicaragua Declaration with a view to speedingup the process of unification. Today we come to share ourresolve to pursue political union in Central America. Wewant the international community and the United Nationsto be witnesses to our efforts  and before them we commitourselves to do all that is within our power to achieve thisobjective. In order to achieve this goal  we ask that friendlycountries and multilateral institutions continue to support usand to provide timely assistance  so that our national andregional efforts can complement one another  and to enableus to have at our disposal an effective mechanism forrealizing our aspirations.I should like to comment on issues of far-reachingimportance on the agenda of the General Assembly that arevital for the Organization itself. We stand convinced thatthe principles of the Organization remain valid and that itis a unique  sui generis institution  essential andirreplaceable in the international system  and that its reformis necessary in order to adapt it to the demands of the newinternational order. With respect to the proposed reformsput forward by the Secretary-General  my Governmentsupports the institutional changes that will be necessary forthe Organization efficiently to respond to the commonproblems faced by our nations.For the United Nations to function better  it must beable to rely on adequate and predictable financial resources.It is the responsibility of Member States to fulfil ourfinancial obligations  which cannot be subject to any kindof conditionality  so as to safeguard the independence impartiality and credibility of the Organization’s activities.Reform of the Security Council is necessary in orderto overcome the imbalances that exist in its currentcomposition. We support an appropriate increase in thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members  so thatthe Council will be representative of the number ofMembers that the Organization now has. These newmembers should have the same rights and obligations andbe designated in conformity with the principle ofgeographical distribution  so as to include developingcountries in both categories. We believe it particularlyimportant to devote attention to the Council’s workingmethods and procedure so as to ensure that the decision-making process is participatory  democratic and transparentand involves effective coordination among all the organs ofthe system.The United Nations was created to be universal innature. Therefore all peace-loving States that accept theobligations enshrined in the Charter should be Members ofit. For this reason  we reaffirm our support for the justaspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan to rejointhe Organization on the basis of the principle ofuniversality  which is the distinguishing mark of theUnited Nations.In conclusion  I wish to state that the people ofCentral America are grateful for the work of the UnitedNations in the process of peacemaking  democratizationand development in Central America. We recognize theefforts that the Organization is continuing to make topromote international peace and security by seeking tosettle conflicts by peaceful means and in accordance withthe principles of international law.On the threshold of a new century  nations are facingtremendous challenges. We invoke the aid of God so thatpeace  freedom and human values may prevail among thepeoples of the earth."
"147",6333,"SMR",52,1997,"﻿It is my honour tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election and to assure youof the fullest cooperation of the delegation of San Marino.May I thank the outgoing President  His ExcellencyMr. Razali Ismail  for his excellent work  and reiterate tothe Secretary-General the best wishes of the Governmentand the people of San Marino for a successful fulfilmentof his mandate. The goals that the United Nations iscalled upon to achieve are important and demanding  butalso stimulating.These are times of great expectations for the UnitedNations  and the Republic of San Marino is determined todo everything within its power to help translate theseexpectations into concrete and effective actions. We mustrecognize that the United Nations has constantly inspired promoted and instilled a greater respect for human rights.It has been building a new law of nations.The United Nations has made it clear that peacecannot be achieved and maintained unless seriousimbalances are redressed and all human beings  by virtueof their fundamental right to dignity  are respected andnot discriminated against because of their diversity.Equally essential are access to progress and developmentfor all; the equitable utilization of our planet’s resources;and the avoidance of mere exploitation and abuse  whichwould jeopardize our future beyond repair.Although in recent decades conflicts no longer breakout on a worldwide scale and in some cases take placewithin national boundaries  they nonetheless continue to5claim innocent victims  cause incalculable damage andundermine economies  especially those of the lessdeveloped countries. Indeed  the instruments of war havechanged. They have become increasingly sophisticated anddestructive and more easily produced and spread. Just thinkof anti-personnel landmines; it has been estimated thatmillions of them have been placed throughout the worldand that for each cleared mine  50 new ones are laid.In this connection  I stress the urgent need for allStates to accede to the recently drafted Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transferof Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.As regards the fight against terrorism  San Marino isfollowing with great attention the work of the Ad HocCommittee charged with drafting an InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Theproliferation of violence and crime  which have becometransnational  demands an adequate response by theinternational community.With reference to drug trafficking  San Marino isparticularly active in the field of prevention. This year  ourGovernment launched the “Youth Project”  which consistsof a series of initiatives organized by  and dedicated to young people  with the purpose of stimulating them toexploit their creativity and potential in a constructive way.In this regard  San Marino supports the Secretary-General’sproposal to convene a special session of the GeneralAssembly in June 1998 on the traffic in illicit narcoticdrugs.San Marino acknowledges that the Rio Conferenceindeed constituted a milestone in the history of our planetand revealed the magnitude of environmental degradationon Earth. Yet San Marino has observed with bitterness thatconcrete initiatives have fallen short of expectations. Thiswas confirmed by the recent special session of the GeneralAssembly on the review of Agenda 21.Worthy of praise is the Secretary-General’s proposalto revitalize the Trusteeship Council by entrusting it with amandate of collective environmental safeguard. Theenvironment is a priority concern for the Republic of SanMarino. At the local level  a project is being undertaken forthe monitoring of the territory which involves students ofvarious school grades under the coordination andsupervision of teachers. This project aims to enhance ourcitizens’ awareness of the fact that environmental protectionis the responsibility of each and every individual.In the field of the prevention and suppression ofchild abuse  San Marino signed the Convention on theRights of the Child and believes that the adoption ofdecisions aimed at defending children against any form ofaggression  including sexual abuse  is of paramountimportance.San Marino continues to support the fight againstcapital punishment  in keeping with the fact that it wasthe first European country to abolish it in the mid-nineteenth century  and it urges other Member States toadopt concrete measures to eliminate the use of the deathpenalty.And we must not forget the exodus of the manyrefugees who are fleeing their countries because of war hunger or in the pursuit of the better future to which theyare entitled.San Marino  which boasts a tradition of greathospitality towards refuge-seekers  is deeply concernedabout the situation observed in refugee camps and theirimpact on local populations. We are grateful to the HighCommissioner for Refugees  who daily fulfils thisdemanding task with efficiency.The United Nations is adjusting to the process ofchange by establishing the conditions for a concreteresponse. Its structure  organization and functioning mustbe on exactly the same wavelength as the new reality  andmust be strong enough to face the challenges of thepresent — and those  even more demanding  of thecoming third millennium. For this reason we appreciatethe work already done by the Secretary-General and urgehim to continue this essential process of renewal of theOrganization.The United Nations reform package proposed by theSecretary-General is a good basis for a realistic andeffective response with a view to reaching the lofty goalsof the Organization: peace  social and economic progress and safeguard of the rights of both individuals andpeoples. Member States will be able to focus better onthese goals by solving  first of all  the United Nationsfinancial crisis. To do this  a new and more equitablescale of assessments is necessary  along with cost-cutting the elimination or reduction of bodies and services whereappropriate  and  most important  the avoidance of overlapwith other organizations  including at the regional level.Small countries are particularly aware of this issue  sinceit is increasingly difficult for them to guarantee their6participation and contribution — and not only in financialterms.San Marino has given great attention to all proposalsfor the reform of the Security Council put forward bynumerous countries during the debate. All of them areequally important and constitute an essential basis for theformulation of well-considered  comprehensive solutions.However  it is essential that participation in the conceptionand implementation of this restructuring not be confined tolarger States. The future configuration of the UnitedNations should reflect a community of 185 countries  eachand every one of them independent and sovereign accordingto the principles of universality and equality. Those areamong the reasons that have led San Marino to support anincrease in the number of non-permanent seats on theSecurity Council — though  and I stress this point oncemore  this is not the only issue.The reform of the United Nations does not consist ofbeing present in major or minor bodies  but rather ofshaping the future together through the understanding participation  awareness  involvement and support of all.We shall shape a future where universal peace isguaranteed and safeguarded by the United Nations.San Marino is convinced that the United Nations mustfulfil both a monitoring and a protecting mandate  on theone hand in favour of individuals whose rights andfreedoms are limited or denied by their own States  and onthe other in favour of those countries  especially smallerones  whose development could be hampered or influenced.In this regard I wish to underline how all countriesand the United Nations itself could benefit from the roleplayed by small States  which can make a significantcontribution to major issues as well  since they have nomilitary  political or economic interests but rather a heritageof ideals  culture and traditions to safeguard.May these objectives be fully attained as the UnitedNations approaches the third millennium."
"148",6449,"SUR",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation ofSuriname  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. I am convincedthat under your wise and able guidance our deliberationswill be fruitful. May I express our appreciation for theexcellent manner in which your predecessor  AmbassadorRazali Ismail  presided over the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly.I also take this opportunity to convey our profoundadmiration of and gratitude for the dynamic leadership ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in pursuance of thenoble objectives of this unique world body in this era inwhich new challenges and opportunities face humankind.We salute his efforts to bring our Organization more in linewith the pressing demands of our time.When we express our feelings of solidarity with theless fortunate of the world  our sympathy also goes out tothe Government and the people of the sister island ofMontserrat as they suffer the consequences of a geologicdisaster in these dismal days of their history. The importantsupport that the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)countries  within their limited possibilities  have given toMontserrat to help alleviate the pain merits recognition andis worth following. I therefore seize this opportunity toappeal to other countries to fulfil their moral obligations toour brothers and sisters in need.Within the context of an increasingly integrated andcomplex global economic system of production anddistribution  trade liberalization and globalization offinancial markets  the major thrust of the developmentstrategy of the Government of the Republic of Surinamelies in the revitalization and strengthening of production andexport capacity as the main engines of growth whilemaintaining financial and monetary stability.In response to the need to diversify the export base ofthe economy  a good deal of impetus was given this year tothe expansion of the mining sector by the recent opening ofan oil refinery that will enable my country to meetdomestic demands for heavy oil  by new gold-miningoperations and by the commercial exploitation of othermineral deposits. Furthermore  we have initiated theconstruction of two important bridges. Together with therehabilitation of vital infrastructure  including access roadsin the coastal area and to the interior of the country and theoperation of a ferry service with our neighbouring country the cooperative Republic of Guyana  these bridges willoffer new opportunities for trade  house construction transport  tourism and employment in Suriname.It is often said that progress in building lastingdemocracies and stronger market economies isincreasingly threatened by slow growth  weak institutions poverty and wealth inequality. Persistent economichardships for the majority of the people can likewisedamage the credibility of democratic Governments. Thestruggle against poverty and social injustice is thereforethe greatest challenge to the Government of Suriname.In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achievepeople-centred development goals  the presentGovernment  within the international constraints ofsustainable development and environmental protection will continue its endeavours to increase domesticefficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture production  manufacturing and export  as well as tostrengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship  witha view to ensuring political stability and fosteringequitable economic growth.Bearing in mind that which has been referred to asthe dark side of the globalization process  and with a viewto avoiding marginalization and creating outsiders to theglobal economy  it is imperative that we continue torecognize the small  fragile and vulnerable economies ofthe Caribbean  including Suriname  and of other regionsin the world. This should guarantee that they will begiven special treatment during a transitional period inwhich they will still require exceptions  waivers and othertransitional arrangements in the broader context ofinternational trade liberalization and economic integration.Hence the Surinamese Government attaches specialsignificance to the May 1997 Bridgetown Declaration ofPrinciples on Caribbean Community-United Statescooperation in responding to the challenges that the newmillennium poses for our region  and it is looking forwardto an expeditious implementation of the Plan of Actionappended thereto. We also attach great importance to thetimely implementation of the Programme of Action forthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and are looking forward to the 1998 review sessionof the Commission on Sustainable Development onoutstanding chapters and issues of the Programme ofAction.The Government of Suriname welcomes the call ofthe United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs for a6renewed and concerted international commitment to aforward-looking drug strategy for the twenty-first centuryand  to that end  the convocation of a special session of theGeneral Assembly in June 1998. That session will preparea global drug-control strategy and new ways to promoteinternational and regional cooperation in the fight againstthe worldwide drug problem that undermines in particularthe economic and social prospects of many smalldeveloping nations.While Suriname cannot be considered a drug-producing country  it is afflicted by this scourge throughproducers from outside the country who misuse its territoryas a transit point for drugs bound for other countries  wherethe availability and extensive use of drugs is creating ahuge  profitable market that threatens the well-being of somany and feeds the greed of but a few.To demonstrate our resolve to eradicate this evil fromour territory  we will join with neighbouring countries tocoordinate our strategies and efforts. For that purposeSuriname will convene  at the beginning of 1998 and inconcert with Guyana  Brazil  France and Venezuela  aninternational conference on defining strategies and actionsagainst the misuse and illicit trafficking of drugs. Weappeal to those who are also committed to this struggle toassist us in this endeavour.Reflecting on our special session on theimplementation of Agenda 21  the Government of Surinameapplauds the adoption in July of this year of the Programmefor the Further Implementation of Agenda 21  including thestatement of commitment by Member countries. We expectthe next comprehensive review of its implementation in theyear 2002 to demonstrate greater measurable progress inachieving sustainable development.The Government of Suriname feels concern about theissue of finance for sustainable development. Since Rio1992  only four developed States have fulfilled theirAgenda 21 commitment towards the target of providing 0.7per cent of their gross national product as officialdevelopment assistance. As it was agreed that for mostdeveloping countries official development assistance is stilla main source of external development financing and cannotgenerally be replaced by private capital inflows  I shouldlike to urge the donor community to intensify efforts toreverse the declining trend in official developmentassistance as we experience it today.The situation in the Middle East continues to pose agreat threat to international peace and security. The Osloagreement of 1993  signed by the two parties  embodiesthe hope that a lasting solution to this conflict is withinreach  since it establishes the basis for a lasting peace inthe Middle East. We feel that the peace process must becarried on urgently  with a well-defined timetable. Wetherefore support the co-sponsors of the peace process intheir effort to bring the parties back to the negotiatingtable with a view to securing durable peace in the MiddleEast.Allow me to make a few remarks on the importantissues of the reform and strengthening of the UnitedNations and of more equitable representation in theSecurity Council. Since its birth  our Organization hasgrown from 5 to 185 Member States  but the SecurityCouncil still reflects the world as it was in 1945. TheGovernment of Suriname therefore underscores the needfor an expansion of  and a more equitable representationin  the membership of the Security Council.The reform of the Security Council should not onlymake the Council’s membership more representative andmore legitimate but should also enhance its transparencyand openness towards other Member States and non-members in order to convey its important messages in anamplified and more effective manner. Hence we welcomethe recent measures taken by the Council to enhance itstransparency.The present Government of Suriname takes theposition that the countries of the Caribbean and LatinAmerica should be included in any agreed expansion ofthe Council  within the context of the principles ofequitable geographic distribution and the sovereignequality of States. The reform should not result indiscriminatory treatment between the developed and thedeveloping countries. We furthermore consider as integralparts of Security Council reform its expansion  the reformof its working methods and the issue of the veto. Theveto should preferably be restricted to issues falling underChapter VII of our Charter.Increased globalization and the emergence of newchallenges and threats require closer cooperation betweenStates at a global level. Within this context  it is ofutmost importance to reaffirm and maintain the role of theUnited Nations as a major actor in cooperation betweenStates  especially development cooperation. In this light my Government welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General to propose a comprehensive reform programmeto the General Assembly which is geared towardsstrengthening the efficiency of the Secretariat and fixing7a stronger focus on economic and social developmentissues.The Government of Suriname supports in general thereform proposals of the Secretary-General and their keyelements. These reform proposals as a whole represent atimely and welcome initiative  given the fact that in today’sworld the need has progressively increased for globalcommon action on a number of pressing problems  such asthe eradication of poverty  humanitarian emergencies refugee problems  climate change and desertification diminishing official development assistance funding  drugs nuclear disarmament  the implementation of Agenda 21 democracy and the maintenance of peace and security invarious regions of the world.All this calls for a stronger United Nations to promotea renewed multilateral cooperation based on commoninterests and shared responsibility. We must empower theUnited Nations now so that it can confront the globalchallenges of the twenty-first century.One of the best ways to re-establish trust in the UnitedNations is to enhance the impact of United Nationsdevelopment activities at the country level. In this regardthe Surinamese Government endorses the proposal toestablish a “United Nations House”.In closing  I wish to reiterate that the Government ofthe Republic of Suriname is committed to contributing tothe ongoing process of reform of our Organization.We see the reform proposals of the Secretary-Generalas a first step in the right direction  although much more isleft to be done. We feel that the United Nations systemshould be made stronger  more effective and more efficientin order to meet the priorities set by all its Members — notjust the priorities of the economically strong and themilitarily powerful but  especially  the priorities of the weakand vulnerable States  which should be prevented frombecoming outsiders in the global economy."
"149",6473,"SVK",52,1997,"Mr. President  at theoutset  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I also wish to thank your predecessor  Mr.Razali Ismail  for his excellent work during the last sessionof the General Assembly.The ongoing session of the General Assembly iscrucial in terms of showing the capability of the UnitedNations to react adequately to changes in the global sceneafter the end of the cold war  mainly in connection withproblems humankind faces on the eve of the newmillennium. We all know that if the United Nations is tomeet the expectations and needs of the new era  it must gothrough a process of reform. The Slovak Republicwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report (A/51/950) entitled“Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform”and supports his endeavours to streamline the work of theOrganization in order to achieve greater unity of purpose strategic deployment of resources  coherence of efforts andflexibility in response.The suggestions included in the Secretary-General’sreport reveal a firm determination to transform the UnitedNations into a centre which takes an active part ingoverning international relations  in accordance with itsmain principles enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. Though one of the basic goals of the reform isto streamline the work of the Organization  along withcost-saving  the latter should not be the final goal of thereform  since this approach itself does not lead to thestrengthening of the United Nations system. Any reformof the Organization which would lead to a weakening ofits position is not acceptable.The financing of the United Nations is necessarily anintegral part of its reform  since continuation of thecurrent financial crisis has a grave impact on theperformance of the Organization. We believe the principleof honouring legal obligations — in this case  thepayment of assessed contributions — should be a basisfor any solution to be adopted  although we understandthat a number of countries are in arrears to theOrganization because their rates of assessment do notreflect their capacity to pay.Slovakia belongs to a small group of countries —so-called good contributors — having paid its regularbudget contributions in full and on time this year. Withregard to our peacekeeping- budget assessment  theGeneral Assembly decided to allocate Slovakia to groupC of Member States for the period 1993 to 1996. We continue to believe that there is no need to limitthis decision strictly to such a short period. Speaking interms of capacity to pay  Slovakia simply belongs to groupC of the Member States. For this reason  the GeneralAssembly should no longer postpone its decision on thepermanent allocation of Slovakia to group C of the MemberStates for the financing of United Nations peacekeepingoperations. We expect that the General Assembly at itsfifty-second session will take a decision confirming thepermanent presence of Slovakia in this group. It was alsoon the understanding of the difficult financial situation ofthe United Nations that Slovakia  on the eve of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly  paid in full itsarrears to the peacekeeping budget for the period 1993-1996.The maintenance of international peace and securityremains one of the main priorities of the United Nationsand peacekeeping operations are a key instrument availablein this regard. As experience in recent years has shown  theability to respond quickly with adequate mandate andmeans is a prerequisite to the successful completion ofpeacekeeping operations. The Slovak Republic fullysupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to build up theUnited Nations standby arrangement system and to establisha rapidly deployable mission headquarters team. We areready to participate actively in this system whileconsidering the allocation of appropriate means.Post-conflict peace-building is of crucial importanceshould a conflict resolution achieve lasting results. In recentyears  the reconstruction of a conflict-torn society hasinvolved a variety of actions. Many actors have beenengaged in this process while lacking integratedcoordination. Therefore  we welcome the decision of theSecretary-General to make the Department of PoliticalAffairs the focal point for defining objectives  criteria andoperational guidelines in this regard  as well as his intentionto strengthen the role of a special representative of theSecretary-General to be responsible for the implementationof peace-building initiatives in the field. At the same time in our view  it is still necessary clearly to define thecompetence  interaction and feedback between theDepartment of Political Affairs and the specialrepresentative of the Secretary-General.The contribution of the Slovak Republic to the workof the United Nations rests first of all upon the concretefulfilment of the primary purposes of the Organization  suchas the maintenance of international peace and security.Slovakia has been currently contributing its troops andmilitary observers to the United Nations TransitionalAdministration for Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and WesternSirmium (UNTAES) in Eastern Slavonia and to theUnited Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)in Angola. It also takes active part in the work of theSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations  of whichit became a member in April this year  and thuscontributes to the improvement of the planning andcontrol system of United Nations peacekeepingoperations. On this occasion  I can state with fullresponsibility that the Slovak Republic is interested in andis ready to continue contributing to United Nationspeacekeeping operations.Experience has proven that small and mid-size Statesare capable of bearing their part of the responsibility forstability and security in individual world regions. In thisconnection  the Government of the Slovak Republic hasdecided to present its candidature for a non-permanentseat in the Security Council for the term 2000-2001. Webelieve that the candidature of the Slovak Republic  whichis not currently a member and has no representative inany of the principal United Nations organs  can win thesupport of the Member States in order to increase therepresentativeness and democratic nature of this body.Along with the reform measures initiated andundertaken by the Secretary-General within hiscompetence  a discussion of important issues that residewithin the jurisdiction of Member States is under way. Anumber of stimulating as well as antagonistic opinionsreflecting the complexity of the process have beenformulated. The most evident example of this is thequestion of Security Council reform. It is in all ourinterests that the Security Council’s composition anddecision-making procedure reflect the significant changesthat have taken place on the international political sceneduring the last three decades. The Security Council’sreform should result in an enhancement of its legitimacyand representativeness  while maintaining its ability toreact promptly.In our view  a new geopolitical situation on theglobal scene should be reflected in a new concept of theSecurity Council. Apparently  a decisive part of thegeneral membership is not ready for such a step andpolitical circumstances have not sufficiently matured. Atthe same time  the efforts aimed at restructuring theSecurity Council within a predetermined timetable  evenin the absence of a general agreement  might becounterproductive. Since Security Council reform is anextremely important and sensitive issue for the furtherexistence of the Organization  Slovakia prefers a2continued and thorough discussion in this regard without anartificial acceleration of the whole process.The change of priorities in international politics afterthe end of the cold war  in particular the utmost necessityto solve various socio-economic problems  seems to haveshifted arms control and disarmament issues out of sight.Concerned about this negative trend  we feel thatdisarmament should again be given priority in the UnitedNations agenda.Recently  the Slovak Republic  as a new member ofthe Conference on Disarmament  was honoured to chair thatunique multilateral disarmament forum. We are convincedthat the Conference on Disarmament must play a further indispensable role in solving the most important issues ofinternational security  stability  peace  arms control anddisarmament.Besides the opening of concrete negotiations on theprohibition of the production of fissile materials forweapons and other explosive devices  we find especiallyimportant the question of a global and comprehensive banof anti-personnel landmines. We understand the efforts tobring this issue to the Conference’s agenda and the Ottawaprocess to be fully complementary. We highly appreciatethe agreement on the text of the Ottawa convention reachedrecently in Oslo.The Slovak Republic has been continuously engagedin a number of activities that contribute to the alleviation ofthe consequences of the use of anti-personnel landmines.Reflecting the provisions of the Ottawa convention on theprohibition of anti-personnel landmines  we would like tooffer our assistance in mine-clearance programmes byputting at the United Nations disposal a mine-clearance unitthat would follow up on the very successful performance ofthe Slovak Engineer Battalion in former Yugoslavia.We welcomed with satisfaction the conclusionsreached at the first session of the Preparatory Committeefor the Sixth Review Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).It is important that the technical and formal approach to thework of the Preparatory Committee has been altered  thusestablishing favourable conditions for the success of theReview Conference.The Slovak Republic  which uses nuclear energysolely for peaceful purposes  has supported all stepsdesigned to lead to the elimination of nuclear weapons.As one of the 44 countries needed to ensure theConvention’s entry into force  the Slovak Republic isprepared to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) before the end of this year. I would alsolike to state that Slovakia has been honoured to chair thePreparatory Commission for the CTBT Organization.This year’s entry into force of the ChemicalWeapons Convention can undoubtedly be considered themost significant event in the field of disarmament. TheSlovak Republic has been striving to strengthen theConvention through its active approach to the work of theOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.We are proud to state that some of the Organization’sinspectors were trained in facilities provided by theSlovak Republic. We are interested in continuing theseactivities in order to help the Organization fulfil itsverification and preventive functions.Support for economic and social progress is one ofthe basic missions of the United Nations. We welcomethe creation of a new Department of Economic and SocialAffairs  and we believe that this will lead to its furtherstreamlining and efficient performance. The Organizationis a unique forum that can facilitate close cooperation andpartnership for development among Governments  civilsociety  the private sector and regional and globalorganizations.The role of the Economic and Social Council  as setforth 50 years ago in the United Nations Charter  needsto be revised. In a time of changing social and economic-development philosophy  it is necessary to strengthen thepolicy-management and coordination roles of theEconomic and Social Council  as well as its position inthe macroeconomic-policy-coordination dialogue. Thereform of the subsidiary bodies of the Economic andSocial Council and the rationalization of their structure work and functions require  in our opinion  a carefulapproach  one to be taken with full respect for theirautonomy while aiming at their further rationalization andconsolidation. The steps taken so far by the Secretary-General in this field are pointing in the right direction.Slovakia  as a member of the Commission onSustainable Development and the Governing Council ofthe United Nations Environment Programme  devotedconsiderable attention to the nineteenth special session ofthe General Assembly. Although the special session hasnot brought the expected results  we consider it an3important step in the global discussion on the strengtheningof the principles of sustainable development.We look forward with anticipation to the specialsession of the General Assembly on drugs. That session which will be held next year  should yield concrete resultswith regard to combating the production of and traffickingin narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As we allknow  drugs pose a real threat  mainly to youngergenerations.Since the Slovak Republic’s establishment as anindependent State  it has been participating actively in thework of one of the most important multilateral developmentbodies  namely  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP). Slovakia has been a member of theUNDP Executive Board since 1993. The UNDP regionalcentre for Central and Eastern Europe was established inthe Slovak capital  Bratislava  in June of this year. Thecreation of this centre is a concrete example of theachievement of United Nations reform  in this instance ofUNDP’s efforts for decentralization at the country level andcutting the burden of administrative costs. The centre’sfoundation has been actively supported by Slovakia  anduse has been made of my country’s advantageous positionas a bridge between UNDP secretariat activities atHeadquarters in New York and UNDP efforts in thecountries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth ofIndependent States region. We are convinced that thepresence of the UNDP regional centre in Bratislava willenable Slovakia to be even more active in developmentcooperation within the United Nations development group.Human rights are a matter of the highest priorityamong the activities of the United Nations. Slovakiastresses the need for the consistent implementation ofrelevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard wesupport the role of special rapporteurs appointed to selectedcountries where systematic human rights abuses occur. Weacknowledge the results the special rapporteurs haveachieved in this field.The Slovak Republic supports the ambitious proposalsfor restructuring United Nations institutions dealing withhuman rights in order to create effective conditions forimproved protection of human rights. In this connection  weconsider it appropriate and necessary to harmonize theactivities of the Commission on Human Rights with thework of the relevant expert committees established pursuantto international human rights treaties. At the same time  theSlovak Republic supports the creation of effectiveconditions for tripartite cooperation among Governments the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.Human rights abuse has been the cause of a numberof conflicts in many places on our planet  which are oftenfollowed by a humanitarian crisis on a massive scale.Women and children are the most fragile sectors of anyafflicted population. We must not forget this fact whilepursuing the purposes of the United Nations.I believe that the United Nations reform process willbe successfully completed in next few years. I find theSecretary-General’s programme for reform to be animportant step in this regard. The Slovak Republic isprepared to contribute to this process so that the UnitedNations can approach the next millennium as a modern viable  global body with the adequate authority to fulfilthe purposes embodied in the United Nations Charter."
"150",6498,"SVN",52,1997,"﻿Please allow me at the outset Sir  to express my sincere congratulations on your electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession. The expectations of this session are great and thetasks demanding; however  your experience and politicalwisdom are a guarantee that they will be fulfilled.I would like to take this opportunity to thank HisExcellency for Razali Ismail  Ambassador of Malaysia  forhis energetic and successful presidency of the fifty-firstsession.Almost two years have passed since we  Heads ofState and Government of the United Nations MemberStates  confirmed our commitment to the idea of reformin this very Hall. This reform should contribute to theaccomplishment of the mission of the United Nations inthe current international situation as well as to greaterefficiency of the Organization. Today  we have before usa comprehensive set of proposals by the Secretary-General in “Renewing the United Nations: A Programmefor Reform” (A/51/950). This document proves that thediscussions held within the last two years  and theexperience gained in recent decades  have helped the newSecretary-General to prepare  within a few months concrete proposals providing a basis for further decisions.Slovenia joins those who have expressed theirappreciation to the Secretary-General for the impressivework he has performed in the first months of his mandate.This work has included concrete measures for thefunctioning of the Secretariat and proposals for reform.We are well aware  however  that the responsibility nowlies with us. We  the representatives of the Member Statesand the peoples of the United Nations  are responsible fordecisions that will give impetus to the necessary reformsand enable the Organization to deal with the tasks of thecoming century.Our approach should not be based primarily oncalculations of what individual Member States might gainfrom the reform. It should above all be based on anassessment of how to reform the Organization so that itwill better serve all of us. This will be possible only ifthe Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basictasks — the maintenance of international peace and securityand comprehensive economic and social development particularly in developing countries — and to ensure broadrespect for the promotion and protection of individual andcollective human rights.Another important requirement for the success of thisreform programme is for the United Nations to take itsdecisions promptly and on time. The past years have madepossible all-round discussion about reform. And now is thetime for decisions: Slovenia believes that major decisionsshould be taken during the first part of the present sessionof the General Assembly. The President of the GeneralAssembly will play a significant role with regard to thosedecisions that cannot be postponed. We fully support andencourage you  Sir  in your assumption of an active roleand in your determined management of the decision-makingprocess.Slovenia supports the proposals contained in theSecretary-General’s report on a programme for reform. Thisproject deserves all our attention and assistance. Its mainvalue is that it offers the possibility of concrete decisionswhile remaining open to new ideas and proposals.The proposals for promoting sustainable development defined as a priority task by the Secretary-General himself deserve careful examination. The impression is that theseproposals are headed in the right direction  although cleareranswers to questions on development financing will berequired. The “development dividend” created by thestreamlining of the Secretariat will not be able to provideall the answers we need. Concrete proposals will be neededto define more accurately the tasks of the proposed officefor development financing  which would encourageinnovative means of mobilizing new financial resources fordevelopment.Slovenia agrees with the suggestion of the Secretary-General that human rights should be integrated into allprincipal activities of the United Nations  such as peace andsecurity  economic and social affairs  developmentcooperation and humanitarian affairs. This approachpromises a significant improvement in the activities of theUnited Nations in these areas. It would also lead toincreasingly comprehensive United Nations activities in thefield of human rights.Respect for human rights is achieved not only throughthe functioning of instruments to monitor compliance withinternational treaties but also through political  social andeconomic measures that allow human rights to become anintegral part of social development and a part of theeveryday life of each individual. Observance of humanrights must be closely linked with the promotion of socialprogress and the eradication of poverty in order to securehuman dignity  essential social security and development.Furthermore  this would substantially contribute to theelimination of political tensions and of the root causes ofthreats to international peace. Should the United Nationsfail to ensure respect for human dignity and the protectionof human rights  its basic mission will not be fulfilled.The new High Commissioner for Human Rights willcertainly assume an important role in the search forsolutions to salient issues. We note with pleasure that itis Mrs. Mary Robinson  until recently the President ofIreland  who has been appointed to this post. Mrs.Robinson has already won worldwide recognition  and wewish her every success and look forward to her proposalsfor improvements in the field of human rights.Reform of the Security Council constitutes animportant part of the reform of the United Nations. Theperiod following the end of the cold war only reconfirmsthe importance of the effective functioning of themechanisms of collective security. However  it also callsfor changes in the composition of the Security Counciland for the improvement of its working methods.Slovenia is committed to a reasonable and balancedincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanentmembers of the Security Council  to a restriction on theuse of the veto and to greater transparency in thefunctioning of the Council. It is our hope that thediscussions on Security Council reform  which have beengoing on for several years now  will lead to appropriatedecisions that have the genuine support of themembership of the United Nations.Slovenia also endorses the approach taken by theSecretary-General in the field of disarmament.Disarmament has been one of the priority goals of theUnited Nations since its foundation. We have good reasonto be satisfied  since disarmament efforts have registeredconsiderable progress with respect to weapons of massdestruction. The Chemical Weapons Convention  signedfour years ago  entered into force this year. We expect itto be implemented effectively  although this will befeasible only if the Convention is ratified by all theremaining countries  particularly those disposing of largestockpiles of chemical weapons or of resources for theirproduction.2The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the conclusion of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year haveconsiderably reduced the dangers created by nuclearweapons. But the time has come to take further steps. Weneed to ensure universal adherence to the ban on nucleartests and to accelerate negotiations for the ban on theproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons.Endeavours towards the reduction of nuclear-weaponarsenals should be intensified in order to ensure theirgradual elimination.I wish to place special emphasis on the importance ofthe early adoption of the international convention on acomprehensive ban on anti-personnel landmines and theirdestruction. Slovenia has joined those countries that havealready renounced their use  transfer and production  andhas been participating actively in the Ottawa process sinceits inception. Negotiations concerning these issues have justbeen brought to a successful conclusion at the diplomaticconference in Oslo. Early in December of this year Slovenia will join those who intend  in the presence of theSecretary-General  to sign the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transferof Anti-Personnel Landmines and on Their Destruction.Disarmament efforts constitute an important elementin the strengthening of international security. The formationand implementation of the regional arms control anddisarmament regimes represent an effective mechanism instrengthening security. The experience gained during theBalkan crisis  which posed the most serious threat to peacein Europe since the foundation of the United Nations strengthens our belief that lower armament thresholdsshould be imposed. More weapons can only present greatertemptation and danger.None of the endeavours aimed at modernizing theOrganization by providing relevant answers to global issueswill have any guarantee of success if the United Nationsproves unable to contribute to the solution of those crisissituations that pose a threat to international peace and thatgenerate humanitarian problems. These situations are nowassuming larger dimensions than in any other period ofUnited Nations activity to date. The credibility of theOrganization and the functioning of its main bodies must berepeatedly proven. Special importance in this respect mustbe attached to the activities of the Security Council  which in accordance with the Charter  bears primary responsibilityfor the maintenance of international peace and security.Today  expectations regarding action by the SecurityCouncil are more realistic than they were several yearsago. However  they are no less demanding. The SecurityCouncil is taking an active part in issues concerninginternational peace on the African continent. It has provedits ability to apply a variety of the methods that are at itsdisposal in accordance with the Charter. These includepreventive diplomacy  cooperation with the Organizationof African Unity  classic peacekeeping operations and theuse of measured and focused economic sanctions. Theappropriate choice of these methods has enabled theSecurity Council to formulate relevant approaches to thesituations in Liberia  Angola and Burundi. As for someother crisis areas  including the Republic of the Congo the most appropriate approach still remains to be found.The Security Council is also participating in settlingissues which arise after the military conflicts. In Europe the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides anexample of such involvement. Following the conclusionof the Dayton agreement  which halted the war  thesituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has stabilized to acertain extent. Yet peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina isstill far from secure. The return of refugees is proceedingslowly  is limited  and is facing hindrances. Theauthorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have not beenfunctioning as stipulated in the peace accord  and theprincipal war-crime suspects have not yet been transferredto stand trial at the International Tribunal for the formerYugoslavia. The United Nations has been performing anumber of important tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina particularly in the areas of humanitarian aid  unarmedcivil police activity and criminal prosecution. The scopeof the present engagement of the United Nations inBosnia and Herzegovina is  however  is in proportion withthe increased coordination of action taken in Bosnia andHerzegovina by other international organizations. At thesame time  success in those fields falling within thecompetence of the United Nations is of criticalimportance for the establishment of lasting peace.Let me take this opportunity to stress that theinevitable starting point for solving the crisis in Bosniaand Herzegovina is the precise identification of the natureof that devastating war  which has not been completelystopped. If there is a lack of willingness to identify thereasons for and the nature of the war  and its aims andprotagonists  then the healing will inevitably be a lengthyand expensive process  with many risks to human life andproperty. One must even envisage the possibility that thesearch for peace might prove unsuccessful.3The activities underway in Bosnia and Herzegovinahave assumed the character of a post-conflict action  buttheir aim is also a preventive one. Experience gained inrecent years has shown that conflicts often re-emerge in theabsence of appropriate preventive action of a diplomatic economic or  if necessary  military character. The time towithdraw the international forces from Bosnia andHerzegovina will have to be considered very carefully.Withdrawing too early could lead to a recurrence of theinitial situation of instability or of armed conflict.An example of successful preventive actionrepresenting an important lesson for the future has beenprovided by the international operation in Albania this year.Operation Alba was conducted on the initiative and underthe leadership of Italy  in agreement with the AlbanianGovernment and with the authorization of the SecurityCouncil. That operation has shown how quick anddetermined action taken by a group of countries in thevicinity of the emerging crisis situation  and with theauthorization of the Security Council  can prevent armedconflict and potential destabilization in the region. Sloveniatook part in that successful operation and is ready toparticipate in other preventive actions  as well as in otherpeacekeeping operations. That readiness has been confirmedby the decision of the Security Council to include aSlovenian contingent in the peacekeeping operation inCyprus.The recent international action in Bosnia andHerzegovina and Albania  as examples of regional crises demonstrates the importance of the participation of regionalorganizations; such a role has been played by theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Slovenia’s readiness to contribute towardsimplementing the objectives of the United Nations has alsobeen manifested by the candidature of Slovenia for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 1998-1999 in the elections to be held at the General Assembly ina few weeks’ time. Slovenia has confirmed its role as aState that has been successfully coping with the issues ofdevelopment and of good-neighbourly relations. Within thescope of its possibilities  it has also been striving for long-term stabilization of the situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina and in the region at large. Through this actionand its other international activity  Slovenia has proved tobe a factor for peace and stability in Europe.As a Member of the United Nations  Slovenia isactively participating in the discussion on reform  includingthe issue of reform of the Security Council. Our readinessto contribute  in practice  to the work of the SecurityCouncil has been manifested by our cooperation in thepeacekeeping operations in Albania and in Cyprus. Andlast but certainly not least  Slovenia has been paying itsmembership contributions to the regular budget and to thepeacekeeping budget in full and on time.As a candidate for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council  we undertake in the event of ourelection to observe the principles of openness andtransparency of action  and will strive to strengthen theties between the Security Council and rest of themembership of the United Nations.May I in conclusion reiterate again the importanceof this session of the General Assembly and of thedecisions to be taken. We have arrived at a stage wherewe may see the crystallization of solutions that willprepare the United Nations to cope with the tasks of thenext century. It is our responsibility to formulate thesesolutions in a sufficiently clear and comprehensivemanner  and in that way provide for the viable future ofour common Organization. I firmly believe that we  thepresent generation  will be able to preserve the UnitedNations as it was created by our forefathers in theturbulent time at the end of the Second World War  as anOrganization committed to the principles of peace cooperation  development and respect for human dignity."
"151",6543,"SWE",52,1997,"﻿I sincerelycongratulate the Foreign Minister of Ukraine Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly  a most crucial taskwhich I trust he will execute in a most productive andcreative manner.Let me also record my admiration and praise for theway in which his predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail performed his demanding mission during the whole of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly. He laid aunique foundation on the basis of which we must nowmake advances towards a better United Nations.I refer to the statement made yesterday by theForeign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of all20members of the European Union; my Government fullysubscribes to that statement.On the threshold of the new millennium  profoundchanges are affecting the lives of nations and individuals.Many are benefitting from open international relations.Others feel marginalized politically and economically. Andall too many countries are still threatened by persistentpoverty  social injustice and domestic strife.We need a strong United Nations to counter theseforces  which separate nations and tear them apart. We needa renewed United Nations to focus on the tasks for whichit was established  and to meet the new challenges of todayand of tomorrow.This is why we need fundamental United Nationsreform: not piecemeal improvements  but major change.This is why Sweden wholeheartedly endorses the reformproposals presented by the Secretary-General. We give oursupport as an active participant in all spheres of UnitedNations activity and as a major contributor to itsdevelopment funds and programmes.United Nations reform is not a cost-cutting exercise.Its aim must be to make the Organization strong  effectiveand efficient  focusing on its core activities and ready tomeet its future challenges. The Swedish Governmentsupports the proposal that efficiency savings should be usedfor development.The United Nations cannot be reformed under thethreat of political and financial crisis. It is simply notacceptable that Member States should set conditions forfulfilling Charter obligations. The Swedish Governmenturges all debtors — including the main debtor  the UnitedStates — to settle their accounts before the end of this yearand to pay their assessed contributions in full  on time andwithout conditions.Securing a sound and viable financial basis must be anintegral part of reform efforts. The idea of establishing arevolving credit fund could be considered as an emergencystep. We should also enact measures to reverse the currenttrend of late payment. Article 19 of the Charter should beapplied more strictly. It is also time to agree on a new scaleof assessments based on capacity to pay. A realisticproposal has been presented by the European Union.We  the Member States  should provide politicaldirection for the reform process. We should take an overallview of United Nations reform  and avoid getting trappedin details. We are fully aware that there will be furthersteps: reform is a process  not a one-time event.Today  I will emphasize the need to strengthen andreform the United Nations in four key areas: peace andsecurity  sustainable development  human rights  anddisarmament.First  the United Nations must be strengthened andreformed to effectively prevent and settle armed conflicts.This is the purpose for which the Organization wasestablished. This is where success or failure willultimately be determined. Long-term prevention shouldaddress the root causes of conflict: poverty  socialinjustice  oppression and violations of human rights. TheUnited Nations world conferences have established theclose relationship between security and development. TheUnited Nations must continue to build on this politicalplatform.Conflict prevention is a task which requirescoordinated action by the United Nations system as awhole  including the international financial organizations and also by non-governmental organizations. Cooperationat the regional and subregional levels is increasinglyimportant for building a security environment based oncommon values and norms.It is equally urgent to strengthen the ability of theUnited Nations to act on the threat of an erupting conflict.The whole range of United Nations instruments  includingthose mentioned in Article 33 of the Charter  should bedeveloped and used to their full potential. Sweden wishesto cooperate with other Member States to enhance theUnited Nations capacity for early warning and earlyaction. The new generation of peacekeeping operationsmust combine political  military  humanitarian and civilianUnited Nations action  and strike the right balancebetween various forms of response. The United NationsHumanitarian Coordinator plays a key role in fostering aresponse to humanitarian crises. This should lay thegroundwork for post-conflict reconstruction and long-termrecovery of war-torn nations.The Swedish Government supports efforts to set upa rapidly deployable mission headquarters within theUnited Nations. Together with Austria  Canada  Denmarkand Norway  we are creating the multinational Stand-byForces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG) to enhancethe United Nations capacity for rapid deployment. Inmany situations United Nations civilian police can helpprevent conflict and restore ravaged societies. I therefore21appreciated the opportunity I had  during Sweden’spresidency of the Security Council in July  to deliver apresidential statement on civilian police in peacekeepingoperations. It calls on Member States to make qualifiedpolice quickly available to the United Nations throughbetter and standardized training.We need a global security architecture: a web oforganizations capable of dealing quickly with a wide rangeof threats and potential conflicts. Regional organizationswill further gain in importance. But the primary and overallresponsibility remains with the United Nations. Conflictprevention  peacekeeping  peace-building and humanitarianaction to protect the victims of conflicts have to be at thecore of United Nations reform efforts. But the decisivefactor will not be the instruments with which we equip theOrganization  but rather our willingness to use them  to payfor them and to accept the authority of the United Nations.My second theme is that the United Nations must bestrengthened and reformed to combat poverty and promotesustainable development. Fighting poverty  supportingsustainable development and promoting economicintegration are part of the Organization’s mandate as set outin the Charter. Sweden sees this crucial task as being in itsown best interest. Our own development has benefitedmuch from the multilateralism of this century.The Swedish Government wholeheartedly supports theproposals of the Secretary-General to reform the UnitedNations in the economic and social fields. We want anempowered and capable United Nations. We want a unifiedUnited Nations presence in the field so that the UnitedNations system can be a reliable and flexible partner fordeveloping countries. We want long-term commitmentsfrom donors and more equitable burden-sharing forfinancing development.Sweden is one of the four countries fulfilling theUnited Nations aid target. Over a three-year period  by theyear 2000  we undertake to further increase our aid budget challenging the international trend. In spite of a fewdifficult years  we have kept up our voluntary contributionsto the multilateral system. In the coming years we foreseeincreases. To support debt relief for the poorest countriesthe Swedish Government will contribute 295 millionSwedish Krona to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries DebtInitiative.One of the greatest challenges facing the internationalcommunity in the coming years will be to achieve globalsustainable development. The industrialized countriesmust take the lead and learn how to do more with lessinput of resources and energy. Our goal should be to useenergy and raw materials 10 times more efficiently. Inour efforts to combat climate change  the developedcountries should  this December in Kyoto  agree to reducethe emission of greenhouse gases.My third theme is that the United Nations must bestrengthened and reformed to protect and promote humanrights. Sweden applauds the Secretary-General’s steps tointegrate human rights into all United Nations activities.We welcome the appointment of the distinguished MrsMary Robinson as High Commissioner for Human Rights.Next year the United Nations will celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. This historic document establishes the individualas a subject in international relations  with her or his ownrights and aspirations. Violations of human rights are alegitimate concern for the international community.The Human Rights Year 1998 will be an opportunityfor celebration  but also for critical assessment. Weshould reform human rights machinery and strengthenassistance in this field. The implementation ofinternational human rights standards must be improved.Public information and fact-finding on human rightsviolations are crucial. It is particularly important toexpose any attempt by Governments to silence those whobravely stand up in defence of human rights and basichumanitarian principles in their own countries.Sweden will continue to work hard to combattorture. We will stand firm in our rejection of the deathpenalty  wherever practised. It is an abhorrent practice unworthy of our times.Cooperation must be enhanced to eradicate sexualabuse  exploitation and trafficking in children and women.Governments need to take firm action againstdiscrimination based on gender  ethnic origin or religiousbelief.Next year’s diplomatic conference will be amilestone in the decades-long endeavour to establish aninternational criminal court. The court will play a crucialrole in closing the gap of impunity for those who commitgenocide  serious war crimes and systematic or large-scalehuman rights violations.My fourth and last theme is that the United Nationsmust be strengthened and reformed to build security22through disarmament. Disarmament  non-proliferation andarms control are central features of any policy aimed atpreventing conflict  promoting peace and fosteringeconomic and social development. They must become fullyintegrated elements in a coordinated policy for peace-building.The 1990s have seen impressive progress towardsdisarmament  but much work lies ahead. The internationalpolitical and security climate now offers a historicopportunity. It must be fully translated into concreteactions.It is imperative that the quest for a nuclear-weapon-free world continue. Sweden urges the Russian Federationto ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks II (START II) enabling the conclusion of START III. This should pave theway for further reductions  on the part of all nuclear-weapon States  with a view to the total elimination ofnuclear arsenals  in accordance with Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).The Canberra Commission on the Elimination ofNuclear Weapons has proposed a series of measures toachieve a world free from nuclear weapons. Its reportmerits in-depth consideration in international disarmamentforums. Let me focus on two timely aspects.The Commission proposes that nuclear forces shouldbe taken off alert and that warheads be removed from theirdelivery vehicles. I urge the United States and Russia toapply these measures without delay to all strategic weaponscovered by START II  and subsequently by START III.Nuclear-weapon-free States have a legitimate right toassurances that they will not be attacked or threatened bynuclear weapons. The time has come to elaborate a legallybinding instrument under the NPT  giving such assurancesto non-nuclear-weapon States Parties.Conventional arms — especially light weaponry — areat the heart of today’s conflicts. They aggravate tensions provoke and prolong wars and inflict human suffering —sometimes long after ceasefires and peace settlements. Theflow of conventional arms to areas of tension and conflictmust be stemmed. I welcome the high priority given tosuch objectives in the Secretary-General’s reformprogramme. There is a need for export control ofconventional arms as well as of dual-use products.International cooperation in this field and the demand for aninternational code of conduct for arms transfers are mattersof high priority for the Swedish Government.From a humanitarian point of view  anti-personnellandmines are in a category of their own: indiscriminateby nature  crippling innocent children  women  men andnations. I am proud to say that Sweden was the first Stateto propose a total ban on this terrible type of weapon. Iwarmly welcome the Oslo agreement on a convention onsuch a ban. I urge all States to accede to it. We must nowmake every effort to achieve universal adherence to thisban.Reform is necessary to build a stronger and morerelevant United Nations. I have outlined some majoraspects from Sweden’s point of view. As I haveemphasized  but must not look at United Nations reformin isolation  we must consider why we need theOrganization and what it can do for all of us through allof us.Today’s international environment is rife withcontradictions. We have a globalized economy  but wealso have a periphery unable to benefit  and left furtherand further behind. We have ever closer internationalcooperation  but we also have aggressive nationalism andxenophobia. We have growing support for democracy andhuman rights  but we also have atrocities and blatantdisregard for international law.In this situation  the purpose of the United Nationsshould be precisely what is spelled out in its name and itsCharter: to unite nations and people."
"152",6581,"SWZ",52,1997,"﻿I bring with me from the Kingdomof Swaziland the warm greetings and best wishes of HerMajesty the Indlovukazi  the Government and the wholeSwazi nation  to our friends and fellow Member States hereat the United Nations.On behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland  may Icongratulate you most sincerely  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession. We are confident that the wisdom  experience anddiplomatic skills that you bring to the office will ensuresuccess in the many issues facing this session.Swaziland would also like to commend the work ofyour predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail  whopresided with such skill over the deliberations of the fifty-first session.The Kingdom of Swaziland would like to place onrecord its deep appreciation for the work of Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali during his tenure as our Secretary-General.Much was achieved during the five years of Mr. Boutros-Ghali’s leadership  and the whole world owes him a hugedebt of gratitude.We would like further to welcome our newSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has shown in hisfirst year that he has the vision and qualities effectivelyto lead our Organization into the twenty-first century. Allof us in Africa are proud of what he has achieved in sucha short time.One of the main challenges facing our Secretary-General is the reform of the United Nations into a cost-effective  accountable  credible  well-managed and fullyrepresentative Organization.Swaziland gave its full support to the initial Track 1proposals put forward by the Secretary-General. Inparticular  we supported the various initiatives designedto reduce administrative costs in favour of increasedefficiency in the development programmes in the field.We trust that the welfare of those affected by thenecessary cuts has been carefully considered.We have also welcomed the Track 2 reforms announced in July  and again  we support the Secretary-General’s proposals on economic and social reform development cooperation  humanitarian relief and humanrights.We believe that the Secretary-General’s address at thefirst meeting of the general debate struck exactly the rightnote of wise optimism. The responsibility now lies with theGeneral Assembly to support the Secretary-General’s boldapproach  and the Kingdom of Swaziland urges its fellowMember States to back the proposals and allow the reformsto forge ahead.One area of reform that will have a major impact onthe openness and accountability of the United Nationsdecision-making process is the question of the membershipand expansion of the Security Council  in particular theneed for greater representation of the developing worldamong the permanent members.The Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the updatedAfrican Common Position  which calls for  among otherthings  membership in the Security Council to be based onan equal geographical formula  on a regional or continentalbasis. This would make the Council more democratic andensure that all Members would feel fairly and equallyrepresented in our Organization’s most influential body.Africa believes that the continent should have at leasttwo permanent seats  with full voting and veto rights  torepresent the views and concerns of the other 51 countries.These two permanent seats would be appointed through themechanism designed by the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  following the established traditional practice inforce.At the heart of the debate on overall United Nationsreform is the question of finances. Most of the reformsinitiated by the Secretary-General are aimed at making theOrganization more cost-efficient and accountable and atallowing more of our finances to be available for theprogrammes in the field. This is a timely and necessaryinitiative and is deserving of the strongest support of allMember States.These reforms also justify the recommitment of allMember States to keep up to date with their dues. TheKingdom of Swaziland has consistently tried to maintain agood record in fulfilling its financial obligations to theUnited Nations. We pledge to do our best to continue tokeep up to date  and we would urge all our fellow MemberStates to show similar confidence in  and support for  ourOrganization.The Kingdom of Swaziland would also like to addits voice to the appreciation expressed to Mr. Ted Turnerfor his extraordinary display of confidence in ourOrganization. His act of generosity  from the privatesector  reflects a new spirit of optimism in the UnitedNations  and we would call on others with the resourcesto do so to follow Mr. Turner’s example.Hopes for future global stability have been raised bythe various initiatives for reducing the numbers andspread of nuclear weapons and warheads.The Kingdom of Swaziland in particular commendsthe commitment of the United States of America and ofRussia to the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START)programmes  whose implementation will contributesignificantly to a more peaceful world for futuregenerations.We are also encouraged by the global support for theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and for theChemical Weapons Convention  both of which have beensigned by the Kingdom of Eswatini.All these initiatives are important indications of thereal commitment of almost all countries to promoteinternational peace and security. We fully support theSecretary-General’s proposal to create a new Departmenton Disarmament and Arms Regulation as a necessaryaddition to the Organization.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support allmoves to bring about a total ban on the production  useand sale of all types of landmines. We participated at therecent Oslo negotiations on anti-personnel landmines andwelcomed the signing of the treaty.We regret  however  that not all countries could beparties to the treaty  while understanding the reasonsbehind their decisions. We sincerely hope that a way canbe found soon to achieve universal agreement on thiscrucial humanitarian issue.As a consequence of situations of instability on ourborders  we have experienced first hand the terror oflandmines  and we have great sympathy for all who haveundergone the suffering associated with them. We alsowatched with great admiration the efforts of the lateDiana  Princess of Wales  to bring to the world an2awareness of the horrors of these indiscriminate tools ofwar. We therefore call on all Member States to support theinitiatives aimed at ending for ever the threat of all types oflandmines.The Kingdom of Swaziland views with great concernthe situation in the Middle East and in particular thestrained relations between the Israeli and Palestinian people.The climate of reconciliation and hope inspired by the Oslopeace accord has given way to suspicion and dread. It isclear that the international community must continue tosupport the peace initiative as the only way forward andmake every effort to bring the two sides back to thenegotiating table on a basis of mutual trust and confidence.The Kingdom of Swaziland supports the efforts of allwho are trying to achieve a breakthrough in this area. Wecall on the Israeli Government and the PalestinianAuthority  for the sake of their own people  to find a wayout of this apparent deadlock and return to the spirit ofcompromise which prevailed during the Oslo negotiations and which held out the promise of lasting peace.The Kingdom of Swaziland has been encouraged bythe recent developments in Northern Ireland  with all-partytalks on the future of that troubled province at last underway. We commend the determination of the British andIrish Governments to involve all stakeholders in thenegotiations  and we call on all involved to make everyeffort to ensure that these negotiations lead to lasting peaceand stability.The continent of Africa continues to experiencesituations of instability and conflict which have unfortunateeffects on all of us who call it our home. In the past 12months we have seen crises in Sierra Leone  the Congo andthe Comoros islands  and the continuation of problems inmany areas and countries such as the Great Lakes region the horn of Africa and Angola.The Kingdom of Swazilandprays for the many millions caught up in the violence ofthese and other situations of instability on our belovedcontinent  and continues to support efforts to find peacefulsolutions.At the same time  we welcome a number ofencouraging events on the continent  in countries such asLiberia  where United Nations efforts towards peace overthe years contributed significantly to the elections earlierthis year.We applaud the peaceful nature of that process and we hope and pray that lasting  sustainable peace has atlast come to the Liberian people after so many years ofconflict.And we commend the appointment by the Secretary-General of Personal Envoy Mr. James Baker to overseethe situation in Western Sahara. We are most encouragedby developments in this long-running dispute  and welook forward to a lasting resolution in the near future.In the light of continuing instability on much of ourcontinent  one practical measure undertaken by the wholeAfrican community has been the recent initiatives by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregionalorganizations  such as the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and our own Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC)  to become betterprepared to cope with our continent’s crises using theresources available to maintain peace in our region. Oneelement of this has been the training and preparation ofAfrican peacekeeping forces for deployment throughoutthe continent. The Kingdom of Swaziland has pledged itscommitment to provide troops for such forces  onceadequate training and preparation have been completed.We should like to record our appreciation to theUnited States of America for its African Crisis ResponseInitiative  which is focusing a number of Africancountries  including the Kingdom of Swaziland  on therequirement for such things as standardized procedures training and equipment. It is clearly essential for this typeof peace force initiative to have the support of theinternational community and for the OAU to maintainclose cooperation with the United Nations in our jointattempts to provide adequate policing of crisis situationsin Africa.For almost 30 years the Kingdom of Swaziland hasenjoyed excellent relations with a nation which  despite anoutstanding record in international developmentassistance  and while fulfilling all the requirements formembership of our Organization  is nonetheless excludedfrom participating in the activities of the United Nations.I am referring to the issue of the Government of theRepublic of China on Taiwan.In October 1971 the United Nations adopted aresolution which withdrew membership from the Republicof China. That resolution has the effect today of denyingthe rights of almost 22 million people to be representedhere in the United Nations  and to contribute to all theglobal initiatives undertaken by our Organization.The Kingdom of Swaziland has been in a position torecognize and experience at first hand the peace-lovingnature of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its3willingness to help foster peace and prosperity throughoutthe world. The Government and people of the Republic ofChina have made enormous advances in economic  socialand political terms  and have shown themselves ready andable to share their experience and advice with all thenations of the world.Many countries and political groupings over the yearshave also recognized the need to involve the Republic ofChina on Taiwan in global development activities  throughthe offices of the United Nations and its agencies. There isalso a growing voice of international opinion  including inthe European Parliament  the American Congress andamong many countries on all five continents  thatmembership of the United Nations is necessary for the hugeresources and wealth of expertise of the Republic of Chinato be put to the best possible use for the benefit of allmankind.One of the founding and guiding principles of ourOrganization has been that of universality  of granting allpeoples of the world the right to belong to the UnitedNations and to be heard in our chambers. It is a reality thatalmost 22 million people believe that that right is denied tothem  by virtue of their country's exclusion from theactivities of the one truly global development Organization.The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore proposes to its fellowMember States that the time has now come to review theresolution of 26 years ago. We believe that there is anurgent need to re-examine this issue  taking into account theprofound changes in the situation that have occurred since1971.The Kingdom of Swaziland has viewed with concernthe recent report of the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development  which highlighted once more theeconomic plight of the developing world. Globalization andliberalization are economic principles with which we allagree  but not at the expense of a greater concentration ofwealth in the developed countries and an increase inpoverty amongst the underdeveloped.It is all very well to quote the long-term benefits oftrade liberalization  but we must understand the severeshort-term penalties for those countries which are leastprepared to meet them. The Kingdom of Swazilandunderstands very well what is required of us in a world offree trade  in terms of becoming a producer of finishedgoods and services in a manner which will allow us tocompete effectively and on an equal basis with the rest ofthe world. But for us to achieve the growth and standardsof technology and production required  we and the rest ofthe developing world need the understanding and supportof the developed countries in what will be very difficulteconomic times ahead.To meet this economic challenge  the Kingdom ofSwaziland is continuing its efforts to develop in asustainable manner  and to create an environment inwhich our people can prosper. We have been followingup recent national initiatives designed to address ourshort- and long-term social and political challenges and toenhance the right conditions to allow our private sector tocontinue to be the engine for growth. We have justcompleted our latest national development strategy  whichwill set out Government priorities for the next 25 years.Our own internal restructuring programme is continuing and Government has begun a series of short-termmeasures to improve the economy.The Kingdom of Swaziland is a developing nationwhich is largely dependent on agriculture for its survival.In common with other Member States in our position  wecontinually find ourselves at the mercy of Mother Nature and in particular we are dependent on adequate rainfall.Our economy is only just recovering from the devastatingdrought of 1991 and 1992  and now we have learned withgreat dismay that the dreaded El Niño is once morepresent in the Pacific Ocean. If true  this will have thegravest consequences for all of us in southern Africa. TheKingdom of Swaziland has learned the lessons of the lastdrought  and we have begun a programme of damconstruction throughout the rural areas. But the threat ofa renewed period of reduced rainfall has come much toosoon  and we hope for the support once more of ourOrganization and our fellow Member States.In addition to addressing its economic concerns  theKingdom of Eswatini has also begun a review of thenation's Constitution. In response to the call by the Swazipeople for a fundamental and far-reaching review of ourexisting Constitution  a Commission has been establishedand is in the process of conducting a constitutionaleducation programme  reaching even to the most remoteareas of the country.This will be followed by a period of submissionsfrom everyone in the Kingdom  after which a constitution in accordance with the wishes of the whole nation  will bedrawn up for national approval.It will truly be the people's constitution  since theprocess allows the free participation of all Swazis.National participation in important matters such as these4is a crucial guiding principle of the Swazi people and  overthe years  has ensured the peace and stability we havealways enjoyed.We have welcomed the encouragement and support forour constitutional review process from the internationalcommunity  including the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme office based in the Kingdom. We are confidentthat  with the involvement of all Swazis  we will producea document reflecting the wishes of the whole nation  onethat will serve us well for generations to come.There is much vital work to be done in this fifty-second session of the General Assembly. The Kingdom ofEswatini believes that our Organization is at a majorcrossroads in terms of its own development. We have theopportunity now to carry out the correct reforms and ensurethat our Organization is equipped to face the many globalchallenges that lie ahead in a more efficient  accountableand open manner. We must choose our steps carefully andwisely. Those for whom we are responsible — ourpeople — look to the United Nations to provide the globaldevelopment leadership that we so desperately need. Wecannot afford to fail them.On behalf of Her Majesty the Indlovukazi  theGovernment and the whole Swazi nation  it is my proudduty to reaffirm the commitment of the Kingdom ofSwaziland to the Charter and principles of the UnitedNations. May God watch over the Assembly's deliberationshere in the coming months and guide it in its decisions."
"153",6614,"SYC",52,1997,"﻿I take this opportunity to congratulate you  Sir on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session.I wish also to thank your predecessor  AmbassadorRazali of Malaysia  for the skill and commitment withwhich he guided our work during the last session.I convey to the Secretary-General and his staff myhigh appreciation of the often difficult initiatives theyhave taken this year to promote peace not only betweenpeoples but also within nations. These initiatives accentthe Organization’s role and its principles  to which I ampleased to reaffirm the commitment of the people ofSeychelles. There have also been initiatives to promotedevelopment and to protect the environment and the weakamong us  and to help stateless individuals and refugeesfrom countries that are often marginalized.We need a consistent  effective United Nationsbacked by the funds necessary for it to carry out itsmandate. The Secretary-General has proposed a series ofreforms along these lines  and the Republic of Seychellesfirmly backs that initiative.Seychelles is a small island State. Yet we have doneall in our power to integrate ourselves fully intointernational life and into the world economy. In thatconnection  Seychelles has requested membership of theWorld Trade Organization; it is already a member of theIndian Ocean Commission and the Common Market forEastern and Southern Africa  and recently joined theSouthern African Development Community. Seychelleshas thus adopted an open economic policy designed to beattractive; yet we continue to face the handicapscharacteristic of an island State  exacerbated by a lack ofhuman and natural resources and by the limits of ourdomestic markets.Following the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  held inBarbados in 1994  and in accordance with resolutionsadopted in international forums  the international6community is heeding the appeal of small island States forhelp in laying and strengthening the foundations ofsustainable development. Like larger countries  small islandStates have the same aspirations  the same needs — andeven more so. Yet they are disadvantaged by their greatlylimited means and their structurally fragile economies. Thatis why it would be more equitable to identify specificcriteria that would integrate them harmoniously into theprocess of global cooperation and economic developmenton both the bilateral and the multilateral levels.Recently  Seychelles has experienced remarkableclimatic setbacks. Unceasing torrential rains of unusualintensity have caused loss of life  flooding  landslides andthe destruction of homes and of infrastructure of all kinds.They also threaten the environment on which our lifestyledepends and our ecosystem  especially in coastal areas.For a small State striving to keep pace withdevelopment  an unexpected upheaval  with all its economicand other consequences  can have far-reaching effects thatare not immediately evident.I should like to take this opportunity to thank theDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs for having quicklydispatched an evaluation mission to take stock not only ofthe damage done but of the future threats such an upheavalposes  given the climatic change under way on a globallevel. Moreover  that mission was followed by thelaunching of an appeal to the international community forassistance. The people of the Seychelles are very gratefulfor all these actions.In conclusion  I should like to express the hope thatthe future of our planet will bring vast improvements notwithstanding the numerous difficulties that loom on thehorizon. The United Nations  through its initiatives and thejoint efforts of all peoples  will most surely achieve thatgoal."
"154",6656,"SYR",52,1997,"﻿I take pleasure in congratulating the Presidenton his election to preside over the fifty-second session ofthe General Assembly and to congratulate his friendlycountry on his election to that high international office. Weare confident that his wide-ranging expertise will facilitatehis task and lead the deliberations of this session to asuccessful end.I should also like to thank his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail  for his wise leadership of theprevious session of the General Assembly.On this occasion I cannot fail to renew mycongratulations to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and to Africa  his great continent. I wish him fullsuccess in discharging his tasks in accordance with theprinciples and purposes of the Charter.Although more than 50 years have elapsed since theadoption of the Charter of the United Nations  andalthough States have since committed themselves to peacein their international relations  many regions of the world particularly in the Middle East  continue to sufferoccupation  aggression and the threat of aggression to apoint where the sounds of war have begun to drown outthat of peace.It has now become clear to most of those concernedwith peace and security in various corners of the Earththat the peace process initiated at the Madrid Conferencesix years ago has reached a dead end. This is due to thevolte-face by the current Israeli Government vis-à-vis thatprocess  including the commitments  agreements andpledges stemming from it. It is also due to its cynicismtowards all the strenuous international efforts seeking  forthe first time in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict  toachieve a comprehensive solution to this conflict.Perhaps many of us  Governments as well aspeoples  cannot foresee the extent of the seriousrepercussions that will result from that Israeli reversal onthe peace process  particularly since it is taking place inthe post-cold-war period  when wars and armedconfrontations have taken ugly and barbaric forms andhave often raged out of control. Syria  which has optedfor the achievement of peace in the Middle East on thebasis of justice and dignity as a strategic choice  findsthat it is duty bound to train a spotlight from thisimportant international rostrum on some facts concerningthe positions of the current Israeli Government. Thisshould enable the international community  with thesponsors of the peace process foremost among them  tobeware of any serious developments in the future leadingto undermining the security and stability of the MiddleEast region and beyond.As a preliminary observation  I must point out thatin our reading of the policy of the Israeli Government wedo not proceed from the perception widely held aroundthe world which classifies it as an extremist ZionistGovernment bent on negating the other party to theconflict rather than making peace with it. We proceedmerely from an objective description of declared positionsof the Israeli Government and from its practices on theground  which — at a minimum — aim at graduallybacktracking from the commitments and agreementsreached by the parties during the peace talks andultimately at completely eradicating the peace processlaunched at the Madrid Conference.20It seems to us that the method now employed by theIsraeli Government to reach that objective is not the usualone of one step forward  two steps back. It is now a newpractice  a tactic of one step back  then two steps back followed by a threat of a further step backwards whichcannot be abandoned  even provisionally  until the otherside accepts new conditions it had already rejected. Thus the peace process regresses until it ultimately cancels itselfout.In this context  some may find it unfairly prejudicialto the Israeli Government to characterize its practices insuch terms. They would  however  be surprised to learn thatthe Head of the Israeli Government himself boasts to hisinner circle of employing such a tactic  which he believesis a very astute means of ending the peace process asunobtrusively as possible.This does not stop at the modus operandi alone  butextends to the details of the very fundamental issuesunderpinning the peace process. While acknowledging theapplicability of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973) to the occupied Syrian Golan  he alsosimultaneously rejects the results reached on the Syriantrack  with the participation of the United States as sponsor on the basis of those resolutions and relating to withdrawalto the line of 4 June 1967. He further rejects the resumptionof negotiations from the point at which they were halted.It is also strange that the Israeli Government rejectsthe formula of land for peace  though it is at the very coreof the United States initiative and has always enjoyedinternational unanimity. Instead of accepting this formula the head of the Israeli Government advances others thatneither common sense nor logic could entertain and thatcannot stand the test of time  such as the formula of peacefor peace or peace for security. It is clear that acceptingthese two Israeli formulas would be tantamount to surrenderand to becoming an instrument at the service of Israel’ssecurity.It is indeed true that security issues are of the utmostimportance to all States  peoples and individuals. That isnot in doubt. However  security is the fruit of peace; theachievement of peace brings security and not vice versa.Proceeding from that  we believe that the IsraeliGovernment  in giving priority in its policy to security overpeace  runs counter to all the concepts defined by societiesand warring States throughout history. It is no exaggerationto say that the insistence of the Israeli Government on itserroneous concept of achieving security before endingoccupation will turn the peace process into a bloodlettingprocess  a cycle of killing that will obtain neither securitynor peace for Israel and may return the Arab-Israeliconflict to its tragic beginnings.The Charter of the United Nations states that theefforts of the peoples of the world must be concerted inorder to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar. Respect for the commitments proceeding from theprinciples of international law and its sources lies at thevery heart of the Charter. It is regrettable that the IsraeliGovernment does not realize that its failure to respect thecommitments reached with the previous Government onthe Syrian track  based on the principles of internationallaw and relevant Security Council resolutions  does notrepresent a mere legal violation. First and foremost  itcasts doubt on the credibility of any previous IsraeliGovernment  and such doubts thus apply to thecommitments made by the current Administration whenit is replaced.Since coming to power  the Israeli Government hasnot limited its positions to undermining the peace process.It has chosen the exact opposite path to that of peace. Ithas increasingly diversified its attacks against Lebanon; ithas bombed cities teeming with civilians and has plantedexplosive devices in many parts of southern Lebanon inorder to incite enmity among the Lebanese and castaspersions on the role of the Lebanese resistance.However  such attempts  contrary to Israel’s objectives have only solidified unity among the Lebanese. They havestrengthened the resolve of the Lebanese resistance toconfront Israeli occupation more than ever before. In theoccupied Palestinian territories  the pace of settlementactivities has escalated  including a sharing of rolesbetween the Israeli Government and extremist settlers  inorder to expropriate more land  destroy homes andmaintain the drive to judaize East Jerusalem.In our occupied Syrian Golan  the policy ofentrenching Israeli occupation has also been escalated tothe point that the Israeli Knesset recently voted on a billentrenching the occupation and impeding withdrawal fromthe Golan  in clear defiance of Security Council resolution497 (1981). This has been accompanied by anintensification of Jewish settlement activity with the aimof swelling the numbers of settlers in the Golan andundermining the chances for peace. That is a flagrantviolation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the firstadditional Protocol thereof. The Golan is Syrian land —it always was and always will be. The Israelis will haveto leave it sooner or later.21We  the Arabs  have championed just andcomprehensive peace and consider it a strategic choice. Forsuch a choice to be realistic and supported by the people it requires full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied SyrianGolan to the line of 4 June 1967  as well as from southernLebanon and the western Bekaa  in implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978). It must guaranteethe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people including those to self-determination and their ownindependent State.Syria has always stressed its keen wish to establish anuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Syria onceagain expresses its grave concern at the serious obstaclethat Israel has placed on the road to that goal in order toprevent the establishment of the zone by refusing to adhereto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). This intransigent Israeli position does great harm tothe credibility and universality of the Treaty. We believethat the measures and arrangements to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  as called for byUnited Nations resolutions  require Israel  the only State inthe region possessing nuclear facilities and stockpiles  toadhere to the NPT and place all its nuclear establishmentsunder the full-scope safeguards regime of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency. It must further destroy its entirestockpile of nuclear weapons.At a time when the urgent need to intensifyinternational efforts towards a just and comprehensivepeace in the Middle East is very clear  some States of theregion are engaging in military cooperation similar to analliance and have recently declared their intention toconduct military manoeuvres in the eastern Mediterranean.Such manoeuvres would be a threat to the peace and safetyof neighbouring States as well as to the stability of theregion.Syria supports all the efforts being made to eliminatetension in various regions of the world and to resolvestanding problems. In this context  Syria underlines itsconcern for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Syriacalls for easing the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq while Iraq is required to implement the remaining SecurityCouncil resolutions in a manner ensuring a just solution tothe issue of Kuwaiti prisoners.We also hope that there will be a positive response tothe initiatives of the League of Arab States and theOrganization of African Unity  as well as towards theflexibility shown by the Libyan Government to resolve theLockerbie crisis. We would also like to see the embargoagainst Libya — a fellow Arab country — lifted  as wellas an end to the suffering caused to the brotherly Libyanpeople by that embargo.Syria supports measures to guarantee peace andsecurity in the Korean peninsula. We also wish to expressour support for the aspirations of the Korean people forreunification. We further hope that serious efforts will bemade to provide assistance to the Korean people toovercome its economic crisis.Syria stresses the need to take the necessary steps assoon as possible to lift the economic  trade and financialembargo which has been imposed on Cuba for more than30 years.Syria is following with concern the severe conflictsafflicting some African countries. We call on theinternational community to make the necessary efforts andto endeavour to find solutions to these disputes  in closecooperation with the Organization of African Unity  inorder to promote peace and stability on the Africancontinent. The international community is further calledupon to provide assistance of all kinds to enable AfricanStates to eradicate the scourge of poverty and achievedevelopment.Among its primary purposes  the Charter of theUnited Nations provides for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security; the fostering betweennations of international relations based on respect for theprinciple of equal rights and self-determination ofpeoples; international cooperation in the economic  social cultural and humanitarian fields; and the promotion ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. It alsocalls for non-interference in the internal affairs of States.The Charter encouraged the establishment of specializedagencies in the field of international cooperation. Itentrusted the General Assembly with setting outregulations governing the appointment by the Secretary-General of the employees of the internationalOrganization. Syria underlines the importance of strictadherence to the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations during the process of reform of the Organizationin order to enable it to respond to the needs andaspirations of its Members in the twenty-first century.We believe that promoting development is amongthe first priorities of the United Nations. There istherefore a need to underscore the right to development.22Syria expresses its concern about any weakening ofthe role and working methods of the General Assembly. Wecall upon the General Assembly to perform its effectiverole in accordance with the Charter.In this context  we believe that the changes in theinternational arena and the significant increase in thenumber of Member States of the United Nations call for areview of the composition and working methods of theSecurity Council. Checks and criteria must be put in placeto prevent the arbitrary use of the veto power. Thus thedemocracy and transparency which are required in itsdecision-making would be enhanced  thereby leading tomore fairness and balance  as well as to non-selectivity inthe implementation of the Council’s resolutions. Althoughthis is an urgent matter  we believe that  in order to reachgeneral agreement on this question  the reforms of theSecurity Council must not be subjected to a specific time-frame.The Secretary-General recently presented his proposalsto reform the United Nations. We appreciate the efforts hemade in preparing his proposals. However  proceeding fromour concern to strengthen the United Nations capacity toshoulder the responsibilities entrusted to it  we would havewished to have seen in the proposals more attention givento the fundamental role of the Organization in promotinginternational cooperation for development. We would haveliked the proposals to exclude any measures likely to affectthose programmes and activities related to developmentissues and poverty eradication in developing and leastdeveloped countries.Human rights are a very important issue  which webelieve must continue to be pursued as an independent issuein order to avoid any overlap with other United Nationsactivities. Such an amalgamation of issues would onlyfurther the opportunities to politicize human rights issuesand their use as a means to exert specific pressures  toimpose preconditions or to intervene in the internal affairsof States.Humanity has pinned great hopes on the UnitedNations  an Organization born of a world war which wasdestructive to great hopes. Humanity entertained theexpectation that the Organization would succeed inoutlawing war  ending all forms of aggression andchampioning the right of peoples to self-determination. Itfurther expected it to succeed in achieving development andin eradicating poverty and underdevelopment.Today  as we stand at the threshold of a newcentury  we all face great challenges which require us tofind the appropriate enabling environment for futuregenerations to live in peace  security and cooperationwithin the context of international relations free ofviolence and confrontation. This is the hope of ourpeoples and this is what we must strive to reach as welook forward to a better future that is more just and morehumane for the benefit of all mankind."
"155",6701,"TCD",52,1997,"﻿Intaking the floor for the first time before this Assembly  Ifeel legitimately proud to be the voice with which thepeople of Chad  its Government and its President  HisExcellency Mr. Idriss Déby  convey a message of peace hope and wishes for complete success in our work.I would like to join the eminent speakers who havepreceded me in reiterating my delegation’s warmcongratulations to the President on his illustrious election topreside over this session. That choice is both a tribute to hiscountry  Ukraine — a country resolutely focused on thequest for global peace — and the culmination of his longcareer as a talented diplomat. He can be assured of thecomplete support of my country  Chad  in the discharge ofhis duties.I would also like to take this opportunity to expressour gratitude to his predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail who has conducted the work of the fifty-first session withtact  competence and devotion.Lastly  I would like to greet our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  a son of Africa who has succeededanother great African  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Theelection of Mr. Kofi Annan is the culmination of abrilliant career devoted to the service of the internationalcommunity. It is an honour to his country  Ghana  and toall Africa. I should like to assure him of the firm supportof the Republic of Chad in his efforts to bring about thenecessary and indispensable reforms of our Organizationso as to make it more capable of achieving the purposesand principles of the Charter in our rapidly changingworld.The ideals of peace  liberty and development  whichare pursued tirelessly by each and every nationrepresented here  are of special significance for mycountry and people. Indeed  drawing upon the lessons ofits sad experiences  since 1 December 1990 Chad hasmade a firm commitment to the establishment of a stateof law and the tireless quest for peace and national unitywhich are the essential foundations for its economic andsocial development.At previous sessions the delegation of Chadregularly referred to positive developments in our country.Today I have the honour and privilege of announcing thatwith the presidential election of 1996 and the legislativeelections held at the beginning of this year  most of ourrepublican and democratic institutions are in place.Projects are under way to hold local elections. All this istaking place in a climate of peace and national harmony.The ongoing quest for peace between Chadians  thenecessary consolidation of the achievements of nationalunity and the willingness to involve everyone in publicadministration have compelled our President  Mr. IdrissDéby  to practise what we call consensual  participatorydemocracy. It follows that all political parties  includingthose of the opposition  are represented in all Statestructures. By the same token  a national mediator hasrecently been appointed.The fifty-second session of the General Assemblycoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. This is the proper place toreaffirm our loyalty to that instrument  which  despite itsimperfections  is  in its own language 14“a common standard of achievement”. (UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  resolution 217 (III) part A  operative paragraph)In Chad we are getting down to work  and significantprogress has been registered. Thus  our independent pressis one of the freest in Africa; human rights organizationsare proliferating and carry out their activities unhindered;and organized civil society is fully playing its role.Despite these noteworthy advances  insidiouscampaigns have been sporadically unleashed against mycountry. For my Government the subject of human rights isnot taboo. Thus  I should like once again to reiterate theinvitation that Mr. Idriss Déby  President of the Republic extended during his last visit to France to all countries andhuman rights organizations that are truly interested in thefate of the people of Chad: to come to Chad and freelylook into the situation.With the return to social peace and political stability my country is turning a new page in its history  one thatshould enable it to face the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. To do that  the Government of Chad has adopteda number of principles that  backed up by concrete actions should make it possible to achieve vigorous and sustainedeconomic growth. The objectives are the following: thecontinuation and consolidation of the process ofdemocratizing political and social life; the increasedparticipation of the citizens in political  economic and sociallife and in making decisions that concern them; theestablishment of sound rules of government; the promotionof the private sector; the development of human resources;and the restoration and safeguarding of environmentalequilibrium and of the ecosystem  with special attentionbeing paid to environmental problems related to humanactivities.This entire development strategy will be presented anddiscussed at the round table on Chad to be held in Genevain the months ahead. That meeting is necessary to reactivateand adapt the plan of orientation covering the period 1990-2000.I take this opportunity to invite all countries andintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations totake part in that important conference on the future ofChad.I should now like to touch on a problem that is ofcrucial importance for my Government: the environment.Chad is a Sahelian country  afflicted  moreover  by droughtand desertification. It is deeply concerned with protectingthe environment  our common heritage  whoseexploitation for us is a necessary condition for success inthe struggle against poverty. This is the appropriate forumin which to express our hope that the results achieved bythe Conference of States Parties to the Convention toCombat Desertification will meet our expectations.The prospect of the exploitation of Chad’s oilresources has led to a systematic disinformation campaignalleging environmental degradation in the regionconcerned. I should like solemnly to state here that allnecessary measures have been taken by the Governmentnot only to preserve environmental balance but also toprevent any risk of accident that could jeopardize it.Another subject of grave concern indirectlyconnected with the environment is that of mines  anestimated 1 million of which infest a large portion of thenational territory  thus precluding any developmentactivities in that region. We would reiterate in this respectthe appeal for assistance in mine clearance that was madefrom this rostrum by President Idriss Déby during thecommemorative meeting on the occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. My Government  avictim of the scourge of mines  welcomes the adoption on18 September last of the Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.The international situation remains alarming  even ifpeace ad security are not gravely threatened at the globalscale. In Africa  despite the hopes born of thedemocratization of the political life of many countries hotbeds of tension still persist. In Angola  implementationof the settlement plan advocated by the internationalcommunity is running aground on obstacles thatjeopardize a final return to peace in this country. We callagain on all parties  particularly UNITA  fully toimplement the Lusaka Protocol.Periodic clashes remind us that in Somalia  thehatchet has not definitely been buried  despite numerousattempts at reconciling the fraternal Somali people.The Great Lakes region is progressively entering aphase of relative calm despite sporadic incidentsstemming from the chain of events that have causedupheaval in this part of the continent. We welcome theconcerted efforts of the international community and ofthe countries of the subregion to help restore a definitivepeace.15In Sierra Leone  the situation resulting from the coupis far from responding to the wishes of the people. Chad for its part  strongly supports the consultations held withinthe framework of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States  and in particular the conclusions of its lastSummit  held in Abuja  Nigeria.In Central Africa  closer to Chad  the exacerbation ofthe conflict in the sister Republic of the Congo  despite theappeal made at Libreville by eight Heads of State on 15September last  is of great concern to us. My country is ofthe view that only an immediate and unconditional cease-fire can make it possible to re-establish dialogue betweenthe two parties. This in turn would make possible a greaterinvolvement of the international community  particularly forthe deployment of a multinational force under the auspicesof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU).The scope of the tragedy of these upheavals on theAfrican continent can be gauged by the number ofhomeless and of refugees who  left to their own devices are wandering from country to country  seeking a land toreceive them where they can live in peace. It is urgent forthe international community to take greater notice of thesetragedies  which concern us all  in order to find appropriatesolutions.This sombre picture of the situation on the continentdoes not eclipse the successes of international and  aboveall  African mediation in crisis and conflict situations  suchas in the Central African Republic and in Liberia. In theCentral African Republic  the painstaking settlement of thepolitical and military crisis to the satisfaction of thepolitical class is  for Chad — a neighbouring  brotherlycountry — cause for satisfaction. Likewise  we welcomethe return to peace in Liberia  which has made it possibleto designate a President of the Republic and a Parliamentby means of free and democratic elections.In both cases  the contribution of Africa was decisive.We are proud of this  just as we commend the SecurityCouncil for its support of various African initiatives. Thiscompels me to urge the acceleration of the process leadingto the establishment of an inter-African peacekeeping force.We also urge the strengthening of existing structures  suchas the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questionsin Central Africa; the Regional Centre for Peace andDisarmament in Africa at Lomé  in Togo; and the OAU’sMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution.With respect to Western Sahara  Chad welcomes thefresh impetus given the process by both parties and hopesthat the settlement plan will shortly be implemented infull.In the Middle East  the Israeli-Palestinian peaceprocess seems to be put to the test  given recentdevelopments in this region. We urge all partiesconcerned to respect the Washington agreements. This isthe only alternative if we are to achieve definitive peacein this region. Neither violence nor extremism  nor certainly  intransigence will allow us to arrive at a justand definitive solution to this crisis  which has gone onfar too long.In Asia  the situation in Afghanistan and inCambodia can be solved only by political means.Therefore we urge the protagonists to gather around thenegotiating table and seek to resolve their differences.Chad welcomes the progress  however slow  that hasbeen registered in recent years in disarmament. Wedenounce  however  the shocking trade in conventionalweapons  which foment so many conflicts that ravagevarious parts of the world  including my country. Wetherefore support the efforts initiated in western Africarelated to the moratorium on the export  import andproduction of small arms.My country reaffirms its unswerving faith in thevirtues of dialogue as a means of resolving conflictsbetween States. I should like in this connection to refer tothe question of the embargo that has so harshly and for somany years afflicted the neighbouring and brotherlycountry of Libya. Chad is in a good position to gauge theconsequences that affect not only the people of Libya butalso the people of Chad  as that country’s neighbour. Thatis why  as a country that is dually cut off and deprived ofits principal means of evacuation and supply  Chad firmlysupports the resolutions of the OAU  the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement and calls for the lifting of this unjust embargo. We shouldlike to take this opportunity to express our solidarity withthe people of Iraq and Cuba  who have beenindiscriminately affected by similar measures.My country has noted with satisfaction the end ofthe bipolar world  which has made possible the advent ofa new type of constructive dialogue that will enable ustogether to meet the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. In resuming diplomatic relations with theRepublic of China  the Government and people of Chad16have no intention other than to diversify their relations offriendship and cooperation with all peace- and justice-loving countries of the world on the basis of equality andsolidarity. In the name of the principle of universality sodear to our Organization  we support the return of theRepublic of China to the concert of nations.While the conflicts and other tensions throughout theworld concern us  so too does the international economicsituation. The justifiable fear expressed by the developingcountries in the aftermath of the cold war has not beenmitigated. The recent report of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development reminds us of this.Poverty in the developing countries and the impoverishmentof important social strata in the developed countries providefertile ground for intolerance  extremism and nationalism whose consequences we are all too familiar with. Despitethe numerous dense documents adopted at majorconferences  the expected concrete action has run agroundon the selfish conduct of the richest. Such an attitudeimposes limits upon the globalization of the economy.Africa  which has benefited from the sustainedattention of the international community during this decade is still  unfortunately  a continent ravaged by poverty malnutrition and epidemics of all kinds on a large scale.To the perpetual problems of indebtedness and thedeterioration of the terms of trade are added the constantmarginalization of our continent from the internationaleconomic circles. It is therefore urgent for concretemeasures to be taken so that Africa can experiencesustained growth  which should lead to genuinedevelopment. The terms of the declaration of the Heads ofState and Government of the seven most industrializedcountries and Russia in Denver last May should be made areality in this respect so that Africa  whose well-known vastnatural resources can really become part of the worldeconomy.The new Chad reiterates its unswerving support ofUnited Nations action in the sphere of peacekeeping and inthe area of development activities.Over time  the reform of our institution has become animperative. Therefore  in the context of globalization andinterdependence  the United Nations must adapt itself andbecome both the instrument and the expression ofmultilateralism in which the interests of all are taken intoaccount and safeguarded. For our part  we consider that thepromotion of development must be at the core of ourrenewed Organization.The United Nations deserves more confidence thanever before  provided that it derives from incontrovertiblelegitimacy which the Security Council with its presentcomposition is far from embodying. It has now beenestablished that that irreplaceable body should be adapted but its necessary restructuring should not have adetrimental effect on any part of the world.An acknowledgement of the legitimate claims of thevarious groups that make up our Organization is thereforeindispensable. Chad  for its part  reaffirms the positionstated at the last Summit of Heads of State orGovernment of the Organization of African Unity toassure the equitable representation of the Africancontinent in that body  in which the destiny of peoples isat stake. This is a requirement if the renewed SecurityCouncil is to be credible and effective in the service ofhumanity and if it is not to be a Council of doublestandards."
"156",6747,"TGO",52,1997,"﻿Ishould like to join those who have spoken before me inoffering you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on youroutstanding election to the presidency of our Assembly.To your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  my delegation reaffirms its satisfaction with theefficiency and competence with which he guided the workof the fifty-first session. We wish once again to convey tohim our sincere appreciation.I also wish once again to welcome the election ofMr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General of our Organization.In raising him to this position  the international communityrecognized the qualities that have brought honour to him his country and the entire African continent. On behalf ofmy delegation  I pay tribute to him for his dedication to thecause of international peace and security and for all he isdoing to make the United Nations more effective andcredible by improving its capacity to meet the needs oftoday’s world.Two years ago  we celebrated the United Nations firsthalf-century. We recommitted ourselves solemnly toworking together to advance peace  development  equality justice and understanding among all the peoples of theworld. The current session provides us with anotheropportunity to assess our collective work at a time when weare preparing to enter the twenty-first century with majorachievements under our belt  to be sure  but also withinnumerable challenges to face.In its ongoing quest to make life better for peoples our Organization has adopted and is implementingalternative strategies to meet the demands of a world inconstant change. The proclamation of the United NationsDecade for the Eradication of Poverty  the advancement ofthe rights of women and children  and the convening of aspecial session of the General Assembly on environmentand development are all actions demonstrating thedetermination of the United Nations to address the greatproblems of our time. But we must recognize that  despitethe efforts of the international community to establish anew world order  we are still waiting for the ardentlydesired peace  security  development and growth tomaterialize.Despite the detente that has existed since the end ofthe East-West antagonism  the international politicalsituation continues to present a gloomy picture  markedby ongoing disputes  tensions and conflicts. Even ifpiecemeal efforts are made to settle these crises  definitivesolutions seem to elude us. Thus  we remain deeplyconcerned for the future of mankind.Moreover  our helplessness in the face of resurgentterrorism  worsening poverty  the ever growing number ofrefugees and displaced persons and the deterioration ofthe environment dims our hope that the noble objectiveslaid down in the Charter to build a better world for futuregenerations will ever come true.In this context  Togo  under the guidance of thePresident of the Republic  Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema  isstriving to strengthen the political and legal bases of astate of law and to make development and  above all  theeradication of poverty the cornerstones of its policy.The citizens of Togo have entered a new era in theachievement of greater liberty  justice and progress inorder to make their country a democratic  united andprosperous nation. Every day  they demonstrate their willto reflect in their actions this deep-rooted desire to livetogether in peace and unity. According to experiencedobservers of good faith  the democratic institutionsestablished in Togo are proving themselves. The NationalAssembly  having become an outstanding forum fordemocratic debate  is living proof of the country’scommitment to entrench itself in democracy.Most of the other institutions of the Republicprovided for under the Constitution have beenestablished — for example  the High Audiovisual andCommunication Authority  the Constitutional Court  theNational Commission for Human Rights and the SupremeCouncil for the Courts.Aware  moreover  that they control their owndestiny  the Togolese have decided to work togethertowards a sound and transparent administration of publicaffairs. How could we not  therefore  be pleased by theeconomic performances achieved thanks to efforts madefor the effective implementation of the Governmentprogramme? The gross domestic product increased by 6per cent in 1996  and the rate of inflation has shown aclear improvement compared to 1995 thanks to a prudentwages and monetary policy. Improved exportcompetitiveness and the progressive resumption ofcooperation have allowed us to correct the balance of5payments and strengthen Togo’s contribution to the reservesof the West African Economic and Monetary Union. Thepeople of Togo hope that the community of nations willcontinue to support it in its progress towards legitimacy andlegality by helping it to complete the work of economicrecovery.The maintenance of peace continues to be the primarytask of the United Nations. One cannot over-emphasize thatpreventing crises  reducing tension  separating combatantsand finding definitive solutions to conflicts continue to beamong the fundamental missions of our Organization. Weare pleased to see in Togo that the United Nations  throughconcerted actions  continues day by day to do even more.My country confirms its unswerving dedication to theprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes  inaccordance with international law  and emphasizes the needto strengthen in this area cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations. Chapter VIII of theCharter would then take on its full meaning.Despite every effort  peace remains threatened on ourplanet  particularly on the African continent. As regards theRepublic of the Congo  Togo is concerned over thesituation there since 5 June 1997. We keenly hope that theprotagonists will put aside their arms in favour of dialoguein accordance with the spirit of Libreville Summit  held on14 and 15 September 1997  in which eight Heads of State including President Eyadema of Togo  participated. TheGovernment of Togo urgently calls upon our brothers in theCongo to conclude as quickly as possible a final ceasefireso that  under the aegis of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the internationalinterposition force planned by that last summit can bedeployed.As regards the Democratic Republic of the Congo Togo  needless to say  was involved in the search for apeaceful solution to the crisis by hosting in Lomé lastMarch a special summit of the Central Organ of the OAUMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution in Africa. Faced with a new political situation my Government would urge the authorities in Kinshasa todo everything in their power to provide a climatefavourable to national reconciliation in order to tackle thepriority tasks of development.In Sierra Leone  the hope born of the establishment ofa democratic regime and the signing of the peace agreementin Abidjan in November 1996 between the Government andthe Revolutionary United Front was thoroughly tested bythe putsch of 25 May 1997. My country stronglycondemned this coup. It is demanding the reestablishmentof constitutional order and earnestly hopes that thisquestion can be peacefully resolved in order to avoidanother crisis for the West African subregion at a timewhen the Liberian conflict is coming to a close. Thepeople of Togo are pleased to note that  on the basis ofthe Abuja Agreement  the presidential  legislative andsenatorial elections were finally able to take place last 19July in an atmosphere of discipline  transparency andpeace. My delegation takes this opportunity tocongratulate the mission carried out by the EconomicCommunity of West African States  supported by theUnited Nations and the OAU  from the beginning of theconflict to the establishment of new democraticinstitutions.I should like  moreover  given the instability thatAfrica is experiencing  to remind the parties concernedthat they must seek to prevent fratricidal conflicts  whichdiverts their energy from the path of development. Morethought should therefore be given to establishing anAfrican peacekeeping force  which was first suggested byPresident Eyadema at the thirtieth session of theAssembly of Heads of State and Government of theOAU  held in Tunisia in 1994. There is now animperative  urgent need to establish such a force  whichcould react promptly and effectively to any armedconflict  in order to reestablish peace and stability asquickly as possible wherever necessary.I would like again this year to return to the questionof the Regional Centre of the United Nations for Peaceand Disarmament in Africa and to welcome the sendingby the Secretary-General of a mission of consultants toLomé and other African capitals to explore ways andmeans of revitalizing the Centre. It is clear from thedecision taken in Harare by the thirty-third session of theAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAUthat the Centre has a vital role to play in the maintenanceof peace and security in Africa as well as in theprevention of conflicts on the continent.I cannot fail to mention here the situation in otherparts of the world.Regarding the Middle East  my country  which hadin the past hailed the courage  dedication and spirit ofinitiative of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in theimplementation of the timetable for the withdrawal fromthe occupied territories  is today concerned about theblocking of the peace process in the region. We deplorethe continuation of the settlements policy and the6resumption of acts of violence  which only serve toundermine the climate of confidence that is a prerequisitefor the pursuit of dialogue.Togo urges the parties to resume negotiations inaccordance with the Agreements of 1993 and 1994 in orderto relaunch the peace process and achieve a comprehensiveand lasting settlement of the conflict in the Middle East which has lasted now for more than half a century and isa threat to the peace and security of the States of theregion.I turn to the situation in the Korean Peninsula. Togohas been following with great interest the talks under wayand calls for the establishment of lasting peace in thisregion. We hope that the negotiations that have begun willcontinue and will be crowned with success.Everyone is aware that most of these conflicts haveclaimed  and continue to claim  numerous victims  includingrefugees and displaced persons.The proliferation of weapons  whatever their type  isa threat to peace and security. To be sure  commendableefforts have been made to create a world free from thespectre of nuclear war. However  it must be emphasizedthat the maintenance of international peace and securityhinges on general and complete disarmament. My countryhailed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty andconsiders the entry into force on 29 April this year of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction to be a decisive act by theinternational community in its permanent quest for apeaceful world. In ratifying this Convention  Togo wishedto stress its unequivocal commitment to general andcomplete disarmament. It hopes that implementing theprovisions of this Convention will help spare mankind theinnumerable evils resulting from the use of such weapons.Regarding anti-personnel landmines  my country hailsthe process begun in Ottawa in 1996  which concluded inOslo with the adoption of the treaty regarding the use storage  production and transfer of those mines and theirdestruction. We hope that this treaty  which will open forsignature next December in Ottawa  will be ratified andrigorously applied by all States  so that  because of itsuniversal nature  many human lives may be saved.The end of the bipolarization associated with the coldwar allowed the international community to glimpse aworld in which efforts would henceforth be mobilized toeliminate poverty so as to ensure development and well-being for humankind. However  we are obliged to notethat  despite this favourable environment for peace andeconomic expansion  poverty continues to growunchecked and remains a striking phenomenon in ourworld. This situation provides a good illustration of thefailure of the numerous development strategies putforward by the international community.In this context  the case of Africa remains the mostworrying. The burden of external debt  the drop in exportearnings and the adverse consequences of tradeimbalances have largely contributed to an increaseddeterioration in socio-economic conditions in manycountries. The world economy  characterized  as we nearthe end of the century  by the phenomenon ofglobalization  has experienced a general growth in almostall countries over the past few years. It is regrettable however  that despite this globalization the new rules oftrade have not made it possible to dismantle the barrierserected by the industrialized countries to protect theirindustry and agriculture. It follows that it is still difficultfor our products to gain access to their markets.These protectionist measures  which do enormousdamage to developing countries  especially in Africa cancel out the efforts made by African countries torelaunch the growth of their economies through exports.We cannot stress enough how much damage iscaused by the closing of the markets of the North to theproducts of developing countries. This situation deprivesthe countries of the South of substantial foreign-currencyincome  which are necessary to promote sustaineddevelopment. In this respect  the Government of Togofully appreciates the willingness of the richest countries reaffirmed last June at the Denver Summit  intend to opentheir markets further to the countries of the South. Webelieve that by lifting their protectionist barriers thedeveloped countries will make a genuine and tangiblecontribution to the development efforts being made by theless well-off.In this light  my Government believes thatglobalization must be accompanied by an impetus forincreased solidarity  characterized by the willingness ofthe countries of the North to buy our staple commoditiesat remunerative prices.Despite the commendable efforts undertaken byAfrican Governments within the framework of structural-adjustment programmes  the economic situation in our7States remains difficult  and living conditions for ourpopulations are increasingly precarious. Given this state ofaffairs  the international community has developed variousstrategies to help the African States find viable and lastingsolutions to their many socio-economic problems. It isimportant to welcome here the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa  which my delegation believessupports and complements the United Nations New Agendafor the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) as well as the Cairo Programme of Action for the socialand economic development of Africa.My country also pays tribute to the Government ofJapan which  in addition to its unfailing support todeveloping countries  has taken the positive initiative ofplanning to convene  in 1998  the second TokyoInternational Conference on African Development. It is verydesirable for the various parties involved in Africandevelopment who will be participating in that forum including Africans themselves  to become more involved inthe conception and the implementation of developmentprogrammes for out continent.Development policies for our countries cannot beconceived today without cooperation and regionalintegration. In this respect  the entry into force of theTreaty establishing the African Economic Community is agood illustration of the will of the African States to pooltheir efforts to achieve sustainable development. Togowould like to reaffirm its commitment to the policy ofeconomic integration of the continent and urges the UnitedNations and the international community to support theAfrican countries in their efforts to achieve the objectivesof sustainable development so as to promote prosperity andwell-being for their populations.We are pleased to note that 52 years after the adoptionof the Charter in San Francisco  many processes are underway  aimed in particular at strengthening the UnitedNations system  resolving the financial crisis of theOrganization and restructuring the United Nations in thesocial and economic spheres and in related areas  includingthe Security Council.With regard to the Security Council in particular  it isimportant that the ongoing discussions on its restructuringaim at and succeed in expanding the number of bothpermanent and non-permanent members. Such anenlargement should take into account the interests ofdeveloping countries and should be based on equitablegeographic representation in order to make the Councilmore representative and more democratic  thereby enablingit to respond more effectively to the requirements of theday.Within the framework of efforts to revitalize theOrganization  my delegation has noted with interest themeasures envisaged by the Secretary-General and therecommendations contained in his report  presented on 16July  which are aimed at restructuring the Secretariat andproviding it with the means to serve the Member Statesmore effectively. At this session the Assembly will havean opportunity to take part in a careful and in-depthconsideration of that report.Togo wishes to stress that the decisions andmeasures resulting from such consideration should notreduce the capacity of the Organization in thedevelopment field. We therefore hope  as the Secretary-General himself has proposed  that the savings resultingfrom more rigorous management will permit the financingof United Nations priority programmes  such as those forthe elimination of poverty and the advancement ofsustained economic growth in the developing countries.At the dawn of the third millennium  humankind isat a decisive stage in its history and requires greaterpragmatism  creativity and solidarity in settling itsproblems. In this respect  our world  in a spirit ofsolidarity  must mobilize further to eliminate poverty which is the vital concern of our time  as it impedes thecohesiveness of societies and States  destroys the verybasis of human rights and damages the environment. Wetherefore need to tackle this principal cause ofinstability — poverty — with the same urgency andvigour that we apply to political crises. For it is clear thatno system of collective security can be viable unless weseek effectively to resolve the problems of poverty andmisery that are the daily lot of most of the population ofthe world.Together  therefore  let us seek a new internationalorder based on peace  solidarity and justice."
"157",6792,"THA",52,1997,"﻿It is with great pleasurethat my delegation extends to you  Sir  its sincerecongratulations on your unanimous election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity toexpress its deepest appreciation to your predecessor Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  for his exceptionalleadership and creative energies during the past year. I alsowish to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for the new dynamism which he has brought to theOrganization since he took office last January.This fifty-second session of the General Assemblytakes place against the backdrop of transition andtransformation in the world. The euphoria that came inthe wake of the end of the cold war has given way to asense of realism about the new  and no less formidable challenges that confront us all in this era of globalization.The changes  led by technology and the globalization ofbusiness and information  seem endless and increasinglycomplex. Governments  meanwhile  face the daunting taskof constantly trying to discern and adjust to the new orderof international relations.For all the changes  some legacies of the cold warare still very much with us. Nothing brings home thisreality more than the unfortunate events unfolding inCambodia. While the situation in Cambodia that confrontsus today is very different from the one we faced beforethe signing of the Paris Peace Accord  finding a solutionis no less difficult.How can we deal with a conflict which is basicallyinternal in character  particularly when our ability toinfluence events has become limited and we are overcomewith the fatigue born of déjà vu? Clearly  we cannot turnour backs on Cambodia. But the reality is that we inThailand and in the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN)  as well as the entire internationalcommunity  can only be supportive to the extent that theCambodians themselves are willing to give peace achance.The situation in Cambodia reflects a peculiar aspectof this brave new age we are entering. Even as the worldis being transformed by sweeping global trends  someproblems are so deep-rooted that they resist even the bestefforts of the international community. The UnitedNations  no stranger itself to intractable conflicts  willcontinue to be one of our best hopes for resolving suchsituations.While tending to such traditional challenges  theUnited Nations must also address the many complex newchallenges brought on by the process of globalization.Indeed  globalization has come to mean different thingsto different people. To many  it holds out the promise ofan unprecedented era of progress and prosperity. To itsproponents  globalization has unleashed the forces ofcreativity and productivity in the world economy.12Globalization has been heralded for having spread the ideasand values of democracy and freedom worldwide.On the other hand  there are those who contend thatglobalization has become an all-embracing pretext for theimposition of certain sets of ideas and values. They seeglobalization as leading to a monopoly of economic powerin the hands of a ruthless few whose sole allegiance is tothe workings of market forces  while the vast majority ofhumanity is increasingly marginalized.The reality most likely lies somewhere between thesetwo extreme views. The fact of the matter is that we mustall develop the capacity to cope with the effects ofglobalization  both positive and negative. Even the moresuccessful developing countries have not escaped thetremendous turmoil that integration into the global marketcan bring on  as evidenced by the currency crisis thatThailand and many other countries in South-East Asia aregoing through.Thailand’s recent experience suggests that to thriveunder economic globalization  developing countries have tofully understand how market forces work and to adaptthemselves accordingly. Thailand has learned that financialliberalization requires a high degree of discipline from boththe public and private sectors. Also crucial is the need to bevigilant in improving prudential regulations. Moreover  amore comprehensive macroeconomic analysis is needed inorder to improve the monitoring of current economicconditions.But Thailand’s basic strengths remain. Our economicfundamentals are still underscored by a remarkably highsavings rate  relatively low inflation and a strong traditionof market-oriented policy framework. We are firm in ourcommitment to free and open markets. We are also activein promoting regional cooperation and economicliberalization through such frameworks as the Associationof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and varioussubregional development schemes.Moreover  we are firm in our determination to achievegood governance and greater democracy. This pastSaturday  the Thai Parliament approved the new draftConstitution  which emphasizes transparency  accountabilityand the role of public participation.Our political reform goes hand in hand with oureconomic reform. We realize that we can no longer put offeconomic restructuring if we are to get back on trackquickly. We are therefore seriously implementing theconditions of the International Monetary Fund rescuepackage. We are also working with the World Bank andthe Asian Development Bank to restructure our financialsystem  enhance our export competitiveness and return theeconomy to its long-term sustainable growth throughnecessary reforms of the civil service  privatization industrial restructuring and the upgrading of the quality ofour workforce  our technology and our infrastructure.I prefer to think of this crisis as a blessing indisguise. While we have done many things right in thepast — including progressive industrialization andliberalization of international trade and investment —with the benefit of hindsight  the macroeconomiccapability to cope with an increasingly open capitalmarket was inadequate. Globalization of business andfinance compels us to become more competitive throughgreater openness and transparency. Our economy is toodeeply integrated into the international economic systemto do anything less. We cannot fight the market; what wemust do is ensure that the market works efficiently andequitably.At the same time  Thailand’s experience also showsthat the United Nations has an important role to play incoordinating macroeconomic policy at the global level.Closer cooperation and coordination is needed betweenthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions the World Trade Organization and major industrialcountries to provide integrated support for theenhancement of capacity-building in those countrieswhose economies are still weak. Globalization of coursehas its winners and losers. The rules of the game shouldtherefore take into account both the weaknesses andstrengths of all countries concerned.As a universal and multi-purpose Organization  theUnited Nations is the only institution in the world capableof forging a global partnership among States  big andsmall  rich and poor  powerful and weak. No single Stateor region can go it alone. This is why Thailand iscommitted to supporting the United Nations. This is whyThailand welcomes the reform-action initiatives andproposals recently put forward by the Secretary-General.I hope that these measures will enable the United Nationsto carry out its responsibilities with increased efficiencyand effectiveness. I wish the Secretary-General well onthe further implementation of these proposals.Thailand attaches great importance to thestrengthening of the role of the United Nations in13promoting international cooperation for economic and socialdevelopment. We are pleased that in his reform proposalsSecretary-General Kofi Annan argued that the promotion ofsustainable development should be the central priority ofUnited Nations activities. While the reform plan proposedby the Secretary-General requires more thoroughconsideration  Thailand can support his proposal ofdesignating the United Nations Development Group —comprising the United Nations Development Programme the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United NationsPopulation Fund — to supersede the sectoral group ofdevelopment operations. We hope that the United NationsDevelopment Group will facilitate consolidation andcooperation among United Nations agencies withoutcompromising their identities  so that they can respondmore effectively to the needs of developing countries.Thailand also welcomes the creation of a developmentdividend by shifting resources from administration todevelopment activities. According to the reform plan  theadministrative costs will be reduced by one third  theworkforce will be reduced by 1 000 posts and thepaperwork will be cut by 30 per cent. However  downsizingshould not be an end in itself. The central element of thereform should concentrate on how to manage funds andimplement programmes so as to achieve equitabledevelopment  which is our common goal.Another important point in the Secretary-General’sreform plan is the proposal to mobilize more resources forUnited Nations operational activities. Thailand sees theUnited Nations as the main forum for the creation of anequal and workable partnership between developed anddeveloping countries — a partnership that should beresponsive to the needs and aspirations of the developingworld. The steady decline in voluntary contributions to coreresources has inhibited the capacity of United Nations fundsand programmes to play the roles assigned to them. In thisregard  we support the Secretary-General’s proposal oninnovative means of mobilizing new financial resources fordevelopment. The private sector is potentially an importantsource of financial support  as demonstrated by theproposed donation of $l billion by Mr. Ted Turner.However  the funds from the private sector should beadditional to  and must not replace  official developmentassistance.The restructuring of the Security Council is also a vitalpart of United Nations reform. Despite the end of the coldwar  the anachronistic yet so powerful veto power stillexists in this supposedly more democratized institution. Itis heartening  however  to note that the issue has beenextensively debated. Thailand and its ASEAN partners  aswell as the Non-Aligned Movement  believe that this vetopower should be curtailed with a view to its eventualelimination. The Security Council itself should beexpanded  taking into account the increase in UnitedNations membership to enhance its democratic andrepresentative nature  while at the same time paying dueregard to its efficiency and effectiveness.But without the firm commitment of Member States all these reform efforts would come to nothing. MemberStates have the obligation under the Charter to bear theexpenses of the Organization by paying their assessedcontributions in full on time and without conditions.Thailand has always taken its financial obligationseriously and has made every effort to fulfil it. For 1997Thailand is among the 28 countries which paid theircontributions to the regular budget in full and on time.Thailand believes that one of the main tasks of theUnited Nations is to set standards in international law and in recent years there has been an encouraging trendtowards efforts to advance the cause of international lawthrough the creation of legal norms and instruments. Whatthese norms and instruments symbolize is the desire ofpeoples to live in a more orderly world. Thailand willcontinue to support and participate actively in efforts toestablish an international criminal court  as well as in theelaboration of new legal instruments to combat terrorism.In December of this year  Thailand hopes to be one of thesignatories of the Ottawa treaty banning all anti-personnellandmines. We believe that there is no greater crime thanmaiming or killing innocent civilians. It is high time thatwe put an end to this. At the same time  greater effortsand resources should be devoted to removing anddestroying these landmines.As a signatory of the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  which was concluded inBangkok during the ASEAN summit in 1995  Thailandwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulatethe Governments of Central Asia for their initiative toestablish a Central Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone. Theircommendable effort adds to the strong evidence that thepeoples of the world are no longer tolerant of nuclearweapons. At present  more than 100 United NationsMember States are signatories of nuclear-weapon-freezone treaties in their respective regions  treaties whichnow cover the greater part of the world  including LatinAmerica and the Caribbean  the South Pacific  Africa South-East Asia and  soon  Central Asia. What we arewitnessing here is a new partnership  a partnership among14the peoples of the world who dread nuclear arsenals andwish to eliminate these hazardous weapons of massdestruction from the face of the earth.The international environment in which we live isevolving rapidly. During the past year  there have beenmany encouraging developments. But we also findourselves confronted with new and increasingly complexchallenges. In order to overcome these challenges  theUnited Nations as an Organization needs vision andinventiveness. But  more importantly  its Members need tospeak with one voice on issues which confront mankind. Ifwe are to succeed in doing this  a global partnership needsto be forged  be it in the area of politics  economic andsocial development  environmental protection orhumanitarian assistance. Sooner rather than later  we shouldall realize that  in this globalized world  our destinies arelinked together much more closely than we like to believe.The time to forge this partnership is now. The place tobegin the process is here  at the United Nations."
"158",6817,"TJK",52,1997,"﻿I wish at the outset to congratulate you  Mr. Udovenko  onyour election to the important post of President of theGeneral Assembly  and to wish you success in guiding thework of a forum that is so important for the entireinternational community.Speaking from this rostrum three years ago  I stressedthat  in spite of the armed confrontation that was then onthe increase in my country  the leadership of Tajikistan hadopted for a consistent policy of political dialogue as theonly means of achieving peace and national reconciliation.Today the results of that policy can be seen. Withactive international support  the negotiation process led tohistoric decisions being taken by the Tajik people  layingthe groundwork for successful progress towards peace andnational reconciliation.I should like to take this opportunity to expresssincere gratitude to the members of the GeneralAssembly  the Security Council  the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  and his Special Representative inTajikistan  Mr. Gerd Merrem  for the constant and closeattention that they have paid to achieving a settlement inTajikistan  and  indeed  to the problems of Tajikistan ingeneral. We greatly appreciate the efforts of the RussianFederation  the Islamic Republic of Iran and other States as well as international and regional organizations  thatacted as observers at the inter-Tajik talks and made asignificant contribution to the very difficult negotiationprocess. We are deeply grateful to all friendly countries to international organizations and primarily to members ofthe United Nations system that have assisted and continueto provide assistance in the establishment of a lastingpeace and accord in Tajikistan.We are fully determined to strive consistently andunwaveringly for the full implementation of the GeneralAgreement on the Establishment of Peace and NationalAccord in Tajikistan and for the achievement of nationalaccord. Here we count on growing support from theUnited Nations and its observer missions  acting in closecooperation with the Peacekeeping Forces of theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Withoutsuch cooperation  it would be extremely difficult toimplement the military component of the inter-Tajikagreements or to achieve a final solution to the problem ofrefugees.Another important aspect of United Nations assistanceto the peace process in Tajikistan is the development andimplementation of a comprehensive strategy onhumanitarian aid and post-conflict reconstruction of oureconomy. An excellent framework for this effort isprovided by General Assembly resolution 51/30 J adoptedon 25 April 1997 on emergency international humanitarianassistance for lasting peace and reconciliation in Tajikistan.We hope that in the course of this session this usefulinitiative will be continued and that an updated resolutionwill be adopted taking fully into account the specifics of thetransition period and the humanitarian needs of the peopleof Tajikistan.Among the multitude of conflicts and crisis situationswhich unfortunately entered a new phase during the periodfollowing the cold war  we are particularly concerned aboutthe situation in the neighbouring Islamic State ofAfghanistan. Together with our Central Asian partners inthe CIS and with Russia  we have repeatedly expressed ourprofound concern over the destabilizing impact of thesituation in Afghanistan on the entire region  as well as onthe situation beyond the region.On the initiative of the Almaty Five  about a year agothe Security Council became more actively involved inAfghan problems. Along with resolutions adopted by theGeneral Assembly  Security Council decisions are the bestfoundation for ending the fratricidal war that has beengoing on for so many years there.I have to say frankly that the fact that the Afghanproblem remains unsettled may undermine the fragile peacein Tajikistan. We hope that  taking into account the agreedposition of the “Big Eight” Summit participants in Denver and using their experience of cooperation to solve conflictsin the Balkans and other hot spots in the world  Russia andthe United States  cooperating with other States concernedand supporting United Nations involvement  will play adecisive part in an Afghan settlement in the nearest possiblefuture.I will be honest with the Assembly: it is inTajikistan’s vital interests that peace be established inAfghanistan for another reason — it would help to reducesubstantially the flow of arms and drugs across the Tajik-Afghan border  and it would reduce the proliferation ofterrorism and waves of extremism which are destabilizingthe entire region.I would like to comment now on the issue of reformof our Organization. We attribute great importance to theUnited Nations as a key instrument for maintaininginternational peace and security. The idea of adjusting theUnited Nations to today’s realities is certainly importantand necessary. In today’s transitional conditions  thestabilizing role of the United Nations must grow steadily.We believe it is important to approach UnitedNations reform in a pragmatic way  concentrating on themost pressing issues  and maintaining a reasonablebalance between innovation and strengtheningmechanisms that have proved their effectiveness.As a State that has experienced first-hand all thehardships of civil war and has travelled the difficult roadtowards national reconciliation with active support andassistance from the United Nations  Tajikistan isconvinced of the need to preserve strong and efficientpeacemaking mechanisms. First and foremost  this relatesto the work of the Security Council  which has tomaintain timeliness and effectiveness. We believe thatSecurity Council representation would be enhanced if itsmembership were expanded not only to candidates fromindustrialized States  such as Germany and Japan  but alsoto representatives from developing countries on arotational basis.On administrative and budget issues  we consider itimportant to ensure zero actual and  if possible  zeronominal growth of the United Nations budget. We mustutilize material and human resources more efficiently  andwe must strengthen mechanisms monitoring the work ofthe United Nations apparatus. We must also count on theunderstanding of the international community in respectof temporary financial difficulties facing some developingStates and countries emerging from conflicts.We consider it right that the strategy for the twenty-first century should be sustainable development  ensuringconservation of the environment and natural resources.Although we were not entirely satisfied with the results ofthe recent nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly  held last summer  it is important that thatsession outlined ways of expediting progress in key areasof sustainable development  as defined in Agenda 21.As a country that has suffered from civil war and isin transition to market relationships  Tajikistan expects the2United Nations to pay closer attention and participate moreefficiently in ensuring sustainable development in countrieswith transitional economies  including introducing measuresto neutralize the negative social consequences of suchtransitions. We believe that the United Nations can andmust maintain its unique role in providing internationalsupport for the integration of States in transition into globaleconomic and trade systems and for their involvement inthe existing and emerging regulatory institutions andmechanisms. These demands were reflected in the Agendafor Development  which was adopted by the GeneralAssembly in June this year.The absence of peaceful conditions in Tajikistan hasprevented it from moving towards sustainable developmentin any significant way  and consequently it has not beenable fully to implement the recommendations of Agenda 21.Due to the civil confrontations that have swept thecountry  the main efforts of the Government of Tajikistanin recent years have been aimed at eradicating conflict establishing peace and tranquillity  and creating conditionsto integrate the population into active economic andcreative work.The new prospects for peace provide us with anopportunity to redouble our efforts and concentrate onunsolved problems. The most important of these include therapid reconstruction of the social and economicinfrastructure that had been destroyed; the return ofrefugees to their homes  together with their social andpsychological adjustment and reintegration into the newconditions of life; the active involvement of citizens ineconomic activity through the creation of jobs  which arecrucial; and  above all  the creation of conditions conduciveto the democratic development of Tajik society.Today  an intensive transition to a socially orientedmarket economy is under way in Tajikistan. Against thebackground of an increasingly far-reaching peace process the Government of Tajikistan is carrying out economicreforms that promise positive results in the foreseeablefuture. The country’s natural wealth  water supply  energyand intellectual resources are favourable to such adevelopment.However  reality demands that we confront thesituation with honesty. We must admit that withoutinternational support it would be extremely difficult for usto carry out the reconstruction and creative tasks quickly.In the first place  it is a question of donors continuing theircommendable efforts to extend humanitarian assistance toour most vulnerable population groups  which havesuffered from the civil war. Economic reforms under wayin the country also need efficient and targeted support.This would involve an additional flow of investment intoTajikistan  the more active involvement of the country’sexport potential in international trade transactions  and ourgradual integration into international financial and tradeinstitutions. I should like to express my conviction that at this stage of its development  Tajikistan will not be leftalone to deal with its problems.The goal set out in the Charter of the UnitedNations “to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar” has very special meaning for the people of Tajikistan who have experienced the bitter taste of fratricidal war.Our experience has shown that the work of the UnitedNations  based on the coordinated efforts of its MemberStates  can achieve tangible results and resolve seeminglyirreconcilable differences  thereby enabling us to moveonto a peaceful  non-violent track.We note the tireless efforts of the United Nations inmaintaining and strengthening international peace andsecurity on a practical level under new and constantlychanging conditions. We believe that useful momentumfor this work could be provided by convening  in 1999  athird international peace conference  an initiative that isenjoying growing support among members of theinternational community. Greater in-depth discussion ofthis issue on the threshold of the twenty-first centurywould further promote mutual understanding andcooperation in the world  taking account of the interestsof all on the basis of the equality of all nations."
"159",6840,"TKM",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to congratulate Mr. Udovenko the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  on his electionto the post of President of the General Assembly. Hiselection signifies recognition of Ukraine s great prestige inthe world  respect for and confidence in the country sforeign policy  and the personal and professional qualitiesof the new President.We are sincerely grateful to Ambassador Razali Ismailfor his remarkable diplomatic talent and efficientperformance of the President s functions during theprevious session of the General Assembly.First of all  allow me to express our satisfaction withthe report presented by the Secretary-General. It is aninnovative and specific document devoid of many of theweaknesses typical of similar documents in the past.Turkmenistan supports the Secretary-General s programmeto reform the entire United Nations system and thefunctioning of its bodies — in particular the Secretariat —and to tailor the financial resources of the Organization toits planned activities.We share the conclusion in the report that the reformof the United Nations should be radical and not gradual.However  we believe that the reforms should not be carriedout as a revolutionary overhaul  especially when it comes for example  to the Security Council  which after itbecomes more representative should still remain aneffectively functioning body that should not supplant theGeneral Assembly.In our view  a rational increase in the number ofpermanent members of the Security Council primarilycalls for the inclusion of such States as Japan andGermany — vested with all corresponding rights andpowers — because they can make a constructive inputand have greater political objectiveness with respect to thework of the Security Council.There is an issue of special interest and concern forTurkmenistan  as well as for all the countries of theregion: the question of Afghanistan. We are glad to notethat this question finds an increasingly prominent place inthe agenda of the United Nations and in the activities ofits agencies  ad hoc bodies and the Security Council. Wefeel special gratitude for the Secretary-General for hiscontinuing efforts to give a new impetus to the intra-Afghan settlement. In this context  we attach particularsignificance to the efforts of the Secretary-General sspecial envoys Mr. Norbert Hall and Mr. LakhdarBrahimi. Turkmenistan was involved in theimplementation of peacemaking programmes in the regionby hosting a series of inter-Tajik talks and by organizing together with the United Nations  a major internationalconference on humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.Turkmenistan resolutely supports and will support to theutmost the earliest possible convening of an internationalconference on Afghanistan with the participation of all itsimmediate neighbours and  in the future  the holding ofconference with the participation of the Powers vestedwith special international authority and capable of makinga practical contribution towards the settlement. ThePresident of Turkmenistan  Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov maintains constant contact regarding this matter with Mr.Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  and with the leadersof the neighbouring States of Iran  Pakistan  Uzbekistanand Tajikistan. Turkmenistan pins great hopes on theforthcoming summit meeting of the Organization of theIslamic Conference (OIC)  to be held in Tehran inDecember this year  which will give the Muslim world anopportunity to determine at the highest level theguidelines for the resolution of the prolonged Afghancrisis  which has today become a bleeding wound for theAfghan people and an obstacle preventing the region fromimplementing major economic programmes. Turkmenistanhas always believed  and still believes  that conflictsituations emerging in the OIC s geographical areashould be resolved through its joint efforts with theUnited Nations.We are happy to be witnessing today a greaterdisplay of restraint with regard to simplistic attemptsaimed at associating extremism and other negative23phenomena with the world of Islam. The Muslim world likeany other — for example  Christianity — is multifacetedand diverse. It confronts a whole complex of universalproblems of development  and it is being mobilized toovercome conflicts and combat manifestations of uncivilsocial behaviour. The need for this was emphasized by theSecretary- General in his report to the current session of theGeneral Assembly. While it is a secular and democraticState in Asia  Turkmenistan also considers itself atraditional oriental society that  by virtue of its geopoliticaldestiny  finds itself at the juncture of two regions  involvingit simultaneously in Asian and European internationalaffairs. Against the backdrop of the global energy potentialof our State  this factor forms the basis of the UnitedNations-supported strategy of Turkmenistan s neutrality which today acquires practical significance for theOrganization.All our political efforts today are aimed at creating afavourable atmosphere for economic development  both ofthe entire region and of every country in particular. At itssummit meeting held last May in Ashgabat  the regionalEconomic Cooperation Organization  which todaycomprises 10 nations  formulated a strategic programme forthe development of transport  energy  pipeline andtelecommunication infrastructures. Its implementation notonly corresponds to the interests of the participating Statesbut also creates opportunities for the delivery of energycarriers  oil  gas and oil products to international markets inEurope and Asia from the enormously rich deposits in theCaspian Sea basin and the entire Central Asian area.Turkmenistan believes that  in the intensification ofinternational cooperation  the resolution of crises in CentralAsia and the use of preventive measures aimed atprecluding their recurrence because of conflicting claims ofStates to ownership rights over natural resources  it isnecessary to take into account the global challenges of thetwenty-first century  which call for the early developmentof additional and alternative means for the rationaldistribution of energy-producing raw materials on worldmarkets. Turkmenistan possesses the world s third largestgas deposits  and it has huge oil reserves and other mineralresources. It is ready to take part in open and broad-basedinternational cooperation in this endeavour. This approachhas been confirmed by the recently issued internationaltender for the development and exploration of oil and gasdeposits in the Turkmen zone of the Caspian Sea. Wecannot but express our satisfaction at the lifting of artificialbarriers to the gas pipeline from Turkmenistan through Iranto Turkey and Europe. We consider this a good sign fromthe United States  a sign that it is ready to support ourefforts to strengthen our sovereignty and independentnational economy.In this context  allow me also to express oursatisfaction at the fact that the Secretary-General s reportand other recent documents of the Organization have atlast more clearly defined the notion of Central Asia which includes many more States as compared with theold central Asian part of the former Soviet Union. Duringthe past several years Turkmenistan has maintained aconsistent and principled approach to this issue emphasizing that the disappearance of the southernborders of the former Soviet State gave rise to theformation of a new region unified by the commonpurpose of accelerating economic development andstrengthening its political and State structures. Today it isinconceivable that Turkmenistan should exist withoutequally close ties within this region — with Iran  Turkey Pakistan  Afghanistan  Uzbekistan  Tajikistan  Azerbaijanand other neighbours. We are firmly convinced that theformer Soviet “Central Asian 5” have quite logically beentransformed into the “Central Asian 10” and that theUnited Nations and its different agencies should bear inmind this objective reality when formulating theirapproaches to the region.I believe it is highly important to draw theAssembly s attention to Turkmenistan s sincerecommitment to the efforts of the international communityto bring about the complete banning of the production andproliferation of all types of weapons of mass destruction.Turkmenistan fully subscribes to the Ottawa process forthe elimination of anti-personnel landmines. In 1996 and1997  together with Canada  Turkmenistan activelyparticipated in international forums in Vienna  Bonn Oslo  Brussels and Ashgabat  which have been majormilestones on the road towards the signing of the treatybanning anti-personnel landmines  which is to be signedin December this year in Ottawa. Coming from a regionthat has suffered the horrors of this so-calledindiscriminate type of weapon  Turkmenistan is convincedthat it is a timely and highly relevant treaty.At the end of the twentieth century internationalrelations are characterized by one specific feature: theright of choice that is enjoyed today by anunprecedentedly large number of independent nations andStates. This right is becoming an increasingly stable trendstrengthened by greater tolerance and patience ininternational relations. Participation or non-participationin one or another political or economic grouping is nolonger considered  nor can it be considered  through the24prism of the formula “If you are not with us  you areagainst us”. Turkmenistan does not object to the idea of theexistence of the great Powers regional interests. This isthe right of every State. However  we  like our partners inthe Non-Aligned Movement  unequivocally object to theexistence of zones of unilateral domination. We stand forthe principle of open land as well as that of open skies.While building its relations with all States on the basis ofthe principles of equality and mutual respect  neutralTurkmenistan does not divide its partners into categories ofclose or remote  big or small  because that runs counter tothe political logic of our times.Today  during my meeting with Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary- General of the United Nations  I delivered to hima personal message from the President of Turkmenistan Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov which  in particular  states  first that our political philosophy and all our actions are free ofany self-serving interests and are primarily aimed atstrengthening peace and raising the economic well-beingand cultural and educational level of its peoples; secondly that the United Nations can be fully convinced thatTurkmenistan is prepared to give the Organization itsmaximum possible assistance; and  finally  that the UnitedNations can count on Turkmenistan in all its initiatives andendeavours in the region."
"160",6908,"TTO",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Trinidad andTobago  I have the distinct pleasure and honour to extendsincere congratulations to you  Sir  and to the Governmentof Ukraine on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at this fifty-second session. I amconfident that  under your able leadership  the urgent andimportant issues which face the General Assembly at thiscritical time in the history of the United Nations will beadvanced.I would also like to express my profoundappreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador RazaliIsmail of Malaysia  for his excellent stewardship over thelast session. His inimitable and dynamic style has left adistinctive mark on the modus operandi of the GeneralAssembly. Ambassador Ismail deserves ourcommendation for his efforts to advance the work of theGeneral Assembly on issues such as the reform of theSecurity Council  the Agenda for Development and thenineteenth special session of the General Assembly toreview and appraise the implementation of Agenda 21.Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to theprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.Today  as we approach the twenty-first century and a newrange of issues demands our attention as nation States our commitment to the United Nations is no less focused no less poignant. Trinidad and Tobago continues tobelieve in the efficacy of the United Nations  a body nowat a critical point in its evolution. We applaud Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who has presented perhaps the mostextensive reform proposals in the history of theOrganization. A restructured Organization will be betterpoised to respond more readily to the challenges of thenext century. There is no doubt about the need of theinternational community for the United Nations. No otherbody remotely approximates its universality ofmembership and it remains the most appropriate forumfor addressing the interrelated issues of peace  securityand sustainable development.While the international community must addressthese perennial issues  we need at the same time toconfront the daunting tasks of providing humanitarian5assistance and reconstructive aid and ensuring thepromotion of good governance  democracy and humanrights. In this post-cold-war period  the United Nationsmust strive to build an international community based onpeace  justice  equity  democracy and the rule ofinternational law.Trinidad and Tobago is concerned about the rise inpolitical conflicts and tensions and the unresolved long-standing disputes which continue to threaten internationalpeace and security. Increased efforts must be made by theinternational community to address these conflicts throughpeaceful means. Trinidad and Tobago wishes to restate itscommitment to the non-use of force in the conduct ofinternational relations and the peaceful settlement ofdisputes. We will continue to support United Nations-ledpeacekeeping missions and do our part to furtherdemocracy  as exemplified by our participation in theelection processes in such countries as Haiti  El Salvador Nicaragua  Namibia and South Africa.This General Assembly will address yet again thecontinuing quest for a just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast. At this delicate period in the peace process  Trinidadand Tobago believes that durable peace will be achievedonly if all parties to the dispute adhere to the relevantUnited Nations resolutions and implement the agreementsand guarantees to which they have committed themselvesin bilateral and multilateral negotiations.We in the Caribbean region appreciate the supportgiven by the international community to the Governmentand people of Haiti. This support has contributed to theprogress made so far in the building of democracy and thestrengthening of its institutions. We are convinced that therecent decision to extend the mandate of the United NationsTransition Mission in Haiti was necessary to consolidategains already made. We must continue to provide materialand other support to strengthen Haiti’s democracy and itseconomic development. These are necessary pillars for theestablishment of durable peace and stability in that country.Trinidad and Tobago  as a member of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  pledges to continue to do its partin consolidating this process. It is in this context that wewelcomed Haiti as the fifteenth member State ofCARICOM at the meeting last July of the Heads ofGovernment of CARICOM  which was held in MontegoBay in Jamaica. Trinidad and Tobago continues toparticipate in the efforts of the international community inthis transition period  as evidenced by the fact that aTrinidad and Tobago national  Ambassador ColinGranderson  is the Executive Director of the Organizationof American States/United Nations International CivilianMission in Haiti. It will also be recalled that Trinidad andTobago  as part of a hemispheric effort  participated in themilitary mission that restored the democratically electedPresident to Haiti and our efforts have continued at boththe civilian and military levels after that objective wasachieved.In the post-cold-war era  the world has witnessed anescalation in the abuse of human rights  including somecases of genocide and other heinous crimes againsthumanity. Trinidad and Tobago has always beenconcerned about such atrocities. Trinidad and Tobago isproud of the role it played in reintroducing on theinternational political and legal agenda the question of theestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.The Government of my country is heartened by theincreasing support for the establishment of theinternational criminal court and we welcome thesubstantial progress made thus far by the PreparatoryCommittee for its establishment. Trinidad and Tobagourges Member States to continue their constructive andactive participation during the forthcoming sessions of thePreparatory Committee. We further urge widerinvolvement in the process so as to ensure the successfulnegotiation of a widely acceptable statute  which will befinalized at a conference of plenipotentiaries to be held inRome in the summer of 1998.It is because of this concern for the promotion andprotection of human rights and our absolute condemnationof acts of genocide and crimes against humanity thatTrinidad and Tobago participated at the highest levelthrough our President  Mr. Arthur N. R. Robinson  at aconference in Italy on reining in impunity forinternational crimes and serious violations of fundamentalhuman rights. That conference addressed issues pertainingto the ongoing work of the Preparatory Committee andunanimous support was expressed for a permanentinternational criminal court to ensure that perpetrators ofsuch crimes are brought to justice.Linked to the considerations of peace and securityare the myriad socio-economic problems which continueto undermine the stability of our nations. In this regard the international community has sought to respond byconvening a series of world conferences to analyse theglobal situation and provide blueprints for action at thenational  regional and international levels.6A continuing concern for the Government of Trinidadand Tobago remains the failure on the part of theinternational community to provide adequate resources forthe accelerated implementation of the commitments madeat these conferences. Any reform of the United Nationssystem aimed at delivering mandated programmes in amore efficient manner must therefore take this factor intoaccount.The World Summit for Social Development  whichwas held in Copenhagen in 1995  highlighted the urgentneed to eradicate poverty and to develop policies topromote social and economic equity. In October 1996  as afollow-up to the World Summit for Social Development  aCaribbean Ministerial Meeting on Poverty Eradication washeld in Port-of-Spain  Trinidad and Tobago. The assembledMinisters developed a Plan of Action on povertyeradication  which is guiding Governments of the region inthe elaboration of their own national plans. In this regard the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has adopted andis vigilantly pursuing as one of its primary objectives apolicy of sustained economic growth with equity  withspecial emphasis on poverty eradication.My Government recognizes the central role ofeducation and its impact on the eradication of poverty andwe have begun to reform the curriculum to give all childrenequal access to quality education as we strive continuouslyin Trinidad and Tobago towards achieving a “total qualitynation”. Education  in itself  is central to the Government’sobjective of producing a total quality nation  in which allour citizenry strives for excellence  is committed to thehighest standards  is technologically equipped to deal withthe realities of a knowledge-based work environment and isafforded opportunities for life-long learning.In addition  the Government of Trinidad and Tobagohas established mechanisms for addressing the scourge ofpoverty and societal inequities through the followinginitiatives.First  we established a change-management unit forpoverty eradication and equity-building  which reports to aMinisterial Council on Social Development. This Councilwas launched in October 1996  with the assistance of thePoverty Strategies Initiative of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP). The Governmentapplauds UNDP’s support.Secondly  we set up a Committee on SocialDisplacement. The Committee’s terms of reference includethe development of holistic plans to provide relief to allhomeless and destitute persons.Thirdly  expenditure on several other social safety-net schemes has been significantly increased in order todeal with problems and issues affecting women  theelderly  children  adolescents  the disabled and thedispossessed.These measures have been recognized and indeedreflected by UNDP in its 1997 Human DevelopmentReport  which lists Trinidad and Tobago at the top of thehuman poverty index rankings. According to the Report Trinidad and Tobago is among those countries whichhave reduced human poverty to a human poverty indexvalue of less than 10 per cent.We must all continue to support efforts for theeradication of poverty in accordance with agreedprogrammes and plans of action. The assault on poverty especially rural poverty  must take into account thespecial needs of women and their full integration in thedevelopment process.Trinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes theprogress achieved by the United Nations in following upthe Fourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijingin September 1995  which had as one of its primaryobjectives the need to accord high priority to genderissues. It welcomes as well the appointment of a high-level official as a special adviser to the Secretary-Generalon gender issues and the advancement of women.Social and economic problems transcend nationalboundaries and therefore require international solutionsbased on strengthened global partnerships to supportaction. When the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago The Honourable Basdeo Panday  addressed the fifty-firstsession of the United Nations General Assembly  heidentified a number of social problems which pose aparticular threat to the stability and integrity of smallStates. Among the problems he mentioned were drugabuse and drug trafficking and the associated problems ofmoney laundering and trafficking in small arms  as wellas terrorism and social disintegration.Trinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes theconvening of the special session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly on illicit drugs  to be held in NewYork in June 1998. This session should provide anappropriate opportunity for Governments to reviewprogress made in implementing the Global Programme of7Action on drugs adopted in February 1990 and serve tointensify drug-control strategies and cooperation worldwide.The drug scourge and its attendant consequencesrequire action at different levels. To that end  CaribbeanGovernments have decided to establish a criminal justiceprotection programme that would facilitate cooperation inthe confidential protection of witnesses  jurors  judicial andlaw enforcement personnel and their families. If thisprogramme is to be successfully implemented  additionaltraining and technical assistance from the internationalcommunity and agencies such as the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme will be required.The United Nations has a critical role to play  but it isthe responsibility — indeed  the duty — of every State toact aggressively in this regard. Conscious of itsresponsibility  the Government of Trinidad and Tobago hasembarked upon initiatives to curb the illicit drug trade anderadicate the associated downstream activity of moneylaundering.These initiatives are in keeping with internationalconventions and declarations  such as the United NationsConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances  the Commonwealth Schemerelating to Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and theInter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance inCriminal Matters. Trinidad and Tobago has also enteredinto bilateral agreements with other countries to fostercooperation with regard to arresting the growth oftransnational crimes associated with trafficking.Our Government has declared its commitment toeliminating the threats to the stability  security and safetyof our society that emanate from the scourge of the illicitdrug trade. Some of the measures taken include thefollowing.The first measure is the signing of an agreement onmaritime counter-drug operations with the United States ofAmerica. This bilateral mechanism has already proved to bevery effective in dealing with the pernicious drug trade.The second measure is the extension of theGovernment’s powers of extradition and the negotiation ofagreements with countries with which it does not now haveextradition agreements. We are renegotiating existingagreements to make extradition procedures more effective.Trinidad and Tobago is also fulfilling its obligations underexisting extradition treaties.The third measure is the serious implementation ofmoney- laundering drug laws. The illicit gains of the drugtrade and the resource base of drug criminals are beingattacked. The property and profits of drug lords are beingconfiscated as a result of measures which have beenintroduced in my country.Also  a task force to counter narcotics and moneylaundering has been established and the Government ispursuing law reform in the area of bank secrecy.Another measure is that Trinidad and Tobago —with the cooperation of other CARICOM Governments Canada  Britain and the United States of America — hascreated a witness protection programme. In addition  weare establishing the criminal justice protection programmeto which I alluded earlier.Finally  we continue to seek bilateral and multilateralassistance in various forms  such as equipment  personnel aircraft and maritime support in our relentless fightagainst illicit drugs.Earlier I referred to the efforts to reform thisOrganization. One of the key issues that will engage theattention of delegations at the fifty-second session is thequestion of the reform of the intergovernmentalmachinery. We are particularly interested in efforts atreform and reconstruction  especially as they relate to thedevelopment activities of the United Nations. We viewwith satisfaction the Secretary-General’s proposal introduced last March  that the new structure of theSecretariat should serve to bolster support for Africa’sdevelopment  South-South cooperation and the sustainabledevelopment of small island States.Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the recent decisionof the nineteenth special session of the General Assemblyto hold a comprehensive review of the United NationsGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States. That Conference  whichwas held in Barbados in 1994  was of historicsignificance  marking as it did the recognition on the partof the international community of the special situation andneeds of small islands.The Barbados Declaration and Programme of Actionhave as their overall objective the management ofenvironmental problems  the management of our vitalnatural resources and the improvement of human-resourcecapability and institutional requirements for sustainabledevelopment of small island States in the overall context8of Agenda 21. We look forward to the full support of theUnited Nations and the international community when thecomprehensive review and appraisal of the implementationof the Barbados Programme of Action takes place in 1999.A new phase of international cooperation for theCaribbean region was heralded in May 1997 at the firstmeeting of the secretariats of CARICOM and the UnitedNations  from which emanated a work programme for theimplementation of special projects. We commend thisinitiative and are confident that this new relationship will beof benefit to the people of the Caribbean region.The volcanic eruptions in Montserrat bring to the forethe vulnerability of small islands to natural disasters. Thisphenomenon and other environmental problems havereceived increased recognition since the 1992 RioConference on Environment and Development. Trinidad andTobago shares the anguish felt by the citizens of theCaribbean island of Montserrat  which is fast becominguninhabitable. CARICOM member States have respondedwithin their limited capabilities to the disaster  and we willcontinue to provide logistic and other support.To this end  Trinidad and Tobago  in response to theplight of the Government and people of Montserrat  haspledged financial and technical assistance  medical andother relief and engineering personnel  and has beeninvolved in the establishment of a CARICOM village in thenorthern part of the island of Montserrat — a decision thatwas taken at the recent conference of CARICOM Heads ofGovernment. Within our available resources  Trinidad andTobago will continue to be of assistance.The special concerns of small island developing Stateswere also incorporated in the recently adopted Agenda forDevelopment. The Agenda recognizes the fact thateconomic development  social development andenvironmental protection are interdependent and mutuallyreinforcing components of sustainable development  and arethe basis for the achievement of a higher quality of life forall people. The Government of Trinidad and Tobagoattaches great significance to this issue. We are thereforepursuing economic  social and infrastructural developmentin a sustainable way which avoids environmentaldegradation  conserves our natural resource endowment andhelps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity tosupport rising standards of living for the population  as wellas opportunities for self-actualization.Recent steps to promote sustainable development inTrinidad and Tobago in the area of environmentalmanagement include: the establishment of anenvironmental management authority and drafting of anational environmental policy; the development ofenvironmental standards; the preparation of a waterresources management strategy; the development of anational parks and watershed management project; and thecommissioning of a study to assist in establishing a policyframework and facilities for the management of oil andhazardous wastes.Trinidad and Tobago has also ratified severalinternational conventions relating to the environment: theMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the OzoneLayer; the 1994 United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change; the 1994 Basel Convention on theControl of Transboundary Movements of HazardousWastes and Their Disposal; and the 1996 Convention onBiological Diversity.In the area of macroeconomic policy  we haveproceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes tofoster enhanced competitiveness; streamline the incentiveframework; privatize State-owned enterprises to promoteincreasing levels of private investment; promoteentrepreneurial activity through  among other measures  aventure capital regime; and to modernize and strengthenintellectual property legislation to encourage investmentand the transfer of technology.In the social sector  the Government has focused onrationalization and restructuring of the social servicedelivery system; expanding access to education for theschool-age population; rationalization and strengtheningof the health services through the health sector reformprogramme; regularization of squatter communities;restructuring of the unemployment relief programme toallow for skill acquisition through on-the-job training; theestablishment of a community development fund toprovide financing for the delivery of basic social servicesand infrastructure to the poor and vulnerable populationgroups and communities; and the provision of institutionalsupport for the strengthening of non-governmentalorganizations and community-based organizations to assistin this regard.Trinidad and Tobago is a cosmopolitan society inwhich the human rights of each individual areconstitutionally guaranteed. We endeavour to achieve thecherished ideal of a truly democratic nation  in which allpersons live together in harmony  with equal opportunitiesfor all  in order that each individual may contribute to theprocess of national development. In this context  one of9the primary goals of the Government of Trinidad andTobago has been to seek to wider participation in thedecision-making process through a strengthened localgovernment machinery in a manner that will promote theempowerment of local communities in the pursuit ofdevelopment efforts and the promotion of good governance.In a similar vein  the United Nations  with thediversity of its membership  must harness individual andcollective strengths to advance the interests of all Membersof the Organization as we move into a new millennium. Inthis regard  Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the ongoingdiscussions aimed at reforming the membership andworking procedures of the Security Council. It is our hopethat this process will result in a Council whose compositionmore accurately reflects the wider membership of theGeneral Assembly and whose working procedures are moreopen and inclusive than has previously been the norm.We all need to work steadfastly to improve the imageof the United Nations from one of goal-setting to one whichfacilitates prompt action by Members in a manner that isconsistent and wide-ranging and takes into account thespecial needs of the most vulnerable among us.It is incumbent on all Member States to imbue ourOrganization with a renewed sense of self-confidence  faithand optimism and to work in a global partnership toachieve the goals and ideals of the United Nations. We owethis legacy to present and future generations."
"161",6955,"TUN",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to begin by expressing my warmestcongratulations to the President upon his election. We areconfident that his experience  know-how and broadunderstanding of international issues will be invaluable incarrying out the noble mission that has been entrusted tohim and will provide the best possible assurance of thesuccess of this session. His election to the presidencyreflects the very special respect the international communityhas for his friendly country  Ukraine  because of its wisepolicy  based on moderation and a sense of proportion andalso because of the efforts it is making to consolidate theprinciples of peace  justice and cooperation as thefoundation of relations between States.I also wish to express our warmest thanks andgratitude to last year's President  His Excellency Mr. RazaliIsmail  who throughout his term in office distinguishedhimself by the dedication and loyalty with which he carriedout his functions  playing a remarkable role in the reformof the United Nations and its restructuring and adaptationto the changes occurring in the world  and in preparing itto enter the twenty-first century with greater efficiency.Reform of the United Nations and its restructuring areundoubtedly in the forefront of the issues on this session'sagenda  particularly since Secretary-General Kofi Annanhas kept the promise he made when he took office andhas submitted a report on reform of the Organization thatcontains numerous measures and recommendations thatare important for the Organization's future. It is withpleasure that I pay tribute to Secretary-General KofiAnnan for all the initiatives he has taken and the boldproposals he has made since taking office a short whileago with a view to reforming the Secretariat andrationalizing its functioning.Tunisia  which took an active part in the discussionsheld in the various working groups entrusted with thereform process  wishes to underscore the primeimportance of the issues raised in the Secretary-General'sreport  both those that fall within his competenceregarding coordination between the different Departmentsof the Secretariat and between the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies and those reforms that concern theUnited Nations activities and fall within the competenceof the General Assembly  in connection with which theAssembly will adopt relevant resolutions.There is no doubt that the international communityis motivated by a sincere will to give a powerful impetusto the reform process to enable the United Nations toaccomplish the tasks provided for in the Charter  whetherwith regard to achieving security and peace in the worldor to establishing conditions for sustainable development two closely related  complementary goals.In our view  the most important priority of thereform process is to focus on strengthening the UnitedNations role in achieving development and in reducingand eradicating poverty  mobilizing the means required sothat developing countries can achieve economic and socialdevelopment and meet the crucial challenges imposedupon them by globalization and by the market economy.Notwithstanding the well-being and prosperity thattechnological progress and globalization of the economyhave brought to certain countries  while others have beenexcluded  the world's economy continues to suffer fromimbalances that hinder growth in developing countries andendanger international stability. We consider it essentialto give priority to these situations in United Nationsprogrammes and activities in order to narrow the chasmthat exists between States  give new impetus tointernational cooperation in the field of economic andsocial development and strengthen the United Nationscapacity for effective and efficient action in this regard.Tunisia stresses the need to strengthen the role of theUnited Nations in the field of development in order to19consolidate the General Assembly's prerogatives with regardto preparing cooperation policies and monitoring theirexecution. The United Nations continues to be the idealforum for this within the framework of the internationalcommunity. That also requires that Member States honourtheir financial commitments to the United Nations in orderto provide the necessary means required for successfulreform  the realization of the United Nations variousprogrammes and rational  judicious use of resources.In this connection Tunisia once again reaffirms itssupport for the restructuring of the Security Council toensure a fairer representation of Member States and toguarantee the interests of developing countries within theframework of equality for all Member States  consecratingthe spirit of the Charter and giving concrete expression toits principles. In this regard  my country would recall thelegitimate claim of the African States  as expressed at theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Summit Meeting heldat Tunis in June 1994 and reaffirmed at the recent OAUSummit at Harare  calling for the allocation of twopermanent seats on the Security Council to be occupied byAfrican States on a rotating basis.It is also important to continue to improve the workingmethods of the Security Council and to implement fully theprocedures stipulated in the Council's rules of procedure toensure the effective participation of United Nations MemberStates and their collective responsibility for maintaininginternational peace and security.The maintenance of international peace and securityand the elimination of the hotbeds of tensions  conflicts andwars that still rage in many regions of the world are today in addition to the problems of development  at the forefrontof the international community's concerns  and theycontinue to require determined and consistent action by theUnited Nations.In this context  Tunisia emphasizes the importance ofthe role the United Nations must play with regard to thesituation in the Middle East in the light of the dangerousdevelopments that are taking place there. The UnitedNations has followed the Palestinian problem since the verybeginning and has had a special responsibility to thePalestinian people from the adoption of the resolution onthe partition of Palestine until the formulation of the basicprinciples of a pacific settlement of the Arab-Israeliconflict.Tunisia has stood by the Palestinian people in theirstruggle to recover their legitimate rights and for 12 yearswas home to the Palestine Liberation Organization. It hasfollowed  from a position of neutrality  the Middle Eastpeace process and played  at the behest of its of President a historic role in triggering that process. It has supportedthe process at every stage  beginning with the initialcontacts between the conflicting parties  at the MadridConference  and in the Oslo  Washington and Cairoagreements. Tunisia was also a party to the multilateralnegotiations. As such  Tunisia wishes here to express itsprofound concern and indignation at the obstruction ofthis process and at the freezing of the agreements that ledup to it  as well as at the renewed dangers of conflict violence and instability in the region.We denounce the Israeli Government's policy offait accompli  its failure to respect the internationalagreements that have been signed and the unilateralmeasures it has taken in building colonies inside andoutside Al Quds  destroying houses  confiscating identitycards  inflicting collective reprisals against the Palestinianpeople  seizing their financial assets  continuing to besiegethem and taking all sorts of other arbitrary measures. Wecall emphatically for a return to the basic references thathave been part of the peace process since its inception particularly the principle of land for peace  and forrespect of international legality on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978) and the relevant General Assembly resolutions.Furthermore  we call for the implementation of all theprovisions of the agreement pertaining to the transitionstage  including the second redeployment  the opening ofa secure road between the West Bank and Gaza  theopening of the airport and the port  the release ofprisoners and the beginning of the final statusnegotiations  in accordance with the agreed-uponschedule.The international community  particularly in themeetings of the Security Council and the threeconsecutive meetings of the tenth emergency specialsession of the General Assembly  has already condemnedthe current Israeli Government's policy of buildingsettlements in Al Quds and in the occupied Palestinianterritories. This policy has greatly discouraged thePalestinian community and international opinion ingeneral  particularly since it has given rise to acts ofviolence for which Israel bears sole responsibility  giventhe profound despair that has replaced the relief that hadbeen felt throughout the entire region.Tunisia exhorts the international community  andespecially the two sponsors of peace  to act expeditiouslyand firmly to save the peace and avert the dangers that20threaten the region so that the Palestinian people is able torecover its legitimate rights to the creation of anindependent State on its own soil with Al-Quds Al-Sharifas its capital  and to ensure the restoration to Syria andLebanon of the territories which Israel has occupied.We note with satisfaction the United States'resumption of efforts to save the peace process  notably themeeting held yesterday in New York between the partiesconcerned. We also welcome the efforts being made torestore confidence among the parties concerned with a viewto helping them overcome the current crisis and achieve anequitable settlement of the Palestinian problem and theArab-Israeli conflict as a whole. We feel that actionsundertaken to date to mitigate the risks of tension andconflict in the region remain far below what we had hoped.Tunisia regrets the deterioration of the currentfinancial situation of the United Nations Relief and WorksAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) which hinders its mission to alleviate the suffering of thePalestinian people. While reaffirming the internationalcommunity's responsibility for the question of Palestinianrefugees  we urge it to continue to provide assistance toUNRWA in order to allow it to carry out its mandate fullyand resume its work. We urge all donors countries tomaintain and honour their financial commitment and toincrease their contribution to the Agency budget  taking intoaccount the natural growth in the number of Palestinianrefugees  in order to allow the Agency to overcome itssevere financial crisis.Tunisia's awareness of the importance in today's worldof economic and geographic groupings to meeting thechallenges of globalization and the changes we are currentlywitnessing encourages us to be firm and consistent inpursuing our efforts to complete the construction of theArab Maghreb Union. The Union represents a particularclaim made by the peoples of our region and one of thegoals that we  together with the leaders of our brotherMaghreb countries  are striving to attain.This strategic option for the future of the peoples ofthe region and their cooperation with their immediateenvironment is strengthened by the efforts our country ismaking  under the impetus of President Ben Ali  toconstruct a Euro-Mediterranean area that will serve as aframework for cooperation among the Mediterraneanriparian countries  for solidarity among their peoples andfor cultural and social dialogue in the context of the noblevalues and principles in which we all believe. Our countryhas already assumed a distinctive role in ensuring thesuccess of the various meetings and conferences held tothis end  from the preparatory meeting of the region'sMinisters for Foreign Affairs held in Tabarka  Tunisia  tothe Barcelona conference and the meetings that followed.Our country gave concrete expression to this option in1995 by signing an association agreement with theEuropean Union.We believe that it has become imperative to respondfavourably to the willingness of the Libyan ArabJamahiriya to settle the Lockerbie question in a fair andhonourable manner in the framework of proposals madeby the League of Arab States  the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Theseproposals can help to achieve a peaceful solution basedon international legality and thereby hasten the end of thesuffering being endured by the brother Libyan peopleunder the embargo. They would also strengthen stabilityin that part of the Mediterranean.We also take this opportunity to call for an end tothe suffering that has been inflicted upon the Iraqi peoplefor a number of years now. We hope that relations amongthe States of the Gulf region will be based on respect forthe sovereignty of all the States of the region  theirterritorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil. In this context  Tunisia once again reaffirms itssolidarity with the United Arab Emirates in the peacefulefforts they are making to recover the islands of GreaterTunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.The success of the United Nations in achievinginternational peace and security does not rest only onpeacekeeping operations  preventive diplomacy and thepeaceful settlement of conflict. It also requires progressand accomplishments in the field of disarmament. Despitethe end of the cold war and the achievement of a numberof positive results  particularly in limiting the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  these weapons —particularly nuclear weapons — continue seriously tothreaten all mankind.Tunisia  which has ratified all the internationalconventions on the subject  reiterates its appeals for theestablishment of a denuclearized zone  free of all weaponsof mass destruction  in the Middle East. This appeal hasbeen supported by the accession to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of all the countriesof the region with the exception of Israel  which hasneither ratified the Treaty nor placed its nuclear facilities21under the system of international controls  therebyendangering the security and integrity of the entire region.There are many regions of the world that continue tobe torn by war and conflict and whose populations areconfronted with tragic situations as a result of instability insecurity  famine and destitution. We nonetheless note withsatisfaction that  despite the persistence of hotbeds oftension and instability in some of these regions  the Africancontinent is beginning truly to awaken to the possibility ofrestored security and renewed economic growth in anumber of its regions and countries.Tunisia welcomes the development of the situation inAfrica and the sincere determination of member countriesof the Organization of African Unity to pursue the reformsthat have been undertaken to restructure economies andconsolidate democracy. At the same time  my countryreiterates the appeal made by President Ben Ali many timesto the international community for increased attention to bepaid to the continent's problems in order to eradicate onceand for all the hotbeds of tension that remain in Africa  sothat security and stability may be instituted throughout thecontinent  enabling all its peoples to devote themselves towork and to economic development.In this context  the role to be played by the UnitedNations in assisting the countries concerned to overcomethese difficulties and challenges assumes primaryimportance. It is a role that should be seen in the context ofthe prime responsibility that our international Organizationassumes in preserving peace and security and in confirmingthe fact that the United Nations is irreplaceable in theseendeavours. However  this in no way minimizes theimportance that should be given to the action of regionalorganizations  whose role has grown in recent years making their influence visible and palpable.Our country emphasizes the importance of the roledevoted to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution  which was set up by theOrganization of African Unity for all issues related tosecurity and stability on the African continent. This clearlydoes not prevent us from supporting any internationalinitiative that is consistent with this essential principle andthat reinforces African efforts to preserve peace andsecurity on our continent.We applaud the efforts of the United NationsSecretariat to stimulate cooperation and to promoteconsultation with the Organization of African Unity tostrengthen its capacity for preventing conflicts andmaintaining peace. Numerous African States  includingTunisia  have declared their willingness to participate inthe standby arrangements for peacekeeping  therebydemonstrating their determination to contribute to UnitedNations efforts to improve the methods of organizingUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. There is nodoubt that the promotion of international cooperation particularly in the field of training and logistics  canensure the success of the standby forces  thereby makingit the basic formula for the establishment of UnitedNations peacekeeping forces. In this regard  we reaffirmTunisia's unswerving desire to make a real contribution tothe efforts of the United Nations to preserve internationalpeace and security.Our country has contributed both military andcivilian contingents to many United Nations peacekeepingoperations — from the Congo in the early 1960s to othersimilar operations in a number of African countries; inCambodia; in Bosnia and Herzegovina; in Croatia; andrecently in Haiti — thus giving concrete evidence of itsfaith in international action and cooperation carried out bythe Organization. Tunisia will continue to support andassist United Nations peacekeeping operations whenevernecessary.In order to meet the challenges generated byglobalization and openness in the world economy  Tunisiahas introduced substantial and coherent reforms in thepolitical  economic and social fields to ensure society'sequilibrium and integrity and the solidarity of itsmembers  thereby eliminating the negative factors thatcould hinder this: exclusion  neglect of the human aspectin development  and the creation of chasms betweensocial categories resulting from disparate levels ofdevelopment within a given society.We are convinced that global development can beachieved only when the vulnerable sectors of society havebeen assured the conditions for integration with economicdynamics. This requires uprooting the causes of poverty destitution and marginalization  which is consistent withthe commitment to promote solidarity and mutualassistance between the members of society on the nationallevel  and efforts being made in that direction on theinternational level.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsafforded the leaders of Member countries an opportunityto confirm their determination to revitalize the role of theUnited Nations and to confer upon its actions greaterdynamism at a time when problems of security 22development and environment multiply  requiring jointefforts and shared determination to face them with a viewto achieving progress  prosperity and well-being for all.The success of the United Nations remains contingentupon action in accordance with the goals and principlesenshrined in its Charter. It is also conditioned by thecommitment of all countries  large and small  to implementdecisions which uphold the values of liberty  dignity andjustice. In so doing we will respond to the aspirations ofour peoples who are the essential guarantors of the UnitedNations vitality and of its capacity for renewal  durabilityand ability to meet the challenges which humanity willconfront during the next century."
"162",7002,"TUR",52,1997,"﻿It is a great pleasure for me tocongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly. I am confidentthat under his able leadership  the work of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly will be asuccess. I should also like to express our appreciation toAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the way inwhich he presided over the General Assembly during itsprevious session. I also express my warm congratulationsto His Excellency Kofi Annan on his election to the postof Secretary-General of the United Nations.The relative euphoria created by the end of the coldwar is being replaced by a sense of realism. Although thepossibility of a global confrontation has been considerablyreduced  ensuring security and preserving stabilitycontinue to be a major concern for the internationalcommunity. We are witnessing the eruption of conflictsand serious tensions of a regional character as well aswithin individual States.Critical disparities in economic and social conditionsexist around the globe. Large segments of the world’spopulation live in conditions of dire poverty. Achievingsustainable development remains a great challenge for theworld community. On the other hand  the contemporaryvalues we share  such as democracy  pluralism  tolerance human rights and gender equality  require constantattention and effort.14Against this backdrop  international and regionalorganizations and  in particular  the United Nations  are inthe process of redefining their role and functions in orderto cope with new realities and challenges. The discussionsand recent efforts to reform the United Nations haveproduced creative recommendations. Here  I wish tocongratulate the Secretary-General for his comprehensivereport. The far-reaching and substantive reform programmeproposed therein satisfies our expectations. We stronglysupport the reform programme. On the other hand  we alsoshare the serious concerns of the Secretary-General withregard to the need to put the Organization on a soundfinancial basis.We commend the Secretary-General for attaching thehighest priority to the goals of alleviating poverty andenhancing development. This is indispensable for theachievement and maintenance of peace and security  bothwithin and among nations. In this context  we appreciate theapproach taken by the Secretary-General that the envisagedcoordination of the Development Group must be done so asnot to weaken in any way the authority and independenceof the institutions in question  the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) in particular.Making human rights an integral part of all relevantUnited Nations operations is also a commendable goal. Weare pleased to see an eminent personality at the head ofUnited Nations activities in the human rights field. Thefiftieth anniversary  in 1998  of the adoption by the GeneralAssembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightswill provide the opportunity to reiterate our commitment topromote human rights all over the world.Elevating the standard of human rights to its highestlevel is the foremost duty and obligation of each Statetowards its own people. I should like to draw attention tothe human rights problems and to the discrimination facedin particular by migrant workers and their families in somedeveloped countries. The protection and promotion of theirhuman  economic  social  cultural and political rights arematters of major concern in the human rights field.In this respect  Turkey supports the idea of a worldconference on racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia andrelated intolerance. It would be a milestone in the decades-long struggle waged by the United Nations against racismand racial discrimination.Turkey also supports the efforts envisaged in thereform programme to enhance the capabilities of the UnitedNations to deal with transnational organized crime narcotics and terrorism. One of the most important threatsour world faces today is problems related to drug abuse.The special session of the United Nations to be held nextyear will enable us to chart the way for the new measuresthat must be taken in view of the threat posed by drugtrafficking.The scourge of our age  no doubt  is terrorism. It isa threat to human rights and democratic institutions. Itviolates the most fundamental of all human rights: theright to life. It does not recognize boundaries.International cooperation is imperative in the fight againstterrorism  and countries that refrain from participating inthis cooperation must be condemned by the internationalcommunity. We believe that the time has come to draft aglobal treaty on combating terrorism. In the same vein we think that terrorist crimes should be included withinthe competence of the international criminal court that isto be established.The Secretary-General has proposed significantmeasures that bring the arms-control agenda to theforefront of multilateral cooperation. Renewed emphasisshould be placed on the work of the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva  with a view to endingproduction of fissile material for weapons purposes.The United Nations Register of Conventional Armsshould become an effective tool for monitoring armstransfers. Likewise  the international community shouldexert vigorous efforts to end illicit arms trafficking as akey element in the international struggle against terrorism.Peacekeeping stands out as one of the mostsignificant undertakings of the United Nations. Thedevelopment of the peacekeeping capability of the UnitedNations remains a pressing need  and one that Turkeysupports wholeheartedly. Turkey has taken part  andcontinues to participate  in several peacekeepingoperations.The ongoing work aimed at improving therepresentative character of the Security Council increasing the Council’s effectiveness and efficiency andadapting it to current realities of the internationalcommunity is of particular importance. Reform of theSecurity Council constitutes the most serious attempt inyears to enhance the role and moral authority not only ofthe Council  but also of the United Nations as a worldorganization.15We have to ensure that the envisaged enlargement andfuture composition of the Security Council will correspondto the expectations of the largest possible segment of theUnited Nations membership. The reform process has to takeinto consideration the fundamental changes which havetaken place on the international scene and recognize theability and readiness of a group of States to assume agreater and more effective role. These States should begiven the opportunity to serve on the Security Council morefrequently and on a more regular basis. Security Councilreform is too important to be tied to the settlement of otherissues; it must satisfy the general membership and enhancethe role and authority of the Organization.Located at the crossroads of three continents andseveral regions  including the Balkans  the Middle East  theCaucasus  the Mediterranean and Central Asia  Turkeystands ready to play an even greater role in the maintenanceof peace  security and stability in its wider region. Today the historical and cultural attributes of this vast geography more than ever  find expression in Turkey’s foreign policyin terms of hopes and opportunities.A return to normalcy in Iraq and its reintegration withthe international community are of vital importance for allcountries of the region. Turkey supports the preservation ofthe independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity ofIraq. Turkey has been fully complying with the UnitedNations sanctions regime imposed on Iraq. On the otherhand  it is a fact that the sanctions have also producedtotally unforeseen and negative effects on the economies ofthird countries as well as on the economy of Iraq. Turkeystands at the forefront of those countries which have beendirectly and most adversely affected by the sanctionsregime. This unacceptable situation reminds us of the verypertinent remark of the former Secretary-General that“Sanctions are a measure taken collectively by theUnited Nations to maintain or restore internationalpeace and security. The costs involved ... should beborne ... by all Member States and not exclusively bythe few who have the misfortune to be neighbours ormajor economic partners of the target country.”[A/50/60  para. 73]We expect the Security Council to expeditiously considerTurkey’s application to the sanctions committee  and to takeappropriate action.The Middle East peace process has been the singlemost important positive development in that fragile regionin the recent past. However  events have recently taken rather unexpectedly  an unfortunate and dangerous turn.Israeli settlement activities in the occupied territories carried out despite the relevant Security Council andGeneral Assembly resolutions and despite the provisionsof the peace accords  and abhorrent terrorist activities bythe enemies of peace have placed the peace process undera very severe strain. We urge the parties to do theirutmost to establish mutual trust  without which it will beimpossible to attain the objectives of the peace process.Afghanistan is another conflict area where theinternational community has so far been unable to helpbring about a just and lasting solution. At present  eventhe national unity of the Afghan people is at stake. It ismost unfortunate that the warring factions have beenfervently pursuing the military option. Regrettably  one ofthe major obstacles to convincing the factions that amilitary solution is unattainable is the continuing supplyof weapons  equipment and ammunition  along withmilitary involvement from outside.My country has close historical ties with Afghanistanand the Afghan people. We feel very strongly about theindependence  sovereignty  territorial integrity andnational unity of Afghanistan. Taking this opportunity  Iwish to reiterate Turkey’s readiness to host  incooperation with the United Nations  an intra-Afghanmeeting if and when all the parties are ready toparticipate.Turkey attaches particular importance to bringing itshistorical  close relations of friendship and cooperationwith Balkan countries to the highest level. We support themultilateral initiatives aimed at securing peace  stabilityand cooperation in South-East Europe. Bosnia andHerzegovina continues to be a focus of the internationalcommunity. The preservation of the independence sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Bosnia andHerzegovina is a continuing responsibility undertaken bythe United Nations. The full implementation of theDayton Peace Agreement has not yet been secured. Whilethe Federation has been working hard to implement thePeace Agreement  other quarters have been obstructingthe whole process. The successful effort in July on thepart of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) to apprehend andbring before the Tribunal war crimes suspects who remainat large was a commendable move. In order to achievereconciliation and ensure peace and security in Bosniaand Herzegovina  it is essential to prove that crimescommitted will not go unpunished. The return of refugeesand displaced persons to their homes constitutes another16essential element for achieving lasting peace and stabilityin the country.SFOR  to which my country is a troop contributor  hasplayed a significant role in Bosnia for the maintenance ofpeace and order since the signing of the Peace Agreement.We believe that the continued presence of an internationalforce in the area is crucial for durable peace.Albania and its people have passed through verydifficult times. Ensuring internal peace and stability inAlbania was a prerequisite for the preservation of peace andstability in the whole region. The multinational protectionforce  in which  again  my country took part  succeeded inrestoring stability and order in the country. It was thuspossible for the Albanian people to hold the parliamentaryelections that paved the way for the resolution of the crisis.However  Albania still faces a difficult road on theway to full administrative  social and economic recovery.The need for concerted international support remains.Sharing close historical and cultural ties with the Albanianpeople  Turkey will continue to be of support to Albania.In our relations with Greece  our principal objective isto promptly tackle  through a substantive and result-orienteddialogue  the issues  mostly related to the Aegean  that stillstand between our two countries. To this end  we havemade several appeals to Greece to agree to a dialogue andto begin a process with a view to settling our differences.We do not rule out any agreed method of peacefulsettlement of our differences. Furthermore  we haveunilaterally implemented a number of confidence-buildingmeasures in the hope that they would be reciprocated. Weexpect that the group of “Wisemen”  consisting of two non-governmental personalities from Turkey and Greece respectively  will be able to finally meet without furtherdelay. This group has the task of preparing a report to besubmitted to both Governments with non-bindingrecommendations for dealing with the issues.We also eagerly await the translation into concretedeeds  to promote better relations between our twocountries  of the understanding reached during the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Madridlast July. Delaying this process by linking it to pre-conditions or artificial issues will not serve the interests ofeither country.It is evident that our bilateral problems cannot beresolved by the effort of Turkey alone  and that mutualcommitment and the display of goodwill by both partiesare imperative.The Caucasus  as a gateway between East and West attracts world-wide attention politically and economically.We attach the highest significance to peace and stability as well as to the preservation and consolidation of theindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of thecountries of that neighbouring region. In this context  it isvitally important to bring about a just and lasting solutionto the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia on thebasis of international law. The Nagorny-Karabakh disputestill stands out as the principal obstacle to peace  securityand enhanced bilateral and multilateral cooperation in theregion  since more than one fifth of Azeri territoryremains under occupation. We urge that the Minskprocess and the decisions reached in that process will betaken seriously by all parties and that they will beimplemented.The efforts made within this context by theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)/Minsk Group should be carefully considered byall parties concerned. As a member of the Group  Turkeywill continue to contribute to these efforts.We welcome the recent August meeting in Tbilisibetween the parties to the Georgian-Abkhazian conflictand the signing of a statement by the leaders on thepeaceful and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.In this regard  I would like to stress that Turkey iscommitted to the sovereignty and territorial integrity ofGeorgia within its internationally recognized borders asstated in the Lisbon document of the OSCE.The Cyprus question has been on the agenda of theSecurity Council for almost 34 years. This roughlycorresponds to the presence of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in the island. It maybe high time to find a real answer to why a solution haseluded us all this time in spite of the dramatic changesthat have occurred both on the international scene and inCyprus  and despite all the commendable efforts ofsuccessive United Nations Secretaries-General.After so many years it would be wrong  I believe  tocontinue to link a 34-year-old failure to the lack ofpolitical will or to the intransigence of one side or theother. We should ask ourselves where we failed  why themistrust is still so deep in the island and whether we havemade the right diagnosis of this problem.17There are two distinct peoples  two separateadministrations and two democracies on the island. Alongwith these realities  bicommunality  bizonality and themaintenance of the 1960 system of guarantees should beconsidered as incontestable foundations for a settlement. Itis obvious that reluctance to recognize the realities in theisland  and the tendency to apply pressure to one side alone have not led us to a negotiated solution. The last tworounds of talks  in Troutbeck and in Glion  have solidifiedthis perception. We do believe that the lessons of the pastand current developments on the international scene shouldcompel us to adopt a realistic approach to the Cypriot issue.The establishment of an equilibrium between the legal andpolitical status of the two sides to the dispute could be astarting point for a rethinking process.Time is of the essence in initiating such a processsince one can foresee that in early 1998 a chain of eventsmight hinder efforts to find a negotiated settlement  andfurther increase the tension both on the island and in theregion. As witnessed in the recent face-to-face talks  thepursuit of European Union membership by the GreekCypriot side has become the main impediment to progress rendering the negotiating process increasingly meaninglessand an agreed settlement even more elusive. Turkey and theTurkish Cypriot side firmly believe that efforts to carryforward this process will cast a shadow on the talks andmight destroy the very foundation of the negotiationprocess.On various occasions  we have made our position clearon the issue of European Union membership of Cyprus.The 1959 and 1960 Treaties on Cyprus established aninternal institutional balance between the two communitiesof Cyprus and  simultaneously  an external balance ofinterests between Turkey and Greece in their relationshipwith Cyprus. These Treaties unequivocally preclude themembership of Cyprus in any international organization  orpolitical or economic union in which both Turkey andGreece are not members. Therefore  from a legal point ofview  Cyprus can join the European Union only after asolution and simultaneously with Turkey. From a politicalpoint of view  this also appears to be the only viableoutcome. We continue to entertain the hope that those whoare concerned will act with an awareness of their historicalresponsibility  as the time approaches toward a decision onan issue which will have a determining effect on the futurecourse of events in Cyprus.The deployment of S-300 missiles to southern Cyprusis another gloomy prospect. Coupled with ambitiousrearmament efforts that the Greek Cypriot side hasembarked upon  the purchase of highly sophisticatedmissiles aims at jeopardizing the security of the TurkishCypriot people and of Turkey. We sincerely hope that inthe end wisdom will prevail and this project  which mayseriously affect peace and stability in the entire region will be discontinued.The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece  in hisstatement earlier this afternoon  referred in a misleadingway to my country and to the Cyprus issue. Mydelegation will speak in exercise of its right of reply at alater stage in response to the allegations contained in thatstatement.The challenges of building and preserving peace andof achieving development are closely linked. The UnitedNations  having successfully ended the first 50 years ofits existence  is today well poised to take up these tasks.It is up to each Member State to make the best effort tocontribute to this process. Turkey is determined to do itsshare. We sincerely hope that this session of the GeneralAssembly will mark one more important step towards therealization of regional and global peace  stability  security cooperation  solidarity and prosperity on the eve of a newmillennium."
"163",7064,"TZA",52,1997,"﻿Pleasepermit me  Sir  at the outset  to offer my sincerecongratulations to you on your election to the Presidency ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. In thesame vein  our congratulations are directed to the membersof the Bureau on their election. I wish to assure you of thefull cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of thisheavy responsibility entrusted to you.I would also like to express my thanks to AmbassadorRazali Ismail of Malaysia for the able manner in which hedischarged his responsibilities during his Presidency of thelast session. At this juncture  I would like to pay a specialtribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his deserved election asSecretary-General of the United Nations and for the ablemanner in which he is carrying out his responsibilities.Looking at the agenda of this meeting  it is an historicmeeting of the General Assembly and you  Sir  will beremembered for many years to come. Personally  I feelproud and privileged to be associated with this meeting.Last year  here in New York  members of the Groupof 77 and China elected my country  Tanzania  to thechairmanship of the Group. The last nine months or so inthat post have been a very exciting and challengingexperience for me and my colleagues at our Mission to theUnited Nations and for the entire Government of the UnitedRepublic of Tanzania. We have been involved in severalmeetings  debates and negotiations on behalf of the Group.I am glad to say that  despite some setbacks  notablesuccess and progress have been made in all ourendeavours. All this was made possible through thecooperation  support and  above all  teamwork of allmembers of the Group. We thank all members for theirsupport.Two years ago  world leaders met here to celebrate50 years of the existence of the United Nations. Besidestaking stock of the progress made and the lessons learned the Heads of State or Government endeavoured to chartthe institutional framework and operational parametersthat could enhance the Organization's relevance andeffectiveness in a changed international environment. Inthis context  apart from the Organization's traditionalroles of maintaining international peace and security andproviding humanitarian assistance  it was also foundessential to place development cooperation issues at thecentre of United Nations activities. The United Nationsitself needed to undertake appropriate reform measures sothat it would be better able to deal with the challenges ofthe new global economy.To facilitate the reform process in the socio-economic field  developing countries participated activelyand effectively in work on the Agenda for Developmentto ensure the successful conclusion of the negotiations ofthis important process. These negotiations were completedin June 1997  and I should like to commend the Ad HocOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly onthis issue for its good work.Building on the outcome of recent United Nationsconferences and other relevant agreements  the Agendafor Development underscores that sustained economicgrowth is essential to the economic and socialdevelopment of all countries  in particular developingcountries. While acknowledging the importance ofnational policies and measures in the developmentprocess  the Agenda for Development calls for actiontowards a dynamic and enabling international economicenvironment  including such aspects as an open  rule-based  equitable  secure  non-discriminatory  transparentand predictable multilateral trading system and thepromotion of investment and the transfer of technologyand knowledge. Additionally  the Agenda calls forenhanced international cooperation in the mobilization andprovision of financial resources for development. It alsounderscores the need for an effective  equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the external21debt and debt-servicing problems of the developingcountries.Many developing countries are not able to benefitfrom the twin processes of the liberalization and theglobalization of the world economy. These processesbenefit some countries while causing instability andmarginalization in others  particularly in developingcountries. The least-developed countries face the greatestrisk of further marginalization. This is why they continueto demand that such uneven trends be addressed  and thatthe World Trade Organization and other relatedinternational organizations adopt specific and concretemeasures to mitigate the adverse effects arising from theimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements. Thesemeasures must include long-term financial and technicalsupport  the transfer of technology  and the improvement ofthe trade performance of the developing countries. It is alsonecessary to ensure full and effective participation of thedeveloping countries in the international economic decision-making processes.Concerning financial flows  it is imperative to reversethe overall decline in official development assistance and toachieve the agreed target of 0.7 per cent by the turn of thecentury. We appeal to developed countries to reaffirm theircommitments to meet this target. Other sources ofconcessional external financial assistance should also bestrengthened to enable them without conditionalities toincrease resources for disbursement in support of thedeveloping countries.In addition to official development assistance andmultilateral assistance  the growth in foreign directinvestment in developing countries is of particularimportance. However  foreign direct investment portfolioflows are going to very few developing countries  thosewhich are already growing fast; very little  or none  isgoing to the least-developed countries. For example  Africahas received only a small proportion of the total net privateflows  despite extensive reforms that continue to beundertaken. The challenge to the international communityin this respect is to ensure that adequate capital andinvestment flows also reach the least-developed countries soas to accelerate their pace of development. This could bedone through  inter alia  the improvement of economic andsocial infrastructure in the least-developed countries.External indebtedness is one of the major obstacles tothe development efforts of many developing countries. It isacknowledged that even with sound economic policies andwith full appreciation of the debt-rescheduling arrangementsin place  developing countries continue to face anunbearable debt-servicing burden. There is hence anurgent need for adopting durable solutions to externaldebt and debt-servicing problems  particularly those of theheavily indebted poor countries. More also needs to bedone in terms of debt stock cancellation and forgiveness.We appreciate recent initiatives to reduce debts  boththose within the Naples terms of the Paris Club  and thosewithin the multilateral framework  such as the heavilyindebted poor countries initiative of the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund. However  the criteria foreligibility should be more flexible to enable morecountries to benefit from these arrangements. As it isnow  it is almost a nightmare for a country to qualify interms of conditionalities involved and the time it takesbefore reaping the first benefits after qualifying. It is likebeing so near yet so far.The debate on development is closely interlinkedwith that on the environment. In June this year  a specialsession of the Assembly was held to review and appraisethe implementation of Agenda 21 five years on. It isregrettable that the special session came out with noconcrete agreement or commitments on the cross-cuttingissues of financial resources and technology transfer. Forwhile it was possible to agree on follow-up action onsome of the sectoral issues such as forests  energy climate change  desertification  fresh water and others lack of concrete agreement on issues related to financialresources and technology transfer militates againsteffective realization of the little that was agreed upon.In his statement at the special session on behalf ofthe Group of 77 and China  my President  His ExcellencyMr. Benjamin William Mkapa  emphasized that allcountries should rededicate themselves to the RioDeclaration in order to achieve the goals of sustainedeconomic growth and sustainable development. He furtherstressed the need for creating a more conduciveinternational economic environment  to enable developingcountries to gain access to new and additional resourcesand technology on concessional and grant terms. I wishto reiterate that call today.Other major international conferences and worldsummits held since 1990 will also come up for review inthe near future. It is our hope that a new spirit ofinternational partnership in resolving the various socio-economic problems facing  particularly  developingcountries will emerge and that international support forthe implementation of the various programmes of these22conferences will continue to be provided by theinternational community.In recent years  South-South cooperation has evolvedinto an important modality for addressing the developmentneeds of developing countries. We are convinced thatSouth-South cooperation provides a sound basis forpromoting economic growth and increasing technicalcapacities for acceleration of development in the developingcountries. The Group of 77 and China pledge to intensifyexisting cooperation and solidarity among its members witha view to sharing development experiences and solvingsome of the development problems facing them.I agree with the Secretary-General that reform of theUnited Nations is not an event but a process. GeneralAssembly resolution 50/227 and the Secretary-General'sproposals provide a basis for the discussion of UnitedNations reforms. However  we strongly feel that emphasisshould be placed on the overall policy thrust and mission ofthe Organization geared towards the strengthening of itseconomic role.Furthermore  institutions that deal with economicissues  such as the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD)  the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) and the relevantEconomic and Social Council bodies and regionalcommissions  should remain. They should also bestrengthened to ensure that the development concerns ofdeveloping countries are taken fully into account.As for the reform of the Security Council  my countrystands for more democratization and equity in this crucialorgan of the United Nations. We stand for the expansion ofits membership in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories  with the additional members in the permanentcategory getting veto power. The expansion in bothcategories should include not only Japan and Germany  butalso equitable representation of the developing countries ofAfrica  Asia and Latin America.All reforms must be conducive to realizing the broadpurposes and principles of the Charter and to improving theefficiency of the United Nations in all areas. They mustalso contribute to a more positive and effective UnitedNations role in promoting world peace and development and meet the aspirations of developing countries. I amconfident that we will be able to achieve a broad consensusas long as all of us engage in deliberations in good faithand with a readiness to consider all legitimate concerns.Tanzania appreciates the changes that have takenplace in the area of disarmament. The threat of nuclearwar may not at present manifest itself in the ideologicalconfrontation of the past  but it has not gone away orreceded. It is still with us  and we should guard againstany complacency that we are any safer today. Nationsstill possess nuclear warheads  and new generations ofthese weapons are being manufactured. The totalelimination of these weapons must continue to be thecentral purpose of our disarmament agenda.While nuclear weapons still pose a potentially gravethreat to international peace and security  conventionalones have had a devastating effect  particularly in areas ofconflict. Among these are anti-personnel landmines which maim and kill the innocent  even long after warhas ended. The effects of these weapons are evident allover the world  with their most violent manifestation incountries such as Angola  Cambodia  Mozambique andBosnia. Tanzania has supported  and will continue tosupport  a worldwide ban of these weapons through theframework of the Ottawa process and looks forward tobecoming an effective party to the instrument justconcluded in Oslo  Norway. At the same time  we hopethat the elimination of anti-personnel landmines will notbe seen as an end in itself  but as part of the overallobjective of eliminating other weapons  especiallyweapons of mass destruction.As the United Nations grapples with the challengesof peace and development  it is still faced with manypolitical problems which need urgent resolution ifhumanity is to prosper. From Latin America and theCaribbean to Europe  from Asia to the Middle East andAfrica  the United Nations is faced with the arduous taskof promoting peace  democracy and good governance asthe enduring pillars of development.We congratulate the people of Liberia for havingconducted a successful democratic election  which  wehope  has ushered in a new era of peace in that country.Now  as they seek to regain their footing and begin thearduous task of national reconciliation  healing andeconomic reconstruction  they will need the support of theinternational community.At a time when Liberia is emerging from destructionand suffering  we are deeply concerned that Sierra Leoneis sinking deeper into chaos at the expense of peace development and democracy for that country. TheGovernment of Tanzania has associated itself fully withthe efforts made within the framework of the23Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to restoredemocracy and constitutional rule in Sierra Leone. Even atthis late hour  we continue to hope that the Sierra Leoneanmilitary will realize the folly of their misadventure andagree to return their country to constitutional rule. In themeantime  the continuing efforts of the West Africanregion  and Africa in general  merit expanded support so asto put an end to the destructive cycle of military coups inSierra Leone.In Angola  we continue to be concerned by themanoeuvres of UNITA to stall the process ofimplementation of the Lusaka accords. Our concern is givenadded urgency by the steady degeneration of the situationin the country and the likelihood of a return to openhostilities and war  with all the destruction and sufferingthat portends for the people of that country. We urgeUNITA to abandon its obstructionist policies and abide bythe Lusaka peace accords. We hope the United Nations willremain engaged in Angola.The situation in the Great Lakes region remainsprecarious. The consequences of decades of misrule insome countries of the region have been horrendous in termsof suffering  war  death and lost opportunities to harness itsgreat development potential. We regret that the situation inBurundi shows no sign of improvement. The militaryauthorities have persisted in frustrating the efforts of theregion within the framework of the Arusha initiative  underthe chairmanship of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  to facilitatethe process of political dialogue.Tanzania and the other countries of the region arepersisting in their efforts because we believe there is noalternative to dialogue but war and more suffering forinnocent civilians. The region has no other interest inBurundi but to help. At the regional level  meetings wereheld in Arusha on 4 September  and the leaders reiteratedtheir commitment to the search for peace in Burundi andcalled upon the military authorities there to abandon thecourse of confrontation and seek dialogue and politicalaccommodation with all elements in Burundi.The region has been categorical in restating that theBurundi authorities should be under no illusion that theycan bury their heads in the sand or wish the problem away.They simply have to face reality and dutifully rise to theoccasion. Certainly the region and the internationalcommunity cannot leave them alone and allow them to leadthe country into self-destruction and war  with all theattendant problems that creates for Burundi and itsneighbours. I wish to appeal to the internationalcommunity to continue assisting the region so that ourgoal of restarting the dialogue for peace in the country isachieved.In Rwanda  fortunately  the situation is steadilystabilizing  particularly after the return of most of itscitizens  who had been coerced into a drifting life in exileas refugees. Yet the difficulties which face that countryare enormous. The process of recovery from the immensemoral  physical and spiritual effects of the 1994 genocidewill be painful and slow. As Rwanda struggles to cometo terms with the genocide  reconcile with itself andcontinue on the path of national healing and renewal  itneeds our solidarity and support.With President Laurent Kabila's assumption of theleadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  theprocess of returning to democratic rule has begun  albeitslowly. We realize that it will not be an easy or swiftprocess  given the political rigidity and the policies ofpolitical exclusion to which that country was subjected fordecades. We appreciate the enormity of the task ofputting the country back on its feet  restoring Governmentinstitutions and setting out towards democratic recovery.Given this background  what the Government and peopleof the Democratic Republic of the Congo need most issolidarity  understanding and material support from theinternational community.The political problems of the Great Lakes haveprecipitated a grave humanitarian challenge as millions ofpeople have been forced into a life of exile as refugees.This has placed an enormous burden on the countries ofthe region  including my own  which has had to shoulderit without commensurate resources. We appreciate thegreat work done by United Nations agencies and manyhumanitarian non-governmental organizations in terms ofproviding the much-needed assistance to the refugees.Indeed  without this support  the life of the refugeeswould have been most unbearable. Yet even with thismuch-appreciated assistance  the burden left to refugee-receiving States has been enormous. The economic social  environmental and security consequences ofhosting the refugees will have long-lasting effects fromwhich these countries will continue to suffer even afterthe repatriation of the refugees has been completed. Thisraises the fundamental issue of assisting the asylumcountries  not only to cope with the immediate task ofmeeting the needs of the refugees  but also with the long-term effects of hosting them. This aspect needsaddressing.24Somalia may no longer be on our television screens orworthy of the news headlines  but it is still a problemwhich must not be forgotten. The country is stillfragmented  and fighting among the factions in conflict isnot yet over. There is a chance that through the Sodereinitiative there may be some positive developments. TheUnited Nations needs to continue associating itself closelywith the efforts being expended by the IntergovernmentalAuthority for Drought and Development and theOrganization of African Unity aimed at bringing durablepeace to Somalia.In Western Sahara  too  we are concerned by theapparent freeze in the implementation of the settlementplan. As we reiterate our solidarity with the FrentePOLISARIO  we express the hope that the initiatives of therepresentative of the Secretary-General  in the person of theformer United States Secretary of State James Baker  willbear fruit and remove the prevailing political difficulties inthe implementation of the settlement plan.Tanzania continues to follow closely the developmentsin the Middle East which now threaten peace in the area. Inthis regard  Tanzania reiterates its solidarity with thePalestinian people and calls upon the Palestinian and theIsraeli authorities to persist in their efforts to consolidatedialogue and move forward in elaborating permanentarrangements for peace. We still believe that  ultimately enduring peace in the region lies in the return of all theoccupied Arab land and in the full enjoyment by thePalestinian people of its inalienable right to self-determination and independence  including theestablishment of a homeland for themselves withininternationally recognized boundaries.In conclusion  as we move into the new millennium the world is still a place largely besieged by poverty andunderdevelopment  conflict and war. The giant leaps ofscience and technology which have enabled humankind toexplore outer space and to shrink the world into a globalvillage have so far not been adequately and evenlychannelled into meeting the compelling needs of the greaterpart humanity. The world will transit into the nextmillennium divided between those who are prosperous andat peace and those living in abject poverty and at war.Therefore  it must be the overriding objective of the UnitedNations to ensure that this disparity is overcome. Thechallenge that we must all face is to strengthen thisOrganization by unconditionally supporting it fully politically and financially to enable it to serve humanitybetter."
"164",7107,"UGA",52,1997,"﻿Permit me  on behalf of theUganda delegation  to express our pleasure at seeing Mr.Udovenko preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. Allow me also to pay a special tribute tohis predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  forthe outstanding manner in which he discharged his oneroustasks while presiding over the work of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. I also salute andcongratulate Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  for the commitment and dedication he hasdemonstrated since he assumed this office.We note the initiative announced by the Secretary-General on 16 July 1997  entitled “Renewing the UnitedNations: A Programme for Reform”. We will participateactively in the deliberations on these bold and far-reaching proposals. The discussions we shall have on theissues contained in the Secretary-General’s proposal willdetermine the kind of United Nations that can best serveus in the twenty-first century.The issue of the reform of the United Nations is notnew. Reform of this Organization has always been acontinuous process in which we all have an interest. Weall want to see the United Nations revitalized strengthened and well managed. The United Nations isunique. The reform of the Organization must beapproached from the viewpoint of its purposes.In reforming the United Nations  due considerationmust be given to its unequal and diverse membership encompassing different cultures and value systems as wellas great economic and social inequalities  which lead todifferences of opinion on the different aspects of the workof the Organization and how they might be strengthened.Indeed  most views expressed in the past on reformhave come against the background of widespreadscepticism. These views see the United Nations asexcessively costly  mismanaged  inefficient  bureaucratic corrupt and overstaffed with low- quality staff. TheUnited Nations  therefore  finds itself at a criticalcrossroads: neglected in some critical aspects anddeliberately eroded in others. Contradictory assessmentsof its performance and usefulness and divergent viewsconcerning its future role have given rise to politicalcontroversy.The important issues of reform must therefore not beviewed merely as a question of cutting costs; rather reform should aim at the enhancement of the efficiencyand effectiveness of the United Nations in the delivery ofprogrammes and services  particularly those addressingthe pressing needs of developing countries. In elaboratingand implementing the reform package  it is necessary thatthe programmes that benefit the least developed countriesand Africa emerge stronger and better equipped todischarge their onerous responsibilities.The Chairman of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) has already eloquently espoused the Africanposition on the reform of the Security Council. Wesupport this and the Non-Aligned Movement positions.The Security Council should be expanded in bothcategories on the principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation. Africa has already proposed that it begranted two permanent seats with full veto powers. At the25same time  the exercise of the power must conform todemocratic principles.If the United Nations is to be reformed and madeeffective  then adequate financing is a matter of toppriority. We therefore appeal to all Member States to paytheir dues in full  on time and without conditions. Withoutthis commitment  reforms will only be a smoke screen tohide our reluctance to implement the commitments wecollectively agreed upon at the celebration to mark thefiftieth anniversary of this Organization two years ago.Related to this is the question of the scale ofassessments. Uganda supports the principle of capacity topay as the fundamental criterion for the apportionment ofthe expenses of the United Nations. This is critical in orderto redress the unfair burden that developing countries ingeneral and the least developed countries in particularcontinue to shoulder as a result of imperfections inherent inthe present scale methodology  which are to theirdisadvantage. This principle has been consistentlyreaffirmed by the General Assembly in various resolutions.In this connection  we would like to caution that attemptsto impose self-interested positions will not yield anysatisfactory outcome.Uganda welcomes the result of the recently concludedagreement in the area of anti-personnel landmines in Oslo.We are particularly satisfied with the progress thus farmade on these weapons. On our part  even before theconclusion of the Oslo agreement on these weapons  whichcause untold and indiscriminate destruction  we in Ugandahad already stopped and dismantled our facilities for theirmanufacture. We no longer manufacture  import or usethese weapons. We call on all peace-loving nations  thosethat care for the innocent who lose their limbs every minuteto landmines  to follow our example. It is our sincere hopethat when the agreement on anti-personnel landmines willbe opened in Ottawa  Canada  for signature  even thoseMember States that were reluctant to join in the consensuson the agreement will sign it. We hope that the Osloprocess will lead to progress in disarmament negotiations leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons andsubsequently of all weapons of mass destruction.The political and economic situation in Africanremains a matter of grave concern to us. We believe thatAfrica must continue to search for and to find the mostsuitable political arrangements that will guarantee peace andstability. African society  since time immemorial  hasalways emphasized harmony and decision-making byconsensus rather than competition and confrontation. Oursocieties emphasized the good of the whole rather thanthe untamed pursuit of selfish interests. In short egalitarianism and equal participation were the hallmarksof societal and political organization. However  as we allknow  Africa was exposed to other cultures and systemsthat introduced new forms of governance and politics. Itis not surprising  therefore  that  upon independence  thesepowerful and pervasive influences  like multiparty politicsand fierce competition  tore our societies apart. Theconflicts that proliferated in the wake of independencemust be understood against this background.We can state boldly today that  this notwithstanding conflict and chaos in Africa is on the retreat. We havewitnessed the end of conflict in Liberia and elections havetaken place. Military dictators are now roundlycondemned and isolated. The actions that are beingundertaken by the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) against the military junta in SierraLeone — actions that we all support — speak loud.In our own region  the Great Lakes region  wewitnessed the rout of the Mobutu dictatorship  a heinousregime that plundered one of the richest countries inAfrica almost into oblivion. We refused to accept themilitary coup of Pierre Buyoya in Burundi and have setout tough sanctions and conditions for the restoration ofdemocratic governance. This position was recentlyrenewed in Dar-es-Salaam.The efforts that we are undertaking  deserve support be they in the context of the OAU Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Resolution and Management or ofregional initiatives such as those involving the GreatLakes  the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) or those of the Intergovernmental Authorityon Development on the Sudan conflict. At the same time countries that have emerged from conflicts need to begiven a modicum of moral and material support to allowthem get back on their feet. We are all agreed on theneed for post-conflict peace-building and the need toestablish a continuum from relief to rehabilitation anddevelopment. We are also agreed that democracy  goodgovernance and accountability represent the best form ofleadership.However  nations that are struggling to reconstructcannot wait for a full restoration of democratic orderbefore they address urgent humanitarian and reliefrequirements. Quite often the very transition to the rule oflaw and to democratic governance is contingent uponsignificant progress on the humanitarian and economic26fronts. It is with these kind of considerations that we wouldlike to see tangible assistance extended to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo without delay or preconditions. Wemust put behind us the chaos that afflicted that country andthe sad chapter in the history of the Congo that was broughtabout by Mobutu’s mismanagement. The survival of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo is paramount and shouldbe of concern to all of us.The experience of the United Nations in Somalia andRwanda has demonstrated the need for improvement in theOrganization’s ability to anticipate crisis situations and putin place effective mechanisms to avert such situations including in the area of early warning. In this connection we note with satisfaction the strengthening of the UnitedNations capacity for post-conflict peace-building with thedesignation of the Department of Political Affairs as focalpoint for this purpose.We are seized of the grave situation in Congo(Brazzaville) and the Central African Republic. Theunsteady progress on a negotiated settlement of the conflictsin Angola  Somalia  southern Sudan and the WesternSahara continue be of concern to us. We call on all theparties to the conflicts to engage in constructive dialogue inorder to establish lasting peace. We should all support themin this process.In Uganda  we continue to search for solutions to oureconomic difficulties. We have therefore continued toimplement far-reaching economic reforms that emphasizeliberalization  privatization  investment promotion and cost-effectiveness in management. The results are promising and we have recorded gross domestic product growth ratesof more than 6 per cent per annum. Now we are grapplingwith the need to ensure that economic progress benefits thepeople  particularly the poorest. This we will address in theframework of a poverty eradication strategy  the pillars ofwhich will include: first  the improvement of physicalinfrastructure  such as roads and telecommunications;secondly  the universalizing of primary education and theincreasing encouragement of private education at thesecondary and tertiary levels to unlock the creative powerof our population; thirdly  the modernization anddiversification of agriculture; and fourthly  the promotion ofmicro- and small-scale enterprise through improved accessto credit for the rural poor.This is a tall order  and we call upon our developmentpartners to support us in this process in the context of thealready formulated national action plans and the agreedframework for international development cooperation.The issue of the world’s freshwater resourcesremains of the utmost concern to my delegation. Watershortages in the next century are likely to restraineconomic and social development. A large part of Ugandais covered by fresh water. In Uganda  we attachimportance to the economic value of water  and that iswhy we recognize the importance of its equitable andreasonable use. Unfortunately  our water resources arebeing choked by the rapid growth and spread of the waterhyacinth on Lake Victoria and on other lakes and riversin the Nile Valley. As we have done in the past  weurgently appeal once again to the international communityto extend its support to enable us to address the problemof the water hyacinth.Let me reiterate our confidence in the mission of theUnited Nations in coordinating and delivering targetedassistance to developing countries in all areas of humanendeavour  in partnership with Governments. It isimportant  therefore  to ensure that the focus of theOrganization is sharpened to enhance the relevance andeffectiveness of its programmes  be it in the area ofgovernance  poverty eradication  capacity-building orhumanitarian assistance.We need a United Nations that will act as an agentof progress and change and that will be equipped to playan effective and leading role in improving the economicand social conditions of all the world’s nations — not justa few. We also want a reformed United Nations that willdeal effectively with the growing number of complexinternational challenges  including development  peaceand security. Furthermore  we need a reformed UnitedNations that must provide global leadership and vision inthe twenty-first century."
"165",7154,"UKR",52,1997,"﻿Mr. President  it is with pridethat I congratulate you  a representative of Ukraine  on yourelection to the international community’s highest politicalpost. I am confident that you will use to the full your richpolitical experience and internationally recognizeddiplomatic skills  as well as your profound knowledge ofthe United Nations system  to which you have devotedmore than 20 years of your life  to the benefit of mankind.I wish also to address words of gratitude torepresentatives of all United Nations Member States fortheir support of the candidature of the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Ukraine for the honourable and responsibleposition of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We interpret that support as a manifestationof a high level of confidence in Ukraine’s foreign policy its peaceful initiatives and its commitment to the ideals ofthe United Nations and to the objective of reviving andstrengthening the Organization. We regard it also asrecognition of Ukraine’s contribution to the maintenanceof international peace and security  to the process ofnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  to thepromotion of the noble principles of democracy ininternational life and of respect for fundamental humanrights and freedoms.Allow me also to pay a tribute to the President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session  Mr. RazaliIsmail  who made a notable contribution to theOrganization’s progress along the path of reform.The recent history of the United Nations and thehistory of the development of independent Ukraine havemuch in common. The first common feature is that bothmy State and the United Nations are now experiencingthe complicated process of internal reform. Profound comprehensive change is proving to be an extremelydifficult matter. But the choice is final and irreversible:Ukraine has become a democratic State with a policyaimed at ensuring the needs and rights of its citizens  andat establishing a civil society. There is every reason toconclude that during our six years of independence wehave laid the foundation of further State-building.As early as next year we will certainly experiencegradual economic growth and the forging of a sociallyoriented market economy in Ukraine. All the conditionsnow exist for this to become reality  both internal — asillustrated by the political stability in Ukraine — andexternal.Ukraine has consistently conducted  and isdetermined to continue  a policy aimed at strengtheningsecurity and stability throughout the world. I would recallthat last year we removed the last nuclear warhead fromour territory  thus transforming a nuclear-weapon State toa non-nuclear-weapon State for the first time in history.Ukraine thus demonstrated its good will  proved thatgenuine nuclear disarmament is possible  and made asubstantive contribution to the achievement of the ideal ofa nuclear-weapon-free world in the twenty-first century.No less significant is my country’s contribution toradical positive changes in the Central and EasternEuropean region  creating favourable conditions for anew  more stable and more secure geopolitical situationthroughout the continent.3Important steps in that direction included the basicpolitical treaties that Ukraine has signed with the RussianFederation and with Romania  and the agreement with theRepublic of Belarus on State borders  the first of the kindto be signed in the history of the newly independent States.The signing by the Presidents of Ukraine and ofPoland of the joint statement on reconciliation and unitywas of exceptional significance for the improvement of thesituation in Central and Eastern Europe. We view thatdocument as exemplifying a balanced and unbiasedapproach to the evaluation of complex pages of history  andas a deliverance from the burden of the past for the sake ofthe development of mutually beneficial cooperation nowand in the future.The resolution of the problem of the division of theBlack Sea fleet has contributed to enhanced security in theBlack Sea region and throughout Europe.Among the most recent of important events  I wish tonote the signing at Madrid of the Charter on SpecialPartnership between Ukraine and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO). The establishment of a specialpartnership with the alliance has tangibly strengthenedconfidence in Europe and is now one of the importantelements in the establishment of a new system of Europeansecurity.It is generally acknowledged that the future of theEuropean security architecture as an important element ofglobal security should be based on principles ofcomprehensiveness  indivisibility and partnership  and  inthe long run  on collective rather than unilateral action. Itis in that context that Ukraine is developing activecooperation with European and transatlantic securitystructures.An important place in Ukraine’s foreign policypriorities belongs to developing mutually beneficialrelations with the countries of Asia  Africa and LatinAmerica. Ukraine is also devoting special attention to theMovement of Non-aligned Countries  which is one of theinfluential factors in contemporary international relations.Our observer status in that movement testifies to the factthat Ukraine is today a non-bloc country.All of this can be summarized in a single conclusion:thanks to Ukraine’s persistent efforts  its borders are nowpeaceful and it is open to partnership with neighbouringcountries. Our multifaceted foreign policy has promoted theimage of Ukraine as a reliable and predictable partner.We have been guided by  and still abide by  thewell-known principle: think globally and act locally. Ibelieve that this approach — based  incidentally  onfundamental provisions of the United Nations Charter —will lay the foundation for future relationships among allmembers of the world community.The events on the European continent since the endof the Cold War have persuasively shown that threats tosecurity on the continent will henceforth emanate notfrom confrontation between military-political blocs  butrather from regional and local conflicts. A good reminderof this is the series of tragic events of recent years in theBalkans  in the Transdniestr region  in the Caucasus andelsewhere. At the same time  discussions on the future ofEuropean security have so far focused mainly on theissues of NATO and European Union enlargement  therole of the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope and so forth. It is not my intention to minimizethe importance of these issues  but we are certain that all-European stability will be unattainable withoutstrengthening regional security and establishing mutuallybeneficial and good-neighbourly relations betweenUkraine and other nations.It is to that end that European countries —especially those of Central and Eastern Europe  amongthem Ukraine — should exert the best of their efforts. Itwas for this very reason that we proposed to hold inUkraine the 1999 summit meeting of the Baltic and BlackSea States.By the will of destiny  we are living at the thresholdof a new millennium  which has coincided with a turningpoint in the development of mankind. The UnitedNations — a unique instrument for the maintenance andstrengthening of international peace and security —should be well prepared for the changes ahead and shouldbe ready to respond to the challenges of today and of thetwenty-first century.It is difficult to overestimate the positive changes inthe world in which the United Nations has played a keyrole. It is true that the Organization has not been ablecompletely to cure all social evils. However  it is equallytrue that the United Nations has always sent a timelysignal regarding the emergence of new hazards and hasunited the world community to address urgent globalproblems.The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relatesin particular to environmental protection in its global4dimension: prohibiting chemical and bacteriologicalweapons and reducing nuclear weapons  as well asformulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping;ensuring human rights; and codifying international law onnon-renewable resources.At the same time  we must admit that the UnitedNations has not always been able adequately to respond toa number of the problems it has faced. This makes itnecessary further to improve its structure and internalorganization and to increase the effectiveness of its work.Unfortunately  we must take note of the fact that noinstitution other than the United Nations so clearly confirmsthe validity of Parkinson’s law  which states that theexpansion of bureaucracy has no limits. For that reason  Ibelieve that today no one has any doubts that changes inthe United Nations are urgent and are objectively required.I hope that the current session will make a substantivecontribution to this important cause and that we will haveall due reason to refer to it as “the session of reforms”.The well-known seventeenth-century Ukrainianphilosopher and educator Hryhoriy Skovoroda once saidthat“You do your best work and save yourself when youfirmly embark upon the road of common sense”.This  in our view  is the path that the process of UnitedNations reform should also take. Ukraine is activelysupporting measures aimed at bringing the structure andtasks of the Organization in line with new realities.It is from this perspective that we are now consideringa package of proposals by the Secretary-General aimed ata wide-scale reorganization of the United Nations structureand its programme activities. While these proposals maynot fully coincide with the interests of some countries orregions  they have been elaborated on the basis ofcompromise and  in fact  constitute the first real attempt tostop marking time in the process of reforming theOrganization. Therefore we have to be pragmatic andattempt to avoid drowning this issue in endless discussionsand appeals  as has happened repeatedly in the past.We should begin without delay concrete work on theproposals of the Secretary-General  without dividing thepackage into separate components. Furthermore  we mustkeep in mind that the implementation of these proposals following their final approval and endorsement by theGeneral Assembly  will be only the initial stage in theprocess of the radical transformation of the UnitedNations  which will have to embrace its most importantcomponents  primarily the Security Council and thebudgetary and financial system.In this context  equitable geographical representationin the Security Council and the increase of itsmembership take on special importance. It would not bea mistake to say that this problem is considered by themajority of Member States as a priority issue and that itsresolution  to a great extent  will determine the results andthe success of the reform of the Organization. In general Ukraine shares this point of view. But we also believethat the overall process of the renewal and rebuilding bothof the United Nations structure and of its activities shouldnot be held hostage to the solving of one issue  albeit avery important one.The negotiations that took place within theframework of the Open-ended Working Group on theQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase inthe Membership of the Security Council during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly were  in ouropinion  useful and productive. The positions of manyMember States have shifted  moving towards achievingcompromise. We can realistically expect participants inthe negotiations to reach the general accord that isnecessary for the adoption of a decision  as required bythe relevant resolution of the General Assembly. I shouldlike to call on Member States to exert maximum effortsto reach a consensus decision. The most important thingnow is to transcend nationally focused approaches bytaking into account the common interests of theinternational community.Concerning the enlargement of the Security Council I believe that the solution to the problem should be basedon the following general principles.First  all the regional groups  including the Group ofEastern European States  should enlarge theirrepresentation in the Security Council; secondly  theenlargement should not negatively affect the efficiency ofthe work of the Security Council; and thirdly  the processof enlargement should not be given a strict time limit although a decision on this issue should preferably betaken in the near future.The elaboration and practical implementation of anoverall concept of peacekeeping activities is an extremelypressing issue that can be settled only within theframework of the United Nations. Two years ago  at the5commemorative meeting of the General Assembly on theoccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization  Iproposed gradually to re-orient United Nationspeacekeeping activities towards preventive diplomacy. Theexperience of Blue Helmets operations in hot spots aroundthe globe in recent years has further convinced us of theneed to strengthen the preventive component.In this context  we consider the system of UnitedNations standby agreements to be promising. Ukraine striving to make a real contribution to the strengthening ofthis mechanism  recently signed the relevant memorandumof understanding with the United Nations.Improving the efficiency of peacekeeping operationsis not an abstract notion for our country. Let us recall thatthe first Ukrainian peacekeeping unit was deployed fiveyears ago to the United Nations peacekeeping force in theformer Yugoslavia. Since then Ukraine has participated inmore than 10 United Nations peacekeeping operations. Inaddition  our military contingent has taken part in theoperations of the multinational stabilization force in Bosnia.From this lofty rostrum  I reaffirm Ukraine’s readinessto participate directly in a settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict  to join the activities of the group ofcountries known as Friends of the Secretary-General onGeorgia  and to dispatch its personnel to the United Nationspeacekeeping mission in that country.Ukraine will also continue its efforts to bring about afinal settlement of the conflict in the Transdniestr  actingtogether with Russia and with the participation of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as aguarantor of the special status of the Transdniestr as anintegral part of the Republic of Moldova.The nineteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly held earlier this year  which was devoted toreviewing progress in the implementation of Agenda 21 was a major international event. I know that many countrieshave assessed its results rather critically since  in theiropinion  the session did not fully meet expectations. But itdid confirm the adherence of the overwhelming majority ofcountries to the principles of sustainable developmentdeclared in Rio  and it also provided the world communitywith a number of constructive proposals with regard to afurther strengthening of global partnership in the field ofenvironment protection.We must all remember the equal right of present andfuture generations to a viable living environment. Ourshared obligation to them is to join our efforts for thesake of the survival and development of humancivilization. That was the essence of Ukraine’s proposalconcerning the elaboration in future of an internationallegal document that would serve as a reliable legal basisfor safe and sustainable development worldwide.For Ukraine  environmental problems are not justabstract theory. The Chernobyl nuclear-power plantaccident has been a real national tragedy for my country.Every year up to 15 per cent of the State budget is spenton compensating for the losses it has caused and onensuring social benefits for the people affected.Ukraine made a political commitment todecommission the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by theend of the millennium and has made continuous efforts tofulfil it. We expect other countries to meet theircommitments in this regard.At the same time  the problem of Chernobyl cannotbe limited to the decommissioning of the nuclear powerplant. This accident unleashed a series of problems thatare global in nature and could scarcely be overcome aloneby even the most developed nations. Chernobyl today isnot the exclusive problem of Ukraine. In paying tribute tothe United Nations efforts aimed at eliminating theconsequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclearpower plant  I wish to emphasize that an overall solutionto this global problem is simply impossible without large-scale international assistance.At present  the United Nations is going through adifficult but crucial moment of renewal. The same can besaid about Ukraine  which is more than ever beforeconscious of its dependence on the world order and relieson the support of the international community. That iswhy the question of what form the world order willassume in the future — to which this session is expectedto provide an answer — is of particular and  withoutexaggeration  fateful importance to us.The future of the world order  of the United Nationsand of every country  is our common future. Thus  whiledeciding today on the fate of the United Nations  weshould be aware that we are also determining our owndestiny."
"166",7201,"URY",52,1997,"﻿Allow me first of all  Mr. President  to congratulate youon your election to preside over this new session of theGeneral Assembly. We are sure that the experience youhave gained in your years of activity in the Organization together with your personal qualities and technical skills will  under your mandate  contribute to the strengtheningof this most important body of the Organization.Allow me also to express our congratulations to theoutgoing President  Ambassador Razali  for the work heperformed  which certainly contributed to thestrengthening both of the presidency and of the role theGeneral Assembly is called on to play in the UnitedNations.Undoubtedly  the central focus of our attention willcontinue to be the issue of the reform of the Organization the essence of which is now contained in the documentsubmitted by the Secretary-General.My country fully supports and has every confidencein the appointment and endeavours of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. We have thus paid the greatestattention to the package of reforms he has submitted  andwe are prepared to promote deliberations on them so thatthey can be concluded as soon as possible.4We understand that the document is aimed at theobjective of equipping the Organization with anadministrative structure that will permit more flexiblemanagement  prevent duplication of functions and securecoordination among its organs and programmes  all ofwhich will result in an improvement in terms of botheconomy and management.Within the overall issue of reform  the specific topicof the Security Council is one of the most importantbecause of the political significance that organ has had andwill continue to have within the structure of the UnitedNations. Uruguay endorses an enlargement of the Councilbecause it believes that its structure should be adapted tothe new realities in the world  which differ substantiallyfrom those that existed when the Organization wasestablished  since at that time account was taken of thepower structure resulting from the Second World War.In this regard  we support an increase in the numberof both permanent and non-permanent Members of theCouncil  to a total of not more than 25  so that efficiencyis not impaired. Our country particularly supports anincreased presence of developing countries to ensure abetter balance in the membership of this singular organ ofour Organization. We believe that the newly created seatsshould be occupied on the basis of real equality ofopportunity for all States.However  my country believes that the reform of theCouncil should not be confined to the topic of itsmembership. Equally important is ensuring that its activitiesare transparent and that information provided to andcommunication with the States that are not members of theCouncil flow freely and are up to date.The Eastern Republic of Uruguay has expressed strongsupport for progressively limiting the right of veto  and tothat end we have submitted a proposal to the effect that oncertain subjects  the right of veto could be suspended by theGeneral Assembly by a majority to be determined. Thatmechanism  essentially democratic in nature  would thushelp reduce the absolute power of the right of veto ascurrently provided for in the Charter  while at the sametime it would strengthen the competence of the GeneralAssembly.Nonetheless  our country will be ready to analyse anyother proposal that might be submitted aimed at limiting theabsolute individual veto.While the reform of the Security Council and thepossible revision of the scale of assessments have recentlybeen  and continue to be  the focus of political attention we should also study the question of strengthening theGeneral Assembly. A calm and dispassionate analysis ofthe organizational structure and respective areas ofresponsibility of our Organization shows that the forumwhere the principle of juridical equality of States reignssupreme is undoubtedly the General Assembly.There has been and still is much discussionregarding the composition of the Security Council and theexercise of the right of veto  in the context of the newparameters of international realities. That is all well andgood  but at the same time  we need to find practicalways of revitalizing and invigorating the activity of theAssembly.The General Assembly is a unique body ininternational institutional machinery. In it  representativityis practically universal. States participate on an equalfooting without regard for their size or power  and theideal of international democracy attains its clearestexpression  at least in formal terms. The decisions of thisbody have great moral and political force and accordingly it is essential to formulate them better and make themmore timely.For these reasons  the General Assembly not onlyneeds to function more flexibly and utilize its resourcesmore rationally  but also  and essentially  requires greatersubstance. Only thus will we be able to give itsresolutions greater operative force.Consequently  we should take a new approach andopen a new chapter in the reform process  not confiningour reflections and aspirations to reforms of the SecurityCouncil or to reforms of a financial nature  but extendingthem to the organ that brings together the internationalcommunity as a whole  namely  the General Assembly.After 52 years of the Organization's existence  themaintenance of international peace and security continuesto be one of its essential functions. Peacekeepingoperations  to which my country is proud to have been acontributor from the outset  must be fully maintainedwhile adapting to new kinds of conflicts.Uruguay is prepared for this  and  accordingly  wereaffirm here once again our commitment not only tocontinue to make our traditional contribution but also to5diversify it in order to adapt it fundamentally to peace-building.In this connection  we welcome the signing  with theUnder-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations  ofa memorandum of understanding regarding ourcontributions to the United Nations standby arrangementssystem. This will contribute to facilitating the planning offuture peacekeeping missions in the shortest possible time.The General Assembly's recent adoption of theresolution putting an end to the use of “gratis personnelprovided by Governments and other entities” fulfils one ofmy country's long-standing aspirations and does justice tothe principles of equitable geographical representation andthe equality of Member States  both enshrined in theCharter.Similarly  the recent General Assembly resolutionadopting uniform and standardized rates for payment ofawards in cases of death or disability sustained by troops inthe service of the United Nations peacekeeping operationsseems to us an important step that puts an end to an unjustsituation.We fully support the Middle East peace processinitiated at Madrid in October 1991 and continued atWashington  and the Government of the Eastern Republicof Uruguay continues to encourage the necessary holding ofdirect talks between Israel and the Palestinian NationalAuthority. It is essential for both parties to respect in goodfaith the commitments entered into in the Madrid andWashington declarations.Our Latin American continent does not want an armsrace; it wants  on the contrary  to be free of nuclearweapons and of other sophisticated weapons of massdestruction that can create instability. We want to work inpeace  allocating the largest possible amount of resourcesto our economic and social development.However  this should not be an obstacle to limitedpurchases of arms by our armed forces solely for thepurpose of replacing their obsolete equipment  thereby fullydischarging their constitutional mandates.We must work to ensure a continuation of the mutualconfidence and security that prevails in the region today without third countries weakening and taking advantage ofour continent through the sale of sophisticated weapons.Uruguay will continue to support with firmconviction all disarmament processes  and  accordingly we recently signed in Oslo the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines  those lethal weaponsthat have caused not only death and serious injury tosoldiers but also the loss of thousands of innocent lives.Protection of human rights has been and willcontinue to be one of the priority objectives of both ourdomestic and international policies. Without full exerciseof human rights  there can be neither peace nor security neither economic prosperity nor social equity  and theexistence of a democratic system of government willtherefore also be impossible.In addition  there can be no full exercise of humanrights without a minimum economic  social andeducational base  and my country will be prepared tocontribute to ensuring the existence of such a base.In this connection  we fully support the restructuringproposed by the Secretary-General while at the same timeendorsing the philosophy on which it is based  embodiedin his idea that the question of human rights should bepart of all the substantive spheres of the Secretariat'sprogramme of work: peace and security  economic andsocial affairs  development cooperation and humanitarianaffairs.The financial crisis the Organization is experiencing which has no counterpart in its history  stems primarilyfrom the failure to pay assessed contributions. While notintending to justify any delay in payment  Uruguaybelieves that the current scale of assessments requiresadjustments to make it fairer  more transparent and betterbased on the capacity of States to pay. That should not however  mean that developing countries would assumenew and additional commitments today; that would  in ourview  be unjust and unacceptable. The system ofcontributions should be based on objective criteria offinancial responsibility. We agree that there is a need tocorrect and manage the budgets of the Organization inorder to reduce expenditures and increase efficiency  thusstriking a balance between expenditure on peace andsecurity and expenditure on development  each of whichis a cornerstone of the other  without weakening operatingand information activities.We cannot but express our public satisfaction atseeing the importance the Secretary-General attaches todevelopment  which he regards as one of the priorities6and essential functions of the Organization. There can be nopeace without development.On the threshold of a century that is already takingshape and that  unfortunately  seems to be marked bygrowth without equity  uncertainty in employment and aproliferation of crises and conflicts  good management ofdevelopment assistance is today more necessary than everbefore. At a time when human concerns seem to be alien tous  it is essential  in Uruguay's view  to support anOrganization that holds that people must be placed at thevery heart of the development process if we want growth tobe compatible with the human condition and developmentto be conducted by and for people.In this context  we consider it very important tomaintain unconditionally the principle of universality andthe right of all developing countries  without exception  tobenefit from international cooperation and to receivetechnical assistance with a view to achieving sustainablehuman development.Uruguay considers international technical cooperationessential for consolidating the processes of development andintegration in the various regions. It is a fundamental toolfor attaining greater economic growth.We support the development of South-Southcooperation as an important tool for promoting theimproved development of nations. We believe that a newconcept of technical cooperation will have to respond totraditional demands  such as humanitarian affairs  as wellas others associated directly with the process of integrationinto the international economy  such as  for example  theredefinition of the role of the State  its modernization andits decentralization.We believe that a positive contribution to political anddemocratic stability and to economic growth is made byprocesses of regional and subregional integration. In ourcase  the Southern Cone Common Market — composed ofArgentina  Brazil  Paraguay and our country — is a clearexample of democratic stability and expansion of trade within and outside the region  compatible with the rules ofthe World Trade Organization.Uruguay continues to assign to international law aprimordial role as a regulator of relations among States.Respect for and compliance with international law areessential for peaceful coexistence. For this reason  wesupport the holding of an international conference to discussa draft convention establishing an international criminalcourt for autonomous and independent hearings on certaincrimes  such as genocide and others which  because oftheir seriousness  are roundly condemned by theinternational community. We also support the work of theAd Hoc Committee on the elaboration of a convention forthe suppression of terrorist bombings.In times of change  which we all see as appropriateand inevitable in order to revitalize the Organization  wenevertheless identify more than ever before with theessential purposes and principles established 52 years ago.These bind the Organization together and  despite the timethat has elapsed and the important changes that have sincetaken place in the world  continue to constitute and mustcontinue to constitute  today as yesterday  the goal andobjective of all the changes the United Nations will haveto face at the dawn of the twenty-first century.People  simple people  call for us to be effective andefficient in our activities and bold in our decisions inpreventing conflicts  and to act on their behalf inrebuilding civil societies. The citizens of every nation  ofevery country of the world  call on us today to be firm inour commitment to the Charter and to adapt our newactivities to the changing times."
"167",7248,"USA",52,1997,"﻿Five years ago  when I firstaddressed this Assembly  the cold war had only justended and the transition to a new era was beginning.Now  together  we are making that historic transition.Behind us  we leave a century full of humanity's capacityfor the worst and its genius for the best. Before us  at thedawn of a new millennium  we can envision a new erathat escapes the twentieth century's darkest moments fulfils its most brilliant possibilities and crosses frontiersyet unimagined.We are off to a promising start. For the first time inhistory  more than half the people represented in thisAssembly freely choose their own Governments. Freemarkets are growing  spreading individual opportunity andnational well-being. Early in the twenty-first century more than 20 of this Assembly's members - home tohalf the earth's population - will lift themselves fromthe ranks of low-income nations.Powerful forces are bringing us closer together profoundly changing the way we work  live and relate toeach other. Every day  millions of our citizens on everycontinent use laptops and satellites to send information products and money across the planet in seconds. Bit bybit  the information age is chipping away at barriers -economic  political and social - that once kept peoplelocked in and ideas locked out. Science is unravellingmysteries in the tiniest of human genes and in the vastcosmos. Never in the course of human history have wehad a greater opportunity to make our people healthierand wiser  to protect our planet from decay and abuse andto reap the benefits of free markets without abandoningthe social contract and its concern for the common good.Yet today's possibilities are not tomorrow'sguarantees. We have work to do.7The forces of global integration are a great tide inexorably wearing away the established order of things.But we must decide what will be left in its wake. Peoplefear change when they feel its burdens but not its benefits.They are susceptible to misguided protectionism and to thepoisoned appeals of extreme nationalism  and ethnic  racialand religious hatreds. New global environmental challengesrequire us to find ways to work together without damaginglegitimate aspirations for progress. We are all vulnerable tothe reckless acts of rogue States and to an unholy axis ofterrorists  drug traffickers and international criminals.These twenty-first-century predators feed on the freeflow of information  ideas and people we cherish. Theyabuse the vast power of technology to build black marketsfor weapons  to compromise law enforcement with hugebribes of illicit cash and to launder money with thekeystroke of a computer. These forces are our enemies. Wemust face them together because no one can defeat themalone.To seize the opportunities and move against the threatsof this new global era  we need a new strategy of security.Over the past five years  nations have begun to put thatstrategy in place through a new network of institutions andarrangements  with distinct missions  but a commonpurpose: to secure and strengthen the gains of democracyand free markets while turning back their enemies.We see this strategy taking shape on every continent:in expanded military alliances  such as the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO)  its Partnership for Peace andits partnerships with a democratic Russia and a democraticUkraine; in free trade arrangements  such as the WorldTrade Organization and the global Information TechnologyAgreement  and in the movement towards free-trade areasby nations in the Americas  the Asia-Pacific region andelsewhere around the world; in strong arms-control regimes such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; inmultinational coalitions with zero tolerance for terrorism corruption  crime and drug trafficking; and in bindinginternational commitments to protect the environment andsafeguard human rights.Through this web of institutions and arrangements nations are setting the international ground rules for thetwenty-first century  laying a foundation for security andprosperity for those who live within them  while isolatingthose who challenge them from the outside. This systemwill develop and endure only if those who follow the rulesof peace and freedom fully reap their rewards. Only thenwill our people believe that they have a stake insupporting and shaping the emerging international system.The United Nations must play a leading role in thiseffort  filling in the fault lines of the new global era. Thecore missions it has pursued during its first half centurywill be just as relevant during the next half century: thepursuit of peace and security  promoting human rights andmoving people from poverty to dignity and prosperitythrough sustainable development.Conceived in the cauldron of war  the UnitedNations first task must remain the pursuit of peace andsecurity. For 50 years the United Nations has helpedprevent world war and nuclear holocaust. Unfortunately conflicts between nations  and within nations  haveendured. From 1945 until today  they have cost 20 millionlives. Just since the end of the cold war  each year therehave been more than 30 armed conflicts in which morethan 1 000 people have lost their lives - including  ofcourse  a quarter of a million killed in the formerYugoslavia and more than half a million in Rwanda.Millions of personal tragedies the world over are awarning that we dare not be complacent or indifferent;trouble in a far corner can become a plague on everyone'shouse. People the world over cheer the hopefuldevelopments in Northern Ireland  grieve over the loss ofinnocent lives and the stalling of the peace process in theMiddle East and long for a resolution of the differenceson the Korean peninsula  between Greece and Turkey orbetween the great nations of India and Pakistan as theycelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their birth.The United Nations continues to keep many nationsaway from bloodshed: in El Salvador and Mozambique;in Haiti and Namibia; in Cyprus; and in Bosnia  where somuch remains to be done but can still be done becausethe bloodshed has ended.The United Nations record of service has left alegacy of sacrifice. Just last week we lost some of ourfinest sons and daughters in the crash of a United Nationshelicopter in Bosnia. Five were American  five German one Polish and one British - all citizens of the world weare trying to make  each a selfless servant of peace. Theworld is poorer for their passing.At this very moment  the United Nations is keepingthe peace in 16 countries  often in partnership withregional organizations such as NATO  the Organization ofAmerican States  the Association of South-East Asian8Nations and the Economic Community of West AfricanStates  avoiding wider conflicts and even greater suffering.Our shared commitment to more realistic peacekeepingtraining for United Nations troops  a stronger role forcivilian police and better integration between military andcivilian agencies - all these will help the United Nationsfulfil these missions in the years ahead.At the same time  we must improve the UnitedNations capabilities after a conflict ends to help peacebecome self-sustaining. The United Nations cannot buildnations  but it can help nations build themselves byfostering legitimate institutions of government  monitoringelections and laying a strong foundation for economicreconstruction.This week the Security Council will hold anunprecedented ministerial meeting on African security which our Secretary of State is proud to chair  and whichPresident Mugabe  Chairman of the Organization of AfricanUnity  will address. It will highlight the role the UnitedNations can and should play in preventing conflict on acontinent where amazing progress towards democracy anddevelopment is occurring alongside still too much discord disease and distress.In the twenty-first century our security will bechallenged increasingly by interconnected groups that trafficin terror  organized crime and drug smuggling. Already these international crime and drug syndicates drain up to$750 billion a year from legitimate economies. That sumthat exceeds the combined gross national product of morethan half the nations in this Hall. These groups threaten toundermine confidence in the fragile new democracies andmarket economies that so many of you are working so hardto see endure.Two years ago I called upon all the members of thisAssembly to join in the fight against these forces. I applaudthe recent United Nations resolution calling on its Membersto join the major international anti-terrorism conventions making clear the emerging international consensus thatterrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable politicalact. As more countries sign on  terrorists will have fewerplaces to run or hide. I also applaud the steps that Membersare taking to implement the Declaration on Crime andPublic Security that the United States proposed two yearsago  calling for increased cooperation to strengthen everycitizen's right to basic safety  through cooperation onextradition and asset forfeiture  shutting down grey marketsfor guns and false documents  attacking corruption andbringing higher standards to law enforcement in newdemocracies.The spread of these global criminal syndicates alsohas made all the more urgent our common quest toeliminate weapons of mass destruction. We cannot allowthem to fall into or remain in the wrong hands. Here too the United Nations must lead  and it has led - from theUnited Nations Special Commission in Iraq to theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  now the mostexpansive global inspection system ever devised to policearms-control agreements.When we met here last year  I was honoured to bethe first of 146 leaders to sign the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  our commitment to endall nuclear tests for all time  the longest-sought  hardest-fought prize in the history of arms control. It will helpprevent the nuclear Powers from developing moreadvanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit thepossibilities for other States to acquire such devices. I ampleased to announce that today I am sending this crucialTreaty to the United States Senate for ratification. Ourcommon goal should be for the CTBT to enter into forceas soon as possible. I ask for of you to support that goal.The United Nations second core mission must be todefend and extend universal human rights and to helpdemocracy's remarkable gains endure. Fifty years ago theUnited Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rightsstated the international community's conviction thatpeople everywhere have the right to be treated withdignity  to give voice to their opinions and to choose theirleaders; that these rights are universal - not Americanrights  not Western rights  not rights for the developedworld only  but rights inherent in the humanity of peopleeverywhere.Over the past decades these rights have become areality for more people than ever  from Asia to Africa from Europe to the Americas. In a world that links richand poor  North and South  city and countryside in anelectronic network of shared images in real time  themore these universal rights take hold  the more peoplewho do not enjoy them will demand them. Armed withphotocopiers and fax machines  e-mail and the Internet;supported by an increasingly important community ofnon-governmental organizations  they will make theirdemands known  spreading the spirit of freedom -which  as the history of the last 10 years has shown us ultimately will prevail.9The United Nations must be prepared to respond -not only by setting standards but by implementing them. Todeter abuses  we should strengthen the United Nations fieldoperations and early-warning systems. To strengthendemocratic institutions - the best guarantors of humanrights - we must pursue programmes to help new legal parliamentary and electoral institutions get off the ground.To punish those responsible for crimes against humanity and to promote justice so that peace endures  we mustmaintain our strong support for the United Nations war-crime tribunals and truth commissions. And before thecentury ends  we should establish a permanent internationalcourt to prosecute the most serious violations ofhumanitarian law.The United States welcomes the Secretary General'sefforts to strengthen the role of human rights within theUnited Nations system and his splendid choice of MaryRobinson as the new High Commissioner for HumanRights. We will work hard to make sure that she has thesupport she needs to carry out her mandate.Finally  the United Nations has a special responsibilityto make sure that as the global economy creates greaterwealth  it does not produce growing disparities between thehaves and have-nots or threaten the global environment  ourcommon home. Progress is not yet everyone's partner.More than half the world's people are two days' walk froma telephone  literally disconnected from the global economy.Tens of millions lack the education  the training and theskills they need to make the most of their God-givenabilities.The men and women of the United Nations haveexpertise across the entire range of humanitarian anddevelopment activities. Every day they are making adifference. We see it in nourished bodies of once-starvingchildren  in the full lives of those immunized againstdisease  in the bright eyes of children exposed to educationthrough the rich storehouse of human knowledge  inrefugees cared for and returned to their homes and in thehealth of rivers and lakes restored.The United Nations must focus even more on shiftingresources from handouts to ""hand ups""  on giving peoplethe tools they need to make the most of their own destinies.Spreading ideas and education and technology - the truewealth of nations - is the best way to give the people thechance to succeed.The United Nations must continue to lead in ensuringthat today's progress does not come at tomorrow's expense.When the nations of the world gather again nextDecember in Kyoto for the Conference of the Parties tothe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange  all of us - developed and developing nations -must seize the opportunity to turn back the clock ongreenhouse-gas emissions so that we can leave a healthyplanet to our children.In these efforts  the United Nations no longer can and no longer need  go it alone. Innovative partnershipswith the private sector  non-governmental organizationsand the international financial institutions can leverage itseffectiveness many times over. Last week a trulyvisionary American  Ted Turner  made a remarkabledonation to strengthen the United Nations developmentand humanitarian programmes. His gesture highlights thepotential for partnership between the United Nations andthe private sector  in contributions of time  resources andexpertise. I hope more will follow his lead.In this area and others  the Secretary-General isaggressively pursuing the most far-reaching reform of theUnited Nations in its history - not to make the UnitedNations smaller as an end in itself  but to make it better.The United States strongly supports his leadership. Weshould pass the Secretary-General's reform agenda at thissession.On every previous occasion I have addressed thisAssembly  the issue of our country's dues has brought thecommitment of the United States to the United Nationsinto question. The United States was a founder of theUnited Nations. We are proud to be its host. We believein its ideals. We continue to be  as we have been  itslargest contributor. We are committed to seeing theUnited Nations succeed in the twenty-first century.This year  for the first time since I have beenPresident  we have an opportunity to put the question ofdebts and dues behind us once and for all and to put theUnited Nations on a sounder financial footing for thefuture. I have made it a priority to work with ourCongress on comprehensive legislation that would allowus to pay off the bulk of our arrears and assure fullfinancing of America's assessment in the years ahead.Our Congress's actions to solve this problem reflect astrong bipartisan commitment to the United Nations andto America's role within it. At the same time  we look toMember States to adopt a more equitable scale ofassessments. Let me say that we also strongly supportexpanding the Security Council to give more countries avoice in the most important work of the United Nations.10In more equitably sharing responsibility for its successes we can make the United Nations stronger and moredemocratic than it is today. I ask the General Assembly toact on these proposals this year so that we can moveforward together.At the dawn of a new century so full of hope but notfree of peril  more than ever we need a United Nationswhere people of reason can work through shared problemsand take action to combat them  where nations of goodwillcan join in the struggle for freedom and prosperity andwhere we can shape a future of peace  progress and thepreservation of our planet. We have the knowledge; wehave the intelligence; we have the energy; we have theresources for the work before us. We are building thenecessary networks of cooperation. The great questionremaining is whether we have the vision and the heartnecessary to imagine a future that is different from thepast - necessary to free ourselves from destructive patternsof relations with each other and within our own nations andto live a future that is different.A new century in a new millennium is upon us. Weare literally present at the future  and it is the great gift weare obligated to leave to our children."
"168",7272,"UZB",52,1997,"﻿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to your high office  and to express ourconfidence in the success of the work of the currentsession. I also wish to thank sincerely Ambassador RazaliIsmail for his enormous contribution to the work of thesessions of the General Assembly over which he presided.The changes which have been taking place in ourworld in recent years and the formation of a qualitativelynew geopolitical system of international relations requirethe adaptation of the United Nations to new realities  withthe creation of a flexible and efficient internationalmechanism which can take effective measures to addressthe new challenges of our time.In Uzbekistan we have a positive assessment ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan’s plan for reforming theUnited Nations. Although a number of these proposalsrequire careful study and additional elaboration  we canalready highlight concrete aspects which deserve support.I refer primarily to the decision on the enlargement of thepermanent membership of the Security Council throughthe inclusion of Germany and Japan  countries whichtoday are playing a significant role in world economic andpolitical affairs.We also support the enlargement of the non-permanentmembership of the Security Council  which  in our view would provide for a more democratic representation ofother States in this body.To promote efficiency in implementing the resolutionsof the United Nations  there is a need to reinforce andbroaden the authority of the Secretary-General. In our view we should also support the proposal to establish the post ofa Deputy Secretary-General.The idea of merging all the United Nations entities indifferent countries under one flag in the so-called UnitedNations Houses seems to us quite rational.The reform of the United Nations administrationstructure will allow for reallocation of the funds saved toenhance development programmes.The creation of a single agency to combat crime terrorism  drug-trafficking and money-laundering is also atimely proposal.The proposals on consolidating the economic andsocial departments  cutting down on United Nationsadministrative staff  replacing the Department ofHumanitarian Affairs and establishing a streamlinedEmergency Relief Coordination Office to coordinateactivities of all the United Nations agencies inimplementing assistance projects  also merit our attention.Maintaining security and stability in Central Asia andproviding conditions for the sustainable development of theStates of the region are among the crucial guidelines for theforeign policy of Uzbekistan. To achieve these goals Uzbekistan has put forward concrete initiatives  particularlywithin the rostrum of the United Nations.I should like to take this opportunity to draw attentionagain to a number of problems which require an immediatesolution  both at the regional level and at the broaderinternational level.I refer first to the continuing conflict in Afghanistan which has recently become particularly brutal  and to thecontinuing instability in Tajikistan.Our position of principle regarding the Afghansettlement remains unchanged. Its major aspects includesuch points as the maintenance of the territorial integrityof Afghanistan; the rejection of force as a means ofsettling the conflict; the cessation of external interference;the imposition of an arms embargo; the participation in aphased peace process of all the major forces involved inthe conflict; the implementation of the peace processunder the aegis of the United Nations  and with theparticipation of the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC); and the creation of a broad-basedcoalition Government including all the various oppositionparties.We share the view of the Secretary-General that ifthe meaningless civil war in Afghanistan is to be halted regional and international participants must shoulderadditional obligations. Despite all the complications of thesituation around Afghanistan  trends have recently beenobserved which can  and indeed must  be used to beginthe peace process.The proposal on imposing an arms embargo deservesspecial attention. Such an embargo  which has alreadybeen proposed by Uzbekistan on many occasions  must beconsidered the principal condition for halting externalinterference in Afghanistan’s affairs. We are well awareof the technical difficulties related to the implementationof this initiative in the conditions prevailing inAfghanistan. However  we do not think that they areinsurmountable. In our view  the process of imposing anarms embargo should be divided into two stages: first  theadoption by the Security Council of a resolution on theembargo  which would be political in nature; secondly the drawing up of United Nations control machinery forcompliance.We welcome the stepping up of United Nationsefforts to resolve the Afghan problem  in particular  theappointment of Mr. Brahimi as the Special Envoy of theSecretary-General. We hope that the United Nations willalso support our initiative for the creation of a contactgroup from among the countries neighbouringAfghanistan  as well as the United States  Russia andother interested States  together with  of course representatives of inter-Afghan forces.Uzbekistan fully supports the principle of theindivisibility of security — internal  regional and global.Our country was among the first of the newlyindependent States to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly  in 1993  Uzbekistancalled upon the international community to declare2Central Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone  and we have beenconsistently moving towards the implementation of thisinitiative.Concrete confirmation of this policy was the holdingof the international conference “Central Asia — Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone” in Tashkent on 14 to 16 September under United Nations auspices and with the participation ofhigh-level representatives of more than 60 internationalorganizations and countries. This forum was a majorinternational event in the history of the region. However we are well aware that the process of establishing anuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia is not a one-timepolitical action. It must be carried out within the frameworkof existing agreements and in accordance with internationalexperience  in particular within the framework of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) andthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.In this regard  on the regional level a reliable systemof collective efforts by States participating in this initiativeshould be developed. Those efforts must ensure the non-proliferation regime  the ecological safety of hazardousindustries that involve nuclear raw materials and theprevention of leakage of nuclear technologies and materials.On the international level it is necessary to givepriority attention to the settlement of regional problems.The phased advancement towards global security is possibleonly after we create secure and stable regions. In otherwords  when dealing with global problems  it is essential tofollow the principle of moving from regionalism toglobalism.It is also necessary to fundamentally reconsider thesecurity guarantees provided to the non-nuclear States  firstand foremost to those participating in nuclear-weapon-freezones. We need to organically combine the efforts forpromoting non-proliferation and ensuring global nuclearsecurity with the resolution of regional problems. Theproblem of non-proliferation must be considered in closelinkage with significant reductions of other types ofweapons of mass destruction.Uzbekistan highly appreciates the efforts ofinternational organizations — first of all the UnitedNations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) and the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) — for their support of the Central Asianinitiative. We would like to request the General Assembly its President and the Secretary-General to assist in thepassage of a special resolution in support of the initiativedeclaring Central Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone and inthe establishment of a United Nations expert group tostudy the forms and elements of the regional agreementon this issue.Our cooperation within the framework of the OSCEis making a significant contribution to enhancing regionalsecurity in Central Asia. We consider the OSCEParliamentary Assembly Expanded Bureau MeetingSeminar  held in September 1997 in the capital ofUzbekistan  as the world community’s recognition ofCentral Asia’s importance in issues related tostrengthening peace and stability on the regional andglobal levels.The creation of the Central Asian collectivepeacekeeping battalion by Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan andUzbekistan was an important step towards safeguardingpeace and stability in the region. For the first time on theterritory of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan broad-scaleexercises of the Central Asian collective peacekeepingbattalion  Centrazbat 97  were held  with the participationof multinational forces. These exercises constituted aserious test  the successful completion of which confirmedthis battalion as a fully fledged unit in the United Nationsreserve peacekeeping forces.Once again we should like to take advantage of thisUnited Nations forum to call upon the internationalcommunity to pool its efforts to tackle the serious threatto the security of the Central Asian region that may alsohave consequences on the global level. I am referring tothe ecological situation in the Aral Sea basin.The current session of the General Assembly — theReform Assembly  as it was called by Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan — must give a fresh impetus to the jointefforts of the international community in combatingorganized crime  drug dealing and terrorism. We need todevelop transnational programmes to confront thesechallenges and threats.We may confidently say that if favourable conditionsand trends are maintained  in the twenty-first centuryCentral Asia  given its geostrategic significance and itsvast natural  energy and human resources  will become apromising and dynamic regional market of a globalimportance.The interdependence of the situation emerging inCentral Asia  the common European security systemtaking shape and the outlook for developing situations3within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgentneed for the international community to take measures toensure durable peace and stability in this region along withits sustainable development."
"169",7318,"VCT",52,1997,"﻿I wishto congratulate you  Mr. President  on your unanimouselection. I am confident that under your leadership thissession of the General Assembly is well placed to addressthe important issues on its agenda.Commendation is due His Excellency Mr. RazaliIsmail for the balanced and effective guidance he providedduring the just concluded session.My delegation takes this opportunity to offer heartfeltcongratulations to our new Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  on his assumption of such a high and noble office.He will no doubt bring fresh insights to bear on theHerculean tasks and problems confronting the UnitedNations. We wish to indicate our support for his initiativesfor reforming the United Nations.In spite of the many achievements of the UnitedNations  much remains to be done. The world is stillplagued by poverty  all manner of diseases — some evendefying medical science — terrorism  regional conflictand the menace of drugs. There can be no real peace orsecurity if millions of people go to bed hungry. There canbe no comfort if the rich man turns his back on the poorman and treats him as a statistic. It seems as if the moralobligation to help the disadvantaged has been totallyabandoned in some quarters.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains a verypeaceful country  with its cherished democraticinstitutions intact. Recently our judicial system  which isknown historically for its integrity  was put undermicroscopic examination with a view to discrediting it.The test results reveal a clean bill of health. This painfulperiod in our history has taught us many lessons. Weknow now that there are friends who will smile with uswhile plotting our execution. Today it is true to say thatmight is not right and that a small nation like ours canhave the fortitude to withstand attacks even from thosewho may have the strength of Samson.Our banana pains continue to intensify. Theprognosis appears to be very bleak. The recent WorldTrade Organization (WTO) ruling has left us dazed andhelpless. The concept of every man being his brother’skeeper has been shattered.Can we survive? Will our criesfor help go unheeded? What about our neighbours? Arethey deaf or uncaring? I know it now. Money and greedhave been elevated to the status of a religion  and careand concern are now regarded as a vice. Our future isnow on a life-support system. However  I am confidentthat our resourcefulness and faith will see us through.My delegation welcomes the idea of theestablishment of a zone of peace in the Middle East. Wecall on all parties to take urgent and practical stepstowards the establishment of such a zone in accordancewith the relevant General Assembly resolutions adoptedby consensus. We also call for a halt to the distributionand production of conventional weapons  which havecaused immense suffering  especially in this century.Recent acts of terrorism have given cause for greatconcern. Why should innocent people continue to perish?The United Nations Charter provides for the peacefulsettlement of disputes. Both sides have rights which mustbe respected. Violence can never be a solution. Let us putreason before bloodshed.12We should not rush to write the obituary for theMiddle East peace process. The wounds inflicted are notfatal; the haemorrhaging can be stopped and the processrevived.I look forward to the day when peace will break outin that ancient region  when men shall beat their swordsinto ploughshares and into pruning hooks their spears.Our own hemisphere is not without problems. Ourregion believes in neighbourly love  and any attempt toinflict pain and unjustified hardship on any of us affects allof us. Those who exert pressure  be it economic or legal will find no comfort in our bosom. The strategy ofdiplomatic isolation has failed. It is clear that in the newmillennium  we cannot do business as usual. In hemisphericmatters  muscular diplomacy should give way to moralsuasion.During this year both Suriname and Haiti have becomefull members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).We take this opportunity to welcome them once again. Wealso note the progress made since the reestablishment ofdemocracy in Haiti  and we urge the internationalcommunity to continue to offer technical  material andfinancial help. That will enable the people of that countryto deepen the process of democracy and to promote thecountry’s sustained economic and social development. Iwould like to take this opportunity to express my sympathyto the Government of Haiti in regard to the recent tragedyat sea.In our region  nature has manifested its mighty force and the people in Montserrat are now fleeing from an angryvolcano that erupts periodically. Our hearts are with thepeople there  and we have done whatever we can to assist.Efforts to help are continuing at home even as I speak. Letus hope that the full extent of the plight of the people ofMontserrat is realized by those who are in a position tomake a substantial contribution. Now is the time to standup and be counted.My delegation welcomes the convening in 1998 of aspecial session of the United Nations General Assemblydedicated to the fight against the illicit production  sale demand for and distribution of illicit drugs and psychotropicsubstances. Those who traffic in this trade can properly beregarded as merchants of death. International cooperation isthe only way to combat this menace.I wish at this time to pay tribute to a woman who hasdied recently and whose name evokes mystic reverence.Her legacy is one of compassion. I speak of MotherTeresa. She embraced the poor  the sick and the suffering the favoured and the dispossessed. Her life shows thateven in this cruel world there are still people who arewilling to put others before themselves in unrewardedservice. She lived her religion to the fullest. May she restin peace.It is our hope that the issue regarding Taiwan can beresolved peacefully. We urge those on both sides of theTaiwan Strait to hold discussions and negotiate a peacefulsolution in the reunification process to which both sidesare committed. We of Saint Vincent and the Grenadinesare very grateful for the assistance we have received fromTaiwan  and we would hope that the internationalcommunity would respect its contribution to developmentand that it may find its place in the internationalcommunity.My delegation will continue to support thefundamental rights of all peoples to self-determination.We are heartened to see the emergence into sovereignstatehood and independence of peoples once undercolonial domination or foreign occupation. We reaffirmthe inalienable right of peoples of Non-Self-GoverningTerritories to self-determination.The reform and expansion of the Security Council isof paramount importance as we approach the dawn of anew millennium. My delegation wishes to emphasize thatthe ongoing discussions on the reform and expansion ofthe Security Council must take into account the principleof sovereign equality of States and equitable geographicaldistribution. There is also the need for transparency accountability and democratization.My delegation has no objection to the inclusion ofadditional developed countries on the Council aspermanent members  but we fully support the proposalthat all regions be represented in a permanent capacity including Latin America and the Caribbean. The reformcannot be handled piecemeal. We will not support anychange that does not include Latin America and theCaribbean Community.Expansion of the Council must not and cannot belimited to permanent seats. It is necessary to increase thenumber of non-permanent seats to give more countries anopportunity to serve on the Council within a relativelyshorter time-frame. In addition  we recommend that theregional non-permanent seats be rotated among thecountries that are desirous of serving on the Council.13In this process we must remember and be guided bythe word “democracy”. If this body is to have the moralauthority to restore or encourage democracy in someMember States  it must first become fully democratic.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains a loyal anddedicated member of the United Nations committed toupholding the noble principles of the Charter. Now morethan ever before we must reaffirm our collective respect forthe fundamental principles of the Charter. The small nationsof the world must receive constant reassurances from thelarger nations that their interests will be safeguarded  theirsovereignty respected.When we speak of the United Nations  we mustproject our vision beyond this building. In the end it is ourdeeds that will count. Yes  it is what we do to the least ofour brethren. Promises and statements have no meaningunless they can be translated into action. This body mustnever be perceived as a gathering of word merchants but rather  as one of action-oriented men and women.Our planet’s resources are finite  and even the mosteconomically developed States cannot pursue unilateralpolicies in isolation from the rest of the world.We stand firm in the belief that the United Nations isstill the best hope for the world. This hope must begrounded in action  in a firm resolve to act decisively in thebest interests of this great institution — indeed in theinterest of all humanity and untainted by the narrownational interests that have dogged our path during the lastfive decades."
"170",7365,"VEN",52,1997,"﻿Speaking here on behalf of my country  I wish tocongratulate the new Secretary-General of the Organization Mr. Kofi Annan  who  after nine months in his post  nowfor the first time faces the responsibility of a session of theGeneral Assembly  a session that is likely to be noteworthyand hard-working. Given his vast experience  he is wellaware that the prestige and influence of his important postderive from the impartiality that places him above allpressure of interests and raises him to the permanent statusof arbitrator for all and a symbol of the Organization.I also wish to offer my congratulations to the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his appointment as President of this session of theGeneral Assembly.The pace of events today means that subjects that weconsidered just last year seem obsolete. Nevertheless  as wehave still not found solutions to the most pressing problemsfacing the international community  it is logical to keepreturning to those that are of concern to every member ofthat community and to the community as a whole  whichnow finds itself in the midst of the most rapid process ofchange in history.Inevitably  therefore  we will again go over  forexample  human rights  the rule of law  free elections  thewar on drugs  corruption  disarmament  terrorism and othercompelling issues that crop up constantly among ourconcerns and in our work nowadays.I must place on record the fact that the Government ofVenezuela has taken measures on all these issues to ensureincreased respect for human rights  to wage war on drugsand to promote further disarmament and assist in the fightagainst corruption. Naturally  it is not easy for any countryto show a clean record. A Government’s good intentions asregards human rights will always immediately come upagainst recurring internal violence and still untamed unrulyelements  as in the example constantly presented by theaudiovisual media in developed countries. But the willexists and an effort is being made to make Governmentagencies increasingly aware of our resolve to protectguarantee human rights.I wish to highlight the work done by the first UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador  Mr. José Ayala-Lasso  and welcome the new High Commissioner  theformer President of Ireland  Mrs. Mary Robinson  towhom my country wishes every success in the stimulatingbut difficult task ahead of her.With regard to corruption  terrorism anddisarmament  my country  which proposed and was ableto gain approval for the Inter-American Convention —the first of its kind in the world — in March 1996 remains steadfast in its efforts to ensure that everycountry is aware of the need to punish wrongdoing ingovernment  wrongdoing that has tended to be treatedwith great indulgence. It may not be possible to eradicatecorruption  but timely punishment — by endingimpunity — will make such action risky.We have been enthusiastic supporters of allinitiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade  in addition tobeing aware that there are free markets often beyondGovernment control  we are concerned that theindustrialized countries  by lifting embargoes in this field may begin moving towards the opposite extreme andpromote the sale of weapons everywhere  under pressurefrom the military industry  which has an extremelypowerful lobby.My country has resolutely backed the programme toeliminate landmines  hundreds of millions of which havebeen irresponsibly and thoughtlessly scattered interritories on every continent  daily taking their toll ofmany innocent victims  particularly children  whosemutilation by landmines is a constant reminder that weneed to ensure justice for humankind.The fact that Venezuela has a neighbour whereillegal drugs continue to be planted  processed and soldplaces us in the unfortunate position of being part of thesupply route and within an area influenced by drugmoney. That is why the Government of Venezuela hastaken every precaution to keep this danger to a minimum.It fights trafficking on land and sea and in the air  andhas intercepted large shipments of drugs. The official incharge of all Government action against this powerfulenemy of humankind has been given the rank of Minister.It goes without saying that we look forwardhopefully to the next special session of the GeneralAssembly  on illegal drug trafficking  to be held at therequest of Mexico. We hope that it will produce clearsolutions that will enable us to wage a more successfulwar on this scourge and  above all  put an end to moneylaundering  where Government efforts have so far beenleast successful.11As the threat of ever more pitiless and atrocious actsof terrorism has spread around the world and  to no smallextent  here on our American continent  Venezuela hastaken an interest in ensuring that the internationalcommunity is made increasingly aware of itsresponsibilities in joint efforts to approve a convention forthe suppression of terrorist bombings. That convention iscurrently being considered by the General Assembly  in abody that should be completing its work shortly.When the Inter-American Convention againstCorruption was approved  we voiced our hope that  giventhat the disregard for of ethical standards that has fosteredthis crime has been a worldwide and not a strictlyAmerican phenomenon  the subject would one day be takenup by the United Nations in order to produce aninternational convention giving voice to the concern felt byall countries over this problem and harnessing the generalwillingness to put an end to impunity. The day seems tohave come when the Member States of this Organizationwill work together to do away with the toleranceencountered on all continents towards this canker afflictingpolitics and administration; a canker whose breeding groundis not underdevelopment  but the moral decay of the Stateand society; a canker that seriously and increasingly hindersthe trade that is a necessary part of economic globalization.My Government has welcomed the idea of changes notonly in the structure  but even in the philosophy of this 50-year-old Organization. Since the lives of the peoples of thisworld have undergone such profound changes  it would beinexcusable for the United Nations  which represents themall  to remain untouched.We have considered the various plans for reforms andwatched the efforts made by the outgoing President of theGeneral Assembly over these past few months to achievesome  at least  of the essential changes to the system duringhis term in office. And  although we believe this issue to beboth timely and urgent  we do not feel that there isimminent consensus on the suggested changes which  aboveall  relate to membership on the Security Council. In anycase  it is only fair to recognize the serious efforts beingmade to end the stagnation within this Organization andlaunch the debate that is just beginning.Venezuela supports an increase in the number ofpermanent Members on the Security Council  providedthere is no discrimination of any kind and that there is dueregard for the interests of the international community including fair representation of all geographical regions  inline with other new circumstances.We feel that there are great expectations and highhopes that the Secretariat will become more efficient andthat the Organization’s burden of projected expendituresmay be eased. It is also essential that Member States paytheir contributions on time. None of us can refuse tohonour a freely accepted obligation  nor make paymentconditional in a way that presents a threat to the equalityof States and the dignity of the world forum of which weare a part.My country’s position  however  is not limited tothis alone. It goes beyond an analysis of the opportunitiesand rules of the veto to the elimination of the vetoaltogether. It has to do with the reform of the Secretariatitself and with economic and social issues  especiallyfunding for development  as envisaged in the relevantdocument. That is why we feel that consideration shouldbe given to the ideas recently expressed by both theGroup of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement as regardsnot only this subject  but also consensus on the otherreforms.Venezuela supports the convening of an internationalconference on financing for development  in cooperationwith international financial institutions  to proposeinnovative and bold mechanisms in this area. Suchmechanisms must include the mobilization of capitalresources for investment in non-industrialized countrieswhile at the same time  opening the door to theopportunities offered by the private sector.Non-governmental organizations — increasinglyactive in today’s world — could contribute even moretowards attainment of the aims of the Charter of UnitedNations in this field of action. My country has launchedan intensive round of consultations with theseorganizations in what it has called a “Dialogue betweensenior Government and non-governmental organizations” so as to draw up a plan for the promotion  protection andobservance of human rights in Venezuela.We welcomed the Convention on the Law of theNon-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses asa well-conceived initiative. That is why Venezuela playedan active role in the various stages of the drafting of thedocument  which required years of work  and led to thesuccessful conclusion of a document that includesvirtually all the provisions on this subject that exist ininternational law. My country signed the Conventionyesterday and we call upon other countries to do thesame.12As Venezuela has always been in favour of theestablishment of an international criminal court  we wish todraw attention to what the international community hasdone to deal with and punish international crimes againstpeace and security  first with the creation of ad hoc courtsand then with the creation of a permanent body such as thatcourt. By thus institutionalizing and centralizing thepolitical will of States  we will help prevent the possibilityof the winners in a conflict from being tempted to becomethe judges of the defeated.This seems the appropriate time and place to mentionthe Ibero-American community of which Venezuela is apart and the five hundredth anniversary of ChristopherColumbus’s only landing on continental America in hisvoyages.Since 1991  500 years after the discovery of America thanks to an initiative of the King of Spain  the 21countries that proudly share the honour of being membersof the Ibero-American community have met once a year  ina different city each time. I say “proudly” because in theircolonial endeavours both Spain and Portugal took amissionary approach. While imposing their political powerand territorial government  they also disseminatedChristianity and passed on with conviction their Europeancivilization and culture. Thus in Spanish and PortugueseAmerica  the mixing of blood and cultures took root making our world a different one  a world characterized bysocial egalitarianism  religious tolerance and a strong anddeeply rooted freedom. The effects of this situation  whichdefines and unites American existence from north to south makes this community stand out. It does not set it apartfrom others  but  in this era of globalization  it affirms thevery particular features of Ibero-American identity.This idea has evolved well  beginning in Guadalajara then continuing in Madrid  Salvador de Bahia  Cartagena Bariloche and Santiago. The seventh summit meeting willbe held on Margarita Island in my country.As the host country suggests the key topic fordiscussion at each meeting  the President of Venezuela Mr. Rafael Caldera  has proposed the general heading of“Ethical values of democracy”  a suggestion that has beenaccepted with great enthusiasm.The Governments of Venezuela and the other 20countries of Ibero-America insist that it is not enough tohave formal democracy if corruption is rampant  ifinefficiency persists  if justice is not effective  or if theaction taken by the democratic sectors is neithersatisfactory nor transparent.Thus  this general topic encompasses other veryspecific issues having to do with social justice  humanrights  electoral transparency elections  the sincerity ofpolitical parties and  unavoidably  truth in information.That is the nucleus of the agenda for the meeting to beheld on 8 and 9 November on Margarita Island.It is not out of place to explain to this Assembly thatthere are good reasons for this agenda. The economicchanges and the political upheavals of our world havewreaked havoc on the set of values that was  untilrecently  the foundation on which people’s lives rested.The weakness of social justice is pathetic. In morethan a few countries  unavoidable macroeconomicadjustments have affected vast numbers of people who arevictims of injustice and who are unable  both mentallyand physically  of coping with these changes  leavingthem even worse off than they were before. Somethingmust be done to improve the lot of these multitudesduring a transition that  although necessary  is stillpainful.The subject of human rights  which I mentionedbriefly at the beginning of my statement  is vitallyimportant  and it would not be surprising if some day itwere to replace “democracy” as a term and as a concept.Certain statements on this subject may have beenexaggerated in the heat of the moment. But the truth isthat we must march firmly forward towards a time whenevery human being  without exception  feels for his fellowman the same respect that he asks for himself. This is amatter of education  training and will on the part ofGovernments  so that the bad examples from the moredeveloped countries that are passed on by the media donot lead the developing countries to continue violatingthese rights.Despite the fact that democracy has taken root invirtually all the countries in our region — seemingly thedesideratum of our times — it now faces a variety ofdangers  such as elections rigged by internationalorganized crime. The most specific and dangerous casehas to do with the influential role that drug traffickingand money laundering now play in elections  allowingcrime to become closely entwined with political power.My country’s position in this regard is to warnpolitical parties to make sure their electoral campaigns are13transparent by keeping these campaigns short and to thepoint so as to avoid any improper financial influence.Democracy is  by its very nature  a system of politicalparties. There is no democratic system without politicalparties. Yet it is obvious that the downfall of democracy isoften due to carelessness on the part of the political partieson which it is based  when  setting aside the ethics ofservice  ideology and efficiency  they are tempted to takeadvantage of the resources of the State using the pretext oflengthy  complex and costly election campaigns. It wouldseem that the time has come to return to the old politicalideas or to invent new means of expression in order to healand revitalize democracy.Many people reacted by voicing doubts and fearswhen the subject of the people’s right to truthfulinformation was raised. Media groups have even claimedthat this proposal is full of hidden dangers. Nevertheless the straightforward intent of this proposal is to strengthenthe influence of the media at a time when they are virtuallythe first estate. We consider this right to be the counterpartto the media’s right to carry out their activities in absolutefreedom  given the fact that society legitimately aspires  inturn  to be properly  accurately and truthfully informed.In an era in which the media have the most amazingtechnologies at their disposal — such as those providinginstantaneous communication — there can be noexplanation for information that distorts  embellishes ortampers with the truth. All the power that we give themedia  essential for the values of democracy  would be lostif the media were to step outside their role and beginvoicing opinions instead of reporting or made themselvespart of the day-to-day debate of ideas.What Venezuela hopes to achieve by this debate is tomake clear the responsibilities that each actor must play ina democracy  and the media are very important actors. Thatis the reason for this initiative: to warn and caution them not by suggesting rules  but by appealing to a sense ofresponsibility  prompted by their own conscience  withregard to the worthy part that information must play inbuilding a safe and trusting society.Following on from comments I made at this year’sIbero-American Summit in Venezuela  I wish to mentionthe five-hundredth anniversary of the day when ChristopherColumbus set foot on continental America  in August 1498 at the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela. Until then the feats ofexploration by the discoverer of the New World had beenlimited to the islands of the Caribbean. He was notabsolutely sure that he was actually standing oncontinental soil when in 1498 he reached Macuro  a smallvillage on the eastern coast of Venezuela  but he certainlywondered as he witnessed the thrust of a strong currentthat overcame the gentle waves and gave proof of thepresence of a great river  the Orinoco. This was anextremely important event for my country  which we planto commemorate properly. It was the only time the greatadmiral stood on terra firma  which he called “Land ofGrace”. In making this announcement  we hope the globalcommunity will join us in our celebration.In closing  I wish to express Venezuela’s faith in theability of the Organization to act as a permanent arbitratorfor peace and development. There is a greater need everyday for the United Nations to act as the voice andconscience of humanity  but never as the spokesperson ortool of any group  region or interest other than thecommunity which created it and of which it is the core."
"171",7404,"VNM",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of theVietnamese delegation  I wish to warmly congratulate you Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that underyour wise guidance this session will be crowned with manyfine results.I should like also to express the appreciation of theVietnamese delegation for the active work done byMr. Razali Ismail  President of the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  a session that marked new strides on theUnited Nations journey to fulfil its mandate in contributingto peace and development in the world as a whole.May I take this opportunity to warmly congratulateMr. Kofi Annan  who  within a very short span of timesince assuming the very important post of Secretary-General of the United Nations  has managed to accomplisha large amount of work  including efforts related to reformof the United Nations in the light of the profound changesin the world  in response to the aspirations of peoples withregard to our global Organization.Mankind is rushing towards the end of the twentiethcentury and preparing to enter the third millennium withan earnest desire for a more tranquil and better life. Thatdesire becomes even more earnest when we look back atthe last century  a century that has been darkened by theblack clouds of two world wars and countless conflicts large and small. That desire becomes even more urgentgiven that the boundless mind of man has producednumerous miraculous inventions  opening up a new eracalled the “post-industrial era” or “the information age” while more than a quarter of the developing world’spopulation still lives in poverty  some 840 million gohungry or face food insecurity  and even in industrialcountries more than 100 million people live below thepoverty line and 37 million are jobless.Under these circumstances  it is understandable thatall nations see the need to consolidate peace and promotedevelopment as their primary priority so as to turn thetwenty-first century into a century with fewer conflictsand less poverty.Peace and development are companions; they gotogether like the two sides of a coin. Sustainabledevelopment is only possible if it is built upon the solidpremise of a durable peace: peace for all nations  peacefor every region and peace for the entire planet. Here  wefully subscribe to the views expressed in the Agenda forDevelopment: development is a prerequisite for peace and at the same time peace is a precondition fordevelopment.We may take satisfaction from the fact that  during thepast year  a series of events have shown that the trendtowards peace is continuing. Political solutions have beenfound for a number of decades-old conflicts. Relationsbetween various nations  including the big Powers  haveseen some partial improvements. Following in the footstepsof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  theChemical Weapons Convention (CWC) entered into force.The South-East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone(SEANWFZ) has come into existence.In spite of all this  the world’s people still cannot beassured of a lasting peace if that peace is not constructedon an equitable premise. It is truly unfair that a fewcountries are entitled to maintain an absolute superiority which even enables them to use their power to impose theirwill on other countries  while many countries have to livein the fear of insecurity. In this context  we hold that thereis still a need to free our planet from the burden of nuclearweapons  to ban  totally and resolutely  the production storage  threat and use of this most horrible and lethal typeof weapon. In the same context  we expect the nuclear-weapon States to sign the protocol annexed to theSEANWFZ soon  in order to strengthen the power of theTreaty  thereby making a viable contribution to peace andstability in South-East Asia.Our world cannot have peace when conflicts are stillraging in various parts of our planet. Today  the MiddleEast is again raising the deep concern of everyone. Weshare the position that tremendous efforts are needed tolead us to a durable and lasting peace for that region  whichhas suffered too much and too long. Such a peace can beachieved only on the basis of ensuring the safety of thenations living in this region  respecting the fundamentalrights of the Palestinian people  including the right toestablish an independent Palestinian State  and  mostimmediately  the strict implementation of the UnitedNations resolutions and the principles of the MadridConference  as well as the accords that have beenconcluded.In Asia and the Pacific in general and in South-EastAsia in particular  where  fortunately  stability is on therise  incremental efforts are being made to render this trendmore durable. As a country bordering Cambodia  we givegreat attention to the situation in that neighbouring nation.Our position on the Cambodian question is clear to all: inconformity with our general foreign policy  we persevere inupholding the principle of full respect for the independenceand sovereignty of nations and the principle that the affairsof a country must be decided by the people of that countryitself  free from foreign interference. At the same time from the bottom of our heart  we wish the Cambodianpeople peace and stability so that they can reconstruct aprosperous country in their homeland. We sincerely wishto tirelessly foster relations of friendship and cooperationwith the Kingdom of Cambodia.Bordering the South China Sea  which we call theEastern Sea  Viet Nam has always considered thatdisputes there should be settled by negotiation on thebasis of international law  particularly the 1982 UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea  with a viewto achieving a sustainable and lasting solution. For thetime being  it is necessary to preserve the status quo exert self-restraint and abstain from acts that may furthercompound the situation and prejudice the stability of theregion and the safety of international maritime navigation.At the same time  we should seek cooperation measuresacceptable to the parties concerned. We share thesatisfaction at the recent positive developments related tothe situation in the Korean peninsula  and it is our wishthat these developments will lead to a durable peace inthis very sensitive part of our world.Although peace is the most important condition fordevelopment  peace alone  without cooperation amongStates on the basis of equality and mutual respect andbenefits  is not adequate. Today  in a world of ever-deepening interdependence  and under the impact ofglobalization and regionalization trends  the need fordevelopment cooperation is increasingly strong.It is obvious that nations are facing unprecedentedopportunities for expanding markets  engaging morepartners and intensifying investment and technologytransfers in order to attain higher growth. Besides this there is a rather stark reality  especially for developingcountries: the process of liberalization has madecompetition extremely acute  and in that competition theadvantages do not go to countries which  due to certaincircumstances  are still at a low level of economicdevelopment. It is therefore no surprise that the gapbetween the rich and poor countries is widening  causinggreat losses to developing nations.That situation gives the international community twochoices: either to let things go on  which will cause amore serious crisis  affecting the global economic andpolitical situation; or to cooperate for shared development.In our humble opinion  the first scenario is not beneficialto anybody  while the latter brings about benefit for everybody.2With that perception  we are of the view that it isnecessary to reverse the trend of decreasing officialdevelopment assistance  both bilaterally and multilaterally.With that perception  we look forward to strongertechnology transfers  because outstanding and rapidscientific and technological progress is presenting a dangerof developing countries being left further behind.With that perception  we would like to emphasize theneed to set up reasonable trade terms  taking into accountthe difficulties faced by developing countries  and to ensurethat the developed countries broaden market access forcommodities from the developing countries.With that perception  we believe that it is high time tocompletely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking andacting of the past  namely  the imposition of inequitableterms of economic and trade relations  sanctions andembargoes  and so forth  which distort internationalrelations  cause suffering to the people and seriously violatethe minimum right of human beings — the right to apeaceful life.Under the general circumstances of our world today the need to reform the United Nations has become moreand more imperative. We share many of the ideas that theSecretary-General has put forth. In our opinion  besides itscontribution to the maintenance of peace  the promotion ofequitable international cooperation — a top priority on theagenda of the United Nations — must mean more vigorousassistance to development. We offer our strong support forthe ideas stated in the Secretary-General’s report “Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform”(A/51/950)  which particularly underlined that thepromotion of economic development and developmentcooperation was the primary mandate and function of theUnited Nations. It is our hope that countries  especially thedeveloped ones  will enhance their contribution to thedevelopment programmes of the United Nations.On this occasion  I wish to express our highappreciation to the institutions of the United Nations systemfor the assistance extended to Viet Nam  especially for oureconomic renovation to implement social programmes ofpoverty alleviation  health care and education development and international integration. The commitment to furtherenhance the efficiency of the partnership between Viet Namand the United Nations development system was made bythe two partners at the conference to review 20 years ofViet Nam-United Nations cooperation  which took placerecently in Hanoi.With regard to the United Nations structure  ourconsistent view is that it should reflect the fundamentalchanges that have been taking place during the last half-century or more  the most notable highlight of which isthat over 100 independent States have joined the UnitedNations. Its organizational structure and workingprocedures could be more democratized. The stature ofdeveloping countries needs to be strongly enhanced including in the Security Council  and at the same time the role of the General Assembly should be furtherstrengthened. Along those lines  we share the view that itis necessary to increase the membership of the SecurityCouncil  both permanent and non-permanent categories with a satisfactory number of seats given to developingcountries in Asia  Africa and Latin America  and toensure that every Member assumes similar responsibilitiesand rights. We believe that in order to work out acomprehensive programme for United Nations reform aCommittee of the Whole should be established.The National Assembly of Viet Nam has just heldthe first session of its tenth term in Hanoi to elect thehighest dignitaries of our State and approve the list ofnew government members  thus realizing importantcontinuity of generations of leadership. This NationalAssembly is of special significance  as it will lead ourcountry into the twenty-first century on the road of all-round renovation to attain the goal of “Wealthy people strong country  just and civilized society”  through theprocess of national industrialization and modernization  inorder to turn Viet Nam into a basically industrializedState by the year 2020.In its foreign relations  Viet Nam will constantlypursue an open foreign policy of independence diversification and the promotion of multilateral relationsalong the line of gradual regional and internationalintegration  thus making worthy contributions to the causeof peace  national independence  democracy and socialprogress. In line with this policy  Viet Nam will continueto stand as an active Member of the United Nations andthe Non-Aligned Movement. In line with this policy  VietNam is making constructive contributions to theintensification of cooperation within the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is activelypreparing the sixth ASEAN Summit to be held in Hanoiat the end of next year. In line with this policy  Viet Namis competing with time to ensure the successfulorganization of the forthcoming seventh summit ofFrench-speaking community in Hanoi. In line with thispolicy  Viet Nam is sparing no effort in making practicalpreparations to participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic3Cooperation Council and the World Trade Organization.Also in line with this policy  Viet Nam wishes to becomea member of the United Nations Economic and SocialCouncil at the elections to be held at this session of theGeneral Assembly. We are confident that this reasonablewish of ours will meet with the generous support ofMember countries.As we strive for the noble aspirations of peace anddevelopment on the eve of the new century  countries in theinternational community will continue to find in Viet Nama sincere friend and constructive companion. On our part we expect that United Nations activities will be ever moreeffective in enabling all countries to work for shareddevelopment in peace and partnership."
"172",7435,"VUT",52,1997,"﻿I am privileged today to be able to congratulatethe President  on behalf of the Government of theRepublic of Vanuatu  on his election to preside over theAssembly at a period critical to the life of theOrganization and its role in future relations between ourcountries and peoples. I should like to assure him of thefull support and cooperation my delegation and mycountry will lend him and his country  Ukraine  during hismandate.I should also like to take this opportunity to expressthe warmest congratulations of the Government andpeople of Vanuatu to the President of the precedingsession  Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia  on therole he played during a period in mankind’s history that15will be noteworthy for a series of events that wereimportant both on an international level and on variousregional levels.This is also a special opportunity for me to welcomethe new Secretary-General of the Organization  Mr. KofiAnnan  and to reiterate the support of the Republic ofVanuatu for him in carrying out his mandate as Secretary-General and  in particular  for the new initiatives he hastaken and committed himself to take in the process ofdialogue and consultation with all Member States withregard to the future of the Organization.After more than 50 years of existence  the UnitedNations today finds itself facing an economic andinternational political situation that is increasingly complexand particularly more difficult for small developingcountries in general  and especially so for the leastdeveloped small island countries  like the Republic ofVanuatu.This situation should be recognized as one of themajor challenges to the international community and onethat must be dealt with through more committedinternational cooperation  particularly favourable treatmentbeing given to meet the specific needs of those countriesand populations that are its victims.For the Republic of Vanuatu  the highest priorityremains the economic development and social well-being ofits population  more than 80 per cent of whom live in ruralareas or on islands far from the administrative andcommercial centre.The maintenance of political stability and socialharmony in a country depends and will continue to depend first and foremost  on the country’s orientation andeconomic development process. The rhetoric of certaindevelopment partners in trying to make their technical andfinancial assistance contingent on the political commitmentof government leaders and on the maintenance of peace isfutile with regard to the Pacific region. Such rhetoric tendsrather to challenge the very integrity of these leaders andtheir commitment to socio-economic development in theirrespective countries.Genuine international cooperation must not only bebased on the high-priority socio-economic needs of thedeveloping countries and on the interests of the donors; itmust above all be anchored firmly in respect for theprinciples of sovereignty and mutual acknowledgment ofthe competence of the national political authorities in theexercise of their functions in office. In the framework of itsrestructuring and in the context of new internationalchallenges  the United Nations is called upon to play aleading role in international cooperation on the basis ofthese new elements.In this regard  the Government of Vanuatu mostwarmly welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative toestablish a special development account for thedeveloping country Members. I also wish to recall theimportance and role of regional and subregional forumsin the process of establishing and strengtheninginternational cooperation. In our part of the world  theSouth Pacific Forum and the Melanesian SpearheadGroup are concrete examples of such cooperation andtheir initiatives deserve the recognition and support of theinternational community.On 24 October 1995  during the commemoration ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of theUnited Nations Charter  the head of the delegation ofVanuatu declared from this rostrum the support of theRepublic of Vanuatu for the reform and rationalmanagement of the United Nations system. Today  Ireaffirm the support of my Government and congratulateSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the courage anddetermination that he has demonstrated in drafting andimplementing this crucial reform. I fully share theSecretary-General’s point of view when he emphasizes inhis report that “Reform is not an event; it is a process”(A/51/950  para. 25).It is well known that  throughout today’s world reform is also the sine qua non for a State’s sustainableeconomic and ecological growth and development.Indeed  the global challenges that States must face requirethe constant review and ongoing reform of developmentpolicies and of the institutions of state  in order that thelatter may become instruments and tools adapted to andhoned for the accomplishment of specific tasks  whilecontributing to the vision of development that we have setfor ourselves.Seventeen years after attaining its independence  mycountry  Vanuatu  has made great social and economicstrides. However  the disproportionate challenges facinga small island State such as Vanuatu determined us toinitiate a reform programme early this year. This globalreform programme  as we call it  covers the formal andinformal economic sector as well as the public sector  inthe broad sense of that word. With our reform  we wouldequip our country with the means to meet the majordevelopment challenges of the twenty-first century and toavoid or reduce the effects and risks  natural and16otherwise  that stalk all developing countries and smallisland States in particular.This vision of the future that we have crafted for ourcountry requires the creation of dynamic economicconditions in which the private sector is the majorprotagonist. In most cases  attempts by Governments to actdirectly in the production of goods and services have purelyand simply failed. It also requires the establishment anddevelopment of appropriate institutional machinery fortechnical and financial assistance that will promote thecreation  development and growth of private enterprisewhile placing greater responsibility in the individual.As the General Assembly is aware  it is not enough tocreate conditions for the development of a dynamic privatesector that is a driving force for growth if we seekdevelopment that is economically and ecologicallysustainable and fair. Indeed  in our case  we consider thereform and revitalization of the State as another sine quanon of this sustainable and fair development.Hence  public administration must be made moreeffective and freed from any adverse political interference allowing us thus to reestablish transparency  confidence stability and the security of private investment. Our reformis designed above all to eliminate existing injustices and notto create others  which would represent failure andbacksliding. With our reform  we seek equitabledevelopment that takes into account the development needsof our children and of generations to come. Theredistribution of the benefits of reform and the situation ofwomen  children and other disadvantaged groups must beseriously considered in the implementation of this reform.Guaranteed fairness requires the assignment of thehighest priority to education through the allocation ofavailable resources. Only an up-to-date and high-qualityeducation will equip each individual with the necessaryskills and allow him to satisfy his basic needs and maintainhis dignity.It must be clear to all that the decision of theEconomic and Social Council on 18 July to graduate mycountry  the Republic of Vanuatu  from the list of leastdeveloped countries was a surprise. I take this opportunityto reiterate the position of the Government of Vanuatu  asreflected in the official correspondence between myGovernment and the Secretary-General  the President of theEconomic and Social Council and a certain number offriendly countries Members of the United Nations.While recognizing the sensitive nature of thisquestion  the Government of Vanuatu solemnly calls onthis Assembly to consider putting off the question ofgraduation to the year 2000  when the indicators foridentifying least developed countries will be finalized bythe Committee for Development Planning.My Government recently launched a global reformprogramme and will need the full support of the donorcommunity in order to implement our reform and give ourcountry the infrastructure indispensable to our growth.Similarly  during the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates held in Barbados  it was decided to developindicators for the vulnerability index appropriate to thiscategory of United Nations Member.In this context  we consider the decision of theCommittee for Development Planning to be prematureand in no way reflecting the spirit of that United Nationsresolution. Moreover  with more than 80 per cent of ourpopulation living in the countryside on food-producingsubsistence agriculture; a well-paid expatriate population;and official development assistance equal to the State’sannual budget and representing 20 per cent of our grossdomestic product  we feel that the Committee forDevelopment Planning’s decision can only stem from alack of adequate information.We do not understand why least developed countriesin the same situation as Vanuatu are treated differentlyand demand that we receive exactly the same treatment asany that  like us  meets two of the current identifyingindicators for least developed countries  as laid down inthe Committee’s report.(spoke in English)As recognized by the Rio Conference and the GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States  held in Barbados  the issue ofenvironment and its close association with the concept ofdevelopment has become highly complex and sensitive.The convening of international conferences and theformulation of international treaties such as theFramework Convention on Climate Change are a cleardemonstration of the significance of environmental issuesin our development efforts.Small island countries like Vanuatu and other Pacificisland countries have taken some tough decisions to17introduce restrictive measures internally in support of theinternational call for environment protection. They havealso committed their Governments and nations to theprinciple of instituting a legally binding instrument whichwould guarantee the reduction of greenhouse gas emissionsto an internationally accepted level.To the Pacific island countries  particularly the low-lying nations  a failure to fully address the issue at handand to reach an acceptable solution could put into questionthe commitment of the international community  and couldconstitute a great security risk for our islands and our futuregenerations.The Republic of Vanuatu recognizes the UnitedNations initiatives and engagement in the globalization andliberalization of trade. The building up of the multilateraltrading system since 1995 is a manifestation and reflectionof the United Nations effort and desire to create a globaland uniform trading environment that is conducted andbased on the new rules and obligations provided in theMarrakesh Declaration.My country has embarked on a wider process ofconsultations to seek membership of the World TradeOrganization (WTO). The challenges and opportunitiesoffered by this new regime are considerable  and thereforeweaker economies like ours require time to adjust to theireconomic policies in order to accommodate the prescribedobligations and requirements of the multilateral tradingsystem.In this context  we would like to develop a commonapproach through the United Nations system  as well as theEuropean Union  as our partners  in coming to terms withthe demands and obligations of the newly establishedmultilateral trading system. While all of us  in particularsmall islands and least developed States  recognize the needto come to terms with the World Trade Organization  wecannot and should not allow ourselves to be undulypressured by its demands on these matters where we needto protect our trade preferences and interests.What we perceive to be negative and of less relevanceto us in the World Trade Organization must be changedaccording to our interests. There needs to be scope for allthe small and vulnerable States to be accorded sufficienttime to undertake reforms in trade and investmentcompetitiveness with a view to creating a positive impacton the economy  particularly in their efforts to sourceprivate capital flows and foreign direct investment.Allow me at this point to refer to the future relationsbetween the 71 African  Caribbean and Pacific States(ACP) and the European Union when the current fourthLomé Convention expires in the year 2000. After some25 years  it is important to take stock and reflect on thechallenges  opportunities and weaknesses of theConvention by reviewing the existing framework ofcooperation. From a wider ACP perspective  there isgenerally a stronger desire and willingness to retain andstrengthen the existing framework of cooperation in theareas of political  economic  trade and developmentassistance.I would like to take this opportunity to strongly urgethe international community  through this fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly  to recognize that thereare realities which continue to warrant the need forcontinuity of the partnership between the ACP States andthe European Union beyond the year 2000.In conclusion  allow me to reaffirm myGovernment’s support for the process of reforming ourgreat Organization which was begun by Mr. Kofi Annanin order to enable it to deal successfully with thechallenges of the twenty-first century."
"173",7513,"YEM",52,1997,"﻿It gives me pleasure to extend to Mr. Udovenko ourheartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We areconfident that his experience and wisdom will contribute tothe successful and efficient conduct of the deliberations ofthe Assembly and help us achieve our desired objective.I am also pleased to address our thanks andappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Razali Ismail Permanent Representative of sisterly Malaysia  for themanner in which he conducted the work of the previoussession.I take this opportunity to express my country’sappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hisvaluable efforts in serving the interests of the internationalcommunity  strengthening international peace and securityand striving to attain the noble principles and objectives ofthe United Nations.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to paytribute to his predecessor  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali former Secretary-General of the United Nations  for thepositive and important role he played in carrying out thetasks and responsibilities of the United Nations Secretariat.If we were to define the general trend characterizingthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly  wewould say it is the great attention paid to the Secretary-General’s report on the financial and structural reforms ofthe United Nations and its related agencies. This points tothe fact that the Secretary-General’s reform proposals areof great significance and not just an ordinary matter.Indeed  they aim at preparing the Organization to usher inthe twenty-first century with more vigour andcompetence  thus enabling it to achieve the nobleobjectives of the Charter.The Republic of Yemen  in principle  supports theseproposals. However  we have to underline certain basicconsiderations that should not be forgotten or overlookedunder the rubric of financial and administrative reformsof the Organization. It is first and foremost necessary toemphasize that the purpose of these reforms should be toreinforce the United Nations ability to shoulder itsresponsibilities within the framework of the nobleobjectives for which it was established under the Charter which we all have accepted and pledged to abide by.As a least developed country itself  the Republic ofYemen expresses its concern regarding some indicationsin the report that the United Nations role in the field ofdevelopment may be reduced and its responsibilitieslimited in the field of social justice and the task ofnarrowing the huge gap that separates the developing anddeveloped industrialized countries — all on the pretextthat some of these responsibilities have been shiftedelsewhere.Any move in this direction is bound to encouragecertain dangerous phenomena that we have beenwitnessing of late  including legal and illegal emigrationfrom developing to developed countries  that could sowthe seeds of social  ethnic and cultural conflict. Anydiminishing of the United Nations role in developmentwill lead to an increase in the population of developingcountries  which  in the absence of such basic needs asfood  clothing and shelter  could lead to a furtherdeterioration of the environment.For these reasons  we would like to confirm in thename of the Republic of Yemen that the developmenttasks undertaken by the United Nations and its relatedagencies constitute an integral part of the main objectivebehind its establishment: to achieve international peaceand security on this planet.21With regard to the question of reforming andexpanding the Security Council  which has been undermuch discussion for some time and is referred to in theSecretary-General’s report  we strongly support theexpansion of the representative basis of the Council  eitherby accepting Japan and Germany as new permanentmembers or by increasing the number of permanentmembers through an increase in the representation ofgeographic groups and by allowing each group to rotate itspermanent seat among the countries of that group.We support what has been said about the need toreduce the use of the power of veto by permanent members.Indeed  its use should be limited to matters that directlyaffect the highest national interests. In this way  we canavoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that areirrelevant to such interests  but affect narrow regionalcalculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issuesof international peace and security.It is known to all that our Organization was created in1945 to implement the principles of its Charter  whichstipulates that its main task is to maintain internationalpeace and security  settle international conflicts  protecthuman rights and the dignity of man and respect thecommitments emanating from international conventions andpacts.During the 50-plus years of its life  this Organizationhas witnessed ethnic and national wars and conflicts as wellas rivalries and polarizations that have led to controversiesbecause of what was then known as the cold war betweenthe super-Powers. No one can deny the fact  however  thatthe wars that raged from Latin America in the west to theAfrican continent and even to East Asia have indeedsubsided  thanks to the undeniably worthy efforts of theinternational Organization itself and of efforts made fromoutside the Organization  but mostly under its umbrella.Yet  one important question that threatened peace andsecurity in our region even before the creation of thisinternational Organization still constitutes a looming dangerto international peace and security. It is the question ofPalestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict  with all itscomplexities. The international Organization has failed tosolve this question and has been forced to be a mereonlooker before the various attempts that have been madebut have yet to reach a comprehensive  durable and justpeace.The displacement of millions  the occupation of theirterritories  the establishment of settlements  the confiscationof their properties  the arrest of tens of thousands ofPalestinians and the violation of their most basic humanrights  all of which result from the Arab-Israeli conflict constitute a flagrant breach of all the noble principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter and a challengeto the resolutions of international legitimacy emanatingfrom the Security Council and this Assembly.We believe that it is the right of all people ingeneral  and of every citizen in the Middle East inparticular  to speculate about the secret behind theinability of the international community to tame a Statewhose population is less than half the population of thiscity in which we are meeting to adopt legitimateinternational resolutions.Even more peculiar is that  when a candle of hopeflickered and lit the dark fierce night of the struggle thatstarted early this decade — that is  when the world feltsome optimism following the announcement of the Osloagreement  the signature of the Jordanian-Israeli peaceagreement and the progress achieved in the talks on theSyrian track to a stage described by President Hafez Al-Assad of Syria as at times encompassing fewer points ofdivergence than of convergence — after that slim beamof hope  the new Israeli Government came all of a suddento extinguish it and decided to send the whole regionback to square one: conflict and destruction.On the other side of the spectrum of what is beingcalled today the “new world order”  we are all asked  andwithout exception  to implement the harshest sanctionsagainst the Iraqi people  even seven years after thewithdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Can anyone tellus which lands the Iraqis are still occupying now and whythe Iraqi people should be displaced and deprived of theirmost basic legitimate rights? Is it not high time for thehumanitarian conscience of some of us  particularly thepermanent member States  to be awakened and for an endto be put to the sufferings of the Iraqi people?In accordance with its positive stand in support ofthe peace process in the Middle East  which is in linewith the position of the Arab Summit Conference held inCairo in June 1996  the Republic of Yemen reiterates itscommitment to seeing the process for a just andcomprehensive peace completed as stipulated by theMadrid Conference  in the resolutions of internationallegitimacy — particularly Security Council resolutions242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) — and insubsequent relevant agreements and protocols  and inkeeping with the principle of land for peace.22This principle would ensure the complete Israeliwithdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories; theestablishment by the Palestinian people of its ownindependent State  with East Jerusalem as its capital; thereturn of the Palestinian refugees; the release of prisoners;the dismantling of the settlements built by the Israelioccupation authorities in the occupied territories in defianceof the resolutions of international legitimacy; and fullwithdrawal from occupied Golan and occupied southernLebanon.Furthermore  we affirm that Israel should respect thesovereignty of brotherly Lebanon  should release theLebanese prisoners and detainees in the Israeli camps  andshould compensate Lebanon for all the damages caused bythe Israeli aggressions against its peoples and lands.Since it gained its unity and strove to consolidate thedemocratic direction it has adopted  the Republic of Yemenheld the second parliamentary elections on 27 April thisyear. The elections took place in a free and fair atmosphere as confirmed by national and international observers. Theseelections will have positive effects at all levels — national regional  Arab and international — for they represent a newand advanced turning point in strengthening the democraticdirection that is based on a multi-party political system freedom of the press  respect for human rights  and theinstitutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State.Our people is still waging its most important and mostdifficult struggles to implement the programmes set up bythe newly elected Government and approved by the electedhouse of representatives. These programmes focus onpursuing reform efforts — economically  financially andadministratively — and on continuing cooperation with theInternational Monetary Fund and the International Bank forReconstruction and Development.In this regard  our objectives are to correct theeconomic  financial and structural imbalances; to achievesteadiness and stability in the economy as a whole; toactivate the role of the private sector in the competitivefree-market economy; to achieve sustainable development;to foster stable environments so as to attract foreigninvestments; to upgrade the basic necessary services ofsociety; and to build the new State and improve thestandards of living of all citizens.Following these elections and the formation of a newGovernment  Yemen has persisted in its efforts in theimplementation of the advanced stages of its economic andadministrative reform programmes. These programmes havebeen welcomed by the international financial institutionsand by the Brussels conference of donor countries  whichpledged $1.8 billion in support of the YemeniGovernment’s efforts over the next three years. Ourthanks go to all donor Governments and organizationsthat have manifested their support for and solidarity withthe Yemeni people.The British Prime Minister Henry Palmerston isreported to have said that the foreign policy of a countryis the reflection and expression of its internal policy. Andsince economic and social development constitutes thebackbone of the internal policy of the Republic of Yemen the success or failure of the Yemeni foreign policy couldtherefore be measured by its ability or inability to bringin foreign support in order to realize the main objectiveof its internal policy.This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out itsinternal policy — that is  its economic  social and culturaldevelopment — has to take into account  in seeking thefinancial and technical assistance needed to achieve theobjectives of the internal policy  certain basicconsiderations that might seem to others supplementaryand not mandatory.Allow me to say in this respect that within theparameters of a foreign policy there exists a red line thatshould not be violated when realizing an internalobjective. Most important among these considerations isthe need to safeguard sovereignty and not to becomemortgaged to others when seeking national interests.Foreign support should not be sought at the expense ofthe regional and international commitments of thecountry. Correspondingly  there are also certain basicconsiderations that are unanimously recognized by theinternational community which cannot be ignored oroverlooked  as this would adversely affect the interests ofthat country and damage its relations with theinternational community. Included in those considerationsis the need to abide by international pacts andconventions and to respect human rights.Equally  the fight against terrorism and violence inall their forms and manifestations  regardless of theirorigins or perpetrators and regardless of where they arecommitted  has become a basic consideration that cannotbe overlooked by any country seeking foreign assistanceor even mere acceptance by the international community.23In a similar manner  the relation between aGovernment and its citizens has a direct and strong bearingon its relations with the donor countries that are to provideassistance and support. We need not be too idealistic however  for the requirements of national interest of somedonor countries have been placed above those idealisticprinciples. As a result many countries that have hadextremely bad relations with their peoples have stillmanaged to get a considerable amount of financial aid although this occurred more during the cold war than now.The Republic of Yemen is therefore fully committedto the consolidation of security and stability at both regionaland international levels. This can best be reflected in itsposition regarding its conflict with Eritrea and itsendeavours to solve border problems with its neighbours ina peaceful manner.The Republic of Yemen supports the process of acomprehensive and just peace in the Middle East and theprinciple of land for peace. But  like other Arab countries it categorically rejects the principle of peace for peace.The Republic of Yemen has condemned all forms ofterror  be it terror committed by an individual  by a groupor by a State.These are the foundations and the principles of theforeign policy of the Republic of Yemen.At the internal level  the relation between theGovernment and its citizens is based  as I said before  onconstitutional legitimacy; on equality among all citizens whether male or female; on equality in rights andobligations of men and women alike; on the freedom ofindividuals and groups; on the freedom of association toparties  trade unions and civilian community organizations;on freedom of the press; and on the protection of humanrights.On the basis of its deep understanding of the nobleprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations  theRepublic of Yemen is pursuing a foreign policy that isbased on mutual respect  positive cooperation  commoninterests  rejection of violence in international relations peaceful coexistence  maintenance of security and stability good neighbourliness  and consolidation of the role ofYemen in attending to the needs of our nation and instanding for the causes of righteousness  justice and peacein the world under the wise leadership of His ExcellencyPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh.In this regard we are satisfied with the results of ourefforts to improve our relations and to cooperate with ourbrothers and friends. Here we take pride in having beenable to solve the border problem between our country andthe sisterly Sultanate of Oman  and to reach a finalsolution acceptable to both parties. This can be anexample to be followed by brothers and neighbours insolving border problems.This is what we are trying to do now with ourbrothers and neighbours in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.We hope that we will be able to achieve what we all arelooking for: to serve the interests and aspirations of ourtwo brotherly and neighbourly peoples and to consolidatestability and peace in the region.With the aim of reaching a peaceful solution thatsafeguards legal  historical and geographic rights  theRepublic of Yemen has endeavoured to avoid escalationand to dissipate tension. It has demonstrated a sinceredesire and exerted great efforts both in dealing with theEritrean occupation of the Yemeni Greater Hanish islandin the Red Sea in mid-1995 and all along in thenegotiations between the two countries. We did not rushto use force  but rather have sought to pursue all peacefulways and means. We have opted for dialogue throughofficial mediation and international arbitration in order tosave our neighbouring peoples the scourge of war.While the Republic of Yemen expresses its solidaritywith the brotherly Somali people  the Yemeni leadershiprepresented by His Excellency President Ali AbdullahSaleh has added its efforts to those of the League of ArabStates  the Organization of African Unity and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development(IGADD) to achieve peace in Somalia. Just last August President Saleh received the United Nations envoy toSomalia when he visited to our capital. At that time theRepublic of Yemen expressed its special interest in theSomali question and discussed its efforts to find a suitablesolution to the conflict in Somalia  not only in view of thehistorical and social links between Yemen and Somalia but also in view of the negative effects this crisis couldhave on our countries and the fact that thousands ofSomali refugees have come to Yemen.The Republic of Yemen has affirmed its readiness tocooperate with the United Nations with a view tonormalizing the situation in Somalia and enabling thatcountry to become an active member of the internationalcommunity. Our joint efforts have resulted in noticeableprogress in this respect. Our political leadership has24received a number of Somali leaders and has sought tosolve outstanding differences in Somalia. This is because ofour belief in the need to safeguard the unity and territorialintegrity of Somalia and to achieve justice and equalityamong its citizens.From this rostrum we hereby call upon our Somalibrothers to take the initiative themselves and to demonstratea greater political will and sincere desire to find a peacefulsolution to the conflict and to attain stability so thatSomalis can restore their national institutions andreconstruct their country. In this way it will be possible forSomali refugees to return to their regions and be resettledin their country.We also call upon the international community toincrease its effort and to provide the necessary assistanceand support to rebuild the State institutions within aframework of national consensus that is acceptable to allSomalis.When we met last year Yemen welcomed thememorandum of understanding that was signed betweenIraq and the United Nations in May 1996 to implementSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995) on the oil-for-foodformula  it being the first step to alleviate the sufferings ofthe Iraqi people. Yemen was optimistic that this agreement which was reached after arduous negotiations  would beimplemented without delay. But we find now that theimplementation of that agreement often faces greatdifficulties  which has compounded the agony of the Iraqipeople.The Republic of Yemen  while reaffirming the needfor Iraq to implement all the resolutions of internationallegitimacy and to continue its cooperation with the UnitedNations  finds it necessary and urgent to alleviate thesuffering of the Iraqi people caused by the embargoimposed on that country.This leads me to talk about the air embargo and othermeasures imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya andabout the damages and sufferings inflicted upon thebrotherly Libyan people in consequence of this unfairembargo. We would like to affirm our call for an end tothis embargo in the context of the resolutions of the Leagueof the Arab States  the Organization of African Unity andthe Non-Aligned Movement.Concerning Sudan  my country would like to expressits happiness about and support for the new developmentsand changes regarding the Khartoum peace agreement which should receive the support and backing of theUnited Nations and the international community.We in the Republic of Yemen look with muchadmiration and respect on the way in which democraticelections were held recently in the Islamic Republic ofIran. We congratulate its new President on his election and we applaud its Government for the approach it hasadopted towards the region. However  we call upon ourbrothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in the UnitedArab Emirates to continue their direct dialogue in orderto reach a final and peaceful solution to the question ofthe three islands  in accordance with the United NationsCharter  the principles of international law and theprinciple of good-neighbourliness.The maintenance of international peace and security the achievement of sustainable development and respectfor human rights depend  first and foremost  on thepolitical will of the Member States of this Organization.Yet the selectivity used by the powerful Members of theOrganization in dealing with others will strip the newworld order  whose characteristics are not yetascertainable  of its humanity and the justice to which weall aspire. Therefore this rostrum and this Organizationrepresent the real safety valve for the security and safetyof all mankind."
"174",7579,"ZAF",52,1997,"﻿South Africa welcomes yourelection  Sir  as the President of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session. We congratulate you havingexperienced at first hand your skills and role as Vice-Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid. Wealso express our appreciation to Ambassador Razali Ismailfor his tireless work as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-first session.May I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan on his election as the seventh Secretary-General ofthe United Nations. The zeal that the Secretary-Generalhas displayed in addressing  through his reform proposals the difficulties confronting this Organization isimpressive. The Secretary-General’s reform programmeis one that in many respects complements theintergovernmental process regarding the revitalization ofthe Organization.The General Assembly is well aware of the need toreform the United Nations. The process of reform shouldproduce a revitalized Organization capable of addressinghumanity’s vital issues of peace and security. Central tothe process of modernization of the United Nations is therestructuring of the Security Council to redress existingimbalances and transform it into a transparent organaccountable to the broader membership of theOrganization.South Africa fully supports the Non-AlignedMovement’s position that there should be no partial orselective expansion in the membership of the SecurityCouncil to the detriment of developing countries.The reaffirmation at the Organization of AfricanUnity’s Harare Summit of Africa’s claim to twopermanent and five non-permanent seats  with the samepowers and prerogatives enjoyed by the current permanentmembers in an expanded Security Council  is consistentwith the Charter principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation. If the Security Council is to fulfil the roleof custodian of international peace and security envisagedfor it in the Charter  it must be perceived to be fullylegitimate by States and peoples.South Africa is therefore of the view that a limitedexpansion of only five or six new Security Council seatswill not fulfil the crucial requirement of transforming theSecurity Council into a representative organ.Central to the Security Council reform process is thequestion of the veto  which has been a focal point in ourdeliberations for the last three and a half years. Indeed the democratization of the Council hinges on the vetobeing either eliminated or extended to the new permanentmembers. Accordingly  the issue of the status of the vetomust of necessity form an integral part of acomprehensive reform package. Permanent membershipwithout the veto represents merely a symbolic gesture tonew permanent members which would serve to perpetuate13an unjust and discriminatory practice and accord them aninferior status.I wish to recall that last year in the General Assembly I registered South Africa’s disappointment with the slowpace of the debate relating to the reform of the SecurityCouncil. The time has come for us all to display thenecessary political will and determination in order to reachagreement on a comprehensive set of measures which willlead to the creation of a Security Council which istransparent  democratic  accountable and thus credible andlegitimate.The fifty-first session of the General Assembly alsowitnessed the conclusion of the work of the Open-endedHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of theUnited Nations System. Its notable recommendationsregarding the strengthening of the role and functions of theGeneral Assembly attest to the importance which we asMember States attach to this body as the supreme politicalorgan of the Organization.It is  however  disappointing that on the issue relatingto the election of a Secretary-General  the Working Groupwas unable to reach consensus on the recommendation tothe permanent members of the Security Council to refrainfrom using the veto to block the outcome of the election.As a result of Africa’s painful past experiences undercolonial domination  as well as the abhorrent system ofapartheid  my Government is committed to the finaleradication of colonialism and fully supports the effectiveimplementation of the Plan of Action for the InternationalDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We believe therefore  that the Committee of 24 should continue itswork in order to determine the interests of the peoples ofNon-Self-Governing Territories regarding their futurepolitical status. We call on the administering Powers to lendtheir full cooperation to the Committee.South Africa is concerned that intra-State conflicts inAfrica continue to pose a threat to the continent’s stability.These conflicts lead to loss of life and economic hardshipsand are a major stumbling block on the road towards peaceand development. It is a matter of concern that conflicts inAfrica persist despite the commendable efforts of theOrganization of African Unity and of African leaders inconflict resolution.We therefore urge parties to the conflict in theRepublic of the Congo to observe the ceasefire agreementand to make all efforts to ensure that the interim measuresfor the holding of national elections in 1998 are instituted.Similarly  we condemn the coup in Sierra Leone andimplore Member States of the United Nations to supportAfrica’s efforts to restore constitutional order byrefraining from recognizing or giving support in any formto the military Government.South Africa is committed to the promotion of peacein Angola  which we believe will contribute to theconsolidation and extension of stability to the whole ofour region of southern Africa. We are therefore concernedabout the failure of UNITA to fulfil its obligations underthe Lusaka Protocol. In this regard  my Governmentwelcomes the decision of the Security Council to imposethe punitive measures envisaged in its resolution 1127(1997)  as a means of ensuring UNITA’s compliance.South Africa has followed the unfoldingdevelopments in the Middle East with cautious optimism.South Africa  and indeed the international community welcomed the signing of the Oslo accord by the PalestineLiberation Organization and the Israeli Government andapplauded it as representing a positive step towards thefull realization of the long-awaited comprehensive andjust settlement in the region. But the decision of theGovernment of Israel to construct new Jewish settlementsin Jebel Abu Ghneim has given rise to tensions and hasgenerated a crisis situation which has reignited conflict inthe region. We all know that this decision is a flagrantviolation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 andof the relevant resolutions of this body. It is no doubt anattempt to change the legal status of Jerusalem and to pre-empt the final status negotiations.The inalienable right of the Palestinian people toself-determination is a prerequisite for achieving a durableand comprehensive peace. For peace and stability toprevail  the region requires the unconditional withdrawalof Israel from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupiedsince 1967.South Africa welcomes the Secretary-General’s latestinitiatives currently under way to seek a lasting solutionto the question of Cyprus. We urge all parties to makeconcerted efforts in working with the Secretary-Generaland his good offices towards an overall comprehensivesettlement to this question  which has been on the agendaof the United Nations for more than 30 years.South Africa attaches great importance to preventivediplomacy as a means of forestalling the possibility ofconflict. We commend the report of the Special14Committee on Peacekeeping Operations because it providesus with measures aimed at strengthening the role of theUnited Nations in peacekeeping. We also welcome theCommittee’s 1997 report on peacekeeping operations andurge the Committee to address the question of the rapidlydeployable mission headquarters and the furtherdevelopment of United Nations standby arrangements.South Africa believes that progress on disarmamentissues will create a world free of war. The end of the coldwar heralded a period of progress in disarmament and non-proliferation  as was evidenced by the entry into force ofthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the conclusion ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However  there-emergence of maximalist positions in the disarmamentdebate retards global disarmament  as demonstrated by thedisappointing progress made at the Conference onDisarmament this year. Despite the consensual adoption ofa mandate for the negotiation of a fissile-material cut-offtreaty  one of the essential elements for complete nucleardisarmament  little progress has been made. Nevertheless South Africa is encouraged by the large number of Stateswhich have committed themselves to the completeeradication of weapons of mass destruction by joiningvarious non-proliferation and disarmament treaties duringthe past year. Universal adherence to importantdisarmament treaties will pave the way towards a worldfree of weapons of mass destruction.Humanity is faced with the daily threat of harm fromthe use of conventional weapons. High priority should beplaced on strategies and policies intended to prevent theproliferation of conventional weapons and to reduce theirflow to conflict areas. The conclusions reached by theUnited Nations Panel of Governmental Experts on SmallArms lay the foundation for future action by theinternational community.On 18 September 1997  the Oslo DiplomaticConference adopted the Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The Conventionis a clear and total ban on anti-personnel mines andestablishes a compelling new international norm against thisscourge which has for so long afflicted humanity  especiallyinnocent civilians  mostly women and children. SouthAfrica looks forward to the early entry into force of theConvention and appeals to all States to heed the call of theinternational community against these inhumane weapons.South Africa has often expressed grave concern at theinvolvement of its nationals in mercenary activities  becausethese activities inhibit the achievement of peacefulsolutions to internal conflicts and destabilize regions.Consequently  we have drafted legislation to regulate therendering of military assistance by private individuals andcompanies to foreign Governments and agencies.The South African Government puts a high premiumon the promotion and protection of human rights as acornerstone of its foreign policy. As we approach thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and the thirtieth of the International Yearfor Human Rights  we reaffirm our commitment to thepreeminent values of basic human dignity  values forwhich we have fought and for which we must continue tofight. Our peoples deserve no less. In this context  mydelegation supports the recommendation to convene aworld conference on racism and racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance.My Government remains committed to addressinggender inequities. The worst manifestations of theseunequal gender relations are the acts of violencecommitted against women and girls. My Government haspledged itself to preventing and combating this violenceby  among other initiatives  aligning its legislation policies and strategies with international instruments suchas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women.South Africa believes in the strengthening of the roleof the United Nations in the promotion of internationalcooperation for economic and social development. To thisend  we welcome those measures in the Secretary-General’s proposed reform package which seek tostrengthen the capacity of the United Nations and torevitalize its role in the context of development.The adoption of the Agenda for Development by theGeneral Assembly was a milestone in our collectivesearch for a meaningful global partnership fordevelopment. That the membership could reach agreementon so complex a matter is testimony to the seriousnesswith which States view the issue  and to the dynamics ofconsensus-building in fostering a global partnership.Member States should act to implement the Agenda forDevelopment in a coordinated manner  by creatingdynamic structures susceptible of successful delivery.South Africa remains committed to an action-orientated Agenda for Development which gives priorityto international cooperation for development. Partnerships15for development  as envisaged also in the MidrandMinisterial Declaration and Partnership for Growth andDevelopment  should be established to ensure effectivedelivery of assistance to the developing world.The problems of abject poverty and social deprivationcontinue to afflict and haunt many countries  particularly inthe developing world. In order to address this scourge which affects least-developed countries in particular effective and consistent measures need to be undertakenwithin the context of the United Nations Decade for theEradication of Poverty.The issue of external indebtedness continues tofrustrate the ability of the least-developed countries topromote economic and social development. It is thereforeincumbent upon the international community to address andfind a solution to this problem as a matter of urgency.One year after the conclusion of the mid-term reviewof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s  we need to take stock and reviewprogress to see if the requisite resource mobilization levelsare anywhere near being met and whether the centraldevelopment goals are in place. As with the mid-termreview of the New Agenda  this would enable theinternational community to take urgent and practical actionon behalf of the African continent to eradicate poverty andunderdevelopment.We in southern Africa  as a region whose potential fordevelopment was hamstrung by the repressive policies ofapartheid  cannot but seek the promotion of our peoplethrough cooperation. It follows therefore that we should becommitted to the transformation of our Southern AfricanDevelopment Community into an institution which providesa framework for the promotion of the imperatives ofreconstruction and development. This would enhance thedegree to which  individually and collectively  the regionoffers a basis to ensure a better life for all our peoples.The global partnership for sustainable developmentwill be enhanced through the transfer of essential andenvironmentally sound technologies to developing States onpreferential and concessional terms. The financial resourcesand mechanisms necessary for the implementation ofAgenda 21 are still inadequate. Developed countries shouldhonour their commitment to raise official developmentassistance flows to the United Nations target of 0.7 per centof gross domestic product. Those few countries which haveachieved this objective are commended.We encourage the promotion and sustainablemanagement of the global environment to ensure a higherquality of life for all. The objective of sustainabledevelopment should be the integration of environmental economic and social policies in order to meet basichuman needs and to manage the environment on asustainable basis.The disappointing lack of consensus at the specialsession of the General Assembly on the environment heldin June 1997 leaves considerable follow-up action to beundertaken in order to accelerate the implementation ofAgenda 21. In this respect  the role and importance of theUnited Nations Environment Programme as one of theleading United Nations bodies in the field of theenvironment should be strengthened.We commend the decision to convene a specialsession on drugs to deal effectively with the illicitproduction  sale  demand  trafficking and distribution ofnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The specialsession will offer Member States an opportunity to jointheir efforts to combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking.South Africa strongly favours the early establishmentof a permanent  independent and effective internationalcriminal court. An opportunity now exists to establish thecourt before the turn of the century. We must thereforeredouble our efforts during the forthcoming sessions ofthe Preparatory Committee to ensure that the diplomaticconference in Rome can complete its work successfully.It is imperative that all Member States continue fullyto support the international criminal tribunals for Rwandaand the former Yugoslavia. To this end  my Government in collaboration with the Parliamentarians for GlobalAction  recently hosted an international workshop onsecuring State cooperation and compliance with theInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Its purposewas to review cooperation with the Rwanda Tribunal andencourage the enactment of domestic legislation byMember States  thus ensuring that those accused of actsof genocide are swiftly brought to trial.My Government welcomes efforts to elaborate adraft convention to define terrorism. It is our belief thatacts of terrorism must be clearly distinguished fromnational liberation struggles in pursuit of the right to self-determination by peoples subjected to foreign or colonialdomination.16I should like to take this opportunity to announce tothe Assembly that on 20 August 1997  the South AfricanCabinet approved ratification of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea. South Africa  a countrywith considerable maritime interests  will  for its part continue to play a meaningful and constructive role in thegovernance of the world’s oceans.The continuing financial crisis of the Organization isof great concern to my delegation. We fully support theSecretary-General’s commitment to ending the long andpersistent near-bankruptcy of the Organization. It behovesMember States to discharge their Charter obligation bypaying their contributions in full  on time and withoutconditions.The lofty ideals that brought us together shouldcontinue to serve as an inspiration for us to strengthen theauthority and capacity of the United Nations as we moveinto the next millennium."
"175",7622,"ZMB",52,1997,"﻿I am pleased toconvey the congratulations of the Zambian delegation toHis Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his electionas President of the fifty-second session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. This session is especiallyimportant in that it is meant to give impetus to theongoing negotiations on the future structure of the UnitedNations through the reform process. We are confident that19with his proven diplomatic skills he will steer thedeliberations of this session to a successful conclusion.For his predecessor  Ambassador Razali Ismail ofMalaysia  my delegation has only words of admiration andgratitude for the exemplary work he did during the pastsession of the General Assembly.I wish to express my delegation’s satisfaction with theskilful manner in which the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  has managed the affairs of the Organization sincehis election last year. Zambia is confident that  given histested managerial and diplomatic skills  he will effectivelymanage this Organization as it deals with critical issuesconfronting the international community today.At the fiftieth session  world leaders gathered here tocelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of theUnited Nations. In celebrating the occasion  we took timeto assess the contribution of the United Nations to worldpeace  economic and social development  and theobservance of fundamental human rights  and we reaffirmedour faith in the Organization and agreed to vigorously liveup to the objectives of the Charter by strengthening andrevitalizing the United Nations system.It is against this background that my delegationbelieves that the current session of the General Assemblyshould seize the opportunity to advance the reform processfurther. In this regard  it is Zambia’s conviction that acomprehensive approach to United Nations reform would apart from improving efficiency and effectiveness  ensurethe implementation of the programmes of action of theglobal conferences of the 1990s — from Rio to Cairo;Copenhagen to Beijing and Istanbul — which underscoredthe importance of sustainable development and made it acentral theme and a priority. These conferences provided astarting point for a global effort in advancing sustainabledevelopment  set goals and defined broad plans of actionthat provided the basis on which national and internationalactions could proceed.While we have agreed on the necessity of reformingour Organization  it is important to ask ourselves what wewant to achieve through these reforms. In principle  Zambiawelcomes and has carefully studied the Secretary-General’sproposals and measures on the negotiations for reform ofthe United Nations. My delegation expects that the reformprocess would not only result in a more democratic efficient  effective and financially stable United Nations  butalso have a significant impact on economic and socialdevelopment. Zambia would like to see the developmentmandate of the United Nations given priority andprominence in these reforms.Related to this reform process is the pressing issueof the critical financial situation of the United Nations. Itis our view that this state of affairs is the major limitingfactor undermining the ability of the United Nations todeal adequately with its mandates in many areas. Wewould therefore like to see arrears owed to theOrganization paid in full  on time and withoutpreconditions.One of the key components of the reforms of theUnited Nations is the reform of the Security Council. Wedemand that the expansion of the Security Council makeit more representative and more democratic. Thisexpansion should be at both permanent and non-permanent levels of membership. In this regard  mydelegation wishes to state categorically its support for theposition adopted by the Organization of African Unity(OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement that the expandedSecurity Council should have 26 members.Zambia further supports the demand that the regionsof Africa  Asia  and Latin America and the Caribbeannow deserve seats as permanent members on an expandedSecurity Council. Africa  commanding nearly 30 per centof the membership of the United Nations  certainlydeserves to have two permanent and three non-permanentseats on the Security Council.My delegation reaffirms its commitment to generaland complete disarmament. In this spirit  we would alsolike to welcome the recent agreement reached in Oslo.Norway  to ban anti-personnel landmines. We hope thatall countries of the world will be able to sign theagreement in December this year in Ottawa.International peace and security also continues to bethreatened by conflicts around the globe. Africa  inparticular  has witnessed many civil wars whoseconsequences have been devastating.Zambia continues to be concerned about the conflictsin the Great Lakes region of Central Africa  the Republicof Congo  Sudan and elsewhere on the continent. Wewould like to appeal to the parties to these conflicts tocommit themselves to the principle of negotiated andpeaceful settlement of disputes. We call upon theinternational community to provide all necessaryassistance for resolving these conflicts at an early stage.20In Angola  the civil war has caused some of the worsthuman suffering. As host to the talks that led to the signingof the Lusaka Protocol  Zambia has a firm desire to ensurethat there is lasting peace and security in Angola. However Zambia is disappointed at the failure of the União Nacionalpara a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to complywith its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and theprovisions of relevant Security Council resolutions. Zambiawould like to record its displeasure at UNITA’sintransigence.Zambia  together with the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) and other countries  willcontinue its efforts to promote conditions leading to theestablishment of lasting peace and security in Angola. Webelieve that peace in Angola will enlarge the parameters ofpeace in southern Africa  which will enable the countries ofthe region to concentrate their efforts on social andeconomic development in an environment of democracy.Zambia reaffirms the position of the OAU with regardto the situation in Sierra Leone. In this regard  we appealto the international community to continue to denyrecognition to the military junta in Sierra Leone. Wedemand that the junta hand power back to thedemocratically elected Government of Sierra Leone.The Democratic Republic of the Congo has justemerged from a seven-month civil war. We are delightedthat the country has now begun to turn its attention to thechallenges of reconstruction and development. We thusappeal to the international community to unconditionallyassist the new administration in that country in facilitatingrehabilitation of infrastructure and capacity-building toconsolidate the political and economic stability of thecountry.We congratulate the people of Liberia on findingpeace through the democratic process and also take thisopportunity to pay tribute to the Economic Community ofWest African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for thecommendable role it has played in resolving the Liberianconflict.Regarding peacekeeping in Africa  we believe thatAfrica has the primary responsibility for resolving theconflicts on our continent. It is precisely for this reason thatthe Organization of African Unity established theMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution  which we hope the international communitywill fully support.On the economic front  Zambia is gratified to notethat sub-Saharan Africa has begun to record positivegrowth rates  which averaged 5 per cent in 1996  thehighest level in 20 years. Much of this success isattributable to the social and economic reformsundertaken by many African countries. However  thispositive achievement can be sustained only if poverty deprivation and marginalization are effectively addressed.Another factor that continues to constrain efforts forsustainable development in many African countries including my own  is the heavy external debt burden.Zambia welcomes the steps taken by the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank to implement theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. We are however  gravely concerned about the uncertaintiessurrounding the funding for the Initiative. We also remainconcerned about the proliferation of conditions  inparticular the use of non-economic factors in determiningaccess to the Initiative.Zambia believes that the United Nations has a dutyto provide leadership in forging international consensuson the crippling external debt problem of developingcountries and assisting in the mobilization of newresources for development financing. It is also ourexpectation that the United Nations will provideleadership in redressing the widening developmentdisparities existing among nations  and addressing theincreasing trends towards unfair trading practices andprotectionism in international trade  which have had theeffect of marginalizing some regions  notably Africa.Zambia is very concerned about the continueddecline in official development assistance at a time whenthe United Nations is dealing with follow-up to recentinternational conferences on development. There is alsoincreasing evidence of lack of enthusiasm for honouringagreements freely entered into at internationalconferences. A case in point is the failure byGovernments to implement the agreements  commitmentsand recommendations made at the 1992 United NationsConference on Environment and Development.The special session of the General Assembly heldthis past June to review progress in implementation of theRio agreements found that the rate of implementation ofthe programme of action has been extremely slow  mainlydue to lack of resources. It was also evident that therewas a marked lack of political will to ensure thefulfilment of the agreements of the Rio consensus onenvironment and development. Zambia would therefore21like to see  during this session of the General Assembly progress on the proposal to convene an internationalconference on the financing of development. As we all areaware  there has been little progress on this proposal sincethe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  when itemerged.On the domestic front  we in Zambia have adoptednational programmes of action in pursuit of the goals andobjectives of the Copenhagen World Summit on SocialDevelopment  the Cairo Conference on Population andDevelopment and the Beijing Declaration. In implementingthese programmes of action  my Government has targetedthe most vulnerable members of our society to enhance thecapacity of their involvement in the country’s economic andsocial life  with a view to raising their standards of living.In this regard  the Government has taken steps to ensurethat there is equitable access to quality education by allZambians by providing universal basic education within theshortest realistic time-frame. A comprehensive programmeof health reforms is also under way  and this should alsoresult in the improvement of the health status of our people.The measures and programmes that the Government hasundertaken are not  however  sufficient to fully attain theobjectives of these programmes of action  mainly due tolimited financial resources.We wish to conclude by underscoring the continuingrelevance of the United Nations. The case for reform hasbeen made. We owe it to ourselves and to futuregenerations to ensure that we apply ourselves to the task ofreform  knowing well that the world needs a United Nationsthat can be relied upon to act effectively in ensuring peaceand security  and in achieving international cooperation inthe economic  social  cultural and humanitarian fields  asenvisaged in the Charter of the United Nations."
"176",7657,"ZWE",52,1997,"﻿On behalf of the States membersof the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  of which I amthe current Chairman  and of my country  Zimbabwe  Iextend our warmest congratulations to you  Mr. Udovenko on your unanimous election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session. Your electionto that high office is a fitting and eloquent tribute to yourpersonal diplomatic qualities and to the valuable role thatyour country  Ukraine  is playing in international affairs.We are confident that  under your wise stewardship  thedeliberations of this session will achieve significant results.We commend Ambassador Razali  the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session  for havingbrought his experience and wisdom to bear upon thevarious special sessions and working groups of theGeneral Assembly that he presided over during the pastyear  particularly in the area of United Nations reform.May I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his vision and for his exemplaryleadership of the United Nations. I wish to commend himparticularly for his tireless efforts to assist Member Statesin transforming the United Nations into a more dynamic relevant and effective instrument for meeting thechallenges that confront us as we approach the end of thismillennium.Africa has consistently underlined the need forreform of the United Nations and other multilateralbodies  to promote the democratization and effectivenessof the international decision-making process. Indeed  wehave maintained that such international bodies shouldtruly serve the collective interests of the peoples of theworld. It is in this context that we welcome the Secretary-General’s bold package of proposals  contained in thereport entitled “Renewing the United Nations: aProgramme for Reform” (A/51/950)  which has beenpresented to the Assembly. These proposals merit ourserious consideration. We have taken note of thoseproposals that the Secretary-General has implemented orintends to implement  as they fall within the purview ofhis powers as chief administrator of the Organization. Wehave also taken note of the proposals that he is placingbefore Member States for their consideration.We stand ready to work closely with the Secretary-General and other delegations to ensure that the reformprocess is speeded up on the basis of consensus anddemocratic participation. What is crucial to us is thatreforms go to the heart of the matter — namely  theremoval of anachronistic and undemocratic arrangementsintroduced over 50 years ago.The reform and expansion of the United NationsSecurity Council is not only desirable but also imperativeif the Council is to ensure the successful implementation ofits global mandate to maintain international peace andsecurity on behalf of all States. The fact that majorgeographical and political groupings representing theoverwhelming majority of the peoples of the world remainunder-represented and without permanent seats on theSecurity Council is the greatest anomaly of our times.Equally anomalous is a situation in which in thisenlightened age the wishes of the overwhelming majority inthe General Assembly will continue to be subjected to thewhims and dictates of the privileged few by virtue of theirwielding the power of the veto.Why should a small minority of States continue towield so much power over the destiny of the majoritywithout the latter’s consent? Why  indeed  are therefrequent and persistent attempts by few States to undermineand circumvent the most democratic and representativebody of the United Nations — the General Assembly — onmatters of crucial concern to the entire internationalcommunity? What are we to make of this? Are we meantto conclude that democracy and good governance at theinternational level should only be at the pleasure and behestof the mighty and powerful? Surely this state of affairscannot continue  as it makes a mockery of the lofty andhallowed democratic principles we profess to cherish dearlyat the national level.The thirty-third ordinary summit of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU)  held in Harare in June this year underscored the pressing need for democratizing the UnitedNations Security Council and stressed that the processshould take full account of the position of Africa as thelargest continental grouping at the United Nations as far asthe allocation of permanent and non-permanent seats in thereformed Council is concerned. The summit concurred withthe position of the Non-Aligned Movement that use of thepower of the veto should be restricted if it is not abolished.However  for as long as it exists  the new permanentmembers of the Council should be granted the sameprerogatives and powers as the current members.Another area of fundamental importance to Africapertains to the reforms in the economic and social fieldsof the United Nations. Africa is of the view that forreforms in this sphere to be meaningful and credible theyshould seek to reinforce the pivotal role of the UnitedNations in development and  conversely  the centrality ofdevelopment to the United Nations agenda. We firmlybelieve in the role of free enterprise as the motive forcein economic development. But any attempts to re-fashionan exclusively political mandate for the United Nationswill marginalize its role in development  while giving freeplay to blind market forces and finance capital. This isclearly contrary to the Charter of the United Nations andshould be resisted.The United Nations needs adequate financialresources if it is to continue to fulfil its mandateeffectively  particularly in the light of the ever-expandingburden of responsibilities that it has to shoulder. It istherefore imperative for Member States to ensure thatthey pay their dues and pay them in a timely fashion.Unilateral actions to adjust the Organization’s scale ofassessment or to withhold funds from certain UnitedNations programmes undermine the very foundation ofthe Organization and therefore should not be condoned.In the area of disarmament  we welcome theadoption at the recently concluded Oslo Conference of thedraft treaty on the global ban on anti-personnel mines.The overwhelming support that the treaty received iseloquent testimony to the determination of theinternational community to rid itself of these deadlyweapons  which have killed or maimed millions ofinnocent people the world over. Africa  which has one ofthe largest concentrations of anti-personnel mines andperhaps the highest number of victims of these weapons is happy to join this international consensus. It is ourhope that those who remain outside the Ottawa processwill reconsider their position and decide to sign the treatywhen it is opened for signature in December of this year.The past few years have witnessed the Africancontinent undergoing a dual process of economic andpolitical reforms. These reforms have in many countriesresulted in greater democratization  as well as in highereconomic growth rates. In the political sphere  democracyand good governance have taken root on our continent. Inthe past few years  we have witnessed the end of thedictatorships and military governments in many parts ofAfrica  and their replacement by governments committedto the political empowerment of their people. In theeconomic sphere  economic structural adjustment2programmes not only have stimulated high growth rates ofbetween 5 and 10 per cent per annum  but have also createdan environment that is increasingly receptive to foreigndirect investment and greater participation of the privatesector in our economies. Most countries have also enteredinto multilateral and bilateral investment treaties with bothdeveloped and developing countries.At the subregional and continental levels  Africa hastaken unprecedented steps to assume greater control of itsfuture through economic integration. The historic conveningin Harare in June this year of the inaugural session of theAssembly of Heads of Government of the AfricanEconomic Community was an important landmark inAfrica’s efforts to build a stable and prosperous future forits people. The session resolved to strengthen the AfricanEconomic Community through the conclusion of protocolswith subregional organizations  such as the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(COMESA)  among others  which are essential buildingblocks for a viable economic community at a continentallevel.For these efforts to succeed  however  it is vital thatAfrica receive the prerequisite support and cooperation ofits development partners and  indeed  that of theinternational community at large. We should neverunderestimate the enormous obstacles that the Africaneconomies are confronted with. Africa’s external debtproblem and the heavy burden of debt repayments continueto drain many of our economies of the much-needed capitalfor development. More resources in the form of debtrepayments than those coming in the form of aid areleaving the continent. There is a need  therefore  forinternational financial institutions to adopt a unified andcoordinated approach to Africa’s debt problem that willhelp to redress the situation. There can be no better timethan now for the international community to augment ourown efforts to bring the much-awaited peace dividend toour people.Foreign direct investment to Africa should continue tobe augmented by official development assistance. Thesteady fall of this assistance from 0.34 per cent in 1992 to0.25 per cent in 1996 is therefore a matter of seriousconcern to us. We commend those countries which havesurpassed the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of grossdomestic product to official development assistance andurge others to do likewise. We welcome new initiatives onAfrica that have recently been announced in the area oftrade  investment and infrastructure development. Theseare  indeed  a result of the recognition that Africa risksbeing marginalized unless innovative ways are found tosupport its development efforts.Africa in terms of conflict situations still suffersfrom a number of setbacks. The situation in Sierra Leone where a military junta overthrew the democraticallyelected Government of that country in May this year  isa matter of serious concern to us. The Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  meeting in Harare for its thirty-third summit  unequivocally condemned the coup andcalled for the immediate and unconditional restoration ofthe constitutional Government of Sierra Leone. Africa’smessage is loud and clear. The days of militarydictatorships are over. Africa cannot and will not givelegitimacy to regimes that willy-nilly flout the rule of lawand the popular aspirations of their people. We appeal tothe international community not to give solace to thesemilitary juntas in the name of humanitarian aid  but tostand solidly with Africa in denying them recognition.Of equal concern to Africa are the crises in theRepublic of Congo (Brazzaville)  Somalia  the Sudan Western Sahara  Burundi and the Comoros. In this respectwe take note of  and reaffirm our support for  the UnitedNations initiative through the Secretary-General’s envoy Mr. James Baker  which seeks to find a lasting solutionto the problem of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.The OAU is working tirelessly through theMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution in search of African solutions to these Africanproblems. We call on the United Nations and theinternational community at large to support Africa’sinitiatives to resolve these conflicts and to strengthen theOAU’s capacity for preventive diplomacy and conflictresolution.We are encouraged by the continued engagement ofthe United Nations in Angola and welcome the adoptionby the Security Council last month of resolution 1127(1997)  calling on the União Nacional para aIndependência Total de Angola (UNITA) to abide by theLusaka Protocol. Africa and the entire internationalcommunity welcomed the successful holding of electionsin Liberia  and we congratulate the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) on the important roleit played in helping to bring that conflict to an end.We salute the people of the Democratic Republic ofCongo on the positive developments that have taken place3in their country and welcome the commitment of theirGovernment to restore and uphold democracy anddemocratic principles. Obviously  after so many decades ofdictatorship and plunder  the task of rehabilitation andreconstruction in that country is not going to be an easyone. The people of the Democratic Republic of Congo needour support in their endeavours to restore peace andstability in their country.Indeed  basic necessities such as food and shelter together with peace  security and stability  are the foremosthuman rights that the people of the Democratic Republic ofCongo ask of the international community in this  their hourof greatest need. While inquiry into alleged massacres inthe Congo may be important  the lofty principles of peace democracy and good governance which we all cherish sodearly  will be realized in that country only if immediatesupport is provided by the international community.In respect of the dispute between the Libyan ArabJamahiriya and both the United States and Britainconcerning the Lockerbie issue  the OAU summit expressedthe hope that the Security Council would consider ways andmeans to ensure a rapid resolution of this dispute.The peace process in the Middle East is in seriousjeopardy as a result of Israel’s refusal to freeze the buildingof settlements in the occupied territories. There is a realrisk of reversal of important gains that have been achievedso far in that part of the world. We call on the parties tothe peace process to show good faith and give peace achance.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate that we believe theUnited Nations reform process has reached a crucial stage.We have always believed that the United Nations  as aliving organism  needs to respond to its changingenvironment. It is our sincere hope  therefore  that we canmake progress expeditiously. We in Africa aspire  in thesereforms  for a United Nations which upholds universalvalues and interests  attends to the urgent needs of the least-developed regions of the world  and remains at the serviceof humanity."
