"1",24,"AFG",49,1994,"It gives me greatpleasure to convey on behalf of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan our warm felicitations to Mr. Amara Essy onhis unanimous election to the high office of President ofthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. TheAfghan delegation assures him of its full cooperationduring his term of office.23I cannot fail to express the gratitude of the Afghandelegation for the effective leadership shown byAmbassador Samuel Insanally  the President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session  in guiding theproceedings of that session.His Excellency Professor Burhannudin Rabbani President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan  has instructedme to convey to the Assembly a message he has addressedto it. I am privileged to read out that message now:""Your Excellencies  Heads of State andGovernment participating in the forty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly ""His Excellency the Secretary-General ""His Excellency the President of the GeneralAssembly ""I convey my best wishes for the prosperity welfare and progress of your nations  and wish theUnited Nations and the current General Assemblysession ever more success in furthering the cause ofpeace and social justice.""I had desired to personally attend the currentGeneral Assembly session and avail myself of theopportunity to meet and extend to you  and throughyou to your Governments and peoples  the message ofthe Islamic State and the Afghan nation. However important State engagements  particularly someongoing developments concerning the consolidation ofthe political process in my country  prevented mefrom doing so. Therefore  I have asked the Chairmanof the Afghan delegation to convey this brief messageto the General Assembly.""This message raises the cry of a nation which with its unprecedented sacrifices  has played itshistoric role for the cause of world peace and stabilityand for the collapse of the hegemonistic andexpansionist system of the former Soviet Union  aswell as for the defence of freedom  social justice anddemocratic values. A nation which suffered morethan 1.5 million sacrifices and immeasurabledestruction in all spheres of its life has contributed tothe ending of the cold war and to a considerablediminution of the threat of nuclear confrontation. Itwas the ending of global polarization that enabled Eastand West to attain positive understandings thatproduced assurances and trust leading to theestablishment of extensive cooperation and therecognition of democracy as an accepted value andconcept  irrespective of any bloc interest.""We are mindful of the fact that our friends areequally grieved as a result of the prevailingsufferings imposed upon our innocent nation. Weappreciate their readiness to endeavour to find anend to those destructive events.""I would like to make it known that as far asthe Islamic State is concerned  we have proved oursincerity and our dedication to a peaceful settlementof the present problems. To allow the politicalprocess to consolidate  I have announced myreadiness to transfer power to a responsible andlegitimate authority. I have even declared that Iwould not be a candidate during the transitionalperiod.""It is the warmonger elements who have takenadvantage of our flexibility and conciliatorygestures  including our unilateral cease-firedeclarations  to strengthen their political and militarypositions and please their outside supporters withmoves towards the realization of their heinousdesigns. These are elements whose merciless rocketattacks on innocent civilian targets and the continuedviolation of international humanitarian law arematters of everyday life.""The Afghan nation is astonished to continue tosee a lack of adequate enthusiasm on the part of theworld community to act effectively towards therealization of the following legitimate aspirations:""First  an extensive collective endeavour to providerealistic and effective assistance to accelerate theongoing political process inside the country;""Secondly  an immediate start of practical assistancefor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-tornAfghanistan  as well as mine clearance  to facilitateand speed up the repatriation of Afghan refugees;""Thirdly  effective international measures to stopforeign interference  particularly in the form of thesupply of weapons and ammunition to those whocontinue to cause immeasurable loss of life anddestruction of property.24""Finding a solution to the existing problems ofAfghanistan necessitates the taking of realistic andcourageous action by the world community  the UnitedNations and  in particular  the United Nations SecurityCouncil.""We are confident that clear and decisive actionin continuation of the support extended to us duringour 14 years of struggle would enable the Afghannation once again to live in peace  equality andbrotherhood  free from any form of racial  ethnic linguistic and religious prejudice. It is in such anatmosphere of peace and tranquillity that Afghanistancould play its positive and effective role in theconsolidation of regional peace and stability as apositive element  defending democracy and socialjustice.""As history recounts  a disturbed Afghanistan hasalways been a source of regional instability  just as itsstability has had a positive impact on the tranquillityof the region.""It is expected that those concerned with peace inAfghanistan  especially our fraternal neighbouringcountries  will be supportive of the ongoing politicalprocess in our homeland.""The tenets of Islam guide us towards honesty justice and mutual respect among members of thehuman community  irrespective of any form ofprejudice. Islam calls upon all Islamic nations toserve the cause of the peace and security of mankind.""The United Nations  as a source of hope formany suffering nations around the world  can play adecisive role in the return of peace to our shatteredand war-stricken country.""We are appreciative of the personal efforts ofHis Excellency the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and the special mission under the leadershipof His Excellency Mahmoud Mestiri. We also valuethe efforts of His Excellency Mr. Hamid Algabid Secretary-General of the Organization of the IslamicConference  for his continuous search to put an end tothe conflict in Afghanistan. We wish them everysuccess in coordinating their efforts with our nationalendeavours based upon realistic approaches.""Let us hope that our future generations willrecall the efforts of our friends and those interested ina stable and peaceful Afghanistan as the continuationof our just struggle for the cause of peace.""Wishing the current session of the GeneralAssembly every success ""Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani ""President of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan.""Let me begin my own statement by referring to themiseries being inflicted upon our people and country andby letting members of the Assembly know about somerecent political developments in Afghanistan.Since the last session of the General Assembly threemain political developments have taken place in ournational efforts aimed at further consolidation of thepolitical process and in the international action in favourof peace and stability in Afghanistan:First  the completion of the first two rounds and thebeginning of a third round of peace efforts by the UnitedNations special mission to Afghanistan;Secondly  consideration of the situation in ourcountry by the Security Council;Thirdly  major developments in the political process highlighted by the convening in August 1994 of aSupreme Islamic Council in Herat and by its significantresolutions.Following the first round of its visit to Afghanistanthe special mission submitted its report (A/49/208) to theSecretary-General. Before making some comments onthat report  I wish first to express the gratitude of theIslamic State of Afghanistan to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his personal concern andthe attention he continues to pay to Afghanistan. Weassure him of our continued cooperation and support. Ishould also like to reaffirm the commitment of theIslamic State to support the special mission and tocooperate with it to enable it to discharge its mandatesuccessfully.Here  I should like to draw the attention of theAssembly to some elements in the report that are ofparticularly importance. Paragraph 13 states that themission found most of the country - at least two thirds ofit - to be at peace. I would also draw attention to the25realistic conclusion of the mission in paragraph 31  whichstates  inter alia  that the""mission believes that reconstruction assistance shouldnot be seen as separate from but integral to a lastingpolitical solution."" (A/49/208  para. 31)Emphasizing the interrelationship between political andeconomic activities to promote peace  the report says:""Political and economic activity are interrelated andinterconnected forces  which must be linked inAfghanistan in ways which encourage peace."" (Ibid.)We appreciate this positive assessment of the mission.In the light of the above conclusions of the UnitedNations mission as well as its recommendations  and basedupon the critical need of the Afghan people for outsideassistance  we believe the notion of peace first andreconstruction assistance second is no longer justifiable orplausible. The beginning of reconstruction assistance inthose parts of the country where peace prevails willcertainly encourage and persuade those who are illegallycarrying arms to abandon their weapons for shovels andbegin rebuilding their agriculture and farms.Since the beginning of the abortive coup of 1 Januaryin Kabul  the United Nations Security Council hasconsidered the situation in Afghanistan on three separateoccasions. This consideration  which was in conformitywith the Afghan nation’s expectations of the SecurityCouncil  was timely and appropriate.In its Presidential Statement dated 23 March 1994 ""The Council stress[ed] the importance that itattaches to full compliance with internationalhumanitarian law in all its aspects and recall[ed] thatthose who violate international humanitarian law bearindividual responsibility."" (S/PRST/1994/12)That Statement was just  positive and realistic.Recently  another Security Council PresidentialStatement  dated 11 August 1994  was issued in referenceto certain developments including the progress report of theUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan and therecommendations therein. This Presidential Statement toocontains some positive  important and realistic elements  inparticular the fourth paragraph  wherein""The Council calls on all States to take thenecessary steps to promote peace in Afghanistan  tostop the flow of weapons to the parties  and to putan end to this destructive conflict.""(S/PRST/1994/43)The Statement also urges the internationalcommunity to assist Afghans in rebuilding their shatteredcountry.The Islamic State of Afghanistan expressed itsappreciation to the Council for addressing an importantaspect which is the core of the problem. However  wenote with astonishment the reluctance on the part of theCouncil to condemn the aggressors  who continue toinflict inhuman atrocities on innocent civilian populationsand continue to violate international humanitarian law.The Islamic State of Afghanistan once again statesthat the present crisis in the country is not a civil war butrather an imposed armed conflict fueled from abroad.The Security Council’s good intentions forAfghanistan can be realized only if the Council addressesthe actual cause of the fighting. It should not limit itselfto the mere issuance of statements  but should considertaking some specific enforcement measures.In this connection  it would be appropriate to referto resolution 48/75 H  adopted at the forty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly on 16 December 1993  onmeasures to curb the illicit transfer and use ofconventional weapons. The Assembly  considering theavailability of massive quantities of conventional weaponsas a contributing factor to armed conflicts around theworld and recognizing the excessive quantity ofconventional weapons in a number of countries as asource of destabilization of their national and regionalsecurity  invited Member States to take appropriateenforcement measures directed at ending the illegal exportof these weapons from their territories.The continued illegal flow of conventional weaponsto Afghanistan represents a violation of the provisions ofresolution 48/75 H by some of our neighbouringcountries. We hope that the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at the current session requested by that resolution  will suggest effective waysand means of stopping the illegal flow of these weaponsand of collecting weapons illegally distributed in thecountry.26Now I should like to turn to the recent major politicaldevelopment which is a source of hope for bringing an endto the crisis in our country:At the beginning  it would not be inappropriate todraw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that thecurrent situation in Afghanistan is a legacy of 14 years ofprotracted war stemming from the invasion unleashed bythe former Soviet Union  as well as of a series ofinterferences in our internal affairs over the last two years.To eliminate the manifestations and effects of such aprotracted war  which aimed at erasing all spiritual historical and cultural values of Afghan society  is notfeasible in a short period of time.Early last month on the initiative of the south and westzone of the country and its leader and general commander General Mohammad Ismail Khan  a Supreme IslamicCouncil convened in the ancient city of Herat  with theparticipation of more than 700 delegates representingdifferent strata of Afghan society  including governors andthe main commanders of various provinces  religiousscholars  tribal leaders  technocrats  intellectuals and otherscholars  as well as 150 representatives of Afghans livingabroad. That important gathering was also attended by therepresentative of the Office of the Secretary-General onAfghanistan and Pakistan as well as by a number ofrepresentatives of friendly countries. At the end  theSupreme Islamic Council adopted an eleven-pointresolution. Due to the important contribution the realizationof the objectives of the said resolution would have in theconsolidation of peace and the political process in thecountry  I should like to take the liberty of shedding lighton some of its most important points.Given the fact that on the basis of Islamic law andinternationally accepted principles  the will of a nation isthe source of national sovereignty  the Supreme IslamicCouncil decided:- To convene a traditional Grand NationalAssembly - Loya Jirgah - by the end of October 1994  inthe capital  Kabul  in order to determine the future politicalleadership of the country; adopt and ratify the futureconstitution; and settle other important national issues yetpending;- To reject and condemn any Government createdagainst the will of the nation and under the patronage ofoutsiders;- Strongly to condemn foreign interference in theinternal affairs of Afghanistan  calling upon theOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the UnitedNations to act resolutely to put an end to that interferenceon the basis of the provisions of their Charters;- To reaffirm the fact that Afghanistan is adistinct and indivisible political entity.The participating members of the Supreme IslamicCouncil in Herat committed themselves to standing firmagainst any rejection of this national accord. The full textof the Herat resolutions can be found in the officialdocument of the Security Council (S/1994/943).It is gratifying to note that based upon thoseresolutions  a preparatory commission for the GrandAssembly convened on 30 August in Kabul and at its firstmeeting unanimously elected Mawlawi Mohammad NabiMuhammadi  the leader of the Herakat-Inqalabi Islamiparty  as its Chairman.Given the fact that the resolutions adopted in Heratmarked a major new stage in the political evolution of ourcountry  with the emphasis on the broad participation ofAfghans  in that national gathering  and taking intoconsideration the effective role that the special mission ofthe United Nations could play in the acceleration of thepeace process  it would be relevant to say a few wordsabout the need to coordinate and merge these two seriesof efforts into components of a unified political process.Guided by its mandate  the United Nations SpecialMission should try to find common ground with a viewto ensuring a compromise approach that would lead tonational rapprochement among Afghans. We are fullyconfident that Ambassador Mestiri will keep this in mindas the core of his mandate. If the Afghans  in keepingwith their traditional way of solving problems  cometogether in a national gathering and adopt resolutionsaimed at preserving the national sovereignty and territorialintegrity and at realizing the right of the people to decidetheir own political future without foreign interference andinvolvement  the United Nations will be left as a neutralparty with a complementary role.As an additional measure  the United Nations SpecialMission could support an initiative that would avoid anyloopholes and would ensure fairness and impartiality inthe proceedings. Otherwise  attempts to create a parallelinitiative will only produce further complication andaggravation of the situation and  consequently 27disappointment for our nation in the peacemaking efforts ofthe United Nations.I should like to make it clear that at no stage in itsexistence has Afghanistan constituted a source of threat toits neighbours. Nor has it allowed any third country to useit for the advancement of that country’s political differenceswith Afghanistan’s neighbours. We shall continue to act inthis manner. Today  we yearn for peace more than foranything else  for only in an atmosphere of peace can westrive for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of ourwar-shattered country and heal the wounds and relieve thepain and suffering resulting from 14 years of war. Wesincerely and seriously expect our neighbours to besupportive of our national efforts to these ends.In principle  the legitimate interests of States should berecognized and respected by their neighbours. However  ifthe expectation of a State  under the pretext of preservingits interests  violates the supreme interest of another State -namely  its national sovereignty and territorial integrity andthe principle that the will of a nation should govern itsdestiny - this expectation becomes illegitimate.Not too long ago the world witnessed the formerSoviet Union  as it pursued its activities in Afghanistan crossing the boundary of legitimate interest. As a result the Afghan nation  without regard for the disparity betweenthe military means of the two sides  stood against one ofthe world’s mightiest military machines. After 10 years ofimposed war and direct confrontation with the Red Army the Afghan nation  with the help of the Almighty and thesacrifice of more than 1.5 million martyrs  proved onceagain that it would never allow foreign interference oraccept dictates - in particular  that it would not permitoutsiders to impose their will on Afghans.There is no longer a foreign army of occupation inAfghanistan  but the legacy of such a presence is stillkilling our people. Land-mines constitute the most toxicpollution facing mankind. Referred to as the hidden killers these do not discriminate between adults and children. Ifthere are 100 million of these deadly devices in 60 war-stricken countries throughout the world  at least one fifth ofthem are in Afghanistan. This cruel threat is a dreadfulimpediment to the return of the refugees.We need a great deal of help from the internationalcommunity if we are to promote and finance land-mineawareness and clearance programmes. We appreciatehighly President Clinton’s very important proposal  voicedhere  concerning the need for international action to clearmines in the war-stricken countries of the world.No international effort in the war against povertyand in support of sustained growth and development willbe effective if account if not taken of the continuingdeterioration in the socio-economic situation of the leastdeveloped countries  identified as such by the UnitedNations system. Among these countries are those thatexperience frequent natural disasters and those ravaged bywar.Specific action to deal with the particular needs andproblems of land-locked developing countries - I refer inparticular to assistance for the land-locked States ofcentral Asia - is an important matter that requiresdiscussion during this session of the General Assembly.Afghanistan  which is itself land-locked  is the country oftransit for many central Asian States. Roads andhighways in Afghanistan are damaged as a result of thelong years of foreign armed aggression. For this reasonwe shall propose that the United Nations system assist ourregion by carrying out a corridor study - a study of thetransit roads in Afghanistan  which is situated in the heartof Asia.Transit and transport agreements between the land-locked States members of the Economic CooperationOrganization  including Afghanistan  and Iran andPakistan need to be concluded or updated to take accountof the new circumstances and the legal and technicaladvice of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment.The Islamic State of Afghanistan stands firm insupport of human rights throughout the world butparticularly in Afghanistan. Much to our regret  armedconflict between various groups has resulted in violationsof human rights - especially of the right to life  which ishumanity’s most fundamental right. To prevent suchoccurrences and to ensure security  the State isdetermined to collect the arms currently in the possessionof certain groups. There has already been noticeableprogress in this area. Most of the armed groups realizethe need to end conflicts and to relinquish heavyarmaments. The completion of this task can be ensuredthrough strengthening of the national armed forces andthe national police force. Significant steps will be takentowards this goal.As for civil  political  economic and cultural rights the Islamic State of Afghanistan  in observance of Islamic28teaching and international responsibilities  acknowledges itsduty to eliminate all discrimination and intolerance  whetherreligious  linguistic or based on gender. Afghanistanrecognizes its Islamic responsibility to ensure the family legal  cultural  social  political and economic rights ofwomen. Apart from obligations of principle and morality a country that lost 15 per cent of its population during thewar cannot be completely successful in the enormous taskof reconstruction without the active participation of itsfemale population. Therefore  it is imperative that propermeasures be taken to secure extensive participation byAfghan women in the process of rebuilding the nation’seconomy  culture and society.In the midst of these conflicts  it is the children whosuffer most. In Afghanistan alone there are almost 1million war orphans. The situation of this precious andmost vulnerable category of the population deservesparticular attention. To this end  the Islamic State ofAfghanistan will submit a proposal for consideration by theAssembly at its current session to establish an internationalfund within the framework of the United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF) to assist the rehabilitation of orphans ofarmed conflicts. It would be worth considering adeclaration of 1996 as the international year of orphans.We welcome the appointment of Graça Machel by theSecretary-General as an expert to carry out the mandate ofthe General Assembly to conduct a study of theconsequences of armed conflicts on children.The Islamic State of Afghanistan  inspired by Islamicinstructions  has no hesitation in taking a firm stand againstterrorism in any shape or form. As we battle violence inour own land  we continue to add our voice to that of theinternational community in condemning terrorism the worldover.At its last session the General Assembly discussed insome detail the plight of disabled people. However  thepractical achievements do not seem to be adequate. Fromthis rostrum I remind the world community again of thestate of the nearly 2 million disabled persons inAfghanistan  victims of a war of aggression. We willsubmit proposals for securing international assistance forthe world’s disabled population in order to alleviate theirsocial  economic and psychological problems.One issue worth mentioning  with both regional andinternational implications  is that of narcotic drugs. Theillicit cultivation  production  stocking  smuggling andtrafficking of narcotic drugs are undeniably criticalproblems facing humanity today. Regrettably  one of thelegacies of the long war in Afghanistan is thetransformation of some parts of our country into stagingareas for illicit drug activities. This phenomenon  whichis partly the result of the unavailability of alternativeproductive economic activities  is a source of greatconcern to us. Afghanistan  despite its scarce resources has taken serious measures in the struggle against illicitdrugs. We will spare no effort to combat these illegalactivities. However  we must not overlook the reality thatAfghanistan  with its extremely limited means andmassive economic and financial needs  is not in a positioneffectively to accomplish this task alone. Afghanistanneeds urgent support from the international community tointensify the struggle against drug cultivation andtrafficking.The ongoing internal conflict in Tajikistan  afraternal neighbour of Afghanistan  is a matter ofcontinued concern to us. We hope that the brotherlyTajik people  who are opening a new chapter in theirhistory after the collapse of the former Soviet Union andtheir emergence as a new and independent nation  willsoon succeed in overcoming their difficulties.One dimension of this internal conflict is theperiodic disturbances occurring on the border betweenAfghanistan and Tajikistan. As a result of the conflictinside Tajikistan  more than 100 000 Tajik refugees havetaken refuge inside Afghanistan. The Islamic State ofAfghanistan  on the basis of deep feelings of Islamicbrotherhood  humanitarian considerations and traditionalAfghan hospitality  provided shelter to those refugees.The influx of the Tajik refugees to Afghanistan isdue to the political circumstances in their own country.Therefore  only a political solution to the problems withwhich they are faced  with the Government of Tajikistan will guarantee their voluntary repatriation to theirhomeland.The dispatch of armed forces of the RussianFederation to Tajikistan  especially on the border betweenAfghanistan and Tajikistan  would in our view furtheraggravate the problem rather than contribute to itssolution.The Islamic State of Afghanistan has committeditself to supporting the peaceful initiative of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy to Tajikistan  AmbassadorPiriz-Ballon. As far as possible we have encouraged the29Tajik refugee leaders  in a spirit of conciliation  to helpUnited Nations efforts to succeed by agreeing to anegotiated settlement. A chief factor in resolving theproblem will be the Tajik Government’s heeding the justand legitimate demands of the Tajik opposition leaders.Afghanistan  in pursuit of its previous commitments is desirous that its border with Tajikistan should be aborder of peace  understanding and friendship. Once againwe would like to declare that periodic clashes on the borderbetween Afghanistan and Tajikistan are a manifestation ofthe internal conflict in Tajikistan  and not a single memberof the Afghan armed forces is  or will be  involved in anyborder clashes.As everyone knows  in Bosnia and Herzegovina theodious and barbaric ""ethnic cleansing"" practised by theSerbs of Bosnia re-emerged a few weeks ago in BanjaLuka  Bijeljina and other areas. The Security Council hasjust demanded - in resolution 941 (1994) of 23 September -that the Bosnian Serb authorities immediately cease theircampaign of ""ethnic cleansing"". This demand of theSecurity Council is bound to be disregarded and denied bythe Bosnian Serb criminals. It is therefore imperative thatthe Security Council should decide to mandate a UnitedNations presence and coercive measures for the protectionof the Bosnian communities threatened by further ""ethniccleansing"". Otherwise  the United Nations and the five-Power Contact Group will lose all credibility.Another dangerous area calls for the immediateattention of the Organization if we want to save the wholeregion from catastrophe. The grave situation in Kosovo aggravated by the daily massive repression committed bythe Serbian authorities against 2 million ethnic Albanians and referred to as a time-bomb  remains explosive. Wealso remind the Assembly of human rights violations inSandjak.It is our view that a special United Nations missionshould assess war damage resulting from the acts of armedaggression committed by the Bosnian Serbs. Theaggressors must know that they will have to pay warreparations to those who are their victims. This will remindaggressors always to think twice before firing anddestroying.On the basis of its common historical ties with thepeople of Jammu and Kashmir  especially commonreligious ties with its Muslim population  the Islamic Stateof Afghanistan is deeply concerned at the exacerbation ofthe situation in that territory. The sufferings of the Muslimpeople of Kashmir add to our grief. We continue tobelieve that the question of Kashmir  which has alwaysbeen one of the prime concerns of the Muslim Umma can find a lasting solution through peaceful means in anatmosphere of trust  understanding and good-neighbourliness between the Islamic Republic of Pakistanand the Republic of India  a solution on the basis of therelevant resolutions of the United Nations andinternationally accepted principles on the settlement ofdisputes.During these crucial moments of the history of thePalestinian people  we reiterate the responsibility of theinternational community to support the inalienablenational rights of the Palestinians  including their right toreturn to their homeland  and the right toself-determination  encompassing the right to their ownindependent State on their national soil  with Al-Qudsal-Sharif as its capital. The peace process has to beaimed at the full implementation of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) guaranteeing thefull withdrawal of occupying forces from all the occupiedPalestinian territories.The Afghan nation  like other Islamic nations considers the occupation of the site of one of the mostsacred shrines of Islam  in Al-Quds  by authorities lackingawareness of its sacred Islamic character  as contempt forthe most basic spiritual rights of the Islamic communityall over the world.In conclusion  I wish to draw the attention of thisworld gathering to the fact that  as a result of heavyrocket attacks on Kabul by the opposition  as well as theirblocking of the roads to Kabul  the capital has beenwithout running water  electricity or heating for most ofthe time since last January. Also  a shortage of foodsupplies seems to be threatening the city’s mostvulnerable inhabitants who are suffering. It has beenpredicted that the coming winter will be a harsh one.As the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) fears  a large-scale human disaster may beimpossible to avert. We request the donor community torespond positively and urgently to the United Nationsappeal for winter emergency assistance to the city ofKabul."
"2",63,"AGO",49,1994,"Please allow meto begin by congratulating Mr. Amara-Essy  on behalf ofthe Government of the Republic of Angola  on my ownbehalf and on behalf of my delegation  on his election tothe presidency of this forty-ninth session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. We are fully convinced that hisdiplomatic experience and dedication to the noble ideals ofour Organization will ensure the success of the Assembly’sproceedings at this session. I wish to assure him of mydelegation’s full cooperation.I should also like to express our appreciation to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally for his proven dedication and skill in conducting theactivities of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.I also wish to express the profound gratitude of thepeople and Government of the Republic of Angola to theSecretary-General for his skill  energy and tenacity  and forall his efforts in the search for solutions to the innumerableand serious problems afflicting the peoples of our planet.The history we are witnessing today clearly shows aflagrant betrayal of many peoples’ expectations of a betterworld following the end of the cold war. We had all hopedfor  and anticipated  life in a better world of peace andprosperity. Instead  we are witnessing the proliferation ofinternal conflicts  with such tragic consequences  and wesee no visible signs of any immediate satisfactory andlasting solutions  despite the efforts of this Organization.With the end of the cold war and ideologicalconfrontation  the African continent has witnessed duringthe past five years a vast expansion of democracy  whichhas contributed to the revival of hope for the prosperity andwell-being of the African peoples  still suffering theeconomic backwardness bequeathed by colonialism.However  Africa continues to be the continent mostaffected by the proliferation of war and political instability.It is sufficient to mention as examples the conflicts inRwanda  Somalia  Liberia  Burundi and my own country.Similar problems are occurring in many other partsof the world  which indicates the need for an immediateintensification of efforts by the international community and in particular for increased participation by the UnitedNations  to find a negotiated  just and acceptable formulato protect the legitimate interests of peoples.The United Nations must define universal guidelinesto prevent the application of differing criteria to thesolution of various conflicts. In other words  in order tomaintain the credibility of our Organization  all crises andconflicts must be given fair and equal treatment. Thisunderlines the urgent need to restructure United Nationsprocedures in order to make the existing mechanisms forthe prevention and management of conflicts compatiblewith the realities of our time.With respect to human rights  the United Nationsshould continue to play an active role in order to preventtheir continuing to be jeopardized. The recentestablishment of the post of High Commissioner forhuman rights by the General Assembly was an importantstep forward in this sense.The Republic of Angola reaffirms that human rightsand fundamental freedoms are universal  and that theirpromotion and protection should be ensured on the basisof equality  impartiality  objectivity and non-selectivity.The human rights issue cannot and should not be used asa political weapon or a pretext for interference in theinternal affairs of States.Angola follows with interest and satisfaction thepositive developments taking place in some regions of theworld  where solutions are being found to conflicts thathad seemed endless. In the Middle East  for example  thedetermination of the Palestinian people and the politicalcourage of the present Government of Israel havecontributed to the climate of reduced tension that led tothe historic agreement  signed in Washington  for theautonomy of Gaza and Jericho - territories illegallyoccupied in the past.We appeal to the international community to makeevery effort to ensure strict compliance with theagreement  and success for it  by providing all possiblehelp to the Palestinian people for the reconstruction andsocio-economic development of the embryonic PalestinianState.42It would not be immoderate to once again hail thecourage and determination demonstrated by PresidentYasser Arafat and by Mr. Shimon Peres.We encourage the Government of Israel to continuethe contacts already initiated with the countries of theregion with a view to achieving peace and harmony in thearea.In southern Africa  we laud the courage anddetermination of the people of South Africa  which led tothe fall of the inhuman and anachronistic apartheid regime.Today we rejoice to see the people of South Africa free atlast. We again greet the new South Africa  led byPresident Mandela  this different South Africa  whichemerged from a democratic election  whose results wereaccepted by all the political forces in the country.We warmly congratulate the new South Africanauthorities and welcome them to our Organization. Wealso pay tribute to the peoples of southern Africa  whomade so many sacrifices before toppling the dreadfulapartheid regime.Angola  which was the main victim of innumerableattacks  suffering enormous loss of human life anddestruction of social and economic infrastructures  becauseof the support we gave to the brotherly people of SouthAfrica  has reason to ask here and now whether theresolutions of this Assembly and of the Security Councilregarding compensation to my country will now beimplemented.In Mozambique  we welcome and encourage theGovernment’s commitment to organize democraticelections  and we urge RENAMO and other political forcesto respond with an equal commitment to the success of theprocess  leading to lasting peace in that country. However the United Nations  in particular  and the internationalcommunity  in general  have an important role to play inensuring the attainment of the main objectives: peace democracy and prosperity.In Liberia  we are encouraged by the positivedevelopments and by the dialogue that is taking placebetween the parties involved. Angola encourages thecontinuation of such dialogue and urges the parties to trulycommit themselves to the search for a lasting peace.With regard to Western Sahara  Angola urges theparties involved to apply the United Nations peace planstrictly and to adhere scrupulously to the mechanismsestablished for that purpose  which have the full supportof the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  and weencourage the parties to enter into direct dialogue tofacilitate progress.In Rwanda  the easing of political and militaryupheavals notwithstanding  a precarious socio-humanitarian situation prevails. Angola expresses itssolidarity with the brotherly people of Rwanda. Weconsider that the international community should continueto play an important role in solving the crisis in Rwandaand in maintaining the peace and tranquillity of itspeoples.In Somalia  in spite of the commitment demonstratedby the international community  we do not foresee an endto the armed conflict in the near future  because of thelack of consensus between the parties involved. Angolaconsiders that our Organization should continue to assumeits responsibility in the maintenance of world peace andsecurity  which are threatened in that part of Africa  andwe appeal to the common sense of the parties tocooperate with the United Nations in the efforts tore-establish peace in that country.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  in spite of the enormousefforts by the international community to restore peace profound differences still remain  and this contributes tothe continuation of the conflict. We therefore urge theparties and the international community to continue theirefforts to find a lasting solution that is acceptable to theparties involved. Finally  we salute the Government ofthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for its efforts to thatend.With regard to the Korean peninsula  Angolaencourages the efforts towards reunification and salutesthe positive signs registered in the dialogue between theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates of America.Angola is following with concern the situation inEast Timor. The international community has witnessedthe serious and persistent violations of human-rights towhich the suffering people of East Timor have beensubjected. Angola considers that there is a fundamentalproblem to be resolved first. Here  I refer todecolonization and to respect for the rights of the peoplesof this territory - mainly  their right to self-determination.We therefore urge the Government of Indonesia torecognize the legitimate right of the people of East Timorto self-determination and independence and to cooperate43with Portugal  as the administering Power  and with theUnited Nations towards fulfilment of the wishes of theMaubere people.The current situation in Cuba  following the tighteningof the economic embargo  should be one of the mainconcerns at this session of the General Assembly  as itsdirect victims are the populations of island.The General Assembly’s adoption of resolutions 47/19and 48/16 clearly demonstrates that the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba iscontrary to the principles of international law and theCharter of the United Nations. For this reason  and inparticular because of the extraterritorial application of thatunilateral measure  Angola condemns it.As we add our voice to those of all who seek an endto the embargo imposed against Cuba we are convinced thatonly through dialogue - never by adopting drastic andinhuman measures such as I have mentioned - can disputesbe resolved. We therefore encourage the continuance ofdialogue between the two countries towards the resolutionof their differences within the framework of the Charter ofthe United Nations.The international strategy for development for theyears 1991-2000  which was adopted in December 1991 brought hope to the international community  which hasregarded the effective implementation of this new strategyas the solution to the socio-economic problems of ourplanet. Today  three years having elapsed  a certainscepticism is shaking our initial convictions.The Republic of Angola considers that the role playedby the international economic institutions - bodies such asthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development the World Trade Organization and the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade - is of vital importance. In the fightagainst trade barriers  these bodies create enormousopportunities for developing countries to participate in thedevelopment of the world market. The heavy and painfulburden of external debt dating back to 1982 leads us tobelieve that the efforts of all are necessary if we are to findmedium- and long-term solutions.Equally  special attention must be given to the issuesof sustainable development. This necessarily impliesimplementation of the objectives of the Rio summit and thehonouring of commitments assumed thereafter by theindustrialized countries.The data included in the reports presented to theCairo Conference on Population and Developmentdemonstrate that the social situation throughout the worldis assuming almost alarming proportions. The fact thatthe world’s population is now 5.5 billion and that themajority of these people live in absolute povertyconvinces us of the urgent need to adopt  during theforthcoming World Summit for Social Development  aconcerted plan of action calling for measures to counterthe increasing deterioration in their social condition. Wetherefore reiterate our firm belief in the legitimacy of thegoals set out in the document entitled ""African CommonPosition on Human and Social Development in Africa"".Having made a few comments on the main problemsthat affect all of us in one way or another  I should liketo make a brief reference to the situation in my country.Representatives will probably recall that  followingUNITA’s rejection of the results of the democraticelections in 1992  which the international communitymonitored and judged to have been free and fair  UNITAresorted to war  with the objective of taking power byforce of arms  contrary to the spirit of the BicesseAccord  of which this Organization is a signatory andwhich served as the basis for the electoral process.The situation created by the resumption of warrapidly degenerated into a real catastrophe  jeopardizingthe country’s territorial integrity and forcing the legitimategovernment to take defensive measures to prevent therealization of UNITA’s intentions.In spite all the efforts of the Angolan Governmentand of the international community  and as a result of thiswar  imposed on the people of Angola by the militaristicwing of Mr. Savimbi’s UNITA  Angola faces a rathersombre future - one dangerously similar to those of thecountries that I have already mentioned.The present situation in my country is characterizedby the extreme poverty of the people  who  having fledthe war zones in order to save their lives  have becomerefugees in their own land.In Angola there are currently 3.75 million displacedpersons  more than 500 000 mutilated people andthousands of orphaned children and abandoned elderlyfolk. In addition  almost of the country’s all economicinfrastructures have been destroyed. In some areascontrolled by the Government  people and goods cannotalways circulate freely  owing to mines and to the acts of44terrorism and banditry perpetrated by UNITA’s militarywing.The difficult situation that I have just described mustcontinue to command the attention of the internationalcommunity if the people and the legitimate Government areto be helped to re-establish peace throughout the country.As those present in this Hall know  on 15 Novemberlast  following the failure of our attempts to establish adialogue  from Namibia to Addis Ababa and Abidjan  theGovernment of Angola initiated the negotiations of Lusaka.These were mediated by the United Nations and wereobserved by Portugal  Russia and the United States ofAmerica  whose endeavour has contributed to the consensusin the negotiators’ position.It is important that we should once again express oursincere gratitude to the Government of His ExcellencyPresident Chiluba for his generosity and patience inreceiving the Angolan people in his country and for hispositive action  albeit discreet and unofficial. We alsoreiterate our appreciation of the important role played bythe troika of observers - Portugal  Russia and the UnitedStates of America - and for the committed way in whichthe Secretary-General’s special representative  Mr. AlliouneBeye  has conducted the negotiations in Lusaka. Mr.Beye’s knowledge of the Angolan situation is our guaranteeof a rapid conclusion to the talks. The people of Angolaand the international community expressed their satisfactionat the fact that UNITA has finally accepted the mediators’package of proposals  for this constitutes an important steptowards peace and national reconciliation.It is none the less true that UNITA accepted thispackage of proposals by the mediators only because ofpressure from the international community and  first andforemost  from the Security Council through its numerousresolutions  in particular resolutions 864 (1993) and932 (1994)  which advocated the imposition of sanctionsagainst UNITA if its leadership did not demonstrate goodfaith about the conclusion of an agreement; and  alsobecause on the military front there had been a clear reversalof the situation. Today the Government already controlsmore than 75 per cent of the territory and 90 per cent ofthe population.We are convinced that if this pressure is maintainedUNITA  which knows only the language of the force ofweapons  might engage in a constructive and honestdialogue. In this context we once again urge theinternational community to continue exercising its variousforms of pressure on UNITA’s militaristic wing so that anagreement is reached in Lusaka to put a definitive end tothe war and to restore peace and harmony among theAngolan people.We are not aiming at a military victory. We wantan agreement that can bring lasting peace and pave theway to national reconciliation. Our insistence on pressureis based on our desire that the relative progress made inLusaka be irreversible  as it is only a step along thedifficult path to peace and its consolidation  to thepromotion of the country’s unity and nationalreconciliation  and to the defence of legality anddemocracy.Therefore  the international community  and theSecurity Council in particular  must be prepared to actimmediately as soon as an agreement is reached inLusaka in order to avoid any pretexts for non-compliance.There must not be a substantial interval between thesigning of the agreement in Lusaka and there-establishment of the cease-fire  on the one hand  andthe beginning of the implementation of the Lusakaagreement  or understandings on the other; this will avoidviolations. In this context it is necessary to anticipate thesending of the component of the United Nations AngolaVerification Mission (UNAVEM III) immediately afterthe signing of the agreement.Please allow me to reiterate before this Assemblythat it is the firm commitment of the Government of theRepublic of Angola not to spare any effort in the searchfor a negotiated solution to the crisis in Angola and thatit is not our intention to destroy UNITA militarily.Contrary to information which has been circulatedrecently accusing the Government of launching a militaryoffensive against UNITA  we have to say that the truth iscompletely different. The Government is engaged instopping the UNITA military offensive  with the aim ofhalting the kind of events that occurred before the signingof the Bicesse Accords  in order to ensure that a militaryadvantage not be obtained while the Lusaka Accord wasbeing signed. We should not enable UNITA to obstructthe full implementation of the Accord. We want UNITAto become a political party  to be prepared to live indemocracy and to respect the existing constitution  whichis the result of a difficult national consensus whichUNITA itself joined in and which it amended before itwas approved by the Parliament.45Finally  we would like to send a strong appeal to theinternational community to increase humanitarian assistanceto the needy people. The Government’s scarce resourcesare insufficient to meet the dramatic socio-humanitariansituation of the people being rescued from the captivity ofUNITA.Members have had the opportunity to see ontelevision the real situation in Kuito and elsewhere. TheGovernment of Angola has always been committed todelivering humanitarian assistance to all the needyregardless of where they may be  and requests thatpressure be exerted on UNITA not to hamper the effortsto distribute relief supplies to the population and the workof non-governmental organizations and United Nationsagencies which with great sacrifice are involved inhumanitarian assistance to Angola.I reiterate our best wishes for the success of thisforty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"3",110,"ALB",49,1994,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Essy on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish him every success in discharging this noble duty.A well-deserved word of appreciation is due to his predecessor  Ambassador Insanally  for the remarkable competence and skill he displayed as President at the last session.We highly esteem the Secretary-General's unreserved commitment  at the head of the world Organization  to make broad reforms in it and to increase its effectiveness in all fields.After the fall of the iron curtain in Europe  Albania joined the family of democratic nations  leaving behind a deep isolation and a totalitarian regime. In two years  thanks to the determination of the democratic Government to carry out profound and urgent reforms  Albania has taken important steps in all fields. State institutions have been transformed  drawing upon the positive experience of developed States. The former secret service was dissolved and the army was placed under civilian control and underwent reform in compliance with the requirements of a demilitarized  profoundly democraticsociety. Today  Albania boasts an independent judiciary and a constitutional court which supervises the constitutional character of the laws passed by Parliament. Currently in Albania  there are more than 30 registered political parties 	hundreds of non-governmentalorganizations  and more than 320 magazines and newspapers  of which 90 per cent are privately owned. At present  Albania's religious communities practice their own beliefs in exemplary harmony and tolerance  according to the centuries-old traditions of my country.By promoting democracy and strengthening the institutions of the rule of law  the democratic Government seeks to guarantee the country's internal social and political stability. However  Albania continues to be the poorest country of the European continent and faces a series of economic difficulties. By firmly pursuing the economic policy of shock therapy  in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the international community  the Government is implementing a series of short- and medium-term programs that have given a great impetus to free individual initiative. In two years' time  agriculture  land  apartments  transport  services  trade and about 2 500 small and medium-sized enterprises have been privatized. From 400 per cent  the inflation rate has dropped to less than 30 per cent a year; the currency is stable and practically convertible; and production is on the rise. In 1993  Albania recorded growth rate of 11 per cent  the highest in Europe. Foreign investments are also increasing.In the coming months we shall move ahead without losing time. The nearest objectives in legislation are the approval of the new penal code  the penal procedure code and the constitution  which will meet most advanced European standards. We will also try to increase cooperation with various international organizations  particularly with the agencies of the United Nations system.Albania attaches special importance to strengthening friendly relations and cooperation with the international community  the European Union  the United States of America  the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other friendly countries in the world. Albania's President Berisha is resolutely devoted to the establishment and strengthening of these ties in order to do away  once and for all  with the bitter consequences of the severe 50-year isolation which our people suffered. We want to have friendly relations  especially with our neighbors  and we are making efforts so that a climate of good understanding and cooperation  based on mutual respect and benefit in the spirit of the basic principles ofthe Helsinki Final Act  will prevail all around us. We have established such relations with Italy and are on the way to their further and all-round development.We would also like to have on a consistent basis the sort of good  tension-free relations we are currently enjoying with Greece  the only country of the Balkans that is a member of the European Union. We regard these relations  not merely as bilateral  but also as closely linked to the prospect of the integration of Albania and the Balkans into Europe. Advances are being made in the relations of good-neighborliness and broad cooperation with Turkey  Bulgaria and Romania  on the basis of a long historical tradition.As regards the new Balkan State  our eastern neighbor  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  we are resolutely committed to building relations of exemplary neighborliness with it and to helping that country overcome its internal and external difficulties. We are convinced that its integrity  its internal stability  its recognition and its membership in all international forums are of vital importance for peace  security and stability in the region. Our indispensable good relations with Macedonia are linked to and conditioned by the presence of an Albanian population that ranks second in size to Macedonians. We think that sound inter-ethnic understanding between Macedonians and Albanians  established on the basis of the due recognition of the Albanians' human and national rights  is indispensable for the domestic stability and prosperity of that Republic and the entire region.We would like to have peace  good-neighborlinesses and fruitful cooperation with Montenegro and Serbia  but these relations will remain frozen and mortgaged to the overall solution of the Yugoslav crisis  especially the political settlement of the Kosovo issue. The Kosovo issue is not merely and solely a question of respect for the human rights of the two million Albanian people and the recognition of a few rights in the areas of education and culture. The question concerns recognition of the political self-governing entity of the Albanians  for which the population of Kosovo has cast its vote in a democratic manner.Belgrade should seriously consider this option. We consider regional cooperation and integration an indispensable condition for our integration into Europe. We have been making continuous efforts to promote understanding with our neighbors. For the further promotion of Albania's democratic and economic changesthere is a need for security and confidence in the Balkans. We hold that the developed countries could contribute with a full strategy and program in order to encourage the radical democratic changes in the entire Balkan space  a kind of Marshall Plan designed to promote peace  democracy and modem civilization there  an economic- political program for the all-round rehabilitation of the region.National and ethnic problems left over from the past  backwardness in terms of economic and social development  and the new problems resulting from the change of systems make it still possible for old political mentalities to dominate the stage of inter-Balkan relations. Those mentalities are opposed to true democratic developments  even in the countries which call themselves ancient democracies.As a Balkan country  Albania is concerned about the war and the crises that have encompassed our peninsula. We are convinced that at the foundation of the present-day Balkan crisis lies the revival of aggressive nationalism  which has unfurled the banner of territorial annexationist claims. The end of the cold war has again brought onto the scene the demons of old Balkan politics which seek a redrawing of the existing borders and the re-dismemberment of some States to the benefit of others. The Milosevic regime's opposition  through a bloody war  to the will of the peoples to break away from the former Yugoslav Federation was the first challenge to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Final Act  while the dismembering of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the first act carried out in the name of creating a hegemony-seeking Greater Serbia at the expense of this former republic of the Federation  a Member of the United Nations and of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).In today's Balkans the nations that consider themselves more powerful and better armed are seeking to extend their territories through force and war in order to expand their power. Expansion and aggressiveness inspire their policies towards their neighbors. National divisions  inter-ethnic hatred or religious diversity are encouraged and artificially provoked  and they are converted into major national and international policy issues in an attempt to disguise historically unfounded territorial claims. At the foundation of what politicians today call ""ethnic conflicts"" in the Balkans lie the aggressive nationalism of a hegemony-seeking nation  racism and xenophobia  genocide and massive ""ethnic cleansing"". That is why we have often insisted that any settlement that would legalize theaccomplished fact of ""ethnic cleansing"" in Bosnia would create a dangerous precedent for new tragedies of this kind  starting in the Balkan region.Today  Serb and Greek nationalism are seriously threatening the Balkans. Such elements consider that the collapse of Communist dictatorships in the Balkans created a vacuum to be exploited to achieve their nationalist ambitions.Hence  Serb nationalism launched an aggression in the north and a war to realize a Greater Serbia by creating a real holocaust at the end of this century against the Bosnian people and by strengthening apartheid in Kosovo.That nationalism is bogged down in grave crimes. In our judgment  only the intransigence of the international community and the refusal to recognize the violation of the principles that all of us have accepted will compel the Serbs in Belgrade  Pale and Knin to give up war as a means of solving problems. The dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the ""ethnic cleansing"" on its territory are unacceptable. We have supported and still support the request of that Republic for the lifting of the arms embargo against it  an embargo which - there is no doubt - has been an encouragement to the aggressor. Similarly  we support the recent Security Council resolutions 941 (1994) and 942 (1994)  which we believe are steps in the right direction for putting an end to hostilities in the region. However  we are opposed to resolution 943 (1994)  which is a concession to the Milosevic regime and makes a settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and the establishment of general peace in the Balkans remote.I would like to recall that the crisis in the former Yugoslavia started in Kosovo and that it persists there  alive and very dangerous. Sanctions against Belgrade should not to be eased but should be further tightened and truly implemented if we want the crisis hotbeds in Bosnia and Herzegovina  in the occupied territories of Croatia  Sandiak and Vojvodina  and especially in Kosovo to be eliminated. The Albanian Government insists that the lifting of sanctions against Serbia be conditioned on the settlement of the Kosovo issue.We should be realists. It was not Milosevic's goodwill but the unanimous stand of the great Powers of the Contact Group that recently made Belgrade announce an interruption of its aid to Serbian aggression in Bosnia and accept international monitoring of that act. On this occasion we should stress that these decisions are positive and welcome. They should be irreversible steps  for we consider that the future of peace and stability in the Balkans will also depend  to a considerable extent  on a just settlement of the Kosovo issue. Albanians in Kosovo have been deprived of all rights. Serb nationalism rejects dialog. It is brandishing weapons and engaging in threats by the use of tanks; it is organizing police terror daily from village to village  from one city quarter to another. We have insisted and still insist on carrying out a dialog between Kosovo's legitimate institutions and its leadership  on the one hand  and Belgrade  on the other  in the presence of a third party  on the restoration of the democratic institutions that were abolished with the use of tanks and on the definition of a status that should include recognition of the right to self-determination at an opportune moment. This is the only way  in our view  to reach an overall settlement of the Balkan crisis  which may grow into conflicts far larger than previous ones unless it is tackled with proper determination and responsibility.Greek nationalism  too  is another growing threat to Albania and the Albanians. It is seeking  through a series of maneuvers  to block the reforms in Albania and to destabilize it in an attempt to render the settlement of the Albanian question more difficult and delay it. To facilitate the position of its ally in the north  it is making territorial claims against Albania.Greek nationalism is dangerous not only on account of its tradition but also because of the fact that it has the privilege of being a somewhat forgotten nationalism. For  since Greece is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and of the European Union  there is a tendency to ignore it. The truth is that Greece today  as a member of NATO and the European Union  is subject to a certain control by and dependence on those organizations  and this is a positive thing. However  it is also true that over the past two years Greek nationalism has blocked action by those institutions several times because of the consensus needed to take decisions.Today  the establishment and progressive consolidation of positions in Greek official circles is a bitter fact. The power game that is taking place in Greece is undoubtedly being played through the free vote  but  in distinction to all the other countries of Western Europe  it is being played with nationalist slogans. It is an undeniable fact that after the game is played official Greece will emerge more nationalistic than it was before. It is precisely for these reasons that Greece  the birthplace of democracy  our millenary neighbor  avoided and gave up the opportunity to serve as a promoter of the integration of the Balkan countries into Europe after the fall of the iron curtain. At the same time  through its official and unofficial policy it became a true champion of Serb nationalism - not  of course  for the sake of Serbia’s interests but for the sake of interests and ambitions which it hopes to achieve by remaking the Balkans.We do not mean that Greece can be compared to Serbia  for that would not be realistic. But what causes great concern is the progressively official character Greek nationalistic policy is assuming. It is the Greek Government which has blocked the recognition of Macedonia and has imposed a blockade on it  ignoring the fact that its border is also the border of the European Union. It is Greek state nationalism that blocks European Union aid to the poorest European country  Albania  rendering its economic growth more difficult. The Mitsotakis Government officially demanded the autonomy of ""northern Epirus""  as they call the south of Albania; the Papandreou Government declares that it has incorporated the south of our country in Greek defense planning. The official character the Greek Government has given to its policy on ""northern Epirus"" poses a serious threat to the Balkans.Greek nationalism is trying to manipulate about 60 000 Greeks who live in the south of Albania - according to the 1989 census  they comprise 1.85 per cent of the country's population - as a means to destabilize Albania and to achieve its annexationist designs. For this purpose  Greece is emitting organized  nationalistic and fundamentalist propaganda through radio stations  air-dropped leaflets and the distribution of materials which claim the south of Albania and demand the overthrow of the democratic Tirana Government. On 10 April 1994  an armed band was sent into Albania  where it killed two Albanian army men; hundreds upon hundreds of firearms have been smuggled into Greek minority villages and young Greek minority people have been recruited and sent to attend Greek military schools without the knowledge of the Albanian Government. The recent verdict passed by an Albanian court on five Albanian citizens of Greek origin on charges of collusion with the Greek secret services  sending out military intelligence  the distribution and illegal possession of arms and so on  was exploited as an excuse to attack the Albanian Government at all international institutions and forums  including this august Assembly  to block 35 million ecu in European Union aid to Albania  to expel in retaliation 60 000 Albanian citizens who were legally employed in Greece in a matter of a few weeks  maltreating them  beating them up and killing six of them.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Greek minority of Albania did not let itself fall prey to such a chauvinistic policy. The Greek minority expressed this stand openly two weeks ago during Albanian President Sali Berish's visit to Greek minority villages in the south of Albania. All this has arisen because ethnic minorities in Albania live in harmony with Albanians  and are not maltreated by the Government. On the contrary  with the establishment of the democratic regime  they are step by step enjoying the most advanced standards as set forth in United Nations instruments  the Copenhagen Document and other international conventions on minorities. This has been confirmed by dozens of foreign observers  ethnic minority specialists  parliamentarians  representatives of international institutions  including the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) High Commissioner for ethnic minorities  Mr. Max van der Stoel  various non-governmental organizations  journalists and so on.With the establishment of the democratic regime in Albania  members of the Greek minority are represented in or lead local organs of power; are represented in the Albanian parliament in the ruling parties and the opposition parties  and even in a separate party; they are present at all levels of the administration as ministers  ambassadors  members of the supreme court  and so on; they go to Greece freely and with no obstacles from the Albanian State; they learn or are taught in their mother tongue  and a recent decision of the Albanian Government has created more opportunities to extend this possibility; they have their own schools at all levels  a separate branch in the Greek language at the Gjirokastra University  their own mass media  radio broadcasts and newspapers in the Greek language  as well as their political and cultural organizations.The Albanian Government has openly declared that the crisis in its relations with Greece will in no way affect the harmonious relations between Albanians and members of the Greek minority in Albania.On the other hand  we call on the Greek Government to apply the international conventions relating to ethnic minorities. It cannot shirk its responsibility with its senseless denial of the presence of national minorities in Greece. How could the Turkish  Macedonian and Albanian minorities vanish in Greece at a stroke? The Greek Government should put an end to the suffocating climate that prevents these minorities from asserting their own national identity.How could the Greek Government forget the 1944-1945 massacre of the Albanian population of Chameria  when thousands upon thousands of people were stabbed to death and killed with firearms by Greek chauvinistic nationalists. And some of those who could escape alive  old folk and children  were expelled to Albania and Turkey  thus creating a real tragedy of divided families  whereas their land  homes and other property were usurped by Greek colonists  who still possess them today in contravention of international civil law.We have always appreciated the importance of good relations with Greece  free from any concern and tension  for our development  peace and security. Because of the reasons already mentioned  this has not always worked out. We tried to overcome the present-day crisis in our relations  provoked against our interest and will  through dialog either on a bilateral footing or through international mediation. The Greek minority people in Albania  too  have publicly supported unconditional dialog between the two Governments. Unfortunately  the Greek side has so far rejected a meeting of our two countries' Foreign Ministers  proposed by the Albanian side  as well as the mediation of the United Nations Secretary-General  the European Union presidency and the United States Administration. On the contrary  they are still bringing pressure to bear on the democratic Albanian Government.The Albanian Government will continue to make every effort to be constructive and strive for peace in its policy towards its Balkan neighbors  aware of the fact that the Balkans is one of the hottest and most dangerous spots in the world today  and therefore the attention of the international community should not be distracted from it.In conclusion  I should like to stress that we share the view and join the efforts aimed at revising the Charter and structure of the United Nations  especially as it concerns such important organs as the Security Council  which takes decisions on the maintenance of international peace and security  in order to enhance their efficiency in response to today's challenges in a fast-changing world. The crisis the world is currently experiencing urgently raises the need to achieve consensus on such a restructuring of the Security Council  so as to make this important decision-making body as representative and democratic as possible and even more effective in the adoption of decisions and their implementation. I take this opportunity to reiterate the candidature of my country for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council from the Eastern European Group for the 1996-1997 term. We think that giving this seat to Albania after 40 years of membership in the United Nations would also be an encouragement to small countries to assume the responsibility incumbent upon them and commit themselves to safeguarding peace  security and world order.We look confidently to the further enhancement of United Nations peace-keeping activities. To this end  Albania maintains that the United Nations needs an efficient mechanism to warn of conflicts in advance and to intervene in time in order to prevent their outbreak. We would like to stress the conclusion we have drawn from Bosnia's tragic experience. We seriously believe that the tragedy could have been averted if there had been serious attention by the United Nations when it recognized the secession and independence of that Republic from the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The military intervention Serbia perpetrated in order to halt more secessions from the federation would have been avoided if the new Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been placed under the firm protection of the United Nations.It is never too late to draw lessons. We think that the United Nations should set up a modem system of trusteeship that could be set in motion whenever necessary to prevent human catastrophes like that in Bosnia. Today  this is dictated by the situation in Kosovo  which is very close to posing a potential threat like that posed by Bosnia; it is dictated also by the situations in Rwanda  Somalia  Haiti and other places.As we said last year  we are in favorfavor of United Nations intervention wherever there are clear signs  as determined by early-warning monitoring  of a threat of human catastrophe. As we all know  the consequences of such catastrophes have negative effects on regional and international peace and security. We hold that in such cases there is no reason for the Security Council to hesitate to take a decision on intervention without the prior consent of the State or Government that is the cause of and is responsible for the catastrophe. Otherwise  such human catastrophes will never be prevented  and international peace  security and stability will always be threatened. What we demand is in full compliance with the universally accepted idea  that it is easier to avoid a crisis or conflict than to try to solve it after it has broken out."
"4",133,"AND",49,1994,"Your election Sir  to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of theAssembly marks an important moment for your country Côte d’Ivoire  and for the entire African continent. I havethe honour to convey to you the warmest wishes of thepeople and Government of Andorra. I also take thisopportunity to express appreciation of the greataccomplishments of your predecessor  AmbassadorInsanally.7I am speaking before you here only a few hoursbefore the official opening of the Permanent Mission of thePrincipality of Andorra to the United Nations  the firstdiplomatic Mission of Andorra anywhere in the world.This Permanent Mission is the embodiment of the will ofthe Andorran people to participate actively in theimplementation of the ideals of the United Nations Charter.On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the foundingof this Organization  our Mission will work towards theachievement of important goals. For one thing  it willmake careful preparation for the World Summit on SocialDevelopment to be held in Copenhagen. The objectives ofthat Summit - namely  to find ways to reduce poverty enhance employment opportunities and strengthen socialintegration - are particularly important in relation to thenew possibilities for development under consideration bythe Secretary-General in his ""Agenda for Development"".For another thing  Andorra will take part  with the greatestinterest  in the work of the Third Committee  whoseactivities support our historic devotion to respect for humanrights. I wish also to take this opportunity to acknowledgethe commendable work of the new United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  Ambassador Ayala Lasso.As president of the United States  John FitzgeraldKennedy stood before the Berlin Wall and pronounced thatfamous phrase  ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" (""I am a Berliner"").And for people everywhere in the world who listened tohim on that historic occasion  the word ""Berliner"" wasunderstood to mean ""a defender of freedom"".For those countries whose culture expresses itself inthe Catalan language  a similar moment has become equallyhistoric. I speak of the day when the distinguishedmusician and universally recognized artist Paul ""Pablo""Casals boldly affirmed  here at the General Assembly of theUnited Nations  before Secretary-General U Thant: ""I amCatalan"". Everyone understood immediately that  withthese words  he was beginning a song of liberty anddeclaring himself to be the son of a people filled withrespect for others  a people who had created one of theoldest parliamentary and democratic systems in the world as he stated in his dedication to the cause of peace. Let usremember that the hymn of the United Nations  the Hymnto Peace  is his work  and that it was played for the firsttime  with lyrics by the poet W. H. Auden  on27 October 1971.Allow me today to humbly join two such importantand respected figures and proclaim  in the same spirit andwith the same passion  ""I am an Andorran"". And I hopethat this expression will have the same meaning for youas the earlier assertions  and not seem to be a childish andself-centred show of pride  for throughout the centuriesour ancient and small State has always demonstrated itslove of freedom  its will to contribute to balance andharmony  and its concern to maintain peace.It has been a little more than a year since Andorrabecame a Member of the United Nations  following theapproval of our Constitution and the full adaptation of ourmodel of statehood to that befitting a State under modernlaw. Because of this  and because of the fact that we arethe last of the four small  historically independentEuropean States - the others being Liechtenstein  SanMarino and Monaco - to have become Members of theUnited Nations  it seems that this is an appropriateoccasion on which to reflect on the possible contributionsof micro-States to the family of nations.It is evident that in a world in which greatoperations must be performed on a grand scale  thesimple fact of our existence might appear anachronistic orirrelevant. Indeed  at a time when the establishment ofthe World Trade Organization points towards the end ofprotectionism  and the North American Free TradeAgreement  the Asia-Pacific Economic CooperationCouncil  and the European Union herald the creation oflarge areas in which there is free circulation of goods andservices  one might well question the need for thecontinued existence of a number of small States whichoften find themselves surrounded  as in our case  by largesupranational entities such as the European Union.Yet I believe that as we move towards integration it becomes more than ever necessary to respect andpreserve the identities of micro-States. It is clear thatthese identities are not measured in terms of size  nor dothey allow for the subordination of a minority within amajority  of a smaller collective identity within anotherthat is demographically larger.As democracy consists of government by themajority and the respect of minorities  on the internationalstage the politics of large blocs and of great Powers mustbe compatible with the recognition of groups which though smaller  must not be relegated in any way to astatus that is discriminatory nor must they be consideredless than what they are.It is evident that all small States - and probably aquarter of those represented here are small States in oneway or another - have clear limitations. It is evident also8that the contribution of great Powers to the establishmentand the preservation of world order is  and must be decisive. But it is also true that  beyond their limitations small States have qualities that humanity cannot do without especially at the present time when many peace andreconciliation processes have not been resolved and remainin need of great generosity  comprehension  tolerance anda will to compromise.By their very nature  micro-States must  in an intrinsicand essential way  have respect for diversity and mutualharmony. Precisely because of their small size  they havelearned in the long course of history that durable solutionscannot be imposed  and that the core of the differencescannot be eliminated. More powerful States can gain usefulknowledge from their experience  built upon a wisdom thatonly centuries can provide. This is even more pertinenttoday  when the great Powers have begun to show a certainself-restraint  having discovered that while the use of forcemight postpone a conflict  it cannot be the basis for alasting solution. May the great Powers of the world beguided by the rules of conduct that micro-States have beencompelled to adopt  and may the necessity of the small bethe virtue of the large. To propose rather than impose  tonegotiate rather than to compel  to discuss rather thandictate  to reconcile rather than radicalize  to respect ratherthan humiliate  to cooperate rather than exploit  and torefrain rather than abuse: those are the rules of conductdear to the small States  characteristics which appear to beincreasingly necessary in many regions of our planet  ifwhat we want is for the people of the world to live togetherin dignity and fight together against hunger  poverty disease and the negative effects of the demographicexplosion.It is for this reason  that I venture to call the attentionof the members of the Assembly to the virtues of themicro-States and to ask them to consider whether theymight not make them their own. It is simply a question ofthe great nations making an imaginative effort to putthemselves in the place of those who possess neithermilitary power nor human and economic resources toimpose on others  and consequently to realize that problemsmay be approached in another way  with probably betterguarantees for a successful outcome.This approach finds its origin in the strictest respectfor the identity of others  of their collective personality andall the features that contribute to it  as well as their culture;for culture is always an element of integration. And it isprecisely the balance of cultures and their interaction whichis the basis for peaceful coexistence  which is in itselfconsiderable  and even more for a cordial and fraternallife together. Let us therefore forget the worries ofassimilation and the belief in the superiority of themajority  and let us try to organize life together withmutual respect  something that becomes increasinglyimportant in a world under great pressure fromdemographic change and immigration.Allow me to refer to my country  the Principality ofAndorra  which with a population of only 61 000inhabitants has three different educational systems -Andorran  French  and Spanish - three quarters of itspopulation being immigrants  and a small territory stucklike an island in the middle of the European Union. AndI believe that a study of some of the balances that exist inAndorra might be useful to efforts in southern Africa  inthe Middle East  or in other parts of Europe and theworld where people are struggling to bring about peace.Think  likewise  of the great worries of our times where the drug trafficking and organized crime have ledto a dramatic deterioration in urban safety. Membersmight agree with me that the affirmation ""small isbeautiful"" might appear excessive  but it neverthelessguarantees a level of security far greater than that whichexists in the enormous urban conurbations of moredeveloped countries.I should like further to call the Assembly’s attentionto the urgency of the task of protecting the environment and the defence of nature. Members might agree with methat a smaller territory is much easier to manage according to environmental criteria  and consequently thatthere is less chance of environmental abuse. In the sameway  the scarcity of human resources probably makes usmore inclined to consider the problems that we shalldiscuss at the World Summit on Social Development inCopenhagen  namely  individual problems of marginalizedpeople  of those that cannot follow the competitivemajority in the apparent flow of progress  of the disabled the sick  and  in general  all those in need of solidarity.I know that in a forum such as this Christianindividualism is just a partial approach to these questions but I am convinced that  with a translation into othercultures or religions  on a small scale it is much easier togive a personal answer to the problems of the many. Andalso  in general terms  I think that this philosophy is theone that often inspires solidarity movements  as is thecase today in Rwanda  where  for example  the spirit ofcollective life common to small communities might haveprevented conflict.9In a world that is increasingly interdependent  andincreasingly globalized  I sincerely believe that themicro-States  although indeed small  are not superfluous.And we can even make useful contributions and be pointsof reference in many cases. Sovereign States areincreasingly affected by the sovereignty of others and bynecessary international agreements; but freedom  and thespirit of solidarity are more important than sovereignties orborders.I ask the Assembly therefore to consider the possibilitythat we all make an effort to act like micro-States: we whoare micro-States  and therefore have no alternative  andthose who are not  because they have come to theconclusion that this is the way we will all be able  together to contribute more positively to peace  progress andcoexistence. And as from the sum of small streams ofwater the big rivers are born  perhaps from the sum ofsmall identities and from respect for others and minorities we may be able to build together a more equitable  a moresecure and a more livable world for us  for our children and for generations to come."
"5",178,"ARE",49,1994,"On behalf of the delegation of the UnitedArab Emirates it gives me pleasure to extend to thePresident our congratulations on his election to thepresidency of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. This is a clear recognition by the internationalcommunity of his wisdom  diplomatic skills and a sign ofesteem for his country  Côte d’Ivoire. We would also liketo pay tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Insanally  forhis efforts and his efficiency in steering the deliberations ofthe last session. In this connection  we salute theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisefforts aimed at improving the work of the Organizationand its efficiency so that it may face up to the challengesand changes of today’s world.On this occasion  I am happy to welcome the return ofSouth Africa to the fold of the international community.We are fully confident that by its return  it will effectivelycontribute to enhancing the work of the Organization.The end of the cold war has created a new climate ininternational relations as better prospects have emergedwhich promise to make possible the achievement oftangible progress towards finding solutions for a numberof international problems. Such encouragingdevelopments afford unprecedented opportunities forinternational cooperation in the interests of peace security  stability and sustainable development. At thesame time  we must take stock of the new realities thathave emerged on the international scene.In a number of regions  the escalation of wars andregional conflicts poses a serious threat to internationaland regional peace and security and has led to a state ofeconomic  social and developmental instability. Newforms of racism  nationalism and religious fanaticismhave emerged  and acts of violence and terrorism in all itsforms take place. All these situations and factors impedethe building of the better world of peace  coexistence tolerance and prosperity after which humanity aspires.This makes it clear that the tasks the United Nationsundertakes in performing its role in such areas as theresolution of conflicts  peace building and the preventionof regional conflicts are not easy  given the complexnature of the problems of today’s world which differ fromthose of yesterday’s world. Therefore  we must intensifyour efforts in support of what the Secretary-General hasproposed in his report “An Agenda for Peace”  in orderfor that agenda to be translated into a concrete reality. Irefer in particular to the proposals concerning thestrengthening of cooperation  partnership and coordinationbetween regional organizations and the United Nations  inline with the provisions of the Charter and the rules andnorms of international law. I should mention in particularthe organizations associated with our region  such as theGulf Cooperation Council  the League of Arab States andthe Organization of the Islamic Conference  all of whichpossess a good deal of comprehensive knowledge of theaffairs of the region and the nature of its problems.In the current international situation  it is importantto reconsider the question of reforming the structure ofthe United Nations — particularly the Security Counciland the General Assembly — in accordance with theCharter  so that  in the exercise of their functions  theymay respond and adapt to the nature of the current worldsituation. The responsibilities of the Security Councilhave greatly increased over the past few years. This factmakes it necessary to ensure greater participation by allMember States  taking into account the fact that equitableand just geographic and regional distribution wouldcontribute to the maintenance of international and regionalpeace and security.23Developments in international and regional situationsover the past years have made it clear that radical solutionsto regional disputes can be reached only by peaceful means through dialogue and negotiation between countries inaccordance with the United Nations Charter and the rulesand norms of international law. Proceeding from this  thepolicy of the United Arab Emirates is based on full andmutual respect for States’ sovereignty and independenceand for the principles of non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States  good-neighbourliness and peacefulcoexistence.Thus  throughout the years  we have had a sinceredesire to conduct direct negotiations with the Governmentof Iran with a view to the restoration of our full sovereigntyover our three Islands — namely  Lesser Tumb  GreaterTumb and Abu Moussa  which were militarily occupied byIran in 1971  an action which we consider to be illegal andin breach of the United Nations Charter and the rules ofinternational law.On a number of occasions  my country has declaredfrom this rostrum its complete readiness to settle thisdispute by peaceful means. Hence the initiative by theUnited Arab Emirates which called for serious and directnegotiations to put an end to the Iranian occupation of ourthree islands. This stance on our part stemmed not onlyfrom the nature of the traditional and historic relationsbetween the two countries and from the current trends onthe international scene in dealing with issues of peace andsecurity  but also from our adherence to the principles andtenets of the Islamic Sharia’a  the provisions of the Charterand the rules of international law.Owing to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s failure torespond to all these endeavors and initiatives on thequestion of the three Islands of the Emirates  theGovernment of my country has declared its full readinessto put the issue before the International Court of Justicewhich is the judicial organ competent to settle disputesbetween States. My Country is pledged to accepting allthat follows from the Judgment of the International Courtas that Judgment would be based on legal arguments anddocuments.This initiative was supported by our sister countries ofthe Gulf Cooperation Council  as well as by Arab and byother friendly countries. We hope that the internationalcommunity will support this peaceful initiative  which isbased on international legality.Furthermore  the United Arab Emirates hopes thatthe Islamic Republic of Iran would share this sinceredesire and respond to our serious initiative  especially asthe Government of Iran has on previous occasions — Irefer to disputes in respect of which the Court was likelyto rule in Iran’s favour — had recourse to theInternational Court of Justice and accepted its Judgments.We are confident that this initiative will help to achievean atmosphere of stability and security in the region andwill enhance peaceful coexistence and mutual respectamongst its States and thereby enable them to channeltheir energies and resources towards the achievement ofthe socio-economic development for which they stand indire need after so many years of conflict and war.Although almost four years have elapsed since theliberation of the sisterly State of Kuwait  the Iraqi regimeis still being selective in its implementation of therelevant resolutions of international legality  indifferent tothe serious consequences. In addition  it is using delayingtactics and procrastination  instead of cooperating byreleasing hundreds of hostages and detainees from Kuwaitand other countries.While we in the United Arab Emirates  with ourbrethren in the Gulf Cooperation Council  affirm theneed to uphold the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq we consider the international resolutions operative andmandatory. Thus  we demand that the Iraqi regime abideby its legal and political obligations  as stipulated in theSecurity Council resolutions related to its aggressionagainst Kuwait — in particular  resolution 687 (1991)concerning respect for the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Kuwait; and resolution 833 (1993)  whichdetermines the demarcation of international bordersbetween Kuwait and Iraq in accordance with theprovisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. Short of theimplementation of both these resolutions  there cannot bea positive climate conducive to peace and security in theregion.The peace dividend  the product of the atmosphereof international cooperation in the wake of the Cold Warera  has increasingly come to determine the characteristicsand parameters of a new world order based on regionalcooperation  for whose success peace is considered anindispensable prerequisite. Proceeding from this  theUnited Arab Emirates was one of the countries thatwelcomed the holding of the Madrid Peace Conferenceand the conduct of bilateral negotiations. This was alsothe reason why my country participated in the multilateralnegotiations.24While we considered the Declaration of Principles andthe agreements that followed on the Palestinian andJordanian tracks as the first real steps of detente in theArab-Israeli dispute and the Question of Palestine based oninternational legality as represented in the relevant UnitedNations resolutions  particularly Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) on theIsraeli withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian andArab territories  including Al-Quds Al-Shareef  the SyrianGolan and southern Lebanon  at the same time we affirmthe necessity of attaining positive results on the Syrian andLebanese tracks based on these resolutions and on theprinciples and the premises that were agreed upon inMadrid Peace Conference  namely the land-for-peaceprinciple.My country  which pins its hopes on the success of thenational reconciliation conference in Somalia within theterms of the Nairobi Declaration  is still concerned aboutthe deterioration of the security and humanitarian situationand the obstruction of the distribution of relief supplies tothe suffering people of this sisterly country. We did nothesitate to grant humanitarian assistance in addition to ourparticipation in the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM II).We think that the international relief efforts cannot besuccessful in the worsening internal situation. Therefore the major responsibility lies with the Somali leadersthemselves to formulate a serious response to mediationefforts aimed at the political settlement and nationalreconciliation  without which their country will not besaved  its reconstruction will not be achieved and therehabilitation of its people will not take place or pave theway for Somalia’s return as an active member of theinternational community.My country is deeply concerned over the situation inBosnia and Herzegovina  particularly under thecircumstances of the continued violation of its sovereigntyand of the human rights of its people  especially theMuslims. The facts still indicate that Bosnian Serb forcesand their supporters have not refrained for a single dayfrom their acts of aggression or from perpetrating furthercrimes of ethnic cleansing and genocide. To the contrary they have gone to great lengths in defying the internationalwill and have even attacked United Nations personnel.These Serbian actions aim at regional expansionist gainsthat violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Although the United Arab Emirates has continued tocall upon the international community since the eruptionof this crisis to take serious measures that could restoredignity  security and stability to that country  yet  after 30months  we are obliged to reiterate our call  in thestrongest possible terms  to the international community particularly the Security Council  to reconsider themanner it has opted for in dealing with the question ofBosnia and Herzegovina. The Council must once againtake firmer measures against the Serbian aggressor inaccordance with Article 42 of Chapter VII of the Charter and in a manner that would achieve a just negotiatedsettlement.At the same time  we reiterate our previous call forthe lifting of the arms embargo imposed on the Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina by Security Council resolution713 (1991) so that the people of that country may be ableto defend themselves in accordance with Article 51 of theCharter.In view of the rapid developments in internationalrelations at the end of the Cold War era  the internationalsituation necessitates an early settlement of the problemsleft behind by that era. This will be realized only througha general orientation towards disarmament in all its forms covering both nuclear weapons and weapons of massdestruction. Thus  we look forward to the 1995Conference on the Review and Revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  hoping that that Conference willproduce confidence-building measures on the regional andinternational levels that would create zones free fromweapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons particularly in the Middle East region  which has beenplagued by conflict for a long period of time.Despite progress in the Arab-Israeli peacenegotiations  we are deeply concerned over Israel’sacquisition of an immense nuclear capability  whichconstitutes a constant and continued threat to the securityof the countries and peoples of the region  hampers therealization of the comprehensive objectives of thesenegotiations and will also endanger international peace.While social issues are now at the forefront ofinternational relations  the economic and developmentalquestions of developing countries are increasinglymarginalized  and the economic disparities betweendeveloping and developed countries continues to widen asa result of the measures taken by developed countries.The exports of developing countries are still impeded byprotectionist measures  and their efforts for development25are threatened by the burden of foreign indebtedness reverse financial flows in addition to the constant decline inthe price of commodities  on which most of developingcountries depend as a major source of national income  aswell as the general deterioration in the terms of trade andfinance of the developing countries themselves.The persistence of these problems and the absence ofa solution will lead to political and social tensions  whichin turn will adversely affect international and regional peaceand security.The nature of these problems requires us to reconsiderthe structure of the current international social andeconomic relations with two approaches. The first includesthe development of new measures and mechanisms forcooperation amongst the countries of the North and theSouth  and the second hinges on finding a strategy foreconomic integration that addresses the elements ofdevelopmental deficit among the countries of the South ina way that ensures the realization of socio-economicimprovements in the process of sustainable development and alleviates the concerns of the countries of the Southvis-à-vis implementation of their immediate and medium-term development plans.International economic integration has become aconcrete reality that must be taken into account. Thisconcept has been recently endorsed by the agreement ofa majority of countries to the establishment of the WorldTrade Organization in Marakesh in sisterly Morocco on15 April 1994. There can be no doubt that this is ahistoric event and gives new momentum to the worldeconomy. We hope that the setting up of this neworganization will be a positive beginning that improvesand enhances the prospects of economic  financial andinternational trade relations based on justice  co-equalityand equity  with a view to bridging the gap betweendeveloped and developing countries.The spirit of tolerance and of adherence to noblecultural and humanitarian values  to the principles andpurposes of the Charter and the rules of international lawshould be our beacon which guides our steps towards thefuture that we desire. Consequently  we call on MemberStates to take advantage of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations and to transform it into a historic occasionfor a comprehensive review and for ushering in a brightfuture of stability  security and coexistence prevail for allpeoples and countries of the world."
"6",225,"ARG",49,1994,"Allow me  Mr. President  to congratulate you on yourelection to such a responsible post. I am certain that youwill be able to guide our debates with your well-knownefficiency.These are years of change and transformation. In anamazingly short period of time we have moved from abipolar world marked by strategic confrontation whichseemed insurmountable to a world in which the hope ofan international order of peace and harmony coexists withsome uncertainties. There are still serious conflicts thatrequire our full attention and that of the United Nations -the main institution the international community has forthe solution of such conflicts.The international landscape is full of contrasts: thereare encouraging signs of convergence alongside othersigns that seem to point to the persistence ofauthoritarianism and extremism  which inevitably lead toviolence. Torn as it is between hope and uncertainty  theworld must face the challenge of finding the rightanswers. But we must keep in mind and never lose sightof the fact that we cannot aspire to a world at peace if wefail to establish a just international society. There can beno peace without justice and there can be no justicewithout the full assurance of freedom and human rights.There can be no peace or justice if there isdiscrimination. There can be no peace or justice wherethere is hunger. There can be no peace or justice wherethere are regimes that repress individual freedom. Andthere can be no peace or justice when terrorism continuesto be protected by political  cultural and economicsponsors.11But  as I said at the outset  there are also some facetsof reality that encourage us. One of the high notes of thepast year was the successful conclusion of the institutionaltransition of the Republic of South Africa  magnificentlyembodied in the figures of President Mandela and theenlightened opposition leaders. The national unityagreements which made it possible for South Africa to besuccessfully integrated into the family of democratic nationsdemonstrate once again that the endeavour of nation-building must always be based on dialogue andunderstanding between major political forces.We have also witnessed with satisfaction and hope thecontinuation and the strengthening of the peace agreementsbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.In Gaza and Jericho  after more than 30 years  thePalestinian people is once again determining its own futurein its own land.The original agreements have been strengthened bythose recently signed by Israel and Jordan  whichunequivocally represent the definitive acceptance of theState of Israel by the whole of the international community.We hope that such a promising start will soon lead tosimilar agreements with other  indispensable actors in theregion.As at all great moments in history  the solution to theviolence and despair that lasted for so many years has notbeen a matter of chance. Involved here have been men great statesmen  true leaders  who - without setting asidetheir own legitimate grievances - have decided courageouslyto do away with rancour and recrimination. These Israeliand Palestinian leaders have pointed the way toreconciliation founded on peace.But not all is brightness. The shadows of the Balkantragedy linger  despite the tremendous efforts being madeby the United Nations and regional groups to find a justand satisfactory peace. Argentina has contributed to thisquest for solutions to the best of its ability  through theUnited Nations Protection Force. Since 1992 more than4 000 Argentine soldiers have been dispatched to contribute sometimes even with their lives  to fulfilling the resolutionsof the Organization.In Africa  Rwanda has demanded the attention andgripped the hearts of all men and women of goodwill.Argentina has contributed by sending foodstuffs andmedical supplies  and doctors and nurses from our countryhave joined in the efforts of thousands of internationalvolunteers who  amid scenes of horror and destitution remind us of the inner nobility of every human being.In Latin America  our region  to which we attach thegreatest importance  the process of consolidatingdemocracy has continued. Significant steps have beentaken in terms of the non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  and it is now possible  as in few regionsof the world  to point to high levels of growth in anatmosphere of increasing economic stability. Our region with its renewed democratic outlook  its respect forhuman rights  for peace and progressive but resoluteintegration  has in a few years become the centre ofattraction for international investment. In this frameworkof increasing freedom that the region now demonstrates I should like particularly to hail the historic process ofelections in El Salvador  which has put behind it a longperiod of confrontation.With respect to the situation in Cuba  myGovernment would once again voice its conviction as tothe need for democratization on a pluralistic basis as theonly way to prevent the worsening of the crisis that existsthere and to permit the country to be reintegrated fullyinto the Latin American community.In Haiti  the overall solution lies in compliance withSecurity Council resolution 940 (1994)  which  within thesystem of collective security provided for in the Charter authorizes multilateral action  a mechanism that isessentially different in nature from unilateral intervention which we reject.I wish to take this opportunity to express thanks forthe work done by Mr. Dante Caputo  the former ForeignMinister of my country  who  after completing importantand intelligent work during his term as Representative ofthe Secretary-General for the question of Haiti  decidedjust a few days ago to resign that position.I believe in this regard that it is important to refer toone of the most disquieting challenges that threatendemocracy: corruption. This phenomenon progressivelyerodes credibility and public trust in institutions and theirleaders. The Argentine Government is committed to arelentless struggle against corruption  placing particularemphasis on eliminating excessive State control and alack of transparency in State administration  a fertileground for corruption.The problems that make up the international agendamust  in Argentina’s view  be solved by strengthening the12United Nations. We have constantly and firmly supportedthe work of the Security Council  which is at last on theway to regaining the role assigned to it by the Charter. Theparticipation of Argentina in nine peace-keepingoperations - the highest number for any Latin Americancountry - in the form of troops  military observers andcivilian police  is a concrete contribution that bears out theconvictions that I have spoken of today.I wish to emphasize that in its participation in peace-keeping operations  the Argentine Republic is accompaniedby 72 countries. I wish to pay tribute to them as well forassisting in achieving peace and justice in many  verydiverse  regions of the world.We have also responded to the Secretary-General’sproposal that a system of stand-by forces be set up  and ourresponse takes the form of a pledge of specializedpersonnel  transport and 1 500 troops.Another aspect of far-reaching importance in terms ofthe evolution of the United Nations itself is the question ofequitable representation on the Security Council and anincrease in the number of its members. Argentina attachesgreat importance to this issue and takes the view that thenumber of members on the Council has alwayscorresponded to the geopolitical situation prevailing at aspecific time and that efforts at reform should thus bedesigned to adapt the number to the current geopoliticalsituation.Combating the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction is one of the indisputable pillars of internationalpeace and security.With this in mind  Argentina has ratified the Treaty ofTlatelolco  while currently our Parliament is consideringaccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  which should be extended for the sake of globalsecurity and stability.With respect to chemical weapons  we are taking thenecessary steps to set up a national authority  and we hopeto see international verification measures strengthened.At the same time  we firmly support the conclusion ofthe comprehensive test-ban treaty.In the past year  Argentina joined the systemscontrolling exports of high technology and equipment withpossible military uses  enabling us to benefit from thetransfer of technology.We are concerned at the persistence of thesovereignty dispute over the Malvinas  South Georgia andSouth Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritimeareas.Although we have a satisfactory relationship with theUnited Kingdom on other bilateral questions  we cannothelp but once again reaffirm before this world forum  aswe do each year  our sovereign rights over thoseterritories.Our claim this year has taken on special significance since the Argentine people  through their representativesin the National Congress  reformed the supreme law ofthe country little more than a month ago  givingconstitutional status to the question of the MalvinasIslands by including  in the new text of the constitution a transitional clause which reaffirms our rights and statesthat in recovering those rights respect for internationallaw and the way of life of the population of the Islandsshall be paramount.Thus the entire spectrum of Argentine politicalopinion has given solemn embodiment to a claim whichis more than ever central and permanent to our foreignpolicy.For this reason  and despite the fact that our twoGovernments have collaborated on certain aspects of themanagement of the living resources of the South Atlantic we cannot but deplore the further recourse by the UnitedKingdom to unilateral jurisdictional measures in the area;these undermine the possibility of broadening existingagreements and of arriving at others. We trust that theUnited Kingdom shares with us the conviction that thereis no real alternative to cooperation in the South Atlantic.With respect to fisheries  we have arrived atprovisional agreements allowing for the rationalexploitation of these resources and preventing predatoryfishing. But repeated recourse to unilateral measures suchas I have described jeopardizes the possibility of addingto or indeed maintaining these understandings.As far as oil is concerned  Argentina has once againput forward specific proposals for cooperation. Ourinitiatives on this matter are based on the recognizedprinciple of international law prohibiting the unilateralexploitation of non-renewable resources  a dispute whichhas been acknowledged by the General Assembly.13As to the inhabitants of the islands  I wish to reaffirmbefore this Assembly our full readiness to establish directand responsive links with them. It is clear to us that theproblem of the Falkland Islands has an inevitable humandimension which is bound up with the way of life and theneeds of the islanders.Argentina is ready to preserve the way of life and theparticular characteristics  and in this context we areprepared to study all matters  from communications to thelegal and financial systems  in order to find logicalsolutions acceptable to all.Dialogue with the islanders is an inseparable part of arational  civilized solution to this problem. Once again logic and reason are pointing inexorably towardscooperation and dialogue.The economic and social agenda is an indication ofjust how positive an event was the conclusion of theUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT); it will make it possible to more effectivelytackle problems of unemployment and the distribution ofwealth.Argentina’s policy aims at securing the consensus ofthe countries of the Americas in order that we may declarethe continent a zone free of subsidies and unfair practiceswith respect to agricultural products. The agreement onagriculture marks an important advancement  and Argentinathinks it is appropriate to take a further step by helping toeliminate distortions in international trade.Argentina’s concern for social problems is wellknown. Through measures to establish stability  to combatinflation and to ensure economic growth  we have taken animportant step forward in our struggle against poverty.Turning to external matters  we have proposed theestablishment of a volunteer corps to combat hunger andpoverty  coordinating efforts under way in this field.President Clinton kindly referred to our initiative yesterday and we particularly value his support.The issues related to the relationship betweenpopulation and development  which a few weeks ago wereabsorbing world attention in Cairo  cannot be left out ofthis analysis. We believe in promoting fundamental values such as the advancement of women  human rights  andsustainable economic development  but with respect topopulation policies we maintain that human life exists fromthe moment of conception until natural death  condemningany practice undermining this.Population policies should not aim to smother life but to ensure the greatest access of all individuals to thebenefits of development and the fair distribution ofwealth.There are two scourges besetting the world at theend of the twentieth century: drug trafficking andterrorism. Both of these call for concerted action on thepart of the international community  for they are notnational but world-wide scourges.With respect to terrorism  I can speak with thetwofold weight of conviction and pain - with conviction because of our repudiation of terrorism as a means ofpolitical or religious expression  and with pain  because ofthe hundreds of Argentines who died as a result of theattack that destroyed a building belonging to the Jewishcommunity in Buenos Aires in July. We are grateful forthe solidarity extended to us and for the SecurityCouncil’s condemnation. We believe that concertedaction is needed to tackle terrorism - terrorism which haserupted in New York  London and Panama as well as inBuenos Aires. It is vital for the United Nations to playa more active  leadership role  coordinating a globalendeavour to effectively combat this scourge.We reiterate here our suggestion that the UnitedNations should be provided with a unit devoted to thequestion of international terrorism.United Nations action must enjoy the resolutesupport of all. It is iniquitous and unacceptable that thereare Governments that encourage terrorism. Sovereigntymust not be used as a shield for abetting terroristorganizations while the world looks on helplessly. If weHeads of State all worked in concert  we could put an endto this veritable scourge afflicting us all.The United Nations should also study multilateralmechanisms that  while respecting the immunities andprivileges enshrined in the Vienna Convention  wouldprevent and punish the abuse of those immunities andprivileges to support the actions of international terrorists.We cannot rule out the possibility that such immunitiesand privileges were abused in the attacks in BuenosAires.In closing  I wish to address the need to strengthenthe United Nations  in particular with respect to its14responsibilities in the area of international peace andsecurity. This involves first resolving its pressing financialdifficulties.The United Nations must also continue to study thepossibility of changing the current structure of the SecurityCouncil. In the view of the Argentine Republic  anyincrease in the number of members should be prudent andmoderate  so that the Council is guaranteed maximumpossible operating efficiency. In addition  any expansionshould avoid the creation of unjustifiable imbalances in therepresentation of the various regions of the world. TheArgentine Republic believes that the principle of thesovereign equality of Member States must always berespected. Furthermore  none of the provisions of Article23 of the Charter should be disregarded. For all thesereasons  it would seem preferable to think in terms of alimited increase in the number of non-permanent membersand  as far as possible  the elimination of restrictions ontheir re-election.We find ourselves on the eve of the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization. Let us make the best useof the system of collective security and the mechanisms ofeconomic and social cooperation provided by the Charter.I have no doubt that by doing so we shall have a muchbetter world in the next 50 years  one worth living in forour children and our children’s children."
"7",250,"ARM",49,1994,"May I begin by warmly congratulating you  Sir on your election to the presidency of the forty-ninth sessionof the United Nations General Assembly. I would also liketo express my appreciation to your predecessor Ambassador Samuel Insanally  and to thank him for hiscontribution to accomplishing the tasks of the last session.Further  I wish to express our gratitude to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for thevision with which he has guided the Organization and forhis tireless efforts to ensure the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.The collapse of the old order and the emergence ofnew democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and  soonafter  in the former Soviet Union have presented theworld with a major challenge. In a period of tremendouschange  many difficulties and conflicts have arisen. Someof these difficulties come as immediate by-products ofrapid and haphazard transformations  while others aresurfacing for the first time after decades of inadequatestop-gap measures. Further  if the reform programmeshave so far failed to yield all the benefits expected  thisis also due to an under-estimation of the differences in theinitial conditions of the countries in transition.The pace and comprehensiveness of economicreforms will vary from country to country. However  thereform process will inevitably be lengthy  as it involveswholesale changes in price mechanisms  in the concept ofproperty  in industrial structures and in legal  commercialand financial institutions  as well as the creation of socialsafety nets for the most vulnerable segments of thepopulation  whose situation will be worsened by the highcost of the reforms.As with all the former Soviet Republics  Armenia’seconomy has been badly strained by the changes whichfollowed the disintegration of the Soviet Union and thedifficult transition to a market economy. It is furthercrippled by its over-reliance on trade with the formerSoviet Republics; the blockade of transportation routesimposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan; an embargo byTurkey; and the damage inflicted by the disastrousearthquake in 1988. Other external conditions  such asthe disruption of transport due to the difficulties faced byGeorgia  have exacerbated the situation  contributing to thedecline in Armenia’s industrial productivity. The legacy ofthe Soviet period  with its inefficiencies and excessivehorizontal integration  has worsened the effects of theblockade.Despite these difficulties  the Armenian Governmenthas begun implementing significant structural reforms tocreate a healthy market economy  beginning with theprivatization process launched soon after the ArmenianNational Movement came to power in 1990. Indeed  thecommitment to transform the centrally planned economyinto a market economy stems from the philosophy of thedemocratic movement in Armenia and is seen as an integralpart of the transition to a democratic State.In turn  a free market economy will flourish in a stabledemocracy  able to promote and underpin economicdevelopment. Armenia today is a country with more than30 registered political parties. It has proclaimed freedomof the press  freedom of conscience and freedom ofreligion  and it has laws guaranteeing civil and politicalrights. Three free elections have already been held inArmenia: parliamentary and presidential elections and areferendum on independence. The upcoming referendumon the Constitution and the elections of the NationalAssembly and the President of the Republic will reaffirmthe establishment of a democratic tradition.Democracy is fundamental to the process of economictransformation  which can be divided into three phases more or less typical for all countries in transition:institutional reforms; long-term investments and changes oftechnological structures; and integration into internationalmarkets. It is imperative  however  to set priorities and toidentify the most pressing issues of the moment. In myopinion  Armenia is at the end of the first phase  whichincludes the creation of a legal framework for economicreform  within which private economic activity can takeplace  a framework ensuring that contracts are enforced andthat private property is protected; freeing of prices;privatization; adoption of a national currency; financial andbudgetary stabilization; and improvement in the balance ofpayments. We have already accomplished 80 per cent ofthis phase.Armenia has distinguished itself as the first among theformer Soviet Republics to privatize the ownership ofagricultural land and livestock production. Theprivatization of small and medium businesses as well aslarge enterprises is well under way. In late 1993  with thecollapse of the rouble zone  Armenia faced a monetarycrisis. The uncontrollable flow of old Soviet roubles intoArmenia and Armenia’s subsequent inability to controlmonetary policy on its own territory forced theGovernment in November 1993 prematurely to introducea national currency  the dram. The Government iscurrently implementing a programme based on controllingand lowering the inflation rate  enforcing a strict budget controlling fiscal expenditures and targeting assistance tothe most vulnerable groups.Basic reforms have been undertaken in the bankingsector  the first of which was to break down the mono-bank system of central planning into a two-tiered systemcomprising a central bank and a group of commercialbanks.In Armenia  as in all the emerging democracies there is no historical precedent for the economictransition. It requires lasting commitment and patience aswell as the substantial support of the internationalcommunity. Of course neither short- and medium-termadjustment programmes nor long-term developmentstrategies can hope to succeed fully without sustainedgrowth in the world economy and favourable externalconditions.We recognize that there is no single model oftransition to be prescribed for all countries or  even morenarrowly  for all post-communist societies as a whole. Toensure success for United Nations efforts in the countriesin transition the Organization must tailor its involvementto each country’s resources and procedures  givingpriority to programmes rather than to projects. Thatapproach essentially boils down to the definition of keyobjectives for each programme that will reflect thepriorities of the national Government and the organizationof assistance around the achievement of those goals which can be accomplished by strengthening the role ofthe Resident Coordinator system.Armenia appreciates the Secretary-General’s Agendafor Development as an important and necessarycomplement to ""An Agenda for Peace"". It is acomprehensive and thoughtful reflection upon the variousdimensions of development and the role of the UnitedNations in that connection. At the recently held worldgatherings on development there was broad agreementthat the Agenda should be sustained by an action-orientedframework and practical proposals aimed at resolvingexisting imbalances in the various development areas.We look forward to the further elaboration of the Agenda2for Development by the Secretary-General through anumber of concrete proposals with regard to the reform ofboth the United Nations system and the intergovernmentalconsultative machinery for development  as well as specificrecommendations for greater coordination within the UnitedNations as a whole  including the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the proposed World Trade Organization.Such an elaboration is needed if the Agenda is to lead to aglobal partnership for development.Armenia looks forward to participating in andcontributing to the World Summit for Social Developmentin Copenhagen. The World Summit  to be held in theUnited Nations fiftieth anniversary year  is a landmarkevent and will build upon the commitments of a series ofUnited Nations global gatherings  including the 1990 WorldSummit for Children  the 1992 United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro and the1994 International Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo  and it will be followed by theFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.These are all key events in the process of internationalconsensus-building.Development and human rights are interrelated andmutually reinforcing. There can be no genuine long-termdevelopment without respect for the full spectrum of therights of individuals. The Vienna Conference on HumanRights held last year deepened the understanding of thesignificance of human rights for stability  freedom  peace progress and justice. The establishment of the post ofUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights wasvital to a more effective implementation of the principles ofhuman rights. Member States must continue to work toincrease the effectiveness of existing United Nationshuman-rights mechanisms and to support the HighCommissioner in the fulfilment of his mandate.Armenia considers self-determination in its multitudeof manifestations to be an inalienable human right.Armenia’s position on the Nagorny Karabakh conflict hasbeen clear and consistent from the start. Armenia has noterritorial claims against Azerbaijan. The conflict isbetween the people of Nagorny Karabakh  who are strivingfor self-determination  and the Azerbaijani Government which is refusing to address the rights of the people ofNagorny Karabakh. Armenia provides moral  diplomaticand humanitarian assistance to the people of NagornyKarabakh  and it cannot accept a military solution whichcan only mean the genocide or deportation of thepopulation of Nagorny Karabakh.While the Nagorny Karabakh conflict has gonethrough periods of both intense fighting and relative calmsince I spoke here two years ago  there has never beforebeen a period in the five-year history of the conflict whena cease-fire has taken hold for so long. I am pleased toinform the Assembly today that the cease-fire of12 May 1994  which was mediated by the RussianFederation  is in general being maintained. But what ismore gratifying and encouraging is that  through directand immediate contacts between the parties to theconflict  the de facto 12 May cease-fire was formalizedon 27 July 1994  and on 28 August 1994 the partiesreaffirmed their commitment to the cease-fire until suchtime as a political document has been signed.Armenia congratulates the main parties to theconflict for their commitment to maintain the cease-fireand to engage in direct dialogue. Armenia views this asan important confidence-building measure  as a major steptowards the consolidation of the cease-fire and as a signof a strong commitment to the successful conclusion ofthe current negotiations  which in turn will make possiblethe solution of the problem at the Minsk Conference ofthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.Clearly  the conflict has entered a new phase  inwhich the parties have demonstrated their desire forpeace.Our new challenge  and the priority for Armenia  isthe consolidation of the cease-fire and the establishmentof peace. There is a historic opportunity today to end theconflict. But the cause of peace requires the active unified support of the international community toconsolidate the cease-fire. The cumulative impact of thedistrust of the past five years  on the one hand  and thelack of international measures to support consolidation on the other hand  may increase the current uncertaintyand threaten the fragile cease-fire.There is no doubt that  beyond the cessation ofhostilities  a lasting peace will mostly depend on theability of the main parties to the conflict and of theinternational community to develop innovative andinternationally approved mechanisms for its establishmentand maintenance.The primary concern for Armenia has been  andremains  the security of the people of Nagorny Karabakh.Both Armenia and Nagorny Karabakh have repeatedlyexpressed their readiness to comply with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. A lasting peace can be3achieved only by ensuring the irreversibility of the peaceprocess through the deployment of international securityforces between Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh untilsuch time as a negotiated solution to the problem ofNagorny Karabakh has been reached  with the fullparticipation of Nagorny Karabakh at the CSCE MinskConference.The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is indirect contradiction of the peacemaking efforts of theUnited Nations. Armenia considers that only theunconditional and indefinite extension of the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty will ensure that the Treaty servesits purpose. It is encouraging that negotiations on acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty have made importantprogress over the past year  and we hope that a textsatisfactory to all can be agreed on soon.We support the integration of multilateral disarmamentwith United Nations activities relat to preventive diplomacy peacemaking  peace-keeping and post-conflictpeace-building.The debate in the General Assembly Working Groupon the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council hasbeen very useful. Virtually all States Members of theUnited Nations favour an increase in the membership of theSecurity Council to reflect the radical changes in the worldand the increase in the Organization’s overall membership.However  an increase in membership should not diminishthe Council’s efficiency. It is necessary here to note thatthe Council has taken a number of constructive steps toimprove its transparency and its communication withnon-members. The Security Council should also be betterable to respond to emerging threats and disputes beforethey escalate into armed conflict. With improvedcoordination of United Nations organizations and agenciesdevoted to economic and social progress  the Economic andSocial Council could better assist the Security Council andadvise it of potential emergencies arising out of economicand social conditions. Therefore  Armenia fully supportsthe call for restructuring of the Economic and SocialCouncil and for the possible establishment of an economicsecurity council.Improving the administrative performance of theUnited Nations is another priority. Armenia welcomes thecurrent initiatives to streamline the Organization’sadministrative and management structures and proceduresto meet the demands now being made of the UnitedNations. In particular  we supported the United Statesinitiative  and we are pleased that the General Assemblyhas created the Office of Internal Oversight Services.Let me return for a moment to the theme I beganwith. In this period of unprecedented change  manyhardships - both expected and unforeseen - have arisen.The present era  full of challenge and hope  gives us newfaith in the United Nations as the best and mostappropriate forum for integrating all the interests of thevarious peoples of the world  which are too fragmentedtoday. Universal harmony can be established only whendiscords are peacefully resolved and full cooperationbetween nations is achieved. The United Nations strengthened by the noble principles and objectivesenshrined in its Charter  and facing new responsibilitiesand tasks  can and must lead the way to a betterorganized and more harmonious world.Let me conclude by wishing the General Assemblyevery success in the demanding work it faces during thissession."
"8",283,"ATG",49,1994,"I wish first toextend to Foreign Minister Essy and the people of theRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire congratulations on his election tothe presidency of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. I pledge to him my delegation’s full support ashe carries out the weighty responsibilities of his office. Inwelcoming him and wishing him well in his stewardship ofthe momentous work of this Assembly  I recall that hereplaces in this important office a son of my ownsubregion  the Caribbean. Ambassador Rudy Insanally ofGuyana served the presidency of the General Assemblywith distinction  and I thank him for demonstrating theability and talent of the Caribbean people.The Caribbean people  their aspirations in the globalcommunity and the place of the United Nations in theirconsideration are at the heart of the presentation that I willmake here today. Thirteen years ago my country wasadmitted to this body as an independent Member State. AsForeign Minister at that time  I said to this Assembly:“I represent a people living in the reality ofunderdevelopment. I am before you as arepresentative of the wretchedness that is the residueof colonialism  a wretchedness which includesunemployment and underemployment  inadequatehousing and insufficient medical facilities.“And yet  despite our condition  my people arepart of mankind’s universal relationship; by our veryexistence we are intertwined in the destiny of allhumanity. In that sense  regardless of the wealth ofsome men  mankind will never be rich while weremain disinherited. dislocated and disenchanted.”(A/36/PV.53  pp. 22 and 23-25)Since I spoke those words in this Assembly  there hasbeen little action by the developed nations to help alterthese conditions in my country. Indeed  they have donelittle in the Caribbean as a whole. If anything  the terms ofour involvement in international economic relations haveworsened as prices for our commodities have decreased  thecosts of our imports have increased and our access topreferential markets has diminished. At the same time  ourcalls on the conscience of the rich countries to be mindfulof the conditions that fracture the economic and politicalstructures of our society seem to fall upon deaf ears. Thisbody knows well that the targets set within the UnitedNations itself for official development assistance are met byonly a handful of nations.Today the Caribbean subregion occupies theattention of the international community because of eventsin Haiti. Eleven years ago it was events in Grenada thatcatapulted the Caribbean into the consciousness of globalconcern. In both cases what drove our subregion onto theagenda of international deliberation was not a remedy forthe conditions that precipitated crises in these countries but a desire by some to curtail a threat to securityinterests — security interests that were defined  in largemeasure  by their own domestic considerations. It seemsthat unless the Caribbean is perceived to pose a threat tolarger and more powerful States  we remain no morethan  on the one hand  picture postcards of white sandbeaches and swaying coconut trees  an idyllic playgroundfor tourists  and  on the other  a forgotten backwater ofhuman and economic underdevelopment as represented bythe world-wide television pictures of today’s Haiti.Year in  year out  the underlying problems thatafflict our economic and human condition and that lendthemselves to the crises that we witnessed 11 years agoin Grenada and are witnessing today in Haiti go unnoticedand unattended. Yet in eight months’ time we will markthe fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the UnitedNations Charter  a Charter that proclaimed that we aredetermined“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  inthe dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand small  and ... to promote social progress andbetter standards of life in larger freedom.”But can this body truly say that in almost 50 yearsit has overseen the promotion of social progress andbetter standards of life of nations large and small?Between 1980 and 1988 real gross domestic product perperson in Latin America and the Caribbean steadily fellby an annual average of 0.9 percent. In some States realincome dropped by as much as one quarter during the1980s. With very few exceptions  most countries nowhave per capita gross domestic products lower than thoseof a decade or even two decades earlier.Despite this decline in real gross domestic product many countries in our region are forced to repay debt thatis wrapped tightly around their necks  strangling theirefforts to breathe life into their economies. Mark you this is debt that they have repaid many times over if theonerous interest rates are discounted. Yet they are ableto see little reduction in the sum of the debt. In themeantime  the massive haemorrhage of foreign exchange15occasioned by this intractable debt burden seriouslyhampers the long-term social and economic prospects forsome of our States.For example  debt servicing in the case of Jamaica isbetween 14 per cent and 16 per cent of export earnings; arecent World Bank report suggests that 70 per cent ofGovernment revenue in Guyana will be consumed this yearby debt servicing repayments while as much as 43 per centof the population lives in poverty. In my own country’scase  debt has been incurred by the Government acting asa catalyst for economic development in the absence ofsufficient official development assistance or privateinvestment flows despite generous incentives. Our arrearshave been rising even with debt repayment and now amountto more than $200 million.This burden of debt upon small countries calls for achange in the rules of the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and the World Bank to allow for the forgiveness ofdebt. It also urges a relaxation by Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countriesin particular of their position on bilateral debt. If ourcountries are to maintain political stability and promoteeconomic progress  we need relief from the great burdenthat debt places upon us.It is significant that  as the IMF and World Bank markthe fiftieth anniversary of their establishment this week private aid agencies  led by the Oxford Committee forFamine Relief (Oxfam)  have accused them of underminingthe relief of poverty  of making people poorer and givingshort-term economic aims  such as the reduction ofinflation  higher priority than the reduction of poverty.Only a few would today deny the need for drasticreform or the dismantling of State bureaucracies in favourof private investment and more open economies  but thestructural adjustment which this entails should do more thanpay lip-service to the challenges of providing bettereducation and health facilities in developing countries. Themultilateral financial institutions  and the major Powerswhich control them  must become less ideologicallyinflexible and more alert to the deleterious effect of someof their policies on poor States.It is a startlingly telling measure of the widedivergence of views between developed and developingcountries that this week developing countries rejected outof hand a proposal by major Powers in the IMF on ways toincrease world monetary reserves.There is an urgent need for urgent  meaningful andsincere dialogue between representatives of the rich andpoor nations to bridge this gap in consultation andconsensus-building. If such a dialogue does not begin and begin soon  we may well witness a stand-off inrelations that will paralyse economic cooperation andprogress on a global scale.I urge that within the institutions of the Organizationitself — specifically within the Economic and SocialCouncil and the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) — such a dialogue shouldbegin with the resolve of reaching a practical programmeon which both rich and poor have agreed.If the Organization and its Member States fails to actto promote such a dialogue I fear that it will reinforce theview that the United Nations is captive to the dictates ofthe rich  and powerless to respond to the needs of thepoor.We in the developing countries of the Caribbeanurgently need to develop our human stock and to widenthe space of economic opportunity; to provide more ofour young people with better education; to providefacilities that will keep our populations healthy andproductive; to provide incomes that will encourage ourpeople to save and to convert such savings into low-interest loans for productive enterprise; and to concentrateon exports and undertakings such as tourism to earnforeign exchange.If we are to tackle this task effectively  the yoke ofdebt in particular must be eased from our backs. It is notbeyond the international community to set standards toachieve both repayment of debt and an easing of theburden of such repayment. To do so  two standardsshould be set. The first is on the extent of forgiveness ofexisting debt.Debt forgiveness should be a minimum of 50 percent of existing debt  the original principal of which  asI pointed out earlier  has long been repaid. Forgivenessof 50 per cent of debt is the only figure that makes anysense. A lower percentage would simply make realisticrepayment unachievable unless we were to impoverish ourcountries even further.Secondly  the international community should alsoestablish a standard to set a fixed percentage of exportrevenue for the repayment of debt. Without a standard indebted countries will face the prospect of worsening16poverty for decades to come. We should recall that theprecedent of debt forgiveness was set by two members ofthe Security Council  Britain and the United States. In1946 the terms of a large United States loan to war-tornBritain stipulated that interest should be waived altogethershould such interest exceed 2 per cent of British exportrevenues in any given year. That standard helped Britainto survive. We ask for no more.Worsening poverty has grave implications fordevelopment and democracy in our region — implicationswhich  in the long term  may cost the multilateral financialinstitutions and their wealthier members more than the debtthey could forgive  or cause to be forgiven  in the shortterm.Among these implications is the problem of refugees.We should recall that apart from large-scale violence difficult economic circumstances are what creates refugees.Refugees are not only those people who clamber on boardboats and take to the open sea hoping to reach anaccommodating shore where economic conditions are better.They are also people  many highly qualified  whoreluctantly leave their homelands  illegally settling in othercountries in search of jobs and better living conditions.The migration of such people causes problems both for thecountries from which they move and the countries whichreceive them. In the case of the receiving countries increasing numbers lead to destabilizing immigrationpressures  particularly in inner cities. For the sendingcountries vital skills are lost  skills that could contribute tothe social and economic development of the sendingcountries.Even at its summit meeting in January 1992  theSecurity Council acknowledged that threats to internationalpeace and security can come from“non-military sources of instability in the economic social  humanitarian and ecological fields”. (S/23500 p.3)In this regard  preventive measures need to be taken by theinternational community  led by this Organization  tomitigate root causes of emigration. Among such preventivemeasures must be action to guarantee stability in developingcountries.We in Latin America and the Caribbean are not simplysitting on our hands in the expectation that our fortunes willsomehow be dramatically altered by a sudden change ofheart on the part of the richer States of the world. Withinthe Caribbean subregion  the member States of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are working atdeepening our integration arrangements to explore waysin which we can strengthen our economies by our ownefforts. The measures we have adopted  such as acommon external tariff and open markets  have beendifficult for some of us in the short term  but we havetaken the medicine  bitter though it is  in the expectationthat in the medium to long term we will have created astronger subregional economy  one capable of sustainingus all. We have also looked beyond the insular Caribbeanto the wider Caribbean  including every country of thelittoral.I am proud to say that on 24 July this year  25States of the Latin America and the Caribbean regionestablished the Association of Caribbean States (ACS).Its objectives are economic integration and the creation ofan enhanced space for free trade and cooperation amongthe countries of the Caribbean. We expect that one of themajor benefits of the ACS will be the promotion of theinterests of our grouping in international economic andtrade forums. These actions  which we ourselves aretaking  are part of the set of preventive measures toguarantee stability in our region.It is a tribute to the commitment of the people of theCaribbean to the processes of democracy that we have notwitnessed greater upheaval and that in 11 years theUnited Nations has had only two new crises from oursubregion with which to deal. The internationalcommunity should not assume  however  that the crisis inHaiti arose only from internal factors. Much of itsgenesis resides in the attitude of major international actorsmotivated by their own domestic concerns.Haiti’s independence in 1804  born of the uprising ofblack slaves against the colonial Power  caused it to beostracized from the world community. When ToussaintLouverture led his successful revolt  Haiti was the richestcolony in the world  producing more and trading morewith Europe and the United States than the rest of theCaribbean colonies combined. But the hostileinternational environment in which it was born reduced itfrom the richest colony in the world to the poorest nationin the Western Hemisphere.The price for its limited participation in internationaltrade was an agreement in 1825 to pay its former colonialmaster an indemnity of 150 million gold francs in sixannual instalments. As the respected historian and former17Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago  Mr. Eric Williams put it “Thus was imposed on the infant independent State aheavy financial burden which effectively crippleddevelopment of its social services.”Since then  international actors have continued toinfluence events in Haiti  accommodating in their owninterests dictatorial regimes and military Governments andignoring the country’s growing poverty and the utterdisregard for human rights. Is it any wonder that Haitiansrisked their lives in the most dangerous conditions on theopen sea to become refugees?In this context  let me digress for a moment to takethe opportunity to call upon the United States and Cuba toopen a dialogue to end the impasse that has characterizedtheir relationship for the past 30 years  threatening thestability of Latin America and the Caribbean. Recentlythose two countries demonstrated in this very city theircapacity to sit at the table of peace and negotiate anagreement to end the movement of so-called refugees fromCuba to the United States. Surely the capacity to reachsuch an agreement shows that other agreements arepossible. The willingness of the United States and Cuba toact now in their own interest would avert not only thecontinued hardship the Cuban people endure  but wouldeliminate any perception of threats to their individualsecurity and the security of our region as a whole.My small country agreed to provide a safe haven forHaitian refugees  just as we agreed to contribute one eighthof our small military force to the multinational expeditionauthorized by Security Council resolution 940 (1994). Wedid so out of genuine concern for the lives of manythousands of Haitian people. We did so because we wantedto see an end to their suffering. We did so because wewanted to stamp out the cancer of dictatorship and humanrights abuse in our subregion. As it turned out  ourmotivation to bring order and justice to Haiti coincided withthe motivation of others who have the resources to committo the military undertaking  which became imperative afterdiplomatic efforts  especially by representatives of theUnited Nations itself  had been fully exhausted.But while Antigua and Barbuda supports the objectivesof Security Council resolution 940 (1994) and the use offorce contemplated in it to remove the Cédras regime inHaiti  I am still troubled by the increasing resort to ChapterVII of the Charter as a basis for acting to end conflictswithin a State. Since the end of the cold war the SecurityCouncil has had to invoke Chapter VII  which providesfor “Action with respect to threats to the peace  breachesof the peace  and acts of aggression”  in relation to Iraq Liberia  Somalia  the former Yugoslavia and  now  Haiti.In each of the countries where the Security Counciltook action  there was clearly a need for humanitarianintervention. My Government supports the growing bodyof opinion that holds that the international communitymust not remain a passive spectator when Governmentsmassacre their own people or cause them to starve. Insuch cases the United Nations must act  and should beallowed to do so under the Charter  without having toresort to Chapter VII.Therefore  it is my view that the nations of theworld should amend the Charter of the Organization toconfer power on the United Nations to intervene in caseswhere humanitarian intervention is warranted. But indoing so they absolutely must balance safeguardinghuman rights with protecting a State’s right to autonomy.We must all be mindful that respect for State sovereigntyis a fundamental cornerstone of the international legalorder. Intervention for humanitarian purposes must notbe capable of use for violating the sovereignty of Statesin pursuit of the interests of any member of the SecurityCouncil.As co-Chairman of the Commission on UniversalGovernance  Sir Shridath Ramphal said recently:“An activist United Nations will not long survive asa legitimate andeffective actor if it is used simply asa cover for the intervention of major Powers.Intervention should follow principled criteria andshould be consistent and even-handed. Above all intervention should not be unduly influenced  muchless determined  by the interests or domestic politicalagendas of powerful nations acting within a regionor globally.”In this connection  and particularly if we pursue thenotion of amending the Charter to provide for UnitedNations-authorized humanitarian intervention  themembership of the Security Council itself must berevisited to change the anachronistic nature of the Counciland make it more representative of the nations of theworld.No State or group of States can proclaim theoverarching importance of democracy  nor can any nationor group of States claim to intervene in another State in18the interest of upholding democracy  if that nation or groupof States is unwilling to democratize the Security Councilitself. The time has come to move away from theanachronism of five permanent members and to establisharrangements which are capable of change with the passageof time and the evolution of events. The time has come forequity for all nations — large and small — in themembership of the Council.I return now to the point at which I started — the rolethat the United Nations has played in the almost 50 yearssince the Charter was signed “to promote social progressand better standards of life in larger freedom”.For much of its existence the Organization washampered by the cold war and the struggle for supremacybetween the major Powers. Witnessing events andresponding to them through this prism of cold-war rivalry the United Nations has not been as effective as it couldhave been in defining a world  strong in the pursuit of orderand justice  where States could live in peace and the rule oflaw would replace the law of the jungle.During the greater part of the life of the UnitedNations  the strong have dictated to the feeble  the big tothe small  the mighty to the weak. While there has beenorder  it has been without justice and without equity. Inthis context  while the United Nations has been a symbol ofhope for people from small countries such as mine  muchremains for it to do before it can represent to them anorganization which champions their dignity and worth ashuman beings  which upholds the rights of their smallnations  which promotes their social progress and betterstandards of life.As the United Nations approaches its fiftiethanniversary no longer shackled by the cold-war rivalry ofthe major Powers as it looks to the future  it has anextraordinary opportunity to fulfil the aspirations of theCharter which have so long remained mere words. Indoing so  it can advance the interests of all mankind byproviding a meaningful forum for genuine dialogue betweenthe rich and poor for the establishment of conditions fordevelopment  and thus  for peace.As the Secretary-General has himself pointed out:“It must be remembered that the sources ofconflict and war are pervasive and deep. Politicalstability is not an end in itself; it is a prerequisite foreconomic and social development. The inseparablelinks between peace and development must beacknowledged and fully understood because thedeterioration of economic and social conditions cangive root to divisive political strife and militaryconflict.”The end of the cold war should encourage areformed  refreshed and representative Security Councilto look beyond conventional security to security born ofpolitical stability and economic progress for all nations —large and small. My own small country is willing to doits part. It is my hope that the larger  richer and morepowerful States Members of this Organization canrecognize the need — and act on it — to applydemocratic principles to their relations with poor Statesby contributing to the creation of a world free from thethreat of military and economic pressure  a world strongin the pursuit of equity and justice for all  a world inwhich the United Nations is cast in a pivotal role as apowerful mediator for good in the interest of all mankind."
"9",330,"AUS",49,1994,"I warmly congratulate you  Your Excellency Minister Essy  on your election as President of the General Assembly at this forty-ninth session. Australia is very pleased to serve in the Assembly under your presidency and looks forward to relying on your wisdom and your experience as you preside over our deliberations.The last year has provided its full measure of challenges for the United Nations. The hopes for a new era of peace  after the decades of sterile confrontation between the super-Powers  seem not much closer to being realized. In Southern Africa and the Middle East  there have been remarkable advances in solving some of the world's most intractable problems  but they stand in contrast to the nightmarish conflicts of Bosnia  Somalia and Rwanda. These are only the latest  and most prominent  of a long string of deadly conflicts within State borders  tearing existing States apart and far exceeding the threats to peace posed by conflict between States. These intra-State conflicts have been marked by extreme savagery  each day offering new evidence of how cruel and dangerous a place the world remains for so many of its people.The combined impact of a number of these conflicts has had a corrosive effect on the standing of the United Nations. Pictures of Blue Helmets standing by  unable to prevent conflict and impotent to save life  have become a media cliche. The role that the United Nations system has continued to play in its economic  social and humanitarian work  in responding to the ""silent emergencies"" of poverty and deprivation  has been overshadowed by the public image of an organization failing to meet its responsibilities and unequal to the challenges. Some of this imagery is deeply unfair  failing to take account of the innumerable constraints under which the United Nations operates - and in particular failing to acknowledge that  at the end of the day  the United Nations can do no more than what its Member States allow it to do  or give it the resources to do.But the underlying reality is that the United Nations  and we Member States that make it up  have not yet developed a clear and confident sense of the United Nations own role in the new environment with which we are confronted - where the most common source of conflict is no longer disputes between States  but explosive conflict within States  more often than not expressed in the form of competing ethno-nationalist or religious claims.Of course ethnic or religious difference is not  by itself  a recipe for conflict within States. Australia is just one example  among many  of a highly successful multi-ethnic  multicultural society in which tolerance and peace prevail. For ethnic or religious differences or competing nationalist aspirations to deteriorate into deadly conflict  something more is necessary. And almost invariably that something has been a failure of Governments to deliver basic needs and to satisfy the most basic aspirations of their citizens. In almost every case of major intra-State conflict of recent times  from the formerSoviet republics to Rwanda  ethnic and religious conflict has been associated with declining per capita gross national product  the rise of demagogic politics  and the collapse of effective  responsible government.All this means that it is no longer possible  in the post-cold-war era  for the international community simply to ignore  as it largely did in the past  conflict occurring within State borders which does not significantly impact on other States. The compartmentalization which existed through the cold war years - in which peace and security issues  development issues  and human rights and justice issues were treated as being in completely different conceptual and institutional boxes - no longer seems adequate to deal with the real world distress that so many people are suffering. Basic economic needs  let alone the needs of individuals and groups for dignity and liberty  cannot begin to be met in environments where nobody's personal security can be guaranteed. And that means  in turn  that the international community cannot simply turn away from being involved in protecting human security in many of those situations which might previously have been regarded as wholly internal in character.This truth has  of course  already been recognized to the extent that the United Nations has become involved in essentially intra-State conflicts in Bosnia  Somalia  Rwanda and Haiti. But for the most part that involvement has been hesitant  half-hearted  lacking in confidence  worried about its rationale  too little  and too late. We have now to reach out boldly and try to recapture some of the original vision built into the stated aims of the Charter. We have to reintegrate the relationship among the three basic objectives of peace  meeting the need for security; development  meeting economic needs; and human rights and justice  meeting the needs for individual and group dignity and liberty.The distinction between peace and security on the one hand and development on the other has too often been a matter for sterile and unhelpful debate  with attempts to trade off one for the other as key goals for the United Nations. Any viable modern concept of international peace  let alone peace within States  must recognize that the two are indissolubly bound up with each other: there can be no sustainable peace without development  and no development without peace.In this context  Australia warmly welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts in producing An Agenda for Development which  following on as it does from An Agenda for Peace  fully recognizes the relationship between peace and development  acknowledging that equitable development eradicates many of the socio-political conditions in which threats to peace breed. It places an entirely appropriate emphasis on individual human beings as the end object and beneficiaries of our developmental efforts. This concept of course  in various guises  lies behind most of the international community's key ideas about development in recent years  including ""adjustment with a human face""  ""human development"" and  most recently  ""human security"". I must also applaud the focus which the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security  for example in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance  effective governance and all the social issues which form the agenda of the world social summit.A more integrated effort will clearly be required of the United Nations system if the objectives set out in An Agenda for Development are to be achieved. It is imperative that we improve the system's ability to develop and implement social and economic development programmes in a more coordinated and coherent manner  including by finding ways to allow the Bretton Woods institutions and United Nations bodies to work in closer harmony. An example of a more systematic approach that the United Nations system might be able to adopt is the recent package of reforms undertaken by the Economic and Social Council. The new approach to operational activities  and the joint programme which the Economic and Social Council agreed to earlier this year to tackle the health and development impacts of the HIV/AIDS pandemic  demonstrate the achievements that are possible through such reform.But more will be required than this  including changes in the senior decision-making structure of the UnitedNations Secretariat. Considerable reform in the intergovernmental elements of the United Nations system has been achieved and is being worked out  but the same is not true of the Secretariat itself. Notwithstanding some welcome recent changes  including in particular the designation by the Secretary-General of a special adviser on operational activities  I believe that there continues to be a strong case for creating a new working collegiate executive of four Deputy Secretary-Generals to work with the Secretary-General - responsible respectively for economic and social affairs  peace and security affairs  humanitarian affairs and administration and management.A key source of threats to national and international security lies in unsustainable patterns of consumption and exploitation of resources. High population growth and competition for resources have been contributing factors in several of the recent crises involving the United Nations  including Rwanda and Somalia  and competition over scarce water resources is a potential cause of conflict in a number of regions. Such threats demonstrate how important it is  in security terms  for the United Nations to strengthen its ability to deal with development issues. The international community has developed a significant body of international laws  norms  agreements and arrangements for the rational and cooperative management of scarce resources. The United Nations system needs to ensure that it takes timely  effective and coordinated action to help implement this framework and the programmes for action agreed on at recent global conferences. The outcome of last month's Cairo Conference has provided a blueprint to address problems of population and development  acknowledging the central role of women in the development process.For its part  the Commission on Sustainable Development must develop a genuine capacity to monitor the implementation of Agenda 21  using its political influence to bring about an observable difference in approaches to environment and development. We also attach particular importance to early implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in Barbados in May this year. No less important has been the entry into force of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The adoption in June 1994 of the new Agreement implementing Part XI of the Convention secures a widely accepted legal order for the world's oceans  and provides  in effect  a common language for interaction between States on matters affecting two thirds of the world's surface.From the outset of the establishment of the United Nations  the international community has acknowledged human rights as a central and legitimate subject of international attention. For many years  however  and notwithstanding the system of international human rights treaties  this attention carried with it the ideological baggage of the cold war and was too often marked by confrontation and recrimination. In recent years the international community has begun to develop more cooperative and potentially more effective ways of promoting better observance of human rights standards.These include the creation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  the promotion of national and regional human rights bodies and improved technical assistance. They also include a welcome reaffirmation in Vienna last year of the indivisibility of all human rights - economic  social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights - in developing a base for positive change. And they include the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal to try violations of humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. A further important specific step that Australia believes should be taken in this direction is the creation of a permanent international criminal court  to deal with gross violations of international criminal law wherever they might occur.Human rights observance has its own profound significance for peace and security. The drafters of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized this connection. The international community has clear obligations under the Charter to protect basic human rights  and the most basic freedom of all - the right to life - is directly dependent on the maintenance of peace. We must be prepared to accept a wider application of the notion of security as it appears in the Charter  recognizing that security in the post-cold-war era has as much to do with the protection of individuals - guaranteeing human security - as it has to do with State security - the defence of national borders.Human security  in this view  is as much if not more threatened by intra-State conflict as it is by conflict between States  and intra-State conflict is as much a concern of the United Nations as is international conflict. The experience of the last few years underlines the lesson that a State whose Government systematically disregards human rights  ignores the rule of law and fails to strive for equitable development and distributive justice is a State showing clear signs of heading towards breakdown and civil strife. To try to anticipate with appropriate preventive strategies that breakdown and conflict is  for the United Nations system  not to go beyond its Charter mandate  but to fully realize it.The international community has traditionally talked about security in almost wholly military terms. In a United Nations context  collective security has meant Member States renouncing the use of force against each other and agreeing to come to the aid of a Member when it is attacked. Even the more recent  and very welcome  focus on the concept of common security has been premised on the idea that States will be more secure militarily with defence strategies that are aimed at building security with others rather than against others.If the international community is to respond fully and effectively to the new challenges of the post-cold-war era  this perspective has to be broadened. One way to do that is to talk  as many are now doing  in terms of comprehensive security  which conveys the important idea that security is multidimensional in character  demanding attention not only to political and diplomatic disputes but to economic underdevelopment  trade disputes  human- rights abuses and the like.But Australia's preference - as I spelled out last year in addressing this Assembly  when I launched the so- called Blue Book  Cooperating for Peace - is to describe our shared objective as cooperative security. The term cooperative security is designed to embrace and capture the essence of all those three other ideas: collective  common and comprehensive security. It is designed to shift the focus away from traditional  defensive  State-centred thinking  and at the same time to convey the flavour of consultation rather than confrontation  reassurance rather than deterrence  transparency rather than secrecy  prevention rather than correction  and interdependence rather than unilateralism.Cooperative security in practice means a whole range of different strategies designed both to prevent and to resolve conflict  certainly including the traditional United Nations roles of peace-keeping and peace enforcement. But the strategies that I want particularly to emphasize today are those at the preventive end of the response spectrum  in particular peace-building and preventive diplomacy.As the idea of peace building has been developed by the Secretary General in An Agenda for Peace and in An Agenda for Development  it has largely been restricted to the situations of post-conflict economic and institutional restoration within countries. Australia's view is that while that is a very important element of the idea it is unduly restrictive  and that the concept of peace-building should assume a much more prominent place in our thinking about the international community's role and responsibilities.We see peace-building as describing the whole range of strategies designed to address basic and underlying causes of disputes and conflicts: strategies aimed at ensuring that they do not arise in the first place  or that if they do arise  they do not subsequently recur. Those strategies are applicable at both intra-State and international levels. At the international level we are talking essentially about various regimes and arrangements designed to minimize threats to security  to promote confidence and trust and to create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation  especially through arms control and disarmament treaties; legal regimes such as those on maritime passage and the status of refugees; dispute- resolution mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice; and multilateral dialogue forums  such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) or the new regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the in-country level  peace- building essentially involves strategies to encourage economic development  ensure the observance of human rights  broadly defined  and to facilitate good governance.So perceived  peace-building lies right at the interface between the United Nations agendas for peace and for development. Peace-building activity is already occurring in a great many ways and in a great many places. The attention being given to environment  resource and population issues  the higher profile being accorded to human-rights protection and the significant progress being made on many disarmament issues are all manifestations of this at the general international level. And more attention is being given to democratization and institution-building strategies  as well as economic ones  for particular countries where effective governance has broken down  or seems about to.What is really necessary is that more of this activity be integrated and coordinated within the United Nations system  that activities now being pursued in isolation and without any overriding sense of common purpose be better linked together. If we are to get peace  development and human rights objectives better synchronized  then some institutional changes are necessary. A good start may be to vest responsibility for developing and coordinating peace- building strategies in the position of deputy secretary-general for humanitarian affairs  a position which I suggested earlier should be created.Whatever the achievability of peace-building international regimes in other areas  the end of the cold war has certainly opened up for the international community exciting new possibilities to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and destabilizing conventional-arms races. There is now  for example  an historic opportunity to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The decision by most of the nuclear-weapon States to maintain moratoriums on testing has made a major contribution to an improved negotiating atmosphere in the Conference on Disarmament. Australia very much hopes that the People's Republic of China will play its part in bringing those negotiations to a conclusion by likewise abstaining from further tests. Agreement on a comprehensive test ban will also have a significant impact on the achievement of nuclear disarmament  and especially nuclear non-proliferation  objectives. Australia urges all members of the Conference on Disarmament to seize this opportunity  which may not present itself again  to conclude the test-ban treaty as soon as possible.A further vital contribution to nuclear disarmament would be made by the negotiation of a cut-off convention. Australia hopes that all members of the Conference on Disarmament will support the efforts of the Canadian coordinator and agree to a negotiating mandate by the beginning of the 1995 session.Underlying all the efforts by the international community over the past 25 years to stem the spread of nuclear weapons has been the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT remains the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Its success is reflected in this phenomenon: the general expectation in the 1960s was that the world would have as many as 25 nuclear-weapon States by the 1980s  but instead  160 countries have now acceded to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States  leaving only a handful outside the Treaty framework. The peaceful-use assurances derived from the Treaty and from the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency have laid the foundation for very valuable international cooperation in fields such as nuclear power generation  nuclear medicine and agricultural and scientific applications of nuclear energy. In addition  the NPT incorporates the only commitment from the five nuclear-weapon States to complete nuclear disarmament. The cause of complete nuclear disarmament  whichAustralia fully supports  is moving in the right direction  but it is clear that more needs to be done by the nuclear- weapon States if the pace is to be maintained.A decision to be made on extending the Treaty at the NPT Review Conference next year will allow us to secure its benefits in perpetuity. This is an opportunity we must grasp to shape a world in which our collective commitment to nuclear non-proliferation  and to a world free of nuclear weapons  can be realized. Indefinite extension of the Treaty will create an environment in which the pressures for continued nuclear disarmament will be maximized  in which nuclear proliferation will best be prevented  in which trade and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can best be maintained  and in which the goal of universal membership of the Treaty can best be reached.The pace of chemical- and biological-weapons disarmament continues to be encouraging. Progress is being made in preparing for implementation of the chemical-weapons Convention  and the recent Special Conference's decision to develop verification measures to strengthen the biological-weapons Convention is also very welcome. All members of the global community will benefit  in both security and trade and development terms  from the bans on these entire categories of weapons of mass destruction which will be put in place by the effective operation of both these Treaties.In our efforts to prevent the further spread of weapons of mass destruction  we should not lose sight of the need to control conventional weaponry. Conventional weapons continue to be responsible for the overwhelming majority of the fatalities and casualties in contemporary armed conflict. In this area  the United Nations has taken an important first step in creating the Register of Conventional Arms  although I must note Australia's disappointment at the failure of its Expert Group to agree to expand the Register beyond transfers to cover productions and holdings. It is  however  most important that all States support this initial international exercise in the transparency of conventional weaponry by providing as much information as possible in their returns.There is also a compelling need to strengthen the inhumane weapons Convention and  in particular  to extend further control over the use of  and trade in  land-mines  given the appalling and indiscriminate injuries caused to civilian populations often long after conflicts cease.One of the most crucial elements in any functioning system of cooperative security is an effective capacity for preventive diplomacy. Australia is convinced that the United Nations can and should do more in this respect to prevent disputes escalating into armed conflict  and to this effect we propose to introduce a draft resolution on enhancing preventive diplomacy at the current session of the General Assembly.We believe that there is widespread support for the United Nations to build stronger preventive diplomacy machinery and to develop the capacity foreseen by its founders and articulated in Article 33 to operate as an active agent in the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Organization would be able to operate more effectively in this area if it gave its staff additional skills in dispute resolution and conflict management. We commend its efforts to do so through the fellowship course of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and we will continue to provide our backing for that training. We propose that the United Nations develop a dispute resolution service within its Secretariat. We advocate strengthening the Department of Political Affairs and increasing coordination  information-sharing and early- warning capacity among and between the various elements of the United Nations system. Greater use should also be made of the resources of Member States and stronger linkages forged with regional security arrangements.Such regional organizations and arrangements themselves can play a most useful role. We should not have unrealistic expectations of them because most cannot match the capacity of global bodies to marshal resources for peace-building or  at the other end of the scale  for military responses to crises. They nevertheless offer a way of bringing together the parties to disputes in a constructive and non-confrontational framework. We welcome recent developments to strengthen regional approaches  in particular the recent inaugural meeting of the Regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  with its evident willingness to develop preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region. We hope that others will share our interest in exploring the scope for establishing regional peace and security resource centres - to advance these objectives under the banner of regional organizations or the United Nations itself  or both.We welcome the steps taken by the United Nations Secretary-General to strengthen the United Nations links with regional organizations. In relation to one such important organization in Australia's own part of the world  we welcome the strong support given by MemberStates for the application made by the South Pacific Forum for Observer status in the General Assembly  itself a response to the Secretary-General's invitation to consider ways of further improving the coordination of the efforts of regional bodies with those of the United Nations. Australia also welcomes the regional peace-keeping exercise under way to assist Papua New Guinea achieve a peaceful resolution of the situation in Bougainville  and the Secretary-General's expression of support for that exercise.There is no use talking about reintegrating the United Nations or reshaping its responsibilities unless the resources are there to carry out these responsibilities. The central responsibility of Member States in this respect is to set to rights the Organization's current financial problems. Australia urges  in the strongest terms we can  all Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time as a matter of obligation under the Charter.We believe that the United Nations should look carefully at strengthening measures to encourage the prompt payment of contributions. We could  for example  explore the possibility of charging interest on overdue payments or applying Article 19 of the Charter to provide for only a 24- month grace period before voting rights are lost. We believe also that present budgetary systems could well be improved  in particular those involved with the financing of peace-keeping operations. We hope that  at a minimum  this General Assembly will be able to agree on some practical steps to move towards a sounder basis for such funding. Modern management practices  including a personnel policy more clearly based on merit  need to be adopted.Measures such as these  while valuable  are unlikely to be sufficient in themselves to meet the financial demands which will be placed on the United Nations by its new agenda. The time has come to look at more innovative approaches to raising funds. One possibility which should be examined more seriously than hitherto  notwithstanding the complexities and sensitivities involved  is the application of levies on certain kinds of international transactions  such as air travel or foreign exchange  the capacity to carry on which depends on the existence of stability between States  to which the United Nations in turn makes a major contribution. An international levy on such transactions would be an equitable way of putting a price on an important public good. And the amounts involved are very large. The total value of global foreign exchange turnover  for example  is expected to amount to over $300 trillion next year. A levy on these transactions of only 0.01 per cent  if it could be collected  would yield over $30 billion. A flat-rate $10 added to the price of air tickets for each international sector travelled would yield $3 billion  nearly enough to cover all United Nations peace-keeping activities last year.Whatever the funding strategy adopted  the financial burden on the United Nations system and the international community could be greatly reduced by putting a greater emphasis on preventive approaches to problem solving. It is very clear that prevention is far more cost-effective in the longer term than our current pattern of responding to problems  if at all  only after crisis points have been reached.If the United Nations decision-making bodies are to have legitimacy and guaranteed international support in responding to the range of new and difficult situations with which the international community is now being confronted - particularly deadly conflicts and massive human rights violations occurring within States - they must be representative of the broad range of interests and perspectives of United Nations Member States. This is a key reason why enlargement of the Security Council's membership is a pressing concern for this General Assembly. It should be said  at the same time  that the Security Council's legitimacy will ultimately depend  not just on its representativeness  but upon the quality of its performance  and in that context it will be very important that the Assembly apply very rigorously the criteria and qualifications for Security Council membership elaborated in Article 23 of the Charter.The model that would most simply meet the legitimate aspirations of the largest States excluded at present from permanent membership of the Security Council - including Japan and Germany  whose claims we support - would involve the creation of five new permanent membership seats. Assuming the continuation of the existing regional groups  three new permanent members would come from Africa and Asia  one from the Western European and Other States Group  and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. Australia would prefer not to extend the veto to any new permanent member. At the same time  we believe it would be appropriate slightly to dilute the veto power of the existing five permanent members by requiring two from their number to concur in its exercise.If - as seems not impossible - agreement on a simple model of this kind proves not easily reachable  it may be worth giving consideration to a more complex alternative model. We have in mind one which would no doubt in practice guarantee effective permanency for the largest States currently excluded from the Council  including Japan and Germany. But it would at the same time give a greater degree of flexibility to the Council's structure and greater opportunities for the recognition of several other countries which have made a major contribution to the Organization. It might  for those reasons  be a model capable of commanding more widespread support.This alternative model would involve  in addition to the five existing permanent members - whose veto power would again be slightly diluted  as already outlined - the creation of eight quasi-permanent seats allocated among regional groups for which consecutive re-election would be possible  together with 10 rotating non-permanent seats as at present. It would make abundant sense  in our view  for the existing regional groups to be at the same time modified to reflect post-cold-war realities. A suggested way in which these 23 seats might be distributed among such a new set of regional groups is set out in the table attached to the circulated text of this statement; that table also sets out the way in which the seats might be distributed among the existing groups. On this model  the question which States became quasi-permanent members and how long they remained on the Council in that capacity would be a matter for determination by the regional group in question.Consequential amendments would be required to Article 23 and Article 108 of the Charter  and the opportunity should  of course  be taken at the same time to remove the anachronistic enemy States clauses. An accompanying General Assembly resolution could elaborate any new regional-group arrangements.It is  of course  the case that any change to Security Council membership is fraught with complexity and difficulty. But if we are ever to move from the stage of generalized discussion to concrete negotiations  it is necessary to put some quite specific and comprehensive proposals on the table. I certainly do not suggest that the models I have just advanced are the only possible approaches  but I do strongly suggest that the time is now ripe for us to commence such negotiation. I believe that others share our determination to move in a spirit of good will and conscientiousness to see to it that the United Nations of the next 50 years is soundly built; and an expanded  newly legitimized Security Council is a crucial foundation in this respect.Australia wants the United Nations  over the next 50 years  to be an active and effective agent for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We want it to be a catalyst for international peace-building  working to strengthen international law  control and reverse arms races  promote confidence and dialogue between States and address underlying causes of instability  including internal conflict. We want the United Nations to promote  in more effective coordination with the major international economic and financial institutions  equitable and sustainable development and to coordinate responses to humanitarian crises. We want it to emerge even more strongly as a promoter of universal standards of human rights and their respect by Governments. We want the United Nations to pursue its objectives of peace  development and human rights in an integrated  coordinated way  with these objectives complementing  rather than being in competition with  each other. And we want it to be an Organization assured of the wholehearted backing of its Member States and provided by them with all the financial resources it requires to meet its obligations.In short  we want the United Nations to become the Organization which was envisaged in its Charter. One of the priority objectives of our candidacy for election to the Security Council for 1997-1998 is to help in the building of such a United Nations. We believe we have valuable contributions to bring to this task  and we look forward to working closely with all our fellow Members in the shaping of a United Nations fully capable of meeting the needs and expectations of all of us in the international community over the next 50 years."
"10",377,"AUT",49,1994,"Allow me to congratulate the President sincerely on hiselection to preside over the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly. I am particularly pleased to see arepresentative of a French-speaking African country occupythis important position. We trust that the forty-ninthsession will  under his enlightened leadership  pay specialattention to the political  economic and social problemsfacing his continent  so sorely tried over these last fewyears.Next year the United Nations will celebrate itsfiftieth anniversary with a series of activities throughoutthe world. The image of the United Nations in the eyesof world public opinion will depend largely on its status on the extent to which it has remained faithful  50 yearsafter its founding  to the principles of the San FranciscoCharter  which are still valid.I believe it must be a priority to strengthen the worldOrganization in the spirit of Article 1 of the Charter  sothat it can effectively carry out its mission of maintaininginternational peace and security. Let us also recall herethe words of the great philosopher  Sir Karl Popper recently deceased  who wrote: ""Our primary objectivemust be peace. But we must not hesitate to wage war forpeace."" We have given the United Nations theresponsibility of deciding when to use force to preservepeace. This weighty responsibility has to be exercisedwhen necessary.The Security Council is of paramount importance inpreserving peace in the world. In order to maintain andstrengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of the SecurityCouncil  Austria advocates a slight increase in itsmembership. Every Member of the United Nations mustbe able to see and understand how views develop withinthat body. They must all be able to feel sure thatdiscussions in the Council take account of the views ofinterested countries  for example  countries contributingtroops for peace-keeping operations.The importance of the United Nations must bepreserved and developed  not only as a system for themaintenance of international peace and security  but alsoas a forum for discussion and an instrument forcoordination at the global level. On the first point  muchremains to be done. In the social and economic sphereand in the field of development  important progress hasbeen made  notably with the reform of the Economic andSocial Council  which has permitted better guidance ofoperational activities for development.A solid financial basis is absolutely vital to theeffective discharge of the United Nations mission. Non-payment or late payment of mandatory contributions byMember States is a violation of the Charter and of theduty of international solidarity. The burden thus createdfalls  above all  on those Members that are called good12payers and those that provide troops  expenditures that arereimbursed by the United Nations only after considerabledelay. This chronic problem  which is getting worse  canbe resolved only by timely and full payment of mandatorycontributions by all Member States. As one of the 20countries that  in 1994  paid their full contribution in atimely fashion to the regular budget of the United Nations and as a regular participant in peace-keeping operations Austria will  along with the Secretariat and other interesteddelegations  seek a solution to this difficult problem.On the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the UnitedNations faces new challenges at the world level.Sustainable development  the monitoring of worldpopulation growth  the elimination of poverty  the creationof opportunities for productive employment  socialintegration  equality for women  better protection of humanrights  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons - all are majorthemes of our era and have been or will be the subject ofinternational conferences. The task of the United Nationsis to draw the necessary conclusions from the results ofthese conferences and to define the outlines of sustainablehuman development at the world level. The Secretary-General’s reports  ""An Agenda for Peace"" and ""Agenda forDevelopment""  are essential elements in a discussion thathas already led to a broader understanding of the idea ofsecurity.The protection and promotion of human rights is oneof the central tasks of the United Nations. Theaccomplishment of this task has benefited from the vitalimpetus provided by the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action. While we can be pleased with theoutcome of the World Conference on Human Rights  thelasting impact of the final document of Vienna will nonethe less be measured by the continuing will of thecommunity of nations to give effect to its provisions morerapidly and to guarantee them more effectively than in thepast.A crucial role is to be played in this connection by theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. Austria welcomesthe swift implementation of this central provision of theVienna document. In the few months that he has occupiedhis post  Mr. José Ayala Lasso has fully lived up to theexpectations arising out of his difficult and importantmandate. His official visit to Vienna began a dialogue withall Governments. It seems to us a matter of priority topromote coordination of international protection of humanrights within the United Nations system  and in this theHigh Commissioner will  of course  have a determining roleto play. We should also strengthen the various mechanismsfor protecting human rights  as well as the role of theSpecial Rapporteurs. This should make it possible toreact more quickly to violations of human rights and toprevent them more effectively. The resources needed forthe High Commissioner’s work should be provided assoon as possible.Effective protection of human rights is not only aduty towards each individual; it is also an essentialcontribution to ensuring stability  development andsecurity. History teaches us that we must resolutelyoppose all flagrant violations of human rights  such asgenocide in the Nazi concentration camps or by theKhmer Rouge  as soon as they are brought to light. Thismakes it all the more difficult to understand that theresolution adopted by the United Nations Conference onHuman Rights relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina hasremained a dead letter  thereby jeopardizing the credibilityof our world Organization.In this connection  I wish to pay a particular tributeto Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki  former Prime Minister ofPoland and Special Rapporteur of the Commission onHuman Rights  for his excellent work  of which the worldcommunity should be proud. I would also hail PresidentIzetbegovic´ of Bosnia and Herzegovina who  with greatself-discipline and in a very constructive spirit  hasaccepted to speak with those who are committing a kindof genocide against his people. This is remarkableconduct from an extraordinary individual.The effective protection of minorities involves greatdifficulties in many countries. I am pleased to be able toinform the Assembly that  in 1992  Austria and Italy wereable to resolve their dispute over the Southern Tyrol. Thedispute related to the implementation of the 1946 Treatyof Paris on the situation of the German-speaking andLadino-speaking populations in Southern Tyrol. It wasalso dealt with in General Assembly resolutions 1497(XV) and 1661 (XVI)  adopted at the fifteenth andsixteenth sessions respectively.The solution that was agreed to by both sides was toestablish relatively comprehensive autonomy in southernTyrol. This seemed on the whole to be an adequate basisfor ensuring the continued existence of the German-speaking and Ladino minorities.13Given the constant changes in the atmosphere -particularly the economic and financial atmosphere - therehas to be a dynamic autonomy if its objective is to beattained. This will require ongoing flexibility andunderstanding on the part of the relevant authorities. Asolution to the minorities problem on the basis of territorialautonomy must  over the long term  aim at ensuring that allthose who live together under the same roof view suchautonomy as a positive thing that protects their respectiveinterests.The unanimous statements made by Prime MinisterBerlusconi  Foreign Minister Martino and Interior MinisterMaroni that they would not touch the autonomy of southernTyrol seem to us to be a guarantee that we shall continueon the same road.Austria is proud  as one of the headquarters countriesof the United Nations  to host a number of importantprogrammes that meet the immediate interests of theindividual and also have a decisive impact on internationalrelations. These include protection from drug abuse  thestruggle against crime  questions on the use and control ofnuclear power and on the preservation of the system for thenon-proliferation of nuclear weapons - all of these aremajor activities of the United Nations at Vienna  as isinternational cooperation on outer space and on thepromotion of international industrial development.Following recent political changes  important newareas for United Nations activities have emerged in EasternEurope and Central Asia. Vienna sees itself as animportant point for coordinating activities to support andassist those States as they move towards democracy  a stateof law and a market economy.On the eve of its fiftieth anniversary  the UnitedNations currently has more than 70 000 people in 17different peace-keeping operations. More than three timesthe regular budget is being devoted to those operations.Austria  which has been involved for decades in suchoperations  is aware of the enormous challenge that thisposes to the United Nations and its Member States in termsof funds  personnel and organization.One of the most important events to take place withinthe framework of the activities organized in Austria inconnection with the fiftieth anniversary will be the veryhigh-level conference set for early March 1995 in Vienna.This conference will be devoted to the discussion  analysisand preparation of recommendations on how best to take upthe challenge of measures to preserve peace on the eve ofthe new millennium. I am particularly pleased andgrateful that the Secretary-General has been kind enoughto agree to deliver the opening address in Austria.Austria is in favour of strengthening civilian peace-keeping operations and of stepping up United Nationsactivities in preventive diplomacy. Thus  the AustrianFederal Government has established  in the city ofSchlaining  a centre for civilian peace-keeping operations.This year  we held our second seminar on the re-establishment of peace and on preventive diplomacy  aseminar in which high officials of the United Nationsparticipated. Also in Schlaining  we have a regulartraining programme  with international participation  forcivilian international operations relating to peace-keepingand peace-building.For a quarter of a century  the non-proliferationTreaty has successfully prevented the proliferation ofnuclear weapons and has also successfully prevented theabuse of nuclear power for military purposes. The 1995Review Conference will take a decision on extending thenon-proliferation Treaty. Our common goal must be theunconditional and unrestricted extension of the Treaty.Austria also has good reason to hope that the substantivenegotiations currently under way in the Conference onDisarmament with a view to the conclusion of acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will lead to nucleardisarmament.As the host country of the International AtomicEnergy Agency  Austria is aware of the importance ofthis control mechanism for the application of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The success of any future agreementon a nuclear-test ban will  in the final analysis  depend onthe effectiveness of the work done by organizationsresponsible for its implementation and verification.A year ago  the Austrian Federal Governmentdecided to offer Vienna as headquarters for the futureorganization to be established under the nuclear-test-bantreaty  and I would wish to extend this invitation againtoday before the General Assembly.This year once again  our hopes of seeing an end tothe fighting in the territory of the former Yugoslavia havebeen dashed. Despite international initiatives and peaceplans  the actual prospects for an equitable and lastingsolution are not very good. The reconciliation betweenthe Bosnian Croats and the Bosnians  which stemmedfrom the Washington Agreements  should not make usforget that the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continues14to leave innumerable victims in its wake. The toll of deadand displaced persons grows daily more terrible. Theaggressor has gone so far as to attack or lay siege to citiesthat have been declared United Nations protected areas.Despite repeated international condemnation  theSerbian side has continued its practice of ""ethniccleansing"". Austria strongly condemns these crimes wherever and by whomever they may be perpetrated  andwe shall never stop calling for an end to such practices.Basic principles of the international order continue tobe trampled underfoot and lose their credibility. Specificresolutions such as those on military guarantees forprotected areas or return of refugees to their home  have notyet been implemented. All international initiatives andefforts for the repatriation of refugees have been made amockery by ""ethnic cleansing""  which continues to bepractised and  in the final analysis  continues to be toleratedat the international level. The arms embargo imposed bythe Security Council in September 1991 has a unilateralimpact  to the detriment of those countries that have takenover from the former Yugoslavia and that are threatened bySerbian ambitions. And so we have arrived at a situationwhere the legitimate Government of Bosnia andHerzegovina is unable fully to exercise its right tolegitimate self-defence  while at the same time that Statecannot even benefit from adequate protection under thesystem of collective security. On the other hand  we do notsee any attempt on the Serbian side to abandon the idea ofa Greater Serbia based on the illegal conquest of territoriesby force. This can be seen from the fact that the peaceplans prepared by the European Union and the contactgroup have still not been accepted by the Serbian side although on many points they do respond to theiraspirations.In its resolution 943 (1994) of 23 September theSecurity Council set forth the conditions for a suspensionof sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(Serbia and Montenegro). The Belgrade Government mustallow international observers to control the blockade againstthe Bosnian Serbs. The observer Mission now beingestablished along the Serbo-Bosnian border is  as Austriasees it  a step in the right direction but  and I stress thepoint  it remains to be seen how effectively the Missionwill be able to carry out its task and whether credibleconsequences will in fact be drawn from the conclusionsarrived at by the observers.In Croatia also the situation remains largelyunchanged: contrary to the provisions of the 1992 Vanceplan which was approved by the Security Council  morethan one quarter of the country remains in the hands ofthe rebel Serbs. So far there has been neitherdemilitarization of these regions under the supervision ofthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troopsnor has it yet been possible for the civilian population toreturn. Recent protests show to what extent the situationhas become untenable for displaced persons withinCroatia.Against the backdrop of the extremely harshjudgements often pronounced on Croatia one must notforget the very clear terms of the legal opinions of theBadinter Commission in January 1992. From these textsit is clear that  in principle  Croatia met all the conditionsset forth by the European Union for recognition of newStates in Eastern Europe. I realize that in some areas such as administration  practices vis-à-vis the minoritiesand the media  improvements are still much to be desired.But we should not measure Croatia by different andharsher criteria than the criteria we use for other countriesin central and south-eastern Europe because we havegreater access to Croatia and because there are moretransparent structures there  and there is no other countryin Europe  apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina  that hasbeen subjected for years to a violent military attack withwhich it has to cope under extremely difficult conditions.The situation in Kosovo  which has been tooneglected because of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is continuing to deteriorate. The Belgrade authoritieshave pursued their systematic action against the Albanianmajority of the population. There is still a danger thatmass violence may erupt. Observer missions sent by theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE) which were expelled in 1993 have not beenauthorized to return despite intensive international effortsto that end. In that region  which is almost 90 per centinhabited by Albanians and has been fully autonomousduring the past couple of decades  we are witnessing theexercise of a kind of power that is tantamount to that ofan occupying regime.The situation in former Yugoslavia shows that whatthe great French philosopher  Blaise Pascal  said in hisPensées remains as true as ever. He said that justicewithout force was powerless and that force without justicewas tyrannical. The collective security system of theUnited Nations which is part of the post-war order  hasnot really been applied by the international community inthe case of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. The hopethat the collective security system would be used as an15instrument of peace following its successful use after theIraqi invasion of Kuwait has proved disappointing.Unfortunately  Bosnia and Herzegovina is not anisolated case. It would be a serious mistake not to mention at least  some other tragedies - Rwanda  Angola Afghanistan  Haiti  Tajikistan  and so on. There is too longa list of hotbeds of crisis and violence  where the law of thestrongest tramples underfoot the principles of the Charter ofSan Francisco. At the same time we must draw strengthand optimism from some positive developments  historic intheir significance. I may mention  for example  free anddemocratic elections in South Africa  an end to the policyof apartheid  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho  and an end tothe state of war between Jordan and Israel. In South Africaand in the Middle East age-old objectives of the UnitedNations have finally been attained or are about to beattained. Austria  in so far as it can  actively supports thesepeaceful processes  not only in the interests of the peoplesconcerned but also in the interests of greater hope ofresolving other similar problems.The year 1994 is of historic significance to Austria.A huge majority - 66.58 per cent - of the Austrian peoplecame out firmly in support of joining the European Union a community of States that holds the same values as  andplays an increasingly important role in  the United Nations.This was the largest support in a European State for theidea of European integration.With that democratic force we will continue to supportthis goal  and - as of 1 January I hope - as a member ofthis community we will contribute in a spirit of solidarityand openness to the attainment of the objectives of theUnited Nations as we have done in the past."
"11",402,"AZE",49,1994,"Allow me  first  to express my sincere satisfaction on theoccasion of your election  Sir  as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish you everysuccess in your work.I should like also to thank the President of the lastsession  Mr. Samuel Insanally  for the work he did.I express my deep gratitude to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts tostrengthen peace and security throughout the world. Ishould like to extend to him my very special appreciation especially for his keen interest in the problems of ouryoung State  which is going through a complicated periodof its history.It is with a sense of excitement and pride that I amaddressing this Assembly from the podium of the mostauthoritative international forum. For the first time  thePresident of an independent Azerbaijan is representing hiscountry before the international community  a country thathas been recognized by this community and has joined itas an equal among equals.The Azerbaijani people have striven for freedom forcenturies. After the disintegration of the Soviet Unionthey gained their national independence. Our Republichas embarked upon the road of constructing a law-based democratic and civilized State. This is a complicatedprocess; it cannot be completed overnight  but we aresteadily moving towards our goal. During a short periodof time a great deal has been accomplished  and all theconditions have been created for the formation of alaw-based  democratic society. We have evolved in ourRepublic a multi-party system  firmly based on theprinciples of political pluralism and freedom of theindividual  speech  the press and conscience  as well asprinciples of respect for human rights and the rule of law.All citizens of multinational Azerbaijan enjoy equalrights  irrespective of their racial  religious and linguisticaffiliations.Political changes and the democratization of thecountry have created the conditions for carrying out deepeconomic reforms  ensuring a transition to a marketeconomy. We fully encourage the development of freeenterprise and private initiative. We are on the way torealizing a large-scale privatization programme  using worldexperience based upon common human values - on theexperience of leading countries that have already achievedgreat success in constructing civilized  prosperous anddemocratic societies.Located at the important geopolitical junction ofEurope and Asia and the focus of the keen interest of manyPowers  possessing rich natural resources and a substantialindustrial potential and guided by the firm will andconfidence of the Azerbaijani people  we are carrying outthe strategy of strengthening our independence andimplementing democratic market reforms. Today  from thislofty rostrum  I firmly declare that no one will be able tomake the Azerbaijani people stray from this path. We lookto the future of our country with optimism.Our optimism is also linked with historic processestaking place in the world as well as with profound changesin the system of international relations. A world orderbased on equal rights and replacing military and ideologicalconfrontation will certainly form the future basis of thissystem. Partnership and enduring peace and security foreveryone  in accordance with international law and theprinciples and provisions of the United Nations Charter  arebecoming the fundamental principles of the new worldorder. We see the light at the end of the tunnel  a tunnelleading from a world of hostility based on the use of forceto an era of cooperation and prosperity. We are ready towalk along this road together  hand in hand with all theother countries and peoples of the world.However  the threats looming over mankind have notbeen totally eliminated. Old stereotypes still exist  andnumerous problems  accumulated over decades ofconfrontation  especially problems in the sphere ofdisarmament and the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  have not yet been overcome. Relationsbetween States with different economic potentials stillsuffer from the maladies of the past. Time is presenting uswith new challenges  challenges linked with environmentaldifficulties and population and development problems.Aggressive nationalism and separatism  giving birth toconflicts in the Caucasus  the Balkans and other hot spots have become realities following the collapse of the oldworld order. These conflicts not only hamper thedevelopment of independent States and directly threaten thevery existence of fledgling democracies  but also threateninternational security as a whole.That is why  in a post-confrontational world  aspecial responsibility rests on the shoulders ofauthoritative international organizations as well as onthose shoulders of the big Powers. Using their politicalweight and their economic  financial and militaryresources  they must more actively direct their potentialtowards extinguishing the flame of conflicts and towardsthe consolidation of peace  stability and securitythroughout the world.It goes without saying that in the construction of anew world order there is a leading role for the UnitedNations  which will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary nextyear  and for its Security Council  which has extensiveexperience in resolving a number of conflicts and crises.However  the Security Council will still face the difficulttest of proving to the international community itsefficiency under new conditions. Today  as never before the Security Council is required to be more persistent inachieving guaranteed implementation of its resolutions.We hope that enlargement of the Council will contributeto its strengthening.We attach great importance to the role of theGeneral Assembly  which is primarily seen as ensuringthe closest possible interaction between States in thedecision-making process  on the basis of compromisesand the balance of interests.Under present conditions  one should mention theincreased importance of the efficient use by theSecretary-General of his powers  as well as the supportthat must be given him by Member States  which sharewith him the responsibility for strengthening internationalpeace and security.Generally speaking  the Azerbaijani Republic isoptimistic about the future of the United Nations. We aredetermined to continue to protect the lofty principles ofthe United Nations and to seek improvement in theauthority and efficiency of the Organization.For many of those present the notion of war andarmed conflict may  fortunately  be associated withhistory or faraway events. But for my people it is a cruelreality and a bloody daily routine.For six years the flame of war has been blazing onthe land of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Armenia  under2the pretext of realizing the right to self-determination of anethnic group of Armenians living in the Nagorny Karabakhregion of Azerbaijan  is openly carrying out plans to annexthe territories of our State  to forcibly change its Stateborders and to expel the Azerbaijani people from theirhomes.All this is cloaked by an arbitrary interpretation of theright of peoples to self-determination as meaning a right ofany ethnic community to proclaim itself independent and tojoin another State. Such an interpretation of the right toself-determination blatantly contradicts the principles ofState sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt tomake this right absolute results in cruel conflicts  which wehave witnessed in our region and in other parts of ourplanet.The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hasexpressed his concern on this issue  saying:""... if every ethnic  religious or linguistic groupclaimed statehood  there would be no limit tofragmentation  and peace  security and economicwell-being for all would become ever more difficult toachieve."" (A/47/277  para. 17)I fully agree with Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali that:""The sovereignty  territorial integrity andindependence of States within the establishedinternational system  and the principle of self-determination for peoples  both of great valueand importance  must not be permitted to workagainst each other in the period ahead.""(ibid  para. 19)Being aware that the international community isinsufficiently  and sometimes unilaterally  informed aboutevents in our region  I should like to brief the Assembly onthe real situation.Having created a powerful military build-up on theterritory of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan  theRepublic of Armenia started intensive military activitiesagainst our Republic. With the occupation of the town ofShusha and of the Lachin region  the annexation ofNagorny Karabakh was completed  and about 50 000resident Azerbaijanis were ousted. Using the NagornyKarabakh springboard  Armenian armed forces thenoccupied another six regions of Azerbaijan: Kalbajar Agdam  Fizuli  Djebrail  Zangelan and Kubatli  which  likethe Lachin region  are situated outside the former NagornyKarabakh autonomous region  with a territory four timesbigger than that of Nagorny Karabakh.As a result of the aggression  more than 20 per centof the territory of Azerbaijan is under occupation by thearmed forces of the Republic of Armenia. I mustmention here the huge losses on the Azerbaijani side:more than 20 000 killed  about 100 000 wounded and6 000 taken prisoner. In addition  more than 1 millionAzerbaijanis - about 15 per cent of the population - havebecome refugees and live in tents. In their own countrythey have been deprived of shelter  and they suffer fromheat  cold and epidemics  and experience shortages oftheir basic needs. Seven hundred towns and villages havebeen levelled on the occupied Azerbaijani territories;practically all the houses  schools  hospitals  and ancientmonuments have been burned down and looted.I think there is no need to prove that here we aredealing not with the realization of the right toself-determination  but with a gross violation ofinternational law  in the form of aggression against thesovereignty  territorial integrity and political independenceof a United Nations Member State.The war has created unbearable conditions for mypeople. It aggravates social tension and hampers theimplementation of economic and political reforms aimedat the democratization of Azerbaijani society.As a result of the war  the Azerbaijani people havesuffered a huge material loss  amounting to billions ofdollars. As for the moral damage inflicted on human lifeand destiny  there is hardly anything to compare to thesorrow and pain of my people.Blood is being shed now  not only in Azerbaijan  butalso in other hot spots of the world. Peoples must notremain indifferent to these tragic events. Collectiveefforts should be made in order to prevent the escalationof armed conflicts and to achieve their just and lastingresolution.During the past two years the Security Counciladopted four resolutions and its President has made sixstatements in connection with the occupation ofAzerbaijani territories by armed forces of the Republic ofArmenia.In all its resolutions the Security Council reaffirmsthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the AzerbaijaniRepublic; emphasizes the inadmissibility of the use of3force for the acquisition of territory; it strongly demandsthe immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal ofall occupying forces from all the occupied regions ofAzerbaijan; and calls for the return of refugees to theirhomes.But all these decisions have so far been completelyignored by the Republic of Armenia. Moreover  Armeniacontinues to build up its military presence in the occupiedterritories of Azerbaijan.On the other hand  the Security Council has also failedto put into effect the mechanism for implementing theresolutions. Here we face a question: to what extent is theSecurity Council consistent and resolute  and how is thedegree of application of its powers in each case defined?Non-compliance with the decisions of the SecurityCouncil does not serve the interests of the United Nations and may undermine confidence in its abilities to achieve itsmain objective: the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.Experience gained in the process of settling regionalconflicts shows that the efforts to implement resolutionssucceed only when endorsed by the political-military meansenvisaged in the United Nations Charter.The duty of the most authoritative internationalorganization in the world community is to take effectivemeasures with respect to the aggressor State  which isblatantly violating norms of international law.In the efforts to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijaniconflict  we rely on such an authoritative organization asthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE). The Minsk Group  created by the CSCE for thesettlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict  alsoproceeds on the basis of the necessity for the evacuation ofall the occupied territories and the complete withdrawal ofthe occupying forces beyond the boundaries of Azerbaijan.It also calls for respect for the sovereignty  territorialintegrity and internationally recognized borders ofAzerbaijan.However  unfortunately  the numerous mediationefforts of the CSCE have not yet brought about anytangible  concrete results  due to the lack of appropriatemechanisms.Only now do we have the first positive result. At thecost of enormous efforts  and owing to active mediation bythe Russian Federation and the CSCE Minsk Group  acease-fire has been achieved in the conflict zone. Thefighting and bloodshed have been stopped for more thanfour months. We greatly appreciate all this. But thesituation still remains very complicated and the truce isvery fragile.The Republic of Armenia has put forward anillegitimate condition  that of exchanging part of theoccupied Azerbaijani territories for independent status forthe Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic.It demands that it keep its military presence in thisAzerbaijani region and that it control the town of Shushaand the Lachin region of Azerbaijan  which impliesconsolidation of its annexation of our territories.Armenia completely excludes the restoration of thedemographic composition of Nagorny Karabakh as it wasat the beginning of the conflict and the return of theAzerbaijani population  including its return to one of theancient centres of Azerbaijani culture  the town ofShusha. On these conditions  Armenia  ignoring theSecurity Council’s resolutions  proposes the deploymentof an international separation force along the perimeter ofthe occupied Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan thus trying to turn it into a tool for freezing the situationand to make it a hostage of its annexationist policy.The position of the Azerbaijani Republic has alwaysbeen constructive and peace-loving. Despite all thedamage inflicted upon us  we propose peace to theArmenian side on the basis of international law  justiceand humanism. We are prepared to provide guarantees tothe Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh. Wefavour the restoration  on a mutual basis  ofcommunications in the region  including the humanitariancorridor between Nagorny Karabakh and the Republic ofArmenia. We are also prepared to discuss the status ofNagorny Karabakh within the Azerbaijani State.However  there are norms and principles that weconsider eternal: the sovereignty and territorial integrityof our country  the evacuation of all the occupiedterritories and the return of refugees to their homes including the return of 50 000 Azerbaijani refugees totheir native land in Nagorny Karabakh.The Azerbaijani Republic  while it still wants apeaceful political settlement  considers that only theelimination of the consequences of aggression  throughthe implementation of Security Council resolutions  willmake it possible to carry on a stable and productive4negotiating process  with the goal of establishing a durable stable cease-fire and ensuring security for all the people ofthe region. Here we count on the assistance of the worldcommunity to ensure the realization of coordinated peacefuldecisions on the basis of a precise mandate for peace-keepers in accordance with international norms.We highly appreciate the cease-fire agreement. Werealize that it does not mean peace yet  but it creates thenecessary conditions for its rapid achievement. On severaloccasions we have voiced our firm resolution to observe thecease-fire regime until the peace agreement is reached andthere is a total cessation of the military conflict. I repeatthat today from this lofty rostrum of the United Nations.We support the peace-keeping activities of the CSCEMinsk Group and the Russian Federation  and favour theconsolidation of their efforts against any kind ofcompetition in the process of settling the conflict. Suchcompetition could only complicate the achievement ofpeace  which is needed equally by the peoples ofAzerbaijan and of Armenia.Our demands for the complete evacuation of alloccupied Azerbaijani territories are legitimate; they are infull conformity with Security Council resolutions. Attemptsto annex any regions are unacceptable to us and go againstthe norms of international law.As a result of a war thrust upon us  an extremelydifficult humanitarian situation has emerged in theRepublic. Every seventh person in a country with apopulation of 7 million is a refugee  lacking a home  workand means for existence. Suffering from harsh miseries refugees and displaced persons are staying in tent camps.The severe winter conditions and the lack of necessary foodand medicines have created a threat of epidemics andfamine among the most vulnerable group of the population.Overcoming the extremely grave refugee situation hasbecome one of the major concerns of the Azerbaijani State.International organizations and a number of Stateshave responded to the urgent appeal of our Republic  andwe express our most sincere gratitude to the Governmentsof Sweden  the United Kingdom  Germany  Japan Switzerland  the Netherlands and Denmark  which havebecome the largest donors to the United Nationsprogrammes of humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan. Weare also grateful to the Governments of Turkey  Iran  SaudiArabia and other countries for their considerablehumanitarian assistance within the framework of bilateralrelations  and to the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees  the International Committeeof the Red Cross  the United Nations Children’s Fund Doctors Without Borders and numerous non-governmentalorganizations which have rendered invaluable assistanceto the refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan.The role and place of my country in internationalrelations are influenced by its geographical location andsocio-political orientation  as well as the historical-culturaltraditions of a land where Western and Easterncivilizations have merged. It is with an awareness ofthese peculiarities and the challenges of change that weare building  step by step  our cooperation with theoutside world. Since the international recognition of theAzerbaijani Republic  we have established equal  balancedrelations with the overwhelming majority of States  andwe have joined a number of world and regionalorganizations. We have made serious efforts to expandour international relations and to restore the links thatwere lost due to certain conditions. Attaching specialimportance to historical  geographical  economic andhumanitarian links with the independent States that haveemerged on the territory of the former Soviet Union  wefavour the development of equal cooperation with them in particular with Russia  both on the basis of bilateralrelations and within the framework of the Commonwealthof Independent States.Azerbaijan is developing friendly relations with theUnited States  the United Kingdom  France and China.Close good-neighbourly ties link us with the countries ofour region and of adjacent regions  countries such asTurkey  Iran  Saudi Arabia  Egypt and Pakistan  withwhich we closely cooperate within the Organization of theIslamic Conference.Azerbaijan’s accession in May this year to thePartnership for Peace programme of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization was an important event in thepolitical life of our country. This programme attracts uswith the idea of cooperation and interaction in theinterests of common security. I welcome the accession ofthe former members of the Warsaw Pact to thisprogramme. This fact gives hope to the whole of theEurasian continent for peaceful cooperation  therebyensuring security  progress and prosperity for all peoples and thereby eventually eliminating the possibility of theemergence of new adversarial blocs. We hope thatparticipation in the NATO programme will enhance therole of our country in the building of a new Europeansecurity structure.5This year the Azerbaijan Republic was accorded thestatus of Observer in the Non-Aligned Movement  a stepthat provides us with a broad opportunity for theestablishment of bilateral contacts in various fields and forthe rapprochement of our positions with those of the Statesmembers of the Movement.The accession of the young Azerbaijani State to theUnited Nations as a full Member in January 1992 markedthe most important stage in the development of our country.The scope of our cooperation with many United Nationsinternational agencies has been expanding ever since.We appreciate especially the cooperation we enjoywith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WorldBank. Concrete projects that are of great importance forthe socio-economic development of our country have beenelaborated as a result of the practical work of expertsrepresenting these large financial institutions. We assumethat many possibilities exist for our fruitful cooperationwith international financial institutions. We understand theprudence and concern demonstrated by the heads of theIMF and the World Bank with regard to the war conditionsin which the Azerbaijani Republic has been engaged. Atthe same time  however  the IMF has given a structuraladjustment loan to Armenia  which is in a state of war withus. We consider that justice requires at least a balancedapproach in this matter.We are expecting a great deal from the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP) in the way of technicalassistance in the drawing up of national programmes for thedevelopment of market economy infrastructures  andassistance to enable our country make progress towardsmodern management methods and the application ofadvanced technologies.We attach especial attention to international economiccooperation  and it is with deep satisfaction that I shouldlike to inform you that on 20 September 1994  as a resultof long and difficult negotiations  the Azerbaijani Republicsigned a contract with a consortium of large internationaloil companies for the joint development of the off-shoreoilfields for a 30-year term in the Azerbaijani sector of theCaspian Sea.This landmark economic endeavour testifies to ourpolicy of openness to the whole world  as well as to ourpolicy of liberalizing the economy and attracting foreigninvestment. The signing of this unique contract willpromote the strengthening of cooperation andrapprochement among the peoples and countriesparticipating in its implementation  that is  Azerbaijan  theUnited States  Russia  the United Kingdom  Turkey Norway and Saudi Arabia.In mentioning this  I should like once again tounderline the fact that the Azerbaijani Republic is seekingfull-fledged integration into the world community and hasthe full capacity to do so. For that reason the core of itspolicy is the aspiration for peace  and we pin great hopeson the United Nations in assisting us to achieve thispeace.The Azerbaijani people have placed great confidencein me in electing me President of a young  independentState  and today it has been my privilege to convey toyou its deepest aspirations. I leave this lofty rostrum ofthe General Assembly in the hope that the voice of mypeople will be heard by the members of the Assemblyand that it will pave the way to their hearts."
"12",448,"BDI",49,1994,"It is an honour and a privilege for me to addressthe Members of this Organization. In doing so  I conveythe greetings of the President of the Republic of Burundi His Excellency Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya  and of theGovernment and people of Burundi  as well as their goodwishes for every success at this session of the GeneralAssembly.I should like also to greet and congratulate HisExcellency Mr. Amara Essy  Minister for Foreign Affairsof Côte d’Ivoire  on his unanimous election to presideover the General Assembly’s work at this session.Your statesmanlike qualities  developed in the courseof a long and rich career as a diplomat  augur well forgreat success at this forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. Through your impressive election  the GeneralAssembly has once again paid tribute to Africa and toyour country  so committed to peace and internationalcooperation. I assure you that my delegation will giveyou every support as you strive to fulfil your mandate.My congratulations also go to the other members ofthe Bureau  who  I feel sure  will spare no effort in theirpractical support for you in the successfulaccomplishment of your heavy responsibilities.I should also like warmly to congratulate yourpredecessor  Mr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic ofGuyana  who  as President at the forty-eighth session guided the work of the Assembly masterfully and withexemplary commitment.Lastly  we pay a warm tribute to Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations for all the activities he has initiated in order to cope withthe many challenges and enormous difficulties facing ourOrganization today. We believe that these obstacles arenot insurmountable provided that there is honestcommitment and solidarity on the part of the internationalcommunity. Thanks to the resolve and perseverance ofthis Organization  which mobilized the Member Statesagainst apartheid  peace and democracy have nowtriumphed in South Africa. The people and theGovernment of Burundi have already welcomed this well-deserved victory of the valiant South African people  whohave thus resumed their place in the concert of nations.The current session of the General Assembly isbeing held at a time of many serious and unexpectedevents. There have been natural disasters throughout theworld: famine  civil war  terrorism and other scourges ofmodern times  such as religious fundamentalism and there-emergence of exclusionary movements  associations or14political parties  all bearing within them the seeds ofdivision.A year ago  from this very rostrum  the late PresidentMelchior Ndadaye conveyed to this Assembly a message ofpeace  friendship  brotherhood and solidarity. This occurredjust after the pluralist elections of June 1993  which theentire world had found to be free and transparent. Then  on21 October 1993  President Ndadaye was assassinated in arash and senseless act that plunged Burundi into desolation division and political and ethnic massacres  and sorelytested the hard-won democracy. Since that fateful day Burundi has suffered a serious political  institutional  socialand economic crisis  the repercussions of which are stillbeing felt today. We all recall the unbearable imagesbroadcast by the international media.Let us further recall that the successor to PresidentNdadaye  Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira  died tragically in anairplane accident in Kigali on 6 April 1994  which alsotook the life of the Rwandese Head of State. Misfortunesnever come singly; Burundi had the terrible shock of losingtwo Presidents in less than six months. This situation hasprofoundly traumatized the people of Burundi. Somewondered if Burundi would be able to avoid the humancataclysm recently experienced by its neighbour Rwanda.Indeed  the institutional crisis that resulted from the vacuumof power  and the various manifestations of violence thatfollowed  crystallized latent antagonisms  exacerbated latentethnic divisions and created an atmosphere of suspicion andintolerance that was prejudicial to peace.Despite the dark picture I have just painted  the peopleof Burundi has not succumbed to despair. Indeed  theregistered political parties and the representatives of civilsociety have met in a negotiating forum and begun in-depthdiscussions with a view to finding ways and means ofensuring a swift return to peace  security  trust and socio-economic and political stability in the country.The lengthy discussions which began after the deathof President Cyprien Ntaryamira last April recently led tothe signing on 10 September 1994 of a governmentconvention. This document is a basis for thereestablishment of State institutions and organs of State andof various legal and political mechanisms which will restoretrust and cooperation between the political partners. Thesuccessful outcome of these lengthy negotiations hasallowed the people of Burundi to heave a sigh of relief.The people had begun to tire and above all to question thegood faith of politicians who  as far as the people couldsee  were more concerned with their own selfish intereststhan in peace and the development for one and all.We take this opportunity to thank the internationalcommunity for the role it has played in encouraging thepeople of Burundi to pursue national dialogue andcooperation. We are particularly grateful to the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity for thedecisive role they played in ensuring the successfuloutcome of the negotiations. The Special Representativesof the Secretaries-General of these organizations Ambassadors Ahmedou Ould Abdallah and LéandreBassole respectively  participated at every stage of thenegotiations we have just concluded. We welcome theprogress made together through this preventive diplomacy.We believe that the choice of a consensus President Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya  the consensus nominationof a Prime Minister from the opposition  and theformation of a coalition Government are all factorsconducive to restoring security and confidence among thevarious elements of Burundi society and to promoting thereturn of displaced persons and refugees to their homes inthe hills. They are also very important in encouragingreconstruction and the economic recovery of the country.The new national coalition government that arosefrom the consensus reached in the negotiations betweenthe political partners has  as its main tasks  thereconstruction of the economic and social infrastructuresthat were partly or totally demolished  the campaignagainst a general sense of impunity  and the establishmentof conditions guaranteeing the safety and peace of all inBurundi. The tasks ahead are enormous and cannot becarried out without the solidarity and assistance of theinternational community on a bilateral and/or multilateralbasis.We also take this opportunity to recall the requestmade by the Government of Burundi for the organizationof a neutral international inquiry to establish responsibilityfor the October 1993 putsch and the ensuing massacres.The international community has always stood by us intimes of anguish and we feel sure that it will continue tosupport our efforts by providing emergency specialassistance for economic recovery and reconstruction.We also reiterate our appeal to the United Nationsand friendly countries to continue to support theproponents of peace and progress in Burundi and todiscourage and condemn all those at home and abroadwho may be tempted to use violence to resolve the15problems we are experiencing. Today silence meanscomplicity and is criminal.Lasting solutions to Burundi’s political problems canbe found only if they are dealt with in a subregionalcontext. For some years now we have been witnessingforced movements of populations following violenceperpetrated in some countries of our subregion. Thesemovements  often out of control  are a threat to peace andstability throughout the Great Lakes region.No one can fail to see that the tragedy of Rwanda hasshocked human conscience at the subregional  regional andinternational levels. It is shameful not only for thosebehind genocide  or those who have committed it  but alsofor mankind as a whole  which has not been able to rush tothe aid of a people in peril. My country hopes that thoseguilty of this crime against humanity will be brought tojustice and receive the punishment they deserve. Weencourage the Government of Rwanda to continue its policyof reconciliation and to do its utmost to ensure that allRwandese refugees can return to their homeland.The crisis in Rwanda has had most regrettableconsequences for neighbouring States - above all forBurundi  which has ethnic  linguistic and culturalsimilarities to Rwanda. The Rwandese tragedy has hadpolitical  security  economic  humanitarian andenvironmental consequences. We need not go into details because the whole world saw on television the human tideflee fighting to take refuge in neighbouring countries  suchas Burundi  Tanzania and Zaire. The refugee problem hasbeen acute in our subregion since the 1960s. As theAssembly knows  it is both a humanitarian and a politicalproblem. It causes discord between neighbouring Statesand has engendered mistrust between them. Some seerefugees as an economic and social burden  while othersconsider them a threat to their security.For these reasons  we propose that an internationalconference on peace  stability and development in theAfrican Great Lakes subregion be organized as soon aspossible. In the short term  it is a matter of resolving therefugee problem. In the medium term  inter-Statemechanisms should be established to safeguard peace bolster stability and promote socio-economic development.Such a conference could pave the way for the creation ofa more viable economic community combining existingorganizations  such as the Economic Community of theGreat Lakes Countries and the Kagera River BasinOrganization and adapting them better to the realities of oursubregion. We believe such a conference would helpintegrate our States  which share an almost identicalhistory  the same geographical space and  above all  anability to communicate through common languages. Mydelegation is willing to make specific proposals on thismatter.Next year the United Nations will celebrate half acentury of existence. In 50 years the Organization hasaccomplished a great many tasks. It has overcome manyobstacles  survived the cold war and contributed to theadvent of international détente. Its specialized agencieshave assisted millions of people in distress. TheOrganization has always committed itself to actions tomaintain international peace and security. It has beenable to foster friendly relations between nations based onrespect for the principle of equal rights of peoples andtheir right to self-determination. The United Nations hascontributed to dialogue between the peoples and States ofthe world by encouraging relations of cooperation andsolidarity.None the less  the Organization  like any humanenterprise  is far from perfect. Despite efforts to settlearmed conflicts  we must note that the brinksmanship andintransigence of certain belligerents diminish hopes forpeace.In Africa  the conflicts in Somalia  Angola andLiberia seem to go on for ever  notwithstanding theefforts of the United Nations to resolve them.With regard to the crisis in Somalia  we know it wasthe massive intervention of the Blue Helmets that led theparties involved to the negotiating table. The operationinspired some hope that the people of Somalia wouldachieve reconciliation. Unfortunately  the conflictcontinues. Burundi believes the United Nations shouldcontinue this operation  using all the means authorized bythe Charter. At the same time  we call on the partiesinvolved to settle their differences peacefully and to lendevery possible assistance to any mediation effort.As to Angola  the political and military situation hascontinued to deteriorate  with an escalation of the fightingand greater mistrust between the belligerents. Whilewelcoming the resumption of the negotiating processbetween the Government of Angola and UNITA  myState wishes to repeat its appeal for a cessation of thehostilities that have brought so much suffering to thepeople of Angola.16In Liberia  peace has not yet been restored. There hasbeen delay in full implementation of the CotonouAgreement - signed on 25 July 1993 by the InterimGovernment of National Unity  the National Patriotic Frontof Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation Movement ofLiberia for Democracy (ULIMO)  under the auspices of theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity -aimed at finding a peaceful settlement to the conflict. TheRepublic of Burundi pays tribute to the efforts made byECOWAS and the United Nations to bring about a peacefulsettlement of that conflict  which continues to bring suchgrief to the people of Liberia.We also support the United Nations peace plan forWestern Sahara  which involves a referendum to allow theSaharan people to choose their own destiny.Africa is today the scene of the largest number ofarmed conflicts in the world. This political instabilitymeans we cannot tackle development in our countries despite the vast natural resources of our continent. Webelieve it is high time Africans stopped blaming theirmisfortunes on outside factors. We firmly believe thatAfrica must shoulder its responsibilities and define themain lines of its development in accordance with itsrealities. We must respect our identity while accepting anypositive contribution from outside. Burundi has no doubtthe time will come when Africa will show its capacity forself-improvement and that it will be able to contribute moreto the well-being of mankind. In other words  through thedemocratic reforms now under way  our continent  which iscurrently undergoing a period of upheaval  will attain thefreedom and development it so desires.My country welcomes the new era opening up in theMiddle East. The peoples of that region are finally goingto be able to work together for peace  security anddevelopment. We pay tribute to all the countries andinstitutions that contributed to the mediation efforts andencourage them to continue their diplomatic efforts with aview to a final and irreversible settlement of that conflict which has lasted far too long.The situation in the Balkans is also a matter ofconcern. Work must continue to reconcile the positions ofthe various parties. War does not resolve problems ofcoexistence and good-neighborliness between peoples.On the Korean peninsula  we wish for the voluntaryand peaceful reunification of Korea. We also encouragecontinued negotiations between the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States of America  inthe hope that they will remove all uncertainties withregard to the nuclear problem.As the Secretary-General pointed out so aptly in ""AnAgenda for Development""  there can be no peace withoutdevelopment. And the 1994 World Human DevelopmentReport also states:""The absence of peace can indeed hinderdevelopment; but without development  peace isthreatened.""Development requires international cooperation andassistance from other States. The Charter sets as one ofthe purposes of the United Nations:""to achieve international cooperation in solvinginternational problems of an economic  social cultural  or humanitarian character  and in promotingand encouraging respect for human rights and forfundamental freedoms for all without distinction asto race  sex  language  or religion"".Problems arising from the maintenance of peace andsecurity and those of a humanitarian character particularly after the cold war  have led the Organizationto extend its operations to the four corners of the Earth.Some observers even fear that development activities willbe neglected so long as urgent and immediate needsmonopolize the Organization. Some go so far as to saythat the discussion on development should be shifted fromthe General Assembly to other  better equippedinstitutions.In Burundi  we consider that development  and therelated problems and needs  must also be one of thepriorities of the United Nations. There can be no betterplace than the General Assembly to deal with problems asglobal and interconnected as poverty  debt  theenvironment  development assistance and other equallythorny world-wide issues.On the matter of combating poverty and other socialproblems  Burundi places great hope in the upcomingWorld Summit for Social Development  where it intendsto be represented at the appropriate level. Our delegationwill spare no effort to ensure that the declaration to beadopted at the Copenhagen Summit will correctly reflectthe concerns of poor peoples.17The external debt problem of the developing countriesis also a crisis  and it must be dealt with more innovativelythan it has been in the past. Many strategies have beenadopted to resolve the problem. Specific actions have beentaken by creditors to restructure commercial debt and insome cases to cancel bilateral debt. But as the Secretary-General has pointed out  to date  the efforts made to lightenthe burden of multilateral debt have been far fromsatisfactory.The subject of multilateral debt should thus also becarefully studied. My country hopes that the discussion tobe held on the agenda item on debt will result inconclusions that can lighten the burden of multilateral debt particularly with regard to the fragile economies of the leastdeveloped countries.The current situation regarding trade relations isextremely disturbing. The industrialized countries areerecting major barriers to the importation of certainproducts from developing countries. At the same time however  the latter countries  under the effect ofliberalization policies  are opening wide their doors toforeign competition.According to the most reliable sources  the damagedone to developing countries exceeds the amount of aidallotted to them; however  should the rich countrieseliminate all obstacles to the importation of products fromthe third world  the increase in exports from developingcountries would equal twice the aid granted to thesecountries.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creationof the World Trade Organization augur well for a moreorderly and equitable system of world trade. We maintainthe hope that accompanying measures will be taken toavoid the marginalization of developing countries in themultilateral trade system. We are thinking  in particular  ofthe least developed countries which run the risk of beingpoor relations within the new World Trade Organization.For some years  the international community has beenaware of the non-sustainable nature of the development andconsumption patterns followed thus far  without concern forthe protection of the environment.As the Secretary-General emphasizes in ""An Agendafor Development""  the environment  like peace  theeconomy  society and democracy  permeates all aspects ofdevelopment. In the last few years  the General Assemblyhas seriously taken up the issues of environment anddevelopment. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  inJune 1992  gave birth to international legal instrumentswhich  if implemented  will ensure a better environmentand more harmonious development for the Earth and itsinhabitants. My country  Burundi  has already signedthese instruments  and it will soon ratify them.Burundi has been closely following the discussionthat has been under way for some time at the UnitedNations with a view to reforming and improving theworking methods of the Security Council. The ideas putforward are quite diverse. We earnestly hope that thisdiscussion will lead to a solution that will preserve theeffectiveness of the Security Council while allowing thedeveloping countries to have their voices heard withinthat body.If the democratic reforms desired by our peoples areto be lasting and irreversible  there must be support fromthe international community  for democracy against abackdrop of social crisis  unemployment  or poverty could prove illusory. My country places great hope in theUnited Nations  which alone can contribute to solvingmankind’s current problems  such as those of population the environment  economic and social development andhealth  particularly at a time when certain countries of theworld are shaken by endemic illnesses. We cannot passover in silence the scourge of our time - AIDS. Theinternational community must pool its efforts to suppressthis scourge.We express the hope that the United Nations willcontinue to pursue the ideals and purposes contained in itsCharter. May international relations become moredemocratic  and a new  more just and equitable  politicaland economic order emerge.We also hope that  as this century draws to a close our Organization will be able to achieve tangible results particularly in removing the spectres of hunger  povertyand war.We all aspire to peace  justice and freedom. In ourendeavours  we must succeed in achieving them  in orderto give future generations the opportunity to live in abetter world."
"13",495,"BEL",49,1994,"It is with great pleasure that I join the previous speakersin congratulating you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of this Assembly. The great African countrythat you represent  Côte d’Ivoire  has always played anactive and constructive role in our Organization. We aredelighted to have you presiding over our proceedings.8My German ministerial colleague  Mr. Klaus Kinkel spoke this morning on behalf of the European Union. Theviews of my delegation are faithfully reflected in hisstatement and  consequently  there is no need for me toaddress the positions he has outlined.Five years ago the talk was of a new internationalorder. The events that shook Eastern Europe at that timeled us to believe that the old bipolar world had expired andthat another order was bound to take its place. For some the reaction to the aggression against Kuwait marked thebeginning of this new phase. Reality did not live up to ourhopes. Today we have come to understand that theequilibrium based on a bipolar world did not have a""natural successor"" and that it is up to us to build a newone  little by little  through trial and error.Of course  a new equilibrium is emerging in severalparts of the world.First  there is the highly symbolic case of the MiddleEast. Even if implementation of the Washington and Cairoagreements is proving as arduous as was expected  everynew stage constitutes an important step towards lastingpeace. The historic rapprochement between Israel andJordan strengthens this prospect.The new South Africa  too  is facing immensechallenges  but at the same time it has become a beacon ofhope for the entire African continent.The strengthening of democracy and the progressmade in regional integration in Latin America seem to usyet another meaningful evolution. A number of countriesin this region have now found the way towards sustainableeconomic development.The same holds true for Asia  where  moreover  areadiness for dialogue now exists. The regional Forumlaunched by the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)  contacts on the Korean peninsula and  at anotherlevel  the dialogue between the two sides of the FormosaStrait all contribute towards a new climate of confidence.While preparing to welcome four new members  theEuropean Union has signed cooperation agreements withthe majority of the countries of Central and Eastern Europethat might ultimately lead to full membership.Simultaneously  new geostrategic ties are being forged withRussia.The same will for dialogue is reflected in thediscussion of major issues that concern the future of ourOrganization  such as reform of the Security Council.Even if divergences of opinion remain on various points the sense of common interest prevails.Belgium’s major concern remains the achievementof a more representative Council without diminishing itsdecision-making capacity. We prefer therefore to avoidambitious projects that would give privileged status toseveral ""regional Powers"" according to imprecise criteriabut would not reinforce the Council’s ability to shoulderits responsibilities.Why not  as a first step  adapt the Council’smembership on the basis of unanimously agreed criteria?The international community could  as a measure withimmediate advantageous effect  grant an additionalnon-permanent seat to the regions that considerthemselves to be underrepresented and confer permanentmember status on those two economic Powers whosepositive contribution to world affairs has long beenrecognized.These steps  however encouraging  do not bythemselves constitute a new international agreement.Progress and the readiness for rapprochement are by nomeans universal: Central Africa and Bosnia andHerzegovina are cases in point.The situation in Rwanda is uppermost in our minds.The threat it represents of destabilization in Burundi andthe neighbouring countries has become a constant causefor worry in recent months. However deep the hatredborn of the recent or the distant past  reconciliation is theonly alternative. We appeal to the leaders and prominentcitizens of these countries to unite their efforts to broadenthe base of political power and to stand firm againstextremists. Only when these conditions are met canemergency aid make way for durable reconstruction.Naturally  my country will contribute to each stage of thisrenewal.The civil war in the former Yugoslavia has cast firstEurope and then the entire world into profound disarray.Yet for more than three years now  we have beenworking relentlessly to put an end to this tragedy. TheUnited Nations Protection Force has become one of thelargest peace-keeping missions ever set up by ourOrganization. The United Nations and the EuropeanUnion have worked together tirelessly to find a negotiatedsolution. The main Powers have now added their weight9to these efforts. Let us hope that the latest attempt by theEuropean Union  the United States and the RussianFederation will finally succeed in halting the bloodshed.From this rostrum I call upon the parties to seize thisopportunity: put an end to madness and let peace return.I have just touched upon two cases of civil war whereracial hatred has led to particularly inhumane behaviour.More than ever  we must remain unyielding when humanrights are systematically violated. We must aim to banishevery regime that is based on practices of ""ethniccleansing"".So that this lesson may never be forgotten  Belgiumfavours the establishment of an international penaljurisdiction and expresses the wish that the internationalcommunity do whatever is necessary to render itoperational as soon as possible. In the meantime  webelieve that the Tribunal created to judge the war crimesperpetrated in the former Yugoslavia will stand as avaluable precedent  which we would like to see extended tothe crimes committed in Rwanda as soon as possible.Along the same lines  my Government welcomes theappointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights.The operational initiatives launched by Mr. Ayala Lasso -sending human rights monitors to Rwanda  for instance -have received early and concrete support from Belgium among others. I am convinced that Mr. Ayala Lasso’sactions will strengthen the respect for human rights andpromote a successful dialogue among political leaders andhuman rights activists in every part of the world. Thisdialogue will take into account the differing approachesinspired by various cultures and religions  but in myopinion  it would lose its meaning if it were to compromiseon the one essential point: the respect owed to the physicaland moral integrity of every human being.For Belgium  the crisis in Rwanda has marked theinternational agenda. In the wake of the genocide  deathlashed out blindly at a population in exile  pushing back thelimits of horror already reached in Bosnia and Somalia.My fellow citizens were deeply troubled by the ruin of somany efforts of development  the failure of so manyattempts at reconciliation. The savage killing of 10 Belgian""blue helmets""  who were among the 100 United Nationspeace-keepers slain since the beginning of this year highlights the unmistakable fragility of peace-keepingoperations. I believe the best way to honour all those wholost their lives is by reflecting in particular upon the limitsand possibilities of international action.In this regard  the common experience in whichBelgium took part - in the former Yugoslavia  in Somaliaand in Rwanda - has enabled us  sometimes in tragiccircumstances  to make a number of observations forfuture use. I intend to group them around four principlesthat seem to me essential. First: peace-keepingoperations cannot be improvised. Second: once decided they should be given the means to achieve their aims.Third: for these means to function fully  we shouldensure their operational and political coherence. And finally  as long as the security of the personnel involvedcannot be guaranteed  it will become increasingly difficultto find troop contributors for peace-keeping missions which will thereby reduce them to a purely theoreticalinstrument.First  the principle of ""non-improvisation"" impliestwo things.The first is that the Organization must at all times beable to mobilize the necessary means for a peace-keepingoperation and to this end rely on the solidarity of all itsmembers. This means that it is essential to reinforce themilitary peace-keeping capacity of the Organization. Inthe absence of a United Nations multilateral force that canbe deployed quickly  generalized offers of stand-by troopsand equipment and standardization of equipment andprocedures are objectives we must pursue diligently. Tothis end I have sent the Secretary-General a list ofpossible Belgian contributions which could be madeavailable for peace-keeping operations.The second implication is that  even thoughsolidarity remains the basis for conceiving andimplementing peace-keeping  this solidarity cannot beblind and automatic. Each specific operation must be theresult of careful consideration.The launching of a new peace-keeping operationshould only be envisaged and seriously considered whenall other means of solving the crisis have been exhausted including at the regional level. Chapter VI  as well as""An Agenda for Peace""  offer a wide choice ofinstruments for solving a crisis through negotiation arbitration  and so on. Those who forget thatpeace-keeping operations are not a panacea do theOrganization a disservice and often unwittingly contributeto making situations worse rather than solving them.Once it has been decided by the Security Council  apeace-keeping operation becomes everybody’s business.All Member States must contribute according to their10possibilities and as circumstances dictate. Of course Member States must retain the sovereign right to decidewhether or not to participate in a given peace-keepingoperation  but in so doing  they should look beyond thecriterion of national interest.All States should cooperate actively with a view to thesuccess of the operation by facilitating its movements supplies  reinforcements and the prepositioning of reservetroops. All States should use their diplomatic influence tohelp the Secretary-General achieve the political objectivesof an operation. And  finally  all States must adhere totheir financial obligations with respect to an operation.Secondly  a peace-keeping operation must be based onthe consent of the parties  appropriate flexibility andadequate information.Every operation must be based on consensus amongthe States legitimately involved. The conflicting partiesthemselves must agree to the deployment and aims of theoperation  except in the case of an obvious humanitariancatastrophe. In this all-too-frequent case  the SecurityCouncil’s decision to act outside the framework of thetraditional mandate and disregard the three usualconditions - in other words  agreement by the parties  thepolitical process and a cease-fire - must be taken with greatcare. The Council must express this decision clearly in themandate and accept all its consequences.An operation must at all times have the strengthnecessary to execute its mission safely. This rule is ofutmost importance. It implies  to begin with  sufficientmanpower and flexible rules of engagement to respond tothe unexpected. It also implies adequate equipment to fulfilthe mandate and to react to emergencies. The deploymentof a military reserve in the vicinity has already proven itsusefulness  for example  in Somalia. It is a precautionarymeasure we should envisage more often in the future. Asa rule  a force subject to local provocation must alwayshave the choice between evacuating or remaining in place between retreat or riposte.But the use of force is not the first option to beconsidered in order to discourage resistance to apeace-keeping operation. Education and persuasion will domiracles among populations that are often ill-informed oreven misguided about the objectives of a peace-keepingoperation. Experience has shown that it is absolutelynecessary to develop a coherent information strategy. Eachpeace-keeping operation should be provided with aninformation unit and a radio transmitter to broadcast itsmessage. Moreover  the ability to neutralize hostilepropaganda sources should be put to use each time thispropaganda threatens the safety of part of a population orUnited Nations personnel.The third consideration is that the cohesion of thecommand and control structures and consultations on aregular basis with troop-contributing countries areconditions essential to the success of an operation.The military and political control of an operationmust rest with the United Nations or with a dulymandated body. This principle has two consequences.Any attempt by the Commander of the Force or ofa small contingent to report directly only to nationalauthorities will reduce the cohesion of the multilateraloperation. The flexibility required by a commander in thefield to deal with the unexpected  however  is a differentmatter.When an action is undertaken by a regional ormultilateral force it must be authorized by the SecurityCouncil. However  this authorization should not reducethe operational autonomy of the commanders of such anoperation. Those who take the risk must be in control.Moreover  for each operation a consultationcommittee should be created in which troop contributors the members of the Security Council and the Secretariatcan meet at regular intervals. This committee will enablethe contributors better to assist the Secretariat inmanaging the operation.It will also generate a real dialogue betweencontributors and the members of the Council  each timethe latter prepare to take a decision which modifies thebasic conditions of the operation. Contributors often havea better knowledge of the situation in the field and arebest placed to judge whether a new task is feasible oracceptable. Without troop contributors the resolutions ofthe Council would remain ineffectual.As a fourth and last consideration  the security of theblue helmets is as much a concern of the contributingcountries as of the Secretariat. The prosecution of thosewho attack the peace-keeping forces must be efficientlyorganized.The responsibility of a Government for its contingentdoes not stop with its dispatch to the field of operations.The contributing country has the right to watch over the11safety of its compatriots at all times. Ultimately  securitymust be the decisive factor for a contributing country tocontinue or suspend its participation in a peace-keepingoperation.It seems normal  therefore  that a troop contributorshould be entitled to equip its contingent from the start withsufficient defensive armament. Later  when unexpectedcircumstances place the contingent in a situation of realdanger  the Security Council and the Secretary-Generalmust immediately adapt the mandate and  if necessary  therules of engagement to that situation.It is a fundamental duty of the United Nations toorganize the international prosecution of those who attackUnited Nations personnel. The impunity granted so far tothe perpetrators of such crimes gives rise to an uneasyfeeling and undermines the credibility of the United Nationsin the eyes of world opinion. The authority of ourOrganization over those whom it is trying to reconcile isnegatively affected by this  and the Governments thatcontribute troops are increasingly worried. In our opinion it is essential to speed up the adoption of a convention onthe security of United Nations personnel  as well as of theinvestigations and the effective prosecution of those whoattack our personnel.I hope that these thoughts that I have shared with theAssembly will contribute to improving the procedures andreinforcing the means put into effect by our Organization toface up to the new situations that it needs to tackle. Infact  these changes deserve to be formalized when anyrevision of the Charter takes place. The functioning of thepeace-keeping operations would be greatly improved bythis.Alexis de Tocqueville wrote:""Amongst the laws that govern human societies  thereis one that seems clearer and more precise than allothers. If men are to remain civilized  or become so the art of association must grow and improve at thesame rate as the equality of their conditions"".Though this ""art of association"" affects civil societies in thefirst place  it is also  and more than ever  a concern of oursociety of Governments. Launching peace-keepingoperations is without doubt a most generous expression ofthis art of acting together.In the meantime  the fact that we have been able tomultiply peace-keeping operations in difficult political financial and material circumstances is nothing short ofmiraculous and prompts us to pay tribute to all the peoplewho have been working tirelessly within the Secretariat aswell as in the field."
"14",540,"BEN",49,1994,"Ishould like first of all  Mr. President  to tell you howpleased the Benin delegation is to see you presiding overthis session of the General Assembly. This is an honourfor all of Africa  and especially your country  with whichBenin has age-old ties of friendship and  still more  offraternity.At a time when  more than ever before  the UnitedNations is called upon to act in the interests of peace andthe well-being of mankind  this election isacknowledgement by the international community not onlyof the dedication of Côte d’Ivoire to the cause of peace andprosperity but also of your personal qualities as a seasoneddiplomat.Benin is proud to see a distinguished representative ofa country from the subregion of West Africa assume thisimportant responsibility  and can assure you  Sir  of thecooperation and support of its delegation - and here wewish also to congratulate the other members of the GeneralCommittee.I would be remiss if I did not align myself  with greatemotion and pleasure  with what His Excellency Mr. KonanBédié  President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire said  thatin your election we can already see that Africa is resistingmarginalization.I should also like to pay tribute to your eminentpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally ofGuyana  who assumed with such great competence and skillthe presidency of our Assembly at its forty-eighth session.He has left an indelible mark on this world Organizationthrough his personal contribution to our efforts atrevitalizing the General Assembly  restructuring theSecurity Council and resuming development.On behalf of the people and the Government of Benin I should like to pay a most deserved tribute to the UnitedNations and its Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the intensive activities they have been carryingout for peace and development for all peoples  especially atthis time when armed conflict  ethnic clashes and tribalwarfare distort the basic values of mankind.I should also like to welcome the granting to theSovereign Military Order of Malta of Observer status at theUnited Nations.Since our last session  positive developments havetaken place in the settlement of internal  local and regionalconflicts that have caused upheavals in the internationalarena. I would mention  among others  the emergence ofa new South Africa  one that is united  democratic andnon-racial  where each person can at last enjoy fullcitizenship.Benin hails once again the courage anddetermination of the South African people - courage anddetermination that have enabled all humanity to win thishistoric victory  one of dialogue over confrontation and ofpeace over violence.Our Organization  which is proud of its contribution must see to it the consolidation of the policy of unity andnational reconciliation and reconstruction pursued byPresident Nelson Mandela  whose wisdom and clear-sightedness are equalled only by the historic dimensionsof the man himself.In Mozambique  our most cherished wish is for acontinuation of the process of reconciliation currentlyunder way until the final holding in October of free anddemocratic elections in that country  stricken by so manyyears of civil war.Similarly  we express the hope that in Angola thenegotiations under way between the Angolan Governmentand UNITA might lead to an effective cease-fire and tothe establishment of a lasting peace  which are absoluteprerequisites for reconciliation and national reconstruction.With regard to the question of Palestine  wewelcome the positive and irreversible developmentstowards a just and lasting settlement since the historicsigning  between the Palestine Liberation Organizationand Israel  of the Declaration of Principles on Palestinianautonomy in Gaza and Jericho. In the same context  theBenin delegation would encourage Israel and the ArabStates to continue to improve their relations throughcooperation and mutual understanding for theestablishment of lasting peace in the Middle East.As regards the situation between Kuwait and Iraq  itis important  in the interest of security and stability in theGulf  that Iraq confirm clearly  and without ambiguity  itsrecognition of the sovereignty  independence  territorialintegrity and the international borders of Kuwait byagreeing  among other things  to Security Councilresolution 833 (1993).Other conflicts are now in the process of beingsettled elsewhere  for example in Cambodia and Central31America  where praiseworthy efforts are under way with aview to the gradual and definitive normalization of thepolitical situation.In spite of these encouraging facts  we regret to notethat the persistent activities of forces for fragmentation anddisintegration are hindering the achievement of peace incertain parts of the world.In this context  we should point out  inter alia  thevery alarming situation in Somalia  where militaryintransigence and political intolerance are to no availprolonging human suffering  jeopardizing the lives of thestaff of United Nations peace-keeping and peacemakingoperations  and provoking some irritation within theinternational community  whose valuable contribution to apeaceful and lasting settlement is absolutely necessary. Itis time for the protagonists  on whom an acceptablesolution to their conflicts depends  to show good will andflexibility.We deplore the fact that in Liberia  in spite of theconsiderable efforts made by the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS)  supported by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and by the UnitedNations  the implementation of the Cotonou agreement hasbeen carried out only begrudgingly. Six months aftertaking office on 7 March 1994  the National TransitionalGovernment has not yet managed effectively to extend itsauthority to the entire country  whereas the disarmamentand demobilization process is practically suspended.Since a return to normalcy in Liberia is absolutelynecessary for the continuation of the programme ofeconomic integration of the subregion of West Africa  mycountry urges the Liberian parties to abide by the Cotonouagreement so as to speed the return of the country tonormalcy. Once again Benin encourages the internationalcommunity to maintain and increase financial assistance soas to enable the ECOWAS Military Observer Group expanded by troops from Uganda and Tanzania  to fullydischarge its mandate.With regard to Rwanda  ravaged by a war reminiscentof another age  Benin joins in the indignation expressed bythe international community by condemning mostvigorously the massive and systematic violations of humanrights and of international humanitarian law. We welcomethe humanitarian activities and good offices of the UnitedNations  of the OAU  of France  of the United States ofAmerica  of the African countries  and particularly those ofthe subregion  as well as those of non-governmentalorganizations in coming to the assistance of refugees andhelping to initiate a dialogue among Rwandans. Thedelegation of Benin is convinced that any lasting nationalreconciliation in Rwanda must be based on the Arushaagreement of 4 August 1993 in order to maximize theopportunities to rebuild the country.But in order to avoid a repetition of the Rwandanholocaust elsewhere  we should support efforts to identifythose guilty of abuses  whoever they may be  so that theymight answer for their crimes against humanity.In neighbouring Burundi  most recently torn byarmed clashes  the return to a precarious calm and theagreement for a government that was recently signed bythe parties to the conflict bear witness to a new awarenesson the part of that fraternal people  the fate of whom hadbeen of great concern to all peace- and freedom-lovingmen and women throughout the world. We urge themmost earnestly to continue along this path so as toconsolidate their unity and cohesion.Furthermore  the international community hasfollowed very closely recent developments in the situationin Haiti. In fact  on the basis of Security Council 940(1994)  the United States Government showed firmnessand intelligence by forcing the Port-au-Prince dictators toagree to give up the power they seized three years ago.Benin exhorts the United Nations  the Organizationof American States and the United States of America tounite their efforts to bring about the effectivereinstatement of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and thepeaceful restoration of democracy in Haiti. The Republicof Benin is prepared  within its modest resources  to makeits contribution to the triumph of peace and democracy inHaiti.In Europe - specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina -it is to be regretted that the Serbs have rejected the latestpeace plan of the Contact Group  which offered them49 per cent of the Bosnian territory. We will welcomethe agreement by the Belgrade authorities to deployUnited Nations forces along their country’s borders andto enforce the international arms embargo.Faced with the intransigence of the Bosnian Serbs the international community should take over theprotection and defence of the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Bosnia  so as to avoid any spread of thisinterminable conflict  which has already been exacerbatedby the hateful practice of ""ethnic cleansing"".32Following the collapse of ideologies  the role of theUnited Nations in world affairs is and remains essential.We should avoid any weakening of its ability effectivelyand efficiently to promote peace  as this would do greatharm to its credibility. The revitalization  restructuring anddemocratization of the United Nations must continue inorder to increase its efficiency in carrying out the work ithas undertaken.This  for example  should be the case for the SecurityCouncil  which has the responsibility of acting on behalf ofMember States for the maintenance of international peaceand security. Its legitimacy  its credibility and itseffectiveness will be strengthened if we are able to takesteps to enlarge it and change the composition of itsmembership so as to reflect the increase in the number ofStates Members of this world Organization.Aware of the fact that  in this new context  theSecurity Council cannot remain as it was designed andcreated a half-century ago  the delegation of Benin is infavour of a patient search for consensus on all issuespertaining to its reform.The production  international transfer andaccumulation of arms are a threat to peace and stability theworld over. This is why the international community’scommitment to peace requires the firm determination tomake real progress in the process of general and completedisarmament under international control.In the area of conflict prevention and crisismanagement  we must strengthen the capabilities of theUnited Nations and support the idea of good offices and ofpreventive diplomacy as advocated by the Secretary-Generalin the Agenda for Peace.Respect for the principle of the sovereignty of Statescould hinder the implementation of this approach. Indeed crises or conflicts today are for the most part internal innature - civil wars  territorial partitions  ethnic clashes religious or tribal struggles  and so forth. But these crisesand conflicts can also threaten international peace andsecurity. Hence there is a balance to be struck betweenintervention and respect for the sovereignty of States.In this context  we shall continue to encourage closecooperation with regional organizations  pursuant to ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter. Within Africa  there isalready in place a mechanism for preventing  managing andsettling conflicts which makes the development andstrengthening of such cooperation possible.I would also mention  as part of regionalcontributions to global efforts for peace  the conclusionsreached by the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Zone ofPeace and Cooperation in the South Atlantic  held inBrasilia on 21 and 22 September 1994.We can never emphasize enough the closerelationship between peace  democracy  human rights andsustainable development. And we should be pleased thatour Organization offers a proper framework for theachievement of consensus on this relationship. TheDeclaration and Programme of Action of the importantWorld Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in1993 prove that the international community isdetermined to face up to these non-military threats topeace and security the world over.Economic and social issues are of concern today tothe entire world and raise moral issues among politicians Governments and representatives of civilian society. Theend of the cold war  far from ironing out difficulties  hasfurther widened the gap between the developed and thedeveloping countries. The developed and the developingcountries must work together and understand one anotherif there is to be progress and  especially  peace for all.There are many social and economic problemsfacing the world  and we must attack these ills at theirvery roots. The preparations for the commemoration ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the UnitedNations  and the major conferences it has organized since1994  provide us with an opportunity to better deal withthe major problems that are undermining and marringtoday’s world.Above and beyond general political declarations promises unkept and wishes unfulfilled  all the actors inthe international community must by common agreementdraw up concrete  effective and immediate solutions thatwill allow us to avoid chaos in the developing countries in particular in Africa and in the least developedcountries. Otherwise  our expectations for the beginningof the twenty-first century will not be met.None the less  there is room for hope when weremember that the Assembly  in resolution 47/181 of 22December 1992  asked the Secretary-General to submit toit a report on an agenda for development  after consultingwith Member States. The drafting of this agenda  to beadopted during the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  will be a cleardeclaration of the right to development and a reorientation33of the objectives and priorities of the United Nations systemtowards socio-economic activities and programmes designedfirst and foremost to eliminate poverty and then to develophuman resources through education  training  the creation ofproductive employment  and social integration.It is thus possible to change the current situation andto reverse the process of impoverishment  aggravated byeconomic stagnation. The agenda for development willusefully complement Agenda 21 and the Agenda for Peacein the quest for sustainable development.Our vision of the twenty-first century and ourprospects for the future should be illuminated andstrengthened by the effective implementation of the variousprogrammes and plans of action adopted since thebeginning of this decade within the framework of theUnited Nations system. I would like to cite  as examples the Plan of Action for children  the Programme of Actionfor the least developed countries in the 1990s  and theUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africain the 1990s (UN-NADAF). While the implementation ofthe first two programmes has already begun and we willalready be able to take stock of them a mid-term review in1995  UN-NADAF is still in its infancy. Indeed  there hasbeen no concrete action  no funding for projects and nocommitment of financial resources since the adoption of thenew programme in December 1991 by the GeneralAssembly.Furthermore  the planned resumed session to continueand complete negotiations on the draft resolution to createa diversification fund for African commodities hasremained wishful thinking - for want  we are told  of apresident to lead the debates and to conclude the work -and all this  in spite of the efforts made by the President oflast year’s General Assembly session.None the less  we welcome the conclusions andrecommendations of the second part of the thirty-fourthsession of the Committee for Programme and Coordinationon a revised  system-wide plan of action for economicrecovery and development in Africa.But we need not limit ourselves to establishing acloser relationship between a system-wide plan and UN-NADAF or to determining the priority sectors to be thefocal points of action carried out thanks to the cooperationof United Nations bodies for the remaining period of theplan’s implementation. In addition to the present resources we must mobilize supplementary resources for the effectiveimplementation of the activities and programmes involved.The economic and social crises that today arecausing upheaval in Africa have highlighted thechallenges to be taken up by that continent in order tomake progress along the path of development. To copewith these crises  most of our countries have undertakenfar-reaching political and economic reforms.In Benin  we are continuing our march forward tomake sure that our democratic process - begun almostfive years ago - takes root and that our national economyis consolidated. In spite of substantial efforts andsacrifices  our political and economic structures remainfragile and vulnerable.Furthermore  taking up the challenges of the 1990sin Africa necessarily means finding rapid and lastingsolutions to problems linked to foreign indebtedness seeking an inflow of new financial and other resources tomeet the growing development needs  ensuring thetransfer of new and appropriate technology; andpromoting a truly open and equitable system ofinternational trade  as well as encouraging thediversification and modernization of African economies.As regards external debt  the developed countrieswill have to exert clear and resolute politicaldetermination by pursuing a policy of cancelling outrightthe official debt of the African and least developedcountries; by deciding  in the managing boards of themultilateral financial institutions  to reduce by 50 per centthe multilateral debt of the developing countries particularly of the African and least developed countries;and by negotiating with the banking institutions arescheduling of commercial debt. We remain convincedthat these initiatives are within the scope of theGovernments of the developed countries and can beimplemented in a demonstration that the world ischanging.With regard to international trade  the mixed resultsfor Africa of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round giveus little hope that  within the framework of internationaltrade  our countries will soon emerge from themarginalization in which they have existed since the late1980s. As in all previous rounds of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade  the Uruguay Round ledto the elimination of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.But the common estimates of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Developmentshow that the overall result of this eighth round ofnegotiations will only benefit the industrial countries. For34Africa  for example  the OECD studies predict losses ofover $2 billion by the year 2002  not to mention the factthat the countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacificthat are linked to the European Union by the LoméConvention risk losing certain advantages they haveenjoyed until now.Furthermore  the results of the negotiations of theUruguay Round are making the developing countries particularly those of Africa  dependent on food productsimported from developed countries  whereas the objectiveof the current strategies is to ensure food security in Africa.In such circumstances  Benin earnestly hopes that the firstaction taken by the World Trade Organization will be toclose the loopholes of the negotiated text by making bolddecisions and recommendations on behalf of Africa andthereby correcting drawbacks foreseen from the outset.The decisions and recommendations of the EarthSummit will  as they are implemented  gradually becomesolid landmarks for current and future generations in thebuilding of a society that  thanks to the achievement ofsustainable development  will not run the risk of self-destruction.In this framework  Benin welcomes the adoption on 6May 1994 in Barbados of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates. Benin also welcomes the conclusion in Paris on 17June of the International Convention to CombatDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing SeriousDrought and/or Desertification  Particularly in Africa. Wehope that this Convention and the regional Annex forimplementation in Africa will serve as a basis for a newcontract between Governments  donors and localpopulations in their efforts to combat desertification andmitigate the effects of drought. This new contract must bereflected in firm and precise commitments of financialresources and the transfer of ecologically sound technology.If it is not  we will find ourselves in the same unfortunatesituation that led  because of a lack of sufficient resourcesand the poor management of those allocated  to thenon-implementation of the results of the United NationsConference on Desertification held in Nairobi in 1977.Benin therefore appeals to all States to attend the signingceremony for the Convention on 14 and 15 October inParis.The curtain has barely dropped on the CairoInternational Conference on Population and Development which marks the birth of a new process for population anddevelopment strategies. The intensity of debate during theConference was commensurate with the importance of theissue. In order to meet the challenge of the developmentto which countries throughout the world aspire  we mustset our children and women  who represent the majorityof the populations of our countries  along the road toprogress  which requires information  education andtraining.The work of the preparatory committees forimportant United Nations conferences being organized atthe moment - especially the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  the Fourth World Conference on Women the second United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (Habitat II) and the entry into force on 16November 1994 of the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea  completed last July with the agreementon Part XI - will strengthen the positive trend clearlyexpressed during earlier negotiations. Nevertheless  thelife-giving flame fed by the spirit of Rio de Janeiro mightgo out if intellectual efforts are not complemented by amobilization of new and addition financial resources tocarry out all the activities planned.The World Summit for Social Development willbring together for the first time Heads of State orGovernment in order to take decisions on socialdevelopment. Benin believes that the declaration andprogramme of action to be adopted in Copenhagen inMarch 1995 should not be limited to acknowledging andaccepting the fact that Africa is the continent facing thegreatest number of social problems. These twodocuments should be a reference point that clearly definesconcrete measures  an implementation schedule and theestimated costs of activities aimed at eliminating povertyand creating productive employment and socialintegration.Benin suggests that the Copenhagen Summitrecommend the proclamation of an international decadefor the eradication of poverty  which would be thecontinuation of the International Year for the Eradicationof Poverty adopted under General Assembly resolution48/183.The new international situation calls forstrengthening  democratizing and rationalizing theactivities of the United Nations  and it is up to us theMember States to make an outstanding contribution in thepursuit of the noble objectives of peace  justice anddevelopment. We feel that this is possible if all MemberStates respect the obligations incumbent upon them underthe Charter.35The delegation of Benin is convinced that our currentdeliberations will be guided by a common determination totake concerted and concrete steps best suited to thenecessity of maintaining peace and promoting prosperitythroughout the world. In particular  this will require arejection of indecisiveness and self-absorption."
"15",586,"BFA",49,1994,"The honor and the duty of presiding over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly have been entrusted to you  Mr. President  and  through you  to your country  Cote d’Ivoire. Burkina Faso and all of Africa are moved by this signal honor.Beyond the legitimate pride experienced by my delegation  I should like to reaffirm our full readiness to assist you. Your wealth of diplomatic experience  together with your professional and human qualities  will ensure the success of our deliberations.You have succeeded Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  who  with discretion and professionalism  determination and logical organization  guided a forty- eighth session that was rich in ideas  initiatives and various kinds of fruitful contacts. We thank him for this.The Secretary-General	of	our Organization Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali 	has	consistently andcourageously continued both in word and in deed to chart a course designed to reaffirm the mission of the Organization and to participate in defining the present and future spheres of action of the international community.Indeed  vision  courage and patience are virtues of which our world is in dire need. We have moved from the static certainties of the international environment of less than a decade ago to the daily  fluid and dangerous uncertainties that surround us and sometimes overwhelm us  and there is an urgent need to find  or to recover  a reliable compass and collective will and solidarity.However  we have been witnessing a disintegration of the old order. We must indeed note that the post-cold- war period has been characterized by the simultaneous emergence of heated conflicts that pit nations against each other or rend apart their integral elements. From Bosnia and Herzegovina to Rwanda  the causes and means may differ more or less noticeably  but the immediate consequence is always identical: the enormous suffering of peoples.During the forty-seventh session of our General Assembly  Burkina Faso stated:""In their millions  people are cast out into a life of wandering; children are robbed of their childhood  and of their adolescence too; a future without hope is already the lot of a growing number of people caught in the crossfire between one world that is dying and another that is being bomb"". (Official Records of the General Assembly  Forty-seventh Session  Plenary Meetings  21st meeting  p. 86)Africa continues to be shaken by upheavals and crises of all sorts  and particular attention should be paid to them. With regard to Angola  Burkina Faso welcomes the present efforts aimed at implementing the Peace Agreements and supports Security Council resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). We urge UNITA to negotiate with greater firmness and thus allow the Lusaka meeting to yield the hoped-for results for peace and the well-being of the people of Angola as well as of the subregion.As to Mozambique  it is our hope that the holding of free and democratic elections this month will put an end to so many years of confrontation and will further commit this brotherly country to a course of reconstruction and national reconciliation for development and peace.We hope that a solution can be found in Western Sahara within the framework of a referendum whose terms of reference will be accepted by all.We welcome the fact that in Burundi progress is being made in the process begun and supported both by the United Nations and by the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  and we hope that the election of the President of the Republic on 30 September 1994 will make possible positive developments in this situation very soon. Burkina Faso  within the framework of the OAU  is making its contribution to this process.In Liberia  because of the lack of confidence among the parties  neither the demobilization nor the disarmament provided for in the Cotonou Agreement has fully taken place. These measures had been advocated to bring about an atmosphere propitious to the establishment of democratic institutions. Burkina Faso continues to support the Cotonou Agreement of 25 July 1993 as well as the Akossombo agreement of 12 September last.In Somalia  far from the cameras and the media  the tragedy that was so widely reported by those media two years ago continues. The same players are pursuing the same conflict just as chaotically and relentlessly  without any sign of the will to put an end to it through dialog and negotiation.In Rwanda  the unspeakable tragedy that has combined genocide with intransigence has showed the international community its limits and the procrastination of which it has been guilty. After having hastily decided on a withdrawal during the first weeks of April 1994  the international community  responding to the clamorous indignation of public opinion  was forced to review its position and find a way to return to the scene of the tragedy and attempt to limit its shameful and disastrous development. We should like here to thank those who have wished to confine the irreparable and immeasurable damage within the limits of the restored human conscience. Without an active policy of reconciliation and national reconstruction  it is difficult to envisage a calm and stable future for that brotherly country. In this task  which is enormous in all respects  the Government of Rwanda will need all the assistance that can possibly be given it in a clear-sighted  responsible and committed manner. For its part  Burkina Faso  insofar as it is able  will tirelessly continue to make its contribution to Rwanda.Annoyance  irritation and understandable fatigue now hold sway in the Security Council in its consideration of the questions of Liberia and Somalia; indeed  it is even thinking about leaving those two brotherly countries to their own devices. The reasoning put forward for this is that in an environment marked by a plethora of requests for material  financial and human resources  it is impossible to continue to deal with protagonists who prefer war to theloss of a power that has not yet truly even been achieved. It is true that peace cannot be imposed anywhere.Burkina Faso is aware of this and experiences it every day as President Blaise Compaore  putting these convictions into practice  engages in subregional mediation and thus makes his contribution to the great African plan for the necessary and indispensable integration of our continent.Peace thus must be unremittingly pursued. And the task of diplomats is to work to find acceptable and viable terms.Should we then leave all those areas of conflict to their own devices? The answer to this question will tell us more about all of us than about the protagonists of those crises.In Asia and Latin America  the conflict situations with which our Organization is dealing are moving in a direction which gives us reasonable hope to see a settlement very soon. We encourage Kuwait and Iraq to respect resolution 833 (1993) of the Security Council. We are also encouraging dialog between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea  as well as negotiations between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the nuclear issue.Burkina Faso has welcomed and hailed the signing on 13 September 1993 of the historic agreement on the Declaration of Principles between President Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin  and also the signature on 4 May 1994 of the Agreement on Gaza and Jericho. Burkina Faso urges that this policy be pursued.The first democratic elections have taken place in South Africa. The South African people now have leaders that they have freely elected. We once again hail the eminence of President Mandela  as well as the merits of Vice-President De Klerk  for having been able  together with the people of South Africa  to lead South Africa towards a democratic and non-racial society. Here among us at last in the United Nations  South Africa will be able to play and fully shoulder its role in the community of nations  thus strengthening that principle of universality that we supported in a recent initiative concerning the Republic of China.All of this indicates the extent to which political upheavals affect  sometimes in an extraordinary fashionthe haves of men  women and children on all continents. However  to use an expression that was used four years ago during the World Summit for Children  the world continues inexorably to witness a ""silent emergency"" that is still going on and is growing.The global economy has experienced a recession that has more brutally and heartlessly affected the developing countries. This state of affairs has exacerbated situations of injustice and flagrant inequality. The improvement of the economic climate of the developing countries hinges on the growth of financial investment flows  on the transfer of technology  on the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers  on just remuneration for commodities and raw materials. This is not new  and it will be reiterated as long as the developing countries do not have a greater say concerning the processes and machinery for decision-making relating to all these questions.This is why an agenda for development is now urgent and of the highest priority. This agenda should put forward specific measures for implementation focused on growth and development  and integrate the strategies and plans for action negotiated and adopted during the United Nations conferences. From Rio to Cairo  it has been possible to obtain consensus  but what is still missing are the new and additional resources with which to implement the decisions taken. In this connection  we hope that the implementation of the International Convention to Combat Desertification  signed in Paris on 14 and 15 October 1994  will not also suffer from this lack.While the developing countries are fulfilling their share of commitments  the developed countries are balking at making their contributions. This is notably affecting the concept and the implementation of global partnership  which was so highly praised at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.We fear that  as regards the use made of their results  these Conferences have only been understood in terms of their theme  without taking account of development. If these comments are harsh  reality is even more so.Problems build up while financial resources dry up. The eradication of poverty  in such a context  will be difficult to bring about and will have fewer chances for success. The commitment undertaken by the developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their GNP to public assistance for development has not always been respected  except by a few of them.Africa  more than the other continents  is in a situation that is critical and recognized as such by the United Nations. However  from the Program of Action of the United Nations for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa in 1986  to the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  adopted in 1991  nothing concrete has given concrete form to that commitment by the international community.Over the last ten years  the African debt has been discussed ad infinitum  without  however  being reduced or eliminated to an extent likely to allow Africa to relaunch its economy and structure its markets. Several of our partners have made efforts  and we note the decision of the Group of Seven in Naples to expand the Trinidad Conditions to the performing African countries.If this is a step in the right direction  it is not sufficient in a context where  as I said earlier  the deterioration of the terms of trade and the loss of preferential markets are increasing the burden of the debt. We therefore support the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at establishing a fund for diversification  and we call upon the partners of Africa to play an active and positive role in establishing this fund.In April 1994  the signing in Marrakesh of the Agreements of the Uruguay Round opened a new chapter in international trade relations  more or less establishing the marginalization of Africa  which had already been evident throughout the negotiations. We hope that the recently created World Trade Organization will be able to participate in the creation of a multilateral system of trade based on applicable  non-discriminatory relations  and that in particular it will take account of the interests of the developing countries.On the basis of a concern for independence and for the integration of the global economy  access to resources  markets and technology  preferential assistance and compensation measures must be open to the developing countries. The spirit of this new configuration should not be motivated by charity but rather by the awareness that certain measures must be taken to ensure that the development of the world in partnership and solidarity takes place harmoniously. It is in the interest of all of us.The forthcoming World Summit for Social Development  therefore  should emphasize man's needs and put man at the center of development and of international cooperation in drawing up the objectives and specific commitments which we shall be undertaking. Sotoo  the World Conference on Women to be held in Beijing will have to continue that work of intensification begun in Cairo during the International Conference on Population and Development: woman  the best agent for development.For half a decade  the Member States of the United Nations have been involved in a series of Conferences that culminated in an acknowledgment of the following facts. The right to development exists. It must be reflected in reality. It is part of human rights. Development is possible only in peace  and peace itself can be maintained only through development. Democracy and development  therefore  are linked.One after the other  the representatives who have spoken have emphasized the role of the United Nations. The Organization is the most valuable multilateral instrument available to nations. It is important that we give it the means to fulfill our ambitions and our projects.The times have compelled us to confine ourselves to finding the answers that must be found for the urgent situations threatening the lives of human beings. Peacekeeping operations currently face unprecedented complexity and difficulty. We salute and thank the 73 nations that are offering their sons and their resources for the purpose of extinguishing flames kindled throughout the world by man's intransigence and madness.Apart from the question of urgency  there are priorities. If these are understood and dealt with  the emergency situations of tomorrow and beyond will be eased  and we shall come closer to having a more stable  less unjust and more harmonious world.A review of the United Nations system - the role  nature and place of the Security Council and of the General Assembly - is one of the urgent priorities that must be addressed if we are not to harm the future. It will become ever more difficult to wish for democracy in the world if democracy is avoided in the functioning and activity of the United Nations.A year from now we shall be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization. The profusion  complexity and simultaneousness of problems relentlessly assail societies and nature. Mankind will be able to face these challenges and difficulties only by assuming and accepting our complementarity and our interdependence. It is that initiative and that momentum which will renew our bond with the ideals proclaimed 49 years ago in adocument signed in San Francisco  which we call the Charter of the United Nations.Let us  therefore  be an Organization of truly united nations. This is possible only if there is a spirit of justice  peace and solidarity."
"16",629,"BGD",49,1994,"I warmly congratulateyou  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Yourelection is a tribute not only to you personally but also toyour great country  Côte d’Ivoire. I am confident youwill carry forward the high tradition set by yourpredecessor  Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  towhom we owe our deep appreciation.The untiring efforts of the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to renew  reform andrevitalize our Organization deserve our special tribute.As we stand at the threshold of the United Nationsfiftieth anniversary  one goal remains paramount  namely the need to promote human development and humansecurity in all its manifold aspects. The role andrelevance of the people are enshrined in the very firstwords of the Charter. People form the key link that bindour global society  the source of democracy  the object ofhumanitarian concern  the spirit of justice in ensuringhuman and minority rights. They are the cause andobject of all our endeavour.8Too often  people have been ignored  to our peril. Aswe see the stricken faces of men  women and childrenaround our world  the dead  the brutalized  the frightenedand dispossessed  the hungry  diseased and despairing  thislesson is dramatically brought home by the media. And yetour sense of purpose and achievement is ennobled as wewitness the new light of hope dawning in South Africa  theMiddle East  Cambodia and in many other States andsocieties where the painstaking process of peace  democracyand development take root and where solutions arecharacterized with a human face.Individuals find identity in nations and nations derivecognition in universalism. The success or failure of theUnited Nations stems from the contribution each Membermakes to promote its goals. The Organization’s principalmotivation arises out of the responsibility borne by eachnation for the stability and welfare of its own people. It isthe sum total of these individual efforts that marks theUnited Nations measured progress towards maintainingpeace  securing justice and realizing the Charter prerogativeof “social progress and better standards of living in largerfreedom”.The limitations of Governments are also painfullyevident. International cooperation has become animperative  not only because it is possible or necessary  butbecause it is indispensable in a world that has moved frominteraction to interrelationship to interdependence.As we seek to seize opportunities and confrontchallenges at every level — individual  national orglobal — we are deeply aware of the contradictory forcesat work  forces that emanate from both within and withoutour nations. The way we channel these forces intoproductive activities will determine the success of ourcommon endeavour to forge a just and stable world order.On the positive side  ideological walls have tumbled democracy has spread worldwide  more caring andresponsible Governments have come to power andeconomic empowerment and social imperatives havelessened reliance on military culture. Pragmatic cutbacksin strategic weapons and a heightened focus on thedestabilizing capabilities of conventional weapons haveopened doors for more productive use of human  financialand material resources. Historic political changes in theMiddle East and South Africa and political settlements inAsia and Central America can have a far-reaching positiveimpact on those regions.After a long period of stagnation the global economyis poised for its first significant expansion. Thesuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and thecreation of the World Trade Organization as a universalforum for trade negotiations and the settlement of disputeshave brightened prospects for increased trade and long-term growth. More importantly  the desire and ability ofdeveloping countries to contribute to the growth of theworld economy and help to mitigate common globalconcerns as participants and not as bystanders hassignificantly increased.Yet  negative impulses everywhere challenge peaceand security  democracy and human rights  economicprogress and social cohesion. Together  they call for aconcerted response  nationally and internationally  that isnew and imaginative. Today  issues of territorial securityare being overshadowed by concerns over human security.There is increasing recognition of non-military threats tosecurity. Nation States are under siege from multipleforces from within and without that are retarding theircapacity to act effectively and independently.Within States resurgent micronationalism andfactionalism based on narrow self-interest  ethnic andcultural rivalries  bigotry and extremism have contributedto unprecedented human misery. Political instability hasfuelled economic breakdown  and economic backwardnesshas fired political upheaval in a never-ending viciouscircle. Poverty  unemployment and social exclusionpushed by the population explosion  rapid urbanization environmental degradation and a crisis in values  togetherwith rising expectations  have led to social dislocation alienation and sometimes violent confrontation.Demagogues  political separatists and fringe elements arebeing encouraged and supported by powerful externalgroups to challenge the capability and legitimacy ofGovernments to sustain socio-economic reform  peacefulprogress and political stability.New global forces have emerged that no State actingalone can control but which threaten the legitimacy of allStates. Pollution  ecological damage  the spread ofcommunicable diseases and the massive speculativetransfers of monies by electronic means have been thecause and manifestation of a host of cumulative ills.These have been exacerbated by corrosive new threats —organized crime  drug lords  traffickers in women andchildren  arms smugglers  money launderers andterrorists — that eat into all societies  vitiating values andcrippling development. Furthermore  rapid technologicalprogress and transnational processes are reducing the9scope of nation States to act on their own  to regulatedomestic policies and the international movements ofgoods  services  labour and capital.On another plane  fears are surfacing that the bipolarworld of the past 50 years could now assume a newconfiguration  a North-South polarity  not between opposingpolitical and social systems but between rich and poornations. Anxiety is increasing in the South that its interestsare being marginalized; that there is a diversion ofresources away from the South; that its potential to act asa partner in revitalizing the world economy is being ignoredand new constraints  aid conditionalities  rigid adjustmentmeasures  standards of human rights and good governance environmental criteria and military scrutiny are beingselectively imposed. There are signs that  while social andenvironmental issues are being highlighted  vital economicand development imperatives are being sidelined  althoughboth are integrally related and mutually reinforcing.Indeed  there is a crisis in development policy  whichmanifests itself in stagnation  absence of dialogue selectivity and insufficient interest  participation andcommitment.It is against the backdrop of those prospects andproblems that I now turn to the position and priorities ofour Government. There is strong recognition in Bangladeshtoday that to promote representative and constitutionalgovernment  strengthen human rights and ensure socio-economic emancipation a country must increasingly dependon itself. Individual self-reliance must be bolstered bycollective self-reliance through South-South cooperation inconcrete and practical areas of cooperation such as foodproduction  manpower planning  trade  investment and jointventures. The critical catalyst  however  remains areactivation of a constructive North-South dialogue leadingto a more conducive external environment that cansupplement individual efforts.Reaching out to the attainment of these goals Bangladesh has a development policy that embraces afourfold perspective: addressing structural andmacroeconomic reform; stimulating the market economy;increasing the quality and amount of productiveinvestments; and concentrating on human-resourcesdevelopment  particularly the empowerment of women.These perspectives are all linked together by the unifyingtheme of the alleviation of poverty. The cardinal emphasisis on the connection between structural adjustment andalleviation of poverty — that is  the quantity and quality ofprogrammes favouring the needs of the poor and mostvulnerable.Our efforts at reform and consolidation have led tosome positive results. Bangladesh is enjoying todayperhaps the longest period of macroeconomic stability inits history. The budget deficit has been reduced. Importsand exports have increased. Foreign-exchange reservesare comfortable  inflation is at an all-time low  and thereis increased self-reliance in financing our annualdevelopment plans. Today we are financing 38 per centof our development projects from our own resources. Wehave achieved near self-sufficiency in food production and the overall gross-domestic-product growth rate hasreached 5 per cent. The incidence of absolute povertyhas decreased and some headway has been made inadvancing our human-development policy.We can reasonably be proud of our efforts tostabilize population growth and contain and mitigate theimpact of natural disasters. A concerted and determinedfamily-planning programme has yielded positive results.Population growth has fallen from 3 per cent to2.03 per cent  accompanied by progress in reducingfamily size; declining infant  child and maternal mortalityrates; and expansion of the immunization programme tocover 74 per cent of all children.We believe that the recent successfully concludedCairo International Conference on Population andDevelopment has strengthened our efforts in dealing withthree critical  interlinked issues — namely  a holisticapproach to development  of which population policies arebut one essential element; informed choice in accordancewith the laws and culture of each society; and the vitalissue of garnering and allocating additional resources.Preparedness and planning for disasters helped uscontain the consequences of the devastating cyclone of1994 without recourse to outside help. Bangladesh wasable to save countless lives by timely evacuation ofhundreds of thousands of people and to get on withrehabilitation and reconstruction measures on its own.Democracy has taken firm root in Bangladesh. Likeall democracies we have our share of domesticdifferences  but we remain fully committed to workingout our differences through democratic dialogue and therule of law. Fragile democratic institutions and traditionsin new democracies need strong and sustainedinternational support. Our experience has demonstratedvividly that without improved standards of living and avision of the future that can sustain hope  democracy willwither. Equally  without people’s participation thepotential for socio-economic progress cannot be achieved.10It is also clear that  to survive within States  democracyneeds to be sustained through democratization among Statesso that it can expand universally as an essential foundationfor cooperation. We firmly believe that the restoration andconsolidation of democracy worldwide within States andamong States is a vital bed-rock for peace.We are indeed happy that the 1993 World Conferenceon Human Rights  in Vienna  upheld the right todevelopment as a basic human right and as a vital catalystin mutually reinforcing the interrelationship of democracy development and human rights. Widespread poverty andeconomic deprivation seriously vitiate the protection andpromotion of human rights in many societies  despite thebest of intentions. These realities need to be recognized fora realistic evaluation of human rights in developingcountries.For national efforts to succeed  it is essential to createan atmosphere of peace within our own region. Bangladeshcontinues to sustain the momentum and viability of theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC)  not only to promote its fundamental socio-economic mandate but also to create a more receptiveclimate for broad-based confidence building  to reducetension in the region and to contribute to the resolution ofoutstanding differences through dialogue and negotiation.A major endeavour of Bangladesh  as the currentChairperson of SAARC  has been to consolidatecooperation between members so that they may  in thewords of our Prime Minister  Begum Khaleda Zia  turn intopartners of development to combat poverty in the regionand meet the most important challenge to security fromhunger  disease  ignorance and prejudice. The PrimeMinister stated that the options of unilateralism andbilateralism might seem tempting in the short run but in thelong-term interests of the SAARC spirit we need to displaymore commitment for multilateralism and for building abetter regional consensus.Bilaterally  we have taken important steps to strengthenconstructive relations with all our immediate neighbours inpursuit of our policy of friendship  cooperation and peacefulcoexistence with all countries of the world. The exodus of250 000 Myanmar refugees to Bangladesh since 1991 hasimposed an enormous socio-economic and environmentalburden on our country. The rate of repatriation is stillslow  and we hope that with the policy of mass registrationcarried out by the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the pace ofrepatriation will pick up and all the refugees will return totheir country.There has been some improvement in our relationswith our largest neighbour  India  on the issue of thereturn of Chakma refugees and on that of economicinteractions. However  the critical issue of sharingGanges waters remains unresolved. Meanwhile  one dryseason has followed after another without any waterflowing to the Ganges and this is having a cumulativelydisastrous effect on the economy and environment of onethird of our country and on the socio-economic survivalof 40 million people. We earnestly hope that India  ourpartner in the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation and our neighbour  would agree to a fairsharing of common rivers  including the Ganges. Wehope our common friends would recognize theimplications of the situation and encourage the support ofan early and equitable solution.National efforts in the absence of global cooperationhave only limited prospects of improving the humancondition and ensuring peace  justice and development.Recognizing this fact  we are engaged in perhaps the mostcomprehensive exercise ever undertaken to streamline ourOrganization  to reform and restructure its main organsand  together  to forge a more meaningful agenda  onethat is action-oriented  cost-efficient and adequatelyfunded. The Secretary-General has set the stage with hisproposals put forward in An Agenda for Peace and in AnAgenda for Development. The structure and shape of thisworld agenda that is leading us into a new century hasbeen given more refined substance by a variety ofconcentrated suggestions: the outcome of worldconferences and the follow-up to them  making possiblelegislation and new and innovative proposals. They forma continuum that is closely integrated and interrelated.Bangladesh has been an active participant in thisconcerted build-up. Certain key imperatives strike us asparticularly important. The end of the cold war shouldnot mark the end of competition to support developmentaround the world. The global society is only as strong asits weakest link. The world cannot prosper if the poorestcontinue to decline. Peace and development areintrinsically interlinked  and peacemaking and peace-keeping must go hand in hand with peace-building.Resolving social issues must be based on therecognition of the centrality of the individual  theacceptance of human equality  and the worth and dignityof the human person. Yet social development ispredicated on progress in economic development.Together with environment and population  it forms thelogic of comprehensive sustainable development. These11are not separate concerns  but integrated within a compositewhole. The core of development and its main impetus willremain accelerated economic growth fuelled by the input ofadditional resources and by resource generation.The growing divide between rich and poor among andwithin nations is of central concern. The plight of the leastdeveloped countries assumes special poignancy at a timewhen the world economy has yet to show convincing signsof recovery  macroeconomic coordination is weak andpoverty is inexorably deepening. The unabateddevelopment crisis calls for urgent remedial action especially to implement quickly the 1990s Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries. A properresponse to these problems requires accelerating growth writing off debts  wider and preferential access of exportsto markets of developing countries markets  enhanced flowof foreign direct investment and supportive action in thearea of services and labour.The phenomenon of widespread and increasingunemployment and underemployment in both developingand developed countries needs to be addressed as a matterof urgency. Today  even food availability is determined byaccess to employment and financial resources. Rectifyingthe situation of jobless women and combating povertyamong women are major priorities.Reducing damage to the ecosystem and mitigating theconsequences of natural disasters continue to be a greatburden for all concerned. Unchecked consumption ofresources  production patterns triggered by developedcountries and the real plight of the poor need to be dealtwith through remedial action rather than analysis.There has been an increase in the movements ofpeople across borders as migrants  persons seeking asylum refugees or displaced persons. Much closer introspectionis required to analyse and solve this crisis. A key factorwould be the promotion of socio-economic developmentand the protection of migrants.Strengthening the rule of international law isimperative  inasmuch as it offers certainty  predictabilityand the assurance of the legitimate interests of all States.This continues to be the only real protection for smaller andweaker States  especially in areas where the absence of lawcan mean a serious potential for conflicts such as thescarcity and sharing of water  maritime jurisdiction transboundary pollution and environmental damage  andso on. In this context  we welcome the entry into force on 16 November 1994  of the International Convention onthe Law of the Sea.A critical yardstick for all these concerns is the issueof limited resources and the need for new and additionalresources. At the heart of the matter is the need for acommitment to enhance the entire development causerather than particular interests. It calls for balancinglong-term interests that will not only address continuingemergencies and immediate conflicts but will face up tothe underlying silent crisis of development.The absence of peace in our world is a continuingreality. It is manifest in an immense array of conflicts no two of which are alike. They call for solutions thatmust be adapted to widely differing circumstances in newand creative ways. Past  present and potential conflictshaunt us. Many nations bear the burden of recentdevastation and ethnic strife. No one is safe from thethreat of nuclear overkill and nascent nuclearproliferation. The ongoing arms race  the potential of areturn to antagonistic spheres of influence  and the threatof regional hegemony all carry within them the dangersof conflict and destabilization. Yet today  the real heartof our concern is the recognition that any viable solutionmust be directed towards promoting development as afundamental impetus for  and long-term measure of peace.Among Bangladesh’s major priorities are thefollowing.First  of key importance is the preservation of thesecurity of smaller and weaker States and thestrengthening of the rule of law. The enhanced role andcontribution of the International Court of Justice nowassumes much greater relevance.Secondly  the reduction of military expenditures isessential for development and peace. Escalating armsexpenditures continue to consume too large a share ofproductive resources and capacities. From 1987 to 1992 the cumulative peace dividend resulting from reducedmilitary expenses and cut-backs in arms amounted tosome $500 billion in both developed and developingcountries. Little of this dividend was channelled intodevelopment. Reduced reliance on military security mustalso be buttressed through monitoring  regulating andlimiting the growing traffic in arms  especially theclandestine arms trade.12Thirdly  regional efforts and regional disarmament arevital imperatives to stabilize peace. Regional groups canand must harness durable structures of stability at the base through confidence-building measures and broad-basedsocio-economic cooperation. For the first time  in the wakeof the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE) process  Asia has begun to look hard at stepstowards Asian security. The United Nations Centre forDisarmament Affairs has initiated over the past five yearsa vital process of dialogue and interaction that has openedup useful prospects and potential. These provide ananalytical base that strongly supports the goal of promotingregional security arrangements under Chapter VIII of theCharter.Disarmament and arms control are the major vehicleto reduce the threat of destabilization  economic decline andtensions leading to war. A new momentum has beengenerated that needs to be pushed and sustained. Progresstowards negotiating a comprehensive nuclear test ban  thesigning of the chemical weapons Convention  theestablishment of a Register on conventional arms — theseare important milestones on this road. A strengthenednuclear non-proliferation regime has gained in significancewith important advances in nuclear disarmament. A criticalconcern is the objective of extending the Non-ProliferationTreaty (NPT) either indefinitely or for limited periods contingent on progress on the other objectives of theTreaty  nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nucleartechnology. Bangladesh is committed to support thecontinuation and strengthening of the NPT  and we lookforward to actively participating in the 1995 review andextension Conference.Bangladesh has purposefully contributed to UnitedNations peace-keeping efforts  and stands proud of itsrecord as the fourth largest contributor of troops  dispersedover 10 conflict areas. We strongly add our voice inconcert with those who seek to make peace operations amore effective instrument of collective security and toenhance the structural framework for performing andmanaging peace-keeping  including strengthened staff stronger logistic capability and greater coordination standardization and support for training.In the formulation of critical follow-up guidelines tostrengthen peace-keeping we would like to pinpoint thefollowing matters.First  there is a need to define clear-cut mandates withdefinite time frames  objectives and rules of engagementand with secured financing. This must keep in view the realconstraint identified by the Secretary-General  thattraditional assumptions relating to the consent andcooperation of parties  upholding of agreements andminimum use of force have all been under challenge inrecent peace-keeping developments.Secondly  there is a need for impartiality  fulltransparency and continuous consultations with troop-contributing countries so that mandates can be constantlyreviewed  updated and amended. The role of the GeneralAssembly must be enhanced in this regard.Thirdly  there should be clear-cut political directionsand a clearly defined command and control structure foreach operation.Fourthly  contributions to peace-keeping operationsare mandatory and arrears must be paid in full.Resources for peace-keeping should not be at the expenseof resources for development activities of the UnitedNations.Fifthly  decisions on peace-keeping operations shouldinclude provisions for the safety of personnel  appropriatestandardized compensation of all personnel and timelypayments.Intimately connected to the process of peace-buildingin both its political and economic dimension are efforts toreform and revitalize the main organs of the UnitedNations — the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. Bangladesh has been an active participant inthis exercise and will continue to play a constructive moderating and flexible role to promote the realization ofthese efforts for greater democratization  efficiency effectiveness and legitimacy.I turn now to some of the critical political issues onour agenda.Bangladesh’s consistent and categorical position onthe Middle East question and the issue of Palestine needsno reiteration. We believe the Palestinian cause to befounded on justice. We have always stood for acomprehensive solution  which must be based on seriousa commitment by Israel to abide by Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978); theprinciple of returning land for peace; restoration of Arabsovereignty over occupied lands; and recognition of theinalienable national rights of the Palestinians  including aState of their own. We believe that a historic momentumhas been initiated since the Madrid Peace Conference in13October 1991  the signing of the Declaration of Principlesbetween Israel and Palestine in September 1993  the Cairoagreement on Gaza and Jericho and the common agendaagreed between Jordan and Israel this year. We welcomethese vital steps in the peace process  and hope they willlead to a viable and durable settlement.We hail the establishment of a united  democratic andnon-racial Republic of South Africa  a long-cherished goal and applaud all parties for their relentless and courageousendeavour to this end. Our special tribute goes to PresidentNelson Mandela and Mr. de Klerk. Bangladesh looksforward to consolidating our relations with South Africa inmore concrete ways  bilaterally and in all multilateralforums.We are deeply concerned over the vicious cycle ofstarvation  factional fighting  breakdown of centralauthority  economic stagnation and exodus of refugees invarious parts of Africa  exemplified by the situation inRwanda. We are committed to supporting the SecurityCouncil’s effort  especially through peace-keepingoperations  to break this cycle through a comprehensiveprogramme of action that could provide vital reliefassistance  consolidate cease-fires  curtail violence andbring about national reconciliation. We welcome the effortsof the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the ArabLeague to promote and supplement these efforts.In our own region we are anguished by the continuingstrife in Afghanistan  and urge all Afghan leaders to resolvedifferences through peaceful dialogue based on accordssigned in Istanbul  Mecca and Tehran. We fervently hopethat they can reach a broad-based consensus leading to theformulation of a durable government through free and fairelections. We welcome efforts  including those of theSecretary-General of the OIC  the United Nations andspecial representatives aimed at bringing about acomprehensive and peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.The tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues.Plans  deadlines  hopes for settlement have provedinfructuous. The latest plan drawn up by the ContactGroup of representatives from the United States  Russia  theUnited Nations and the European Union has been rejectedby the Bosnian Serbs. At the heart of the issue is thedismemberment of a sovereign Member of the UnitedNations  justified on the basis of pragmatic reality. Thearms embargo imposed on the Bosnians crippled them fromthe outset  making any agreement artificial. Serbianaggression and genocide appalled the world  yet too littlewas done to stop it. Bangladesh believes that much moreneeds to be done to ensure justice  including strengtheningthe mandate and numbers of the United NationsProtection Force (UNPROFOR)  lifting the arms embargo extending exclusion zones and ultimately making thewhole of Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven.The international community has repeatedly affirmedthe inviolability  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We feel thatcontinuing pressure must be maintained on the formerYugoslavia to recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina andeffectively realize a just and negotiated settlement. Ifpresent efforts of the Contact Group fail to result in apolitical settlement we fully support the convening  underUnited Nations auspices  of an appropriately structuredinternational conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina.We are glad that there have been exhaustive attemptsat a peaceful resolution of the problem of Haiti.Bangladesh has pledged its fullest support to this end guided by two key principles: commitment to thepreservation and restoration of democracy wherever it isthreatened in the world  and willingness to serve in peace-keeping operations under United Nations commandmandated by the Security Council. We hope that willremain a cardinal point for the future as well.I may say in conclusion that Bangladesh remainsfully committed to the United Nations as the only forumthat can deal with the cooperative management of theworld’s problems and where we can successfully meet thechallenge of the future by drawing upon our combinedsolidarity to confront it together."
"17",675,"BGR",49,1994,"Let me  on behalf of theBulgarian delegation  congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on hiselection to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly. I should also like to extend myappreciation to his predecessor  Ambassador SamuelInsanally  for his proficiency in presiding over theforty-eighth session.Diverse  often conflicting trends and eventscharacterize the present year  which has marked the endof apartheid in South Africa  a significant breakthrough inthe Middle East peace process and steps towards asettlement of the problems in Northern Ireland. We havealso witnessed  however  the incredible human tragedy inRwanda and the continuing bloodshed in Bosnia. Newhotbeds of tension have emerged in some parts of theworld.What are  in our view  the parameters of the politicalsituation in the world  and Europe in particular? Effortsto build a new world based on the idea of developing thecollective security system envisaged in the United NationsCharter have received additional impetus. Universalstandards for human rights and international mechanismsfor safeguarding them are being devised. The problemsof population  poverty and the global ecosystem are beingaddressed with increasing attention. A concept forrenewed cooperation for development is being consideredin which peace  the economy  the environment  socialjustice and democracy are viewed as aspects of the samemovement towards a better world.At the same time  the elimination of thecontradictions between the East and the West has beenfollowed by destabilization - temporary  we hope - insome regions of the world. Acts of aggressivenationalism and xenophobia  of violence and terrorism are becoming more frequent. The numerous conflictsbased on national  ethnic and religious intolerance aredifficult to manage. Among other things  this hasdisturbed the balance between the efforts to maintaininternational security and the activities in the social andeconomic sphere  against a background of spreading20hunger and poverty and the aggravation of economic andenvironmental problems.These global problems have left their mark onrelations in Europe as in other places. On one hand  new historic possibilities for wide cooperation between allEuropean States have opened up in the process ofpromoting a common European identity. On the otherhand  new  as well as reawakened  national interests andpolicies are taking shape  and these are interacting with and at the same time  counteracting the integration processes.The end of the ideological and military confrontationon the old continent has not yet led to the removal of allbarriers. Europe is still divided into zones that differ interms of security and economic welfare. It is desirable thatthis division be overcome  as the problems of the zoneswith less security could be transferred to those with greatersecurity.The global political dimension of the ongoingtransition to democracy and a market economy in Centraland Eastern Europe has been largely recognized. Despitethe serious decline in living standards and risingunemployment  the Bulgarian people voted for transition.The process of market-orientated reform that started aboutfive years ago is irreversible. Our association with theEuropean Union is a manifestation of the Europeanorientation of my country’s policy and an expression of thepolitical will to adhere to the universal values ofdemocracy. We are adapting our economic  social andtrade mechanisms to those of the European democraciesand are actively participating in political dialogue with theEuropean Union. Though slower than we anticipated  theeconomic reforms in Bulgaria are moving ahead.As a participant in the Partnership for Peace initiativeof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and as a Statewith associate status in the Western European Union Bulgaria will contribute to the improvement of cooperationbetween the Euro-Atlantic and European securityinstitutions and the relevant United Nations structures.On the eve of the session of the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Budapestlater this year  Bulgaria is confident that the high-levelrepresentatives of European countries will come up withnew ideas to improve the functions of the CSCE  includingcooperation with United Nations.The Council of Europe - one of the oldest of theinternational organizations in Europe - has won recognitionas an organization capable of responding adequately andin a timely manner to the challenges of our time bypromoting pluralistic democracy  the rule of law andrespect for human rights.As Bulgaria currently holds the chairmanship of theCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  Ishould like to refer briefly to this body  which alreadycomprises 32 members. Nine States have joined since1989  and nine others are involved in a process ofaccession. Cooperation between the Council of Europeand United Nations institutions and between the Counciland some of the specialized agencies has been developedover many years and has produced concrete results. Thiscooperation has now become triangular - combining theefforts of the Council of Europe  of the CSCE and of theUnited Nations. In addition  there is a developingpartnership with the European Union.In this complex and interdependent environment theUnited Nations must increase its capacity to confront thenew challenges if it is to be effective in peace-makingand in the development of social and economiccooperation between countries. In this context  importantviews and concepts are contained in theSecretary-General’s report ""An Agenda for Peace""  in hisreport on new dimensions of arms regulation anddisarmament and in his agenda for development.Bulgaria values highly the role of the United Nationsin solving problems directly related to the strengtheningof regional and international security. We support apeaceful and equitable solution of the conflicts in theCaucasus region  the Caribbean  Africa and other places.We are particularly concerned about the conflict inBosnia and Herzegovina  which has become one of themost serious challenges facing European States andinstitutions  the entire civilized world and the internationalorganizations. We call for an immediate end to the warand the suffering of the population. A political solutionin Bosnia and Herzegovina must be based on respect forthe interests of all parties. There must be compromiseand realism on all sides. In our view  concerted action bythe participants in the Contact Group is the secondprerequisite for the achievement of a lasting and justsolution to the conflict.Let me once again reaffirm the position of Bulgariaon the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. My country willnot participate  directly or indirectly  in any military21activities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia - noteven under the flag of the United Nations - and we callupon the other Balkan States to do likewise. ""Restraint""should be the key word for the Balkan region. Bulgariawill continue to pursue a constructive and balanced policyand will not take part in any one or other grouping ofBalkan countries. Thus it will maintain its stabilizing rolein the region.Bulgaria subscribes to the view that in the currentcircumstances it would not be appropriate to lift the armsembargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. This  in ourview  would make the conflict even more uncontrollable.We welcome the adoption of Security Councilresolutions 941 (1994)  942 (1994) and 943 (1994)  whichreflect in a balanced way the current developments in theregion. We hope that the easing of the sanctions againstSerbia and Montenegro will be followed by the adoption ofa responsible policy by the party concerned  thus leading tofurther normalization of the situation in the region. Weappeal to the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs to accept theproposed peace settlement and to act in accordance with thenorms of civilized behaviour.The crisis in the former Yugoslavia is directly relatedto yet another important problem - that of equitable burden-sharing  not only in implementing the sanctions imposed bythe Security Council but also in overcoming their adverseeffect on the economies of third countries. The decision toabide strictly by the sanctions has not been an easy one forus. We joined in the sanctions against Serbia andMontenegro - sanctions mandated by the United Nations -in the conviction that they are one of the peaceful means bywhich the international community can contribute to asolution of the conflict. The sanctions have  however caused significant direct and indirect losses to my country.On three occasions since 1991 - as a result of the sanctionsagainst Iraq  Libya  and Serbia and Montenegro - Bulgariahas requested consultations with the Security Councilregarding its special economic problems. Let me point outthat the adverse effects of the sanctions have came at atime of major economic transformation. They distort tradeseriously and hence have a significant negative impact onthe economy  affecting primarily the emerging privatesector.At a time of reorientation of foreign trade within ourEuropean integration policy  the implementation of thesanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(Serbia and Montenegro) has cut off our normal traderoutes to European markets. The lack of adequatealternative transport corridors makes our export activitymuch less competitive and sometimes even impossible.The sanctions are far from being the only source ofour problems and difficulties  but they definitely have aconsiderable negative impact on the overall political economic  security and social situation in my country. Iwould say that the burden of the sanctions exceeds thepoint of reasonable economic and social tolerance inBulgaria  given the lack of adequate financial  economicand trade assistance. Urgent measures are imperative toovercome all those negative effects. Bulgaria wouldwelcome a more active involvement of internationalinstitutions and the developed countries in  for example financing projects for improving the transportinfrastructure of the country as part of the alternativeroad  railroad and communication links in Europe.Another measure could be the provision of better marketaccess for Bulgarian goods and services. We also hopethat the sanctions Committee established under resolution724 (1991) will give favourable and timely considerationto the applications submitted by Bulgarian companies especially those for providing humanitarian aid to theBulgarian minority in eastern Serbia  whose situation is ofprimary concern to us.The United Nations has shown considerableunderstanding of our difficulties and has given us moralsupport. I would like to recall the adoption by consensusof General Assembly resolution 48/210  initiated byBulgaria and sponsored by a number of countries. Wenow look forward to constructive discussions on theSecretary-General’s report on this resolution. This shouldlead to the General Assembly’s adoption of furtherrecommendations for practical steps aimed at assistingthird countries in alleviating their special economicproblems.Bulgaria is of the view that in the process ofrestructuring the United Nations account should be takenof the new political and economic realities of the world as well as the specific problems of countries in transitionto a market economy and of small States  while at thesame time observing the principles of international lawand equality set forth in the United Nations Charter.The improvement of interaction between the GeneralAssembly  the Security Council and theSecretary-General  as well as the restructuring of the22major United Nations bodies in the social and economicsphere  will contribute to reinforcing the role of the UnitedNations in the pursuit of the necessary balance betweenpreventive diplomacy  promotion of sustainabledevelopment and protection of human rights.Bulgaria is following with great interest the ongoingdiscussion on the question of equitable representation on theSecurity Council and increasing its membership whilepreserving its effectiveness. Our country is ready toparticipate actively in the search for consensus decisions.We believe that the Security Council’s work would bemuch more effective if  in the decision-making process onregional issues  the positions of neighbouring countries andStates concerned  as well as those of the respective regionalorganizations  were taken into consideration. This isparticularly important in cases where the Security Councilconsiders the imposition of economic sanctions. It wouldbe useful to prepare and examine in advance a complexevaluation of the negative effects sanctions would have onthe economies of neighbouring countries.There is also a need for greater transparency in theactivities of the sanctions Committees. We thereforesuggest that their meetings should be open to interestedStates. The respective Chairmen could also conductbriefings after each meeting to inform the States of thedecisions taken.The States willing to provide contingents forpeace-keeping operations should also be involved in theSecurity Council deliberations regarding these operations.In addition  the recently established practice of holdingregular meetings of the heads of current operations  themember States of the Security Council and representativesof other interested States should be institutionalized especially in cases where the Security Council considers themandate  composition and nationality of the contingentsinvolved in a particular peace-keeping operation.Bulgaria supports the efforts of the internationalcommunity aimed at preventing the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and at their elimination. Atthe forthcoming Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) review and extension conference  we willadvocate an indefinite and unconditional extension of theTreaty. We are also happy to announce that this yearBulgaria ratified the 1993 Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. TheRepublic of Bulgaria will continue to support regional andglobal initiatives on conventional disarmament and armscontrol.In today’s world  peace and security  democracy andsustainable development are inseparable. We thereforesupport the strengthening of the United Nations role inthe social and economic field.The further liberalization of world trade is animportant factor in development. The successfulconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations provides favourable prospects for wideliberalization and stable growth of world trade. TheWorld Trade Organization will be of paramountimportance for the efficient functioning of the global tradesystem for the benefit of all countries. We expect thatBulgaria will be able to finalize its negotiations onaccession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT)  including the results of the Uruguay Round within a time-frame that will allow us to become a chartermember of the World Trade Organization.Bulgaria is interested in taking all possible measuresaimed at achieving economic stability through sustainabledevelopment. Regional cooperation has a considerablerole in this regard. We hope that the Conference ofMinisters of the Environment of the European countries which is to take place in 1995 in Sofia  will contribute toreinforcing the positive trends in the solution of regionalenvironmental problems.The promotion and protection of human rights andcooperation in the humanitarian field has an especiallyimportant place in Bulgaria’s domestic and foreign policy.We support the strengthening and promotion of theUnited Nations monitoring mechanisms in the field ofhuman rights  the establishment of the post of UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights  theincreased public awareness regarding human rights in allparts of the world and the activities of thenon-governmental organizations. The World Summit onSocial Development in Copenhagen and the Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing are expected to give amajor impetus to the development and protection ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.Next year we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. We await it with a sense ofresponsibility and hope. I am confident that the efforts ofthe international community to build a new world security23system based on the effective maintenance of world peaceand stability  respect for human rights and promotion of themarket-economy principles and of universal democraticvalues will dominate the future of the world Organization.Bulgaria is prepared to contribute to the achievement ofthese goals."
"18",720,"BHR",49,1994,"It is my pleasure at the outset to extend to youas President of the Assembly at its forty-ninth session Sir  and to your fraternal country  Côte d’Ivoire  mysincere congratulations on your election to preside overthis momentous international assembly. I should like toassure you of the cooperation of my delegation. We areconfident that your experience in the affairs of thisOrganization will enable you to conduct the work of thissession with competence and efficiency.I should also like to express our appreciation toAmbassador Samuel Insanally  who conducted theproceedings of the last session with great skill.It is also my pleasure to take this opportunity toconvey our sincere congratulations to the Republic ofSouth Africa on regaining its full membership in theUnited Nations after its liberation from apartheid  trustingthat it will resume its role as active member of theinternational community.I avail myself of this opportunity as well to mentionwith appreciation the persistent efforts and tireless driveof His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  to enhance the role of theUnited Nations in international affairs and to further theOrganization’s noble objectives. We also note withappreciation his sincere and continuous endeavours in thefield of development and international economiccooperation  to which the content of his report “AnAgenda for Development” bears witness.The Secretary-General’s report “An Agenda forDevelopment” prompts us to reflect anew  as we approachthe twenty-first century  upon the future of international3cooperation in all its aspects. The need for suchquestioning undoubtedly gains an air of urgency at a timewhen the features of the international post-cold war orderhave yet to take a clearly identifiable shape. As theinternational community witnessed profound changes in thewake of the 1815 Vienna Conference  the big powers andothers met to establish patterns for relationships amongstStates within the framework of a global order  to bebuttressed by an international consensus. Yet the currentinternational period  fraught with a host of interlockedvariables  is noted for the absence of a similar consensuswhereby the features of the new world order could beidentified.Change is a law of nature. However  the acceleratingpace of change that we witness nowadays is unprecedented;it has sent tremors into the otherwise monotonousprogression of events and has made the present era ahistoric one. It is only by virtue of our understanding ofhistory as the link between past and present that we areable to fathom for even a little while what goes on aroundus.Watching the dramatic changes that took place overthe past few years  one could detect two dominant yetcontradictory trends in the course of those changes. One isthe fragmentation that has occurred in certain regions of theworld  causing the emergence on the political map of newStates on ethnic and cultural bases. The other trend is theinclination towards globalization  especially as the newtechnology and current communications revolution havenarrowed the distances between various parts of the world.The amazing pace and speed of these changes call for newvisions so that the present can be managed and the future’sdimensions charted.The desirable structure of the global world ordershould  in our view  rest on the following basic principles.First  the creation of a new vision for all aspects ofdevelopment. Second  the development of aninternationally agreed-upon mechanism for the maintenanceof world peace and security. Third  cultural andcivilizational interaction among nations.Comprehensive development is a cornerstone of worldpeace. As the Secretary-General has said in his report development is a fundamental human right. It is the safetyvalve for peace. We understand that the concept ofdevelopment means  basically  the achievement andsustaining of socio-economic progress. While somedeveloping countries have been able to overcome some ofthe obstacles to their economic and social development most of them are still caught in the vicious circle ofeconomic problems. If we look back 25 years to considera 1969 study entitled “A Study of the Capacity of theUnited Nations Development System”  we are likely torealize how optimistic that study was and  in contrast how frustrating is the present condition of development indeveloping countries. Hence our conviction that theSecretary-General’s “An Agenda for Development” andhis call for a new vision are an attempt to cast thedevelopment process  with all its human and materialcomplications  in a new form that would meet the basicneeds of developing countries.We would like in this connection to welcome theforthcoming World Summit for Social Development  to beheld in Copenhagen next March. We attach greatimportance to that summit  as it should have the potentialto fulfil expectations in the field of social development inaccordance with the provisions of Article 55 of theCharter. The significance of the summit is underlined byits programme of work  which addresses three importantissues: the alleviation of poverty and eradication of need the creation of employment opportunities and thepromotion of social integration.Economic growth is a central element ofcomprehensive development. Although the worldeconomy’s performance has improved  relativelyspeaking  its growth rate still falls short of the rates of the1970s and 1980s. During 1993  the growth of the worldeconomy has not exceeded one percent  nor is it expectedto grow more than two-and-a-half percent during thisyear  according to economic projections.Economic problems that plague the world economycontinue to have adverse effects on the economies ofdeveloping countries — in particular  on theirdevelopment process. Those countries are beset byeconomic problems that are primarily external and aremanifested mainly in indebtedness  the decline in theprices of commodities including oil  high interest rates the decline in investments  fluctuation of the rate ofexchange  scarcity of cash flows and international tradebarriers.The world is now in need of an equitableinternational economic order that would enable all States small and large  to reap the benefits of experience andgreat accomplishments in the economic field. In spite ofeconomic disagreements between States  the economicsituation will improve with firm political will and the4genuine desire on the part of all States to solve theeconomic problems of the world today.Encouraging signs of change appeared on the horizonearly this year with the signing of the final document of theUruguay Round in Marrakesh and the establishment of theWorld Trade Organization. We hope that the objectives ofthe said Organization will be translated into concrete realityfor the benefit of all humanity. We believe that the termsand framework of the Uruguay Round should translate intoaccess to markets and expansion of international trade tocover all States. In addition  the World Trade Organizationshould contribute effectively to the establishment of a non-discriminatory trade system. Meanwhile  we voice ourconcern that multilateral conventions concerning theliberalization of trade could be thwarted by the use ofenvironmental issues as a means to raise protectionist taxeson international trade  with a view to reducing the use ofcertain commodities in world markets.The second fundamental principle for the world order in our opinion  is the achievement of peace and securitythroughout the world. It should be based on three basicelements: the establishment of a feasible collective-securitysystem  the peaceful settlement of regional and internationaldisputes and disarmament.The history and experience of the United Nations inthe field of international peace and security  which wasoverburdened by the feverish political polarization whichprevailed during the cold war era  should serve as anincentive for the international community to build on thecontent of the Charter with a view to developing a globallyacceptable and supportable mechanism that would be ableto take firm action  pursuant to the provisions of ChapterVII of the Charter  with respect to threats to the peace breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. It is possible in this respect  to develop a pattern of cooperation betweenthe Security Council and regional organizations in mattersrelating to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIIIof the Charter.With regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes  theSecretary-General’s proposals  as set out in his report “AnAgenda for Peace”  should be employed by the internationalcommunity to maintain international peace and security andto develop the means whereby the capability of the UnitedNations to engage in preventive diplomacy  peacemakingand peace-keeping may be strengthened and made moreefficacious. Preventive diplomacy is undoubtedly aneffective instrument for preventing the outbreak andescalation of hostilities between States that would use orthreaten to use force.Disarmament is an important requirement for themaintenance of world peace and security. The nightmaresgenerated by stockpiles of weapons  especially nuclearweapons  continue to haunt humanity and to cause greatanxiety throughout the world in view of the threat thatsuch weapons pose to the human race and its security. Inthe wake of the bipolar era  and as an inevitable result ofthe cold war  the international community has turned itsattention to the question of disarmament. There is anurgent and growing need to put an end to nuclear terrorand to weapons of mass destruction.During the past few years many people  in both thedeveloping and the developed countries  have demandedthat an end be put to the race to acquire nuclear weaponsand other weapons of mass destruction. Although anunderstanding to curb the increase in nuclear stockpileshas been reached as a result of certain concerted efforts those stockpiles have yet to be adequately reduced.It is regrettable that the world has becomecapriciously involved in another dilemma of a differenttype. I refer to the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and related technology through theiracquisition by illegitimate means. Such arsenals and thephenomenon of proliferation must be eliminated if theinternational community is to ensure that internationalpeace and security may be maintained.The third requirement for the establishment of a newworld order is fulfilment of the need of peoples to comecloser to each other  to be better acquainted with eachother through cultural and social interaction with a viewto reinforcing the noble human values and ideals ordainedin monotheistic religions. The world is experiencing animportant epochal transformation as communities shifttheir focus from individual States to regional groupings such as the Cooperation Council for the Arab States ofthe Gulf and the European Union. This phase is expectedto lead to another  in which interaction and cohesionbetween States and regional groups  with their diversecultures  is enhanced  with the ultimate goal of creating aworld that is economically  culturally and intellectuallyinterrelated.The profound apprehension  in terms of history andcivilization  of man’s crisis in modern times leads to theconviction that enlightened dialogue sows the seeds ofcooperation and association between the various nations5and races that yearn for security  tranquillity and stability even if they are at variance in their cultures and in theiroutlook in respect of the human being  life and theuniverse. The polemics to which the final document of theInternational Conference on Population and Development inCairo have given rise are evidence of that variance. Thisreality underlines the need for dialogue  especially since weare at the threshold of the twenty-first century.The significance of the Cairo Conference was due tothe crucial human-life-related issues that it addressed  suchas the family and family planning  productive health  therelationship between the environment and inhabitants andother issues that concern countries  both rich and poor.Bahrain  which participated in that Conference  hasendorsed such provisions of the Final Document as areconsonant with the magnanimous Islamic law  our socialvalues and our national legislation.The Middle East is one of the regions that haveexperienced particularly severe and bloody wars andhostilities. The longest of these was the Arab-Israeliconflict  which repeatedly threatened regional andinternational security. This fact underlines the need toestablish the order of relations between the States of theregion on a basis of co-equal security.I should like to reaffirm here our full support for thepolicy of freeing the Middle East region from nuclear andother weapons of mass destruction and  accordingly —bearing in mind its capability in this field — we call uponon Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. We are confident that the eliminationof such destructive weapons will be of benefit not only inthe area of peace and security but also in the areas ofdevelopment as the resources saved as a result of reducedexpenditure on armaments could be diverted to economicand social areas  thus enabling the peoples of the region toraise their living standards and secure a better life for futuregenerations.Bahrain welcomed the signing of the Declaration ofPrinciples between the Palestine Liberation Organizationand Israel on 13 September 1993 and regarded it as the firststep toward a comprehensive peaceful and just settlementin the Middle East. Since that historic event there havebeen other developments in the peace process. Amongthese was the signing  in Cairo on 4 May  of the self-ruleAgreement between the Palestine Liberation Organizationand Israel. This was followed by the Palestinian self-ruleauthority’s arrival in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. TheJordanian and Israeli sides also were able to sign theWashington Declaration on 25 July this year.We welcome these developments and hope that theywill constitute a first positive move towards acomprehensive and just peace on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and theother resolutions of international legality and the land-for-peace principle. We view these steps as a breakthroughin the attempts to achieve peace  and we hope that theyare the beginning of the solution to the question ofPalestine and of the process of enabling the Palestinianpeople to secure their legitimate national rights  includingthe right to their own independent State.It is our hope that  in the context of the peaceprocess in the region  efforts on the other tracks will yieldpositive results so that the process may be concludedsuccessfully. It is hoped that the negotiations will lead tocomplete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arabterritories  including Holy Al-Quds  the Syrian ArabGolan and southern Lebanon.While we affirm our deep interest in theachievement of peace and development in the Middle Eastregion  the State of Bahrain  as expressed by HisHighness Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa at theopening of the third session of the Consultative Councillast week “deems it incumbent upon it to stress that theensuing peace should be comprehensive  the securitymutual and the development common.”His Highness continued:“All peoples and countries of the region should reapthe tangible results.”It is our conviction that the peace process should becomprehensive and integrated  for it would be futile tofocus on achieving peace and development in one part ofthe region while leaving unresolved problems of others.Mutual security and vital interests should involve allparties that are called upon to take part in peacemakingand mutual development. In this context  all steps by allparties should be taken in a measured  balanced andequitable manner.My delegation wishes to express its support for theSyrian Arab Republic in insisting on its right to regainsovereignty over its territories in the Golan that have been6occupied since 1967. We also call on Israel to withdrawcompletely and unconditionally from southern Lebanon pursuant to Security Council resolution 425 (1978). Thepast has taught us that inequitable peace is the shortest wayto more crises. This must be realized by all those who areinterested in the future well-being and stability of theregion.Security  stability and political balance in sensitiveregions are important. Territorial and boundary claimsaimed at changing the present boundaries of States arematters of concern to my country. It is our conviction thatthe ideal means of dealing with such issues is to respect theexisting and generally recognized borders between States and to settle all differences that may rise by peaceful meansacceptable to both sides.Accordingly  we stress that Iraq should implementSecurity Council resolutions relating to Kuwait and shouldofficially recognize Kuwait’s sovereignty and release allKuwaiti and other prisoners of war and detainees. As wecall on Iraq to comply with the requirements ofinternational legitimacy  we express at the same time ourinsistence on Iraq’s unity  sovereignty and territorialintegrity and our sympathy with the brotherly people ofIraq  who are beset by difficult economic and livingconditions. It is our hope that these conditions will changeonce the causes for them have been removed.It is regrettable that the dispute between the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran in relationto the question of sovereignty over the islands of AbuMoussa  Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb has not abated because it adversely affects the security and stability of theGulf region. With that in mind  the State of Bahrain callson the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the invitationby the United Arab Emirates to seek a settlement of thedispute over those islands through serious bilateral talks andthrough other peaceful means available for the settlement ofdisputes between States by mutual consent.The situation in Somalia is still precarious despite allthe good offices and sincere efforts of the United Nations the League of Arab States and the international communityat large. While we voice our concern over the situation inthat sister nation  we maintain that it is the Somali partiesthemselves that have the primary responsibility for theachievement of peace  the protection of Somali nationalinterests and the rebuilding of the institutions of a unifiedSomalia. Bahrain also supports the recent League of ArabStates resolution calling for the establishment of aministerial committee to follow  along with the Secretary-General of the Arab League  the situation in Somalia anddevelopments there  and to maintain appropriate contactswith a view to finding a suitable solution to the dangerousstate of affairs and to achieving national reconciliation  inthe interest of Somali unity and the well-being of theSomali people.The plight that has afflicted the Republic of Bosniaand Herzegovina for the last two and a half years persistswith full intensity. This year  the Serb aggressors havecontinued relentlessly to commit appalling massacres killings  torture and rape against unarmed Bosnians  inflagrant disregard of the rules of internationalhumanitarian law that outlaw such practices. Inpursuance of their policy of fait accompli through theseizure of more territory  the aggressors persist inpreventing delivery of humanitarian relief supplies violating the sanctity of and destroying places of worshipand carrying out “ethnic cleansing”.The unabated aggression against the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina is a clear test of the effectivenessof the United Nations and its role in providing protectionto populations. The Serb aggression against Sarajevo andGorazde has shown the extent to which the SecurityCouncil is intentionally avoiding ensuring that its ownresolutions are implemented against the Serbs. Althoughin all its relevant resolutions  including resolutions 900(1994) and 913 (1994)  the Council has affirmed thesovereignty  unity  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina none of these resolutions have yet been enforced. TheSecurity Council is now in a dilemma  sincedevelopments have shown the great difference betweenadopting resolutions and taking action to implement them.The adoption by Security Council of resolution 943(1994) which relaxed the sanctions against Serbia andMontenegro was  in our view  tantamount to rewarding anaggressor whose credibility has not been demonstrated.We believe rather that the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina is the one that deserves reparations andshould be rewarded for accepting the peace plan advancedrecently by the five-party Contact Group — a planrejected by the Serbs. Through its President  Mr. AlijaIzetbegovic  the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina alsoaccepted the proposed postponement of the lifting of thearms embargo against it for another six months  a positionthat indeed warrants appreciation by the internationalcommunity and all peace-loving nations.7With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  we aredeeply concerned over the escalation of fighting betweenthe parties to the dispute. We appeal to all Afghan factionsto put the national interests of the Afghan people above allother considerations by putting an end to the fightingamong them  pursuant to the provisions of the Meccaagreement of 1993.Among the appalling developments in Rwanda thisyear were the dreadful massive massacres committed intribal strife within the nation. For our part  we support theefforts exerted by the international community with a viewto repatriating the refugees and displaced persons and toputting an end to the tragedy resulting from the civil war.As far as the Cyprus question is concerned  we areinterested in seeing the obstacles to settlement removed.We are deeply encouraged by the good offices of theSecretary-General and hope they will lead to a solution thatmay be satisfactory to both communities  especially nowthat both sides have declared that they accept  in principle a set of confidence-building measures.In a few months  we shall see the dawn of 1995. Inthat year we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations. Although the Organization coexisted withpolitical polarization during the cold-war era  the peoplesand Governments of the world continued to be loyal to itfor five decades. They are now counting on theOrganization to contribute to the formulation of a newworld order for the future. To that end  it behooves us asMember States to make available to the Organization thecapability and the necessary means which would enable itto face all the challenges ahead. The Organization shoulddevelop itself into an effective instrument capable of copingwith global changes. A number of important steps shouldtherefore be taken  including above all gaining the supportof the Security Council for the desired reforms. Thegrowing number of Member States and the emergence inthe international arena of new influential Powers justifysuch reforms.It should be noted in this respect that a growingnumber of Member States have begun in recent years toassume effective roles in the work of the Organization andto contribute to the maintenance of world peace andsecurity. Proceeding from this  Bahrain looks forward tocontributing to such efforts should it be elected to a termon the Security Council.The ability of the United Nations to prevent disputesand to maintain world peace depends greatly on thecredibility of the principles of the Charter  which should as a basic rule  guide the discussions and decisions of theUnited Nations  and particularly of the Security Council.If it is perceived that application is selective  credibilitywill suffer and the moral authority which is a basicfeature of the Charter will be weakened.Notwithstanding certain failures  the many greatsuccesses the Organization has achieved in many parts ofthe world deepen our conviction that the United Nationsan indispensable guarantee for a future in which ourhopes for international peace and security will be fulfilled.As it approaches the end of the twentieth century mankind longs for a world in which international relationswill be governed by the principles of equality  justice andthe renunciation of the use or threat of force. Mankindlongs for stability and peace based on solid foundationsof understanding  good-neighbourliness and non-interference in internal affairs as a means of consolidatingthe ideals of justice  security and peace amongst allnations."
"19",758,"BHS",49,1994,"I wish to join otherspeakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. Your experience in international affairs  as wellas your proven diplomatic skills  provide the assurance ofa successful conclusion of our deliberations.At the same time  I wish to express our gratitudeand sincere appreciation to His Excellency AmbassadorSamuel Rudolph Insanally  for the distinguished mannerin which he presided over this historic Assembly duringa particularly challenging forty-eighth session  ablyrepresenting not only his country  Guyana  but the entire7Latin American and Caribbean region. We commend himfor his performance.Our Secretary-General continues his outstandingstewardship of the United Nations during these criticaltimes  when this world body is increasingly being calledupon to respond to crises of staggering dimensions. TheBahamas appreciates his tireless efforts.Anniversaries are times of celebration and times ofreflection. As this world assembly approaches its fiftiethbirthday  it is wholly appropriate that we should seek toevaluate our record.I believe that we can all agree that in our efforts toguide international relations in the 50 years since the end ofthe Second World War  there have been both successes andfailures. We must surely build on the successes andredirect our energies to effectively reduce the number offailures.The credible success of this world Organization and itsspecialized agencies in measurably improving the health literacy and education standards of the world’s poor is nomean achievement. So also has been the success of thisbody in seeking to ensure the environmental integrity of theplanet  in galvanizing the resources of the world to fight theillicit drug traffic  and in peacefully resolving disputes.We can all be justly satisfied that the persistence ofthis Assembly played a pivotal role in bringing to an endthe racist Government in South Africa. The victory of non-racial democracy in that torn land must give us hope evenin the face of the most intractable problems. The Bahamasjoins other Members in welcoming South Africa back intothe fold of the General Assembly.The Bahamas fully supports the noble cause of theGovernment of South Africa as it begins the task ofreconciliation and reconstruction. President NelsonMandela and the people of South Africa can be fullyassured of my Government’s hand of friendship.Victory in South Africa allowed us to dare to hope foran opening in Haiti. This Assembly knows very well thelong history of abuse of that poor Caribbean nation — aland in which the apartheid of wealth has flourished in adestitute country. For many generations now  Haitiannationals have felt compelled to abandon their homes frequently in unseaworthy boats  in search of personaldignity and of economic and political liberty.My country has frequently been their first safeharbour  and  while proud of our record of assistance  wehave been and remain ill-equipped to offer such refuge.Members are aware of the tremendous burden that mycountry has had to bear in this regard. This refuge hasbeen provided by the Bahamas in spite of the absence ofeither recognition or assistance from the internationalcommunity.To say that our education  health and welfareresources have been stretched beyond capacity in oursmall island developing country is to greatly understatethe situation. When we add the extra costs attributable tothe necessary marine patrols associated with themonitoring of undocumented persons  the full burdencreated in the Bahamas by Haitian nationals fleeing theirhomes begins to become apparent.Hence  the recognition by this body of the absolutenecessity for the world community to forcibly respond tothe brutality of the military dictatorship in Haiti is verymuch appreciated. The support given to the earlyinitiative led by the Caribbean Community to force aresolution of the crisis in Haiti has already borne fruit and we commend the United States of America for itsleadership in this important initiative.We therefore join in welcoming the formation of themultinational force authorized by the Security Council totake all necessary action to restore the democraticallyelected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.Notwithstanding the tremendous costs that in recent yearshave accrued to the Bahamas as a result of developmentsin Haiti  we have also agreed to lend manpower supportto that force.Today’s announcement that the coup leaders haveresigned and will be leaving the country now paves theway for the desired return of President Jean-BertrandAristide later this week.It is especially important that the internationalcommunity now dedicate sufficient funding and expertiseto the economic reconstruction of Haiti to achievedemocracy in that land. It must continue to do so eventoday as Haitians await the announced departure of thefeared military from leadership and the return of theirelected President. We who promote and encourage theadoption of democratic forms of government must alsoaccept a degree of responsibility to service thatdemocracy  especially in its infancy. The infantdemocracy that is struggling to be born in Haiti will8surely die unless it receives the succour and support of theinternational community.Since the Second World War  the world communityhas addressed the plight of political refugees. Theincreased demand to assist persons fleeing politicalpersecution is demonstrated in the ethnic purges andwarfare in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The dramatic exodus  during the first half of this year of hundreds of thousands of persons across the seas onunseaworthy craft or down long roads across bordersdramatically brought to the attention of the worldcommunity the plight of undocumented persons seekingshelter outside of their homelands.The burden borne by the Bahamas as a result of thepresence of large numbers of undocumented Haitians isnow compounded by the more recent arrival of hundreds ofCubans seeking to enter the United States of America. TheBahamas Government is encouraged by recent efforts byboth the United States of America and the Republic ofCuba to address this perennial problem of Cuban migrants.The gravity of the Haitian crisis  the inhumanity of thegenocide in Bosnia  the cruelty of the murders in Rwandaand the ongoing war in Angola all are clarion calls to ourOrganization and to the world that we must desist fromtardy  piecemeal approaches and address in a timely andcomprehensive manner not only the effects but the veryroot causes of these situations.Not least among these is economics  evidenced by acrisis in development. Despair at the hopeless socio-economic conditions of one’s daily life has given rise  inthose so affected  to a basic pessimism and to thewillingness to risk even one’s life for changedcircumstances. Where basic needs are unmet and survivalis in jeopardy  there is little stake in the future and littlereason to consider the sustainability of one’s actions. Thereal threat to our future security is therefore no longermilitary aggression but deteriorating economic conditions.The alleviation of widespread poverty while managing finiteresources in the face of spiralling population growth will beamong the major challenges of the twenty-first century.The Bahamas  therefore  looks forward to theSecretary-General’s revised “Agenda for Development” hopeful that it will serve as an effective guideline for thecreation and implementation of measures commensuratewith the legitimate aspirations of Member States. We mustnot lose ground in this session by becoming submerged inattempts to redefine development. We must  rather  focuson the different levels of development that exist in ourseveral countries. We must learn their effects and findsolutions for narrowing obvious disparities. Thesesolutions must include programmes specially suited to thediffering levels of development of Member States.We must therefore ensure that our quest forsustainable development is people-centred. We mustconsider sustainable human development with a focus onjustice  equality and democratic freedom as well as onmaterial well-being that incorporates equal opportunity forall. Inequity engenders violence  and violence fragmentssociety.The Bahamas  in spite of its apparent growth andstrong economic indicators  is still only a developingnation. However  unlike many other developing nations the Bahamas is continually frustrated in its efforts tosecure international resources and concessionary financingfrom multilateral institutions because of its reputed levelof per capita gross national product.As a small archipelagic country of a mere 260 000people scattered over 100 000 square miles  burdened bythe cost of transportation and infrastructure replication and with a very small minority of our residents in anextremely high income bracket whilst the overwhelmingmajority of the population is at the opposite end of theeconomic scale  we are advocating that this grosslymisleading per capita criterion for gross national productshould not be the only basis upon which resources andassistance are allocated to developing countries  such asthe Bahamas.It is the view of the Bahamas that the entire systemfor determining eligibility for development assistanceshould be comprehensively reviewed  as it is clear thatspecial consideration ought to be given to countries likethe Bahamas  with peculiar imbalances and vulnerabilities.For its part  the Bahamas is engaged in a process ofrefining its development indicators in an attempt to ensurethat data provided to international institutions are trulyreflective of our economic-development reality. Weexpect that the data so provided will also have an impactupon our budgetary assessments.This comprehensive review  we believe  mustinclude consideration of the vulnerability index identifiedin the Programme of Action of the Global Conference onSmall Island Developing States as the direction to befollowed in the development of a measurement of the9ecological fragility and economic vulnerability of smallisland developing States.In this connection  I would remind the Assembly of animportant message which was reinforced by the recentConference on Small Island Developing States  that is  thatunless the peculiar difficulties of these States are properlyaddressed  those States will not have the wherewithal toproceed on a path to sustainable development.The marine environment presents both an opportunityand a constraint with respect to the sustainable developmentand security of any island State. As a maritime nation  theBahamas attaches tremendous importance to theConvention  which has resulted in the creation of a newlegal regime for the oceans. Among its new achievementsare the recognition of the legal status of archipelagos  the12-mile territorial sea  transit passage  the exclusiveeconomic zone  and the protection and preservation of themarine environment and the resources of the deep seabedas the common-heritage of mankind.The Bahamas was particularly pleased to join withother Member States in signing the agreement on seabedmining in July of this year  as that agreement modifiesprovisions that had prevented many States from becomingparties to the Convention. The long awaited entry intoforce of the Convention is therefore of extreme importance as it provides a boost to our efforts to curb infringement onboth our national security and our national resources.While the socio-economic health of the world stillpresents challenges for the Organization  we have scoredsome political successes in the recent past. These successesinclude  of course  the peace accord between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization signed in September oflast year  which led to self-rule in the Gaza Strip andJericho for the Palestinian people  and the signing of theWashington Declaration between Israel and Jordan last July.We also applaud and encourage the dialogue now underway between Israel and Syria.In spite of those successes  peace-keeping stilloccupies an important place in our activities. However  wemust ensure that peace-keeping operations are notconducted at the expense of other activities which areequally important  such as the development programmes ofthe United Nations. After all  development is a prerequisitefor peace.For small countries with limited resources  such as theBahamas  a major justification for membership ininternational organizations is the enhancement of nationalcapacity. It is therefore the duty of the United Nations tofacilitate the efforts of small countries to arrive at just andequitably sound solutions to differences within theinternational society of States  especially when theyinvolve political and economic giants.It is from this perspective that the Bahamas supportsthe efforts of the Republic of China to entreat theOrganization to examine the merits of establishing an adhoc committee to analyse comprehensively the currentimplications and future ramifications of the preclusion ofthe 21 million people in the Republic of China fromcontributing to  and availing themselves of  all thebenefits deriving from membership in the United Nationsand its affiliated agencies. Our Organization is expectedto reflect universality and to demonstrate impartialitywhen forging international agreements for policycommitments  for accessing resources and for action.The Bahamas welcomes the report of the Open-ended Working Group on the question of more equitablerepresentation within the membership of the SecurityCouncil. The Group’s work thus far has been positiveand constructive  and we trust that the momentum of itsdiscussions will be maintained.The report on the Security Council is of importanceto all Member States. As its conclusions affect eachMember quite directly  it is essential that the Councilshould be seen to reflect as accurately as possible thewishes of the entire international community.Accordingly  it is imperative that the composition of anew Security Council properly reflect regional diversityand thereby enhance the legitimacy of the actions of thatimportant United Nations body.We in the Bahamas look with great expectation tothe observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. The preparatory period for this event is an idealtime for reflection on targets and objectives which havealready been set by our Organization  some of which havenow been outstanding for many years. Turning fifty is anopportunity for the Organization to regain the confidenceof our peoples. It will take hard work and determinationto achieve the desired results so that over the next 50years the United Nations will be known in all societiesand across all levels of those societies as the real leaderin the fight to bring dignity to mankind.In the words of the great Johann Wolfgang vonGoethe:10“We must not hope to be mowersAnd to gather the ripe gold earsUnless we have first been sowersAnd watered the furrows with tears.“It is not just as we take it This mystical world of ours;Life’s field will yield as we make it:A harvest of thorns or of flowers.”"
"20",783,"BIH",49,1994,"Allow me  at the outset  tocommend Mr. Samuel Insanally for the able manner inwhich he conducted the work of the forty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly.I would also like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of this  the forty-ninth session. Iwish you success in pursuing this very important task.I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speakon behalf of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina atthis distinguished gathering.I come from Bosnia and Herzegovina  a far-awaycountry that has currently been the subject of manydiscussions.Unfortunately  I have to begin my statement byrepeating facts that  for most of you  may be or should bewell known.At the time - some three years ago - whenYugoslavia experienced its dissolution  we were doing ourbest to carry out the separation in a peaceful fashion andwithout any violence. For reasons already known  ourinitiatives did not bear fruit.5When Slovenia and Croatia seceded  and thedissolution of Yugoslavia had become inevitable  weorganized a referendum in order to decide  in a democraticmanner  the fate of Bosnia. By a two-thirds majority -exactly 64.4 per cent of the body of registered voters citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina  opted for the country’sindependence in the referendum of 1 March 1992.International recognition of our country followed soonthereafter  and so did the aggression against it. Thedecision on its recognition was made on 5 April 1992 andwas announced the following day  6 April 1992. TheSerbian and Montenegrin aggression against Bosnia andHerzegovina began on 5 April 1992  the very day when thedecision on recognition of the country was adopted.The aggression has continued to this day with more or at times  less intensity  and without any prospect of itscoming to an end in the near future.The war that was forced upon Bosnia and Herzegovinaand its peoples - and that has now entered its thirty-first month -is one of the bloodiest wars in the history of mankind. Atthe very beginning  it was not a war but rather an attack bya well-armed and equipped army  the former Yugoslavarmy  against defenceless citizens.The results of this uneven struggle are as follows:70 per cent of our country came under occupation in thefirst months of the war; more than 200 000 civilians havebeen killed; over 1 million - or one fourth - of ourinhabitants have been expelled from their homes; hundredsof cities and villages have been destroyed and burned. Thiscannot be described as a classic example of warfarebetween two armies. This has been a war of an armyagainst civilians  followed by genocide and  to date unprecedented destruction of cultural and religious objects.The world has not responded in an appropriate mannerto such barbarity.Whether it was because of the brutality of the attack or because it was morally and psychologically unprepared or perhaps because of its entanglement in its conflictinginterests  the world seemed confused and hesitant.When the news and pictures of new concentrationcamps in the heart of Europe came out  the public wasastonished or shocked  but for the most part thoseresponsible kept silent. Tens of thousands have perished inthose camps and many thousands have disappeared withouta trace. The more brutal an attack  the more hesitant theworld became. The free world neither defended norsupported freedom. Our people  facing the threat ofextermination and a clearly pronounced death sentence decided to defend itself.But then it encountered a new absurdity. It found itshands tied. In short  before the war broke out againstBosnia and Herzegovina the United Nations imposed anotorious resolution that banned any import of weaponsinto the territory of former Yugoslavia. Everythingchanged: the war began  the aggressor and the victimwere clearly discernable  but the arms embargo hasremained in place as if nothing had happened in theinterim. Justice was turned into injustice because theaggressor had weapons - weapons that had beenstockpiled over the course of 40 years - while the victimwas unarmed and its hands were kept tied.The resolution on the arms embargo became its owncontradiction. By maintaining the imbalance inweaponry  it has prolonged the war and turned the peacenegotiations into diktat by the better-armed aggressor.We said to the world  ""You do not have to come todefend us  but do at least untie our hands and allow us todefend ourselves. While they kill our children  rape ourwomen and destroy all our relics  do recognize our rightto self-defence.""So far  however  the arms embargo has remained inplace. With only guns and rifles in their hands  ourdefenders have faced artillery and tanks. We have lostmany people  and reports indicate that more than 90 percent of them have been killed by grenades and artilleryshells. Our cities and villages have been left at the mercyof the powerful military technology in the hands of themurderers. In the capital city of Sarajevo alone  morethan 10 000 people have been killed and more than50 000 wounded. Not a single family is withoutcasualties  either killed or wounded.To all this  the world has sent us one message:negotiate. In the belief that the only right path was tocontinue to defend our land and that in this just strugglethe peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the worldwould support us  we refused for a very long time tonegotiate with war criminals.Finally  faced with the unbearable plight of ourpeople and the world’s indifference  without any choicewe accepted negotiations. It turned out that the aggressorhad only been using negotiations as a way to bargain fortime and to cover up its continuation of the aggression.6In March 1993  after long and painful negotiations and withmany concessions from our side  we signed the so-calledVance-Owen plan. The aggressor rejected it.The next bloody round in the war ensued  to befollowed by another round of negotiations that resulted  on5 July 1994  in a peace plan drawn up by the ContactGroup consisting of five great Powers: the United States ofAmerica  the United Kingdom  France  Germany and theRussian Federation. Again  we chose peace and theattackers  once again  opted for a continuation of the war.We accepted the unjust peace offer in order to halt thewar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We did so in the hopethat the injustice of the peace plan could still be correctedin the years of peace. Knowing the Bosnian soul  webelieved - and we still believe - that peace can save - butthat war will destroy - all that we call Bosnia.What we call ""Bosnia"" is not merely a small piece ofland in the Balkans. For many of us  Bosnia andHerzegovina is not only a homeland: it is an idea; it is abelief that peoples of different religions  differentnationalities and different cultural traditions can livetogether. Were this dream to be forever buried  were thisidea of tolerance among the peoples of the area to beirretrievably lost  the guilt would lie not only with thosewho have been relentlessly killing Bosnia with their mortarsfor over 30 months now but also with many of thepowerful elsewhere in the world who could have helped yethave chosen to do otherwise.Two days ago  I left Sarajevo. I did not leave byplane because the airport was closed. I had to take landroutes through woods that are constantly exposed to fireand where many people are killed daily. For days there isno electricity  water and gas in the city. The capital iscompletely blocked and is virtually dying.Yesterday  after I had arrived at United NationsHeadquarters  I received a letter from Srebrenica  a smalltown on the river Drina. The letter was supposed to be areport  but it was also a cry from a real human hell. Icould not find the strength to read it a second time.Over three months ago ""ethnic cleansing"" wasreignited  and there is now a new wave. Thousands ofcivilians whose only fault is that they are not Serbs havebeen expelled from their homes in Banja Luka  Bijeljina Janja and other towns under the control of Karadzic’s army.Once again  nothing has been done. The world seems tohave grown gradually accustomed to unpunished violationsof the basic norms of international law. This is a sorrysituation  and one that concerns every man and everywoman in the world  no matter how near or far fromBosnia they may be.For a very long time I rejected - indeed  I stillreject - any so-called conspiracy theory  the theory that allthat has happened to Bosnia has happened because itsmajority nation is Muslim and there are dark powers thatconsciously impel the Serbs towards the extermination ofBosnian Muslims.Those who support this theory have their arguments and I believe they have been heard here before. Theymaintain that overt aggression  followed by genocide concentration camps and other forms of the darkestfascism  is at work in Bosnia and Herzegovina and thatthe world must be blind not to see it. Is the world blind?Does it consciously condone all these evils? It cannot beblind  and there is thus only the other alternative. This isthe argument that has gained an increasing number ofsupporters. It will not be a good thing if the world’sbillion Muslims come to accept it.The latest events surrounding the plan of the ContactGroup have given the supporters of the so-calledconspiracy theory an additional argument  namely  thatBosnia and Herzegovina has been offered a proposalbacked by five major Powers and  therefore  by themajority of the international community  and it has beenclearly stated that the side that rejected the plan would bepunished while the side that accepted it would beprotected. Yet the opposite has happened. The Serbsrejected the plan  and they have been rewarded by thesuspension of sanctions. We have accepted the plan  andwe have been punished by a complete blockade ofSarajevo. Both processes have occurred simultaneously in parallel.Today  the highest civilian and military UnitedNations authorities are warning us: If you demand andsucceed in achieving the lifting of the arms embargo  theUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) will pullout of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and soon.I have certainly not undertaken this long and arduousjourney from Bosnia to America solely to convey factsthat may be known to the majority of those here. We inBosnia believe that  despite the hardships  good andjustice cannot be defeated. We do not abandon our faith7that the world can be better and that we should all workand strive continually to make it better.In this conviction  and despite all our disappointmentsand frustrations  I have come to speak here before theAssembly and to present some of our proposals. From theGeneral Assembly and the Security Council  we are askingthe following: first  that all resolutions on Bosnia andHerzegovina adopted by the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly be implemented; secondly  that measuresbe taken effectively to monitor the border between Serbiaand Montenegro  on the one side  and Bosnia andHerzegovina  on the other  so that any transport of troops weapons and military equipment across that border may beprevented or detected in timely fashion; thirdly  that shouldthis transport occur  the decision on the suspension of someof the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - SecurityCouncil resolution 943 (1994) - be immediately revokedand that tightened sanction measures be imposed inaccordance with the plan of the Contact Group of July1994; fourthly  that there be no further easing of thesanctions towards Serbia and Montenegro until theyrecognize Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia withininternationally recognized borders; fifthly  that a resolutionbe adopted  without delay  to strengthen the protection andmandate the extension of the safe areas provided for inSecurity Council resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993) and in accordance with provisions of Article 6 of theContact Group plan; and  sixthly  that decisions be taken toensure an immediate end to the strangulation of Sarajevoand to prevent a recurrence of such a situation.The last-mentioned of these measures should envisage as an integral element  the opening of the city along thenorth communication route - road and highway - throughthe creation of a demilitarized belt 2.5 kilometres wide onboth sides of the thoroughfares. In this demilitarized belt only United Nations troops and police might remain. Thepotential use of force against the strangulation of Sarajevois envisaged under Article 4 of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization’s decision of 9 February 1994.Provided that the above conditions were fulfilled  andon condition that UNPROFOR continued to carry out itsmission  the Government of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina would be willing to accept a new  modifiedformula to deal with the problem of the arms embargo.Under this formula we would limit our demand for thelifting of the arms embargo to the adoption of a formaldecision  and the application or consequences of thatdecision would be deferred for six months. In this caseUNPROFOR troops could remain in Bosnia andHerzegovina  the Contact Group would fulfil its promise and a clear message would be conveyed to Karadzic’sSerbs.I should like  in conclusion  to state our twocommitments.First  our irrevocable objective is a democraticBosnia and Herzegovina within internationally recognizedborders  and with full ethnic  religious and political rightsfor all its citizens. In such a Bosnia and Herzegovina theSerbs will have all rights  up to the highest level ofautonomy  but they cannot have a state within a state.Secondly  we consider that  like all other nations  wehave an inalienable right to self-defence. Therefore  ifour compromise proposal on the arms embargo is rejectedfor any reason  we shall ask our friends to secure theimmediate  and even unilateral  lifting of the embargo.Unfortunately  I have to inform representatives that  justtoday  I learned that this compromise proposal is meetingresistance  and even rejection  from some Contact Groupcountries.Finally  I take this opportunity to express our sinceregratitude to all friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina whohave supported its struggle for survival and freedom."
"21",830,"BLR",49,1994,"Let me congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his unanimouselection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. This is both a tribute to his country’scontribution to the work of the Organization and anacknowledgement of his personal achievements inmultilateral diplomacy.Almost half a century ago  the founding MemberStates — and my country is one of them — set for theUnited Nations a task of paramount importance: to uniteour strength to maintain international peace and securityand to promote the economic and social development of allnations. It was necessary to create a mechanism forcoordinating states’ efforts that could offer mutuallyacceptable solutions to international problems. Experiencehas shown that the United Nations can play the part of sucha unique mechanism. Thanks to the great efforts of thisprestigious international Organization  we have managed toavoid military flare-ups and conflicts in many parts of theworld.The world has changed dramatically. The political ideological and military confrontation of two social systemshas become a thing of the past. The ice of the cold warhas melted away completely. These changes brought to theworld hopes for a better future but  unfortunately  havefailed to solve all international problems. Tragedies whoseunderlying cause is ethnic  religious and national enmity arebeing played out in Rwanda  Bosnia and Herzegovina Nagorny Karabakh  Abkhazia and Tajikistan. Unsettledbilateral relations between some States  including thoserelating to the areas of human rights and protection ofnational minorities  are also factors. And there is alsoterrorism  drug-trafficking and uncontrolled arms exports including arms supplies into areas of conflict and hot spotsin countries where bloodshed continues.Under these circumstances  the role of the UnitedNations as a universally recognized uniter of peoplesbecomes much more significant. I am deeply convincedthat there will come a time when the collective reason ofthe United Nations will have a much greater impact onthe processes taking place in the world. Our duty is to doeverything we can to achieve that. Here in the UnitedNations  we have to find the answers to many questionsof concern to our countries.For Belarus  this is especially important. For fouryears now Belarus has been building a democratic independent and sovereign State. Our ideal is one of afree citizen in a free country. After decades oftotalitarianism and sham collectivism  we are graduallygiving back to our people freedom  which the greathumanist Leonardo da Vinci called the main gift ofnature.One significant milestone in the life of Belarus wasthe adoption of a new Constitution and — a historic firstfor us — truly free and democratic presidential elections.Henceforth Belarus has a President elected by the people Alaksandr Lukashenka  who has testified to his basiccommitment to progressive market reforms. Presidentialpower and the trust of the people guarantee thatdemocratic reforms in our country will be irreversible.And today we also have regular elections to the BelarusParliament and for local authorities.In foreign policy  the Republic of Belarus believesin the principles of sovereign equality of states  non-useof force or the threat of force  inviolability of borders peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference ininternal affairs and other universally recognized norms ofinternational law. Our Constitution contains a provisionthat Belarus should be a neutral State and its territory anuclear-free zone. Our Republic is ready to cooperatewith the whole world and is seeking its rightful place inEurope in the regional structures of collective security andeconomic cooperation.The President and the Government of the Republicof Belarus believe that implementation of market reformswill guarantee success in the democratic transformationsin our society. We have embarked on this path firmlyand irreversibly. The legal and organizational bases formoving to the socially oriented market economy havenow been created in the Republic. Appropriate legislationhas been enacted. The ideas of having a state of law dividing power into different branches and improving the23system of executive authority are now being put intopractice.However  as in other countries of Central and EasternEurope  transition to a market economy is very difficult.Our greatest difficulties occur in privatization  fightingmonopolies and stabilizing the monetary-financial system.Moreover  we inherited from the past a national economicstructure in which an excessively large share was given tothe military-industrial complex. Internal and externalnational debt is also high  leading to budget deficits andinflation.The situation is aggravated by the long-termconsequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclearpower plant. The adverse effect of the unprecedentedradioactive contamination on people’s health is notdecreasing. On the contrary  it increases as this tragic dayrecedes. On top of all of this  we had a drought this yearthe likes of which our country had not seen for at least 100years. Modest estimates put the overall damage from thedrought at more than $300 million.Under these difficult circumstances  the Republic haselaborated a programme of measures for pulling theeconomy out of crisis. This programme will be the basisfor an agreement with the International Monetary Fund which we plan to sign sometime next month. Firmlyresolved to carry out wide-scale reforms  we intend to curbinflation  reduce the budget deficit and reduce the deficit inthe balance of payments. Full liberalization of trade andprices  speeding up privatization  should  we think  make itpossible to lessen the crisis in our economy. Relying onour own forces  we nevertheless understand that withoutsupport from the outside we cannot carry out our reformsfully and in a reasonably short time.The Republic of Belarus does not intend to withdrawinto its own problems. We are open to the concerns anxieties and problems of the whole world  and we wish tomake our own contribution to the activities of the worldcommunity of nations. Not just rhetorically  but in reality Belarus was the first State in history voluntarily  withoutreservations or conditions  to renounce the possession ofnuclear weapons. We support proposals on the indefiniteand unconditional extension of the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty.In 1990  from this rostrum  the delegation of theRepublic of Belarus put forward the idea of establishing anuclear-free belt from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Recentsteps taken by Belarus to withdraw nuclear weapons fromits territory ahead of schedule make it possible to considera substantial part of this region as nuclear-free territoryalready.Belarus supports the efforts by Members of theUnited Nations to speed up the negotiations on concludinga comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We believe sucha treaty could be signed as early as next year. We alsosupport the proposal made here to elaborate a treaty onnuclear security and strategic stability. And  of course we advocate multilateral discussion of issues relating toregulating the international arms market and militaryequipment.I would like to stress that  despite our economiccrisis  our Republic is endeavouring to comply fully withour obligations to reduce nuclear and conventionalweapons  even though this requires enormous additionalexpenditures. In this connection  we feel we can expectthe international community to support our actions.The noble quest of peoples for peace following theSecond World War led to the establishment of the UnitedNations. The people of Belarus paid a great price indelivering of world from fascism. The deadly fires ofwar scorched our land and touched literally every familyin it. The tragic price of freedom was the life of everyfourth citizen in my country. Not until 25 years after thewar did our population once again attain its pre-war level.Thus  the General Assembly’s decision to make 1995 theUnited Nations year of tolerance and to proclaim it theworld year of commemoration of victims of the SecondWorld War evokes a particularly profound response inBelarus. The Belarus delegation also considers that nextyear would be the appropriate time to delete from theUnited Nations Charter the outdated concept of the“enemy State”.We must use the forthcoming United Nations goldenjubilee to seek new ways of improving our performancein the changed world conditions. It is a truism that naturecannot tolerate rigidity and that everything in nature isconstantly changing. That law is certainly applicable tothe United Nations. If the Organization is to workeffectively  its major organs must undergo profoundreform.In the application of the principle of representationof countries and regions in the Security Council  theinterests of all groups of States  including the EasternEuropean Group  must be taken more fully into account.Of course  no Security Council reform should detract24from its role as the body responsible for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  so needed by all MemberStates  and particularly the smaller States.The Government of the Republic of Belarus hasreacted positively to the proposal to increase the number ofpermanent members of the Security Council with theaddition of members selected from among the countries thatmake an exceptional contribution to achieving the purposesof the United Nations Charter.We believe that greater account should be taken ofexisting realities  including the complex problemsconfronting countries whose economies are in transition andthe poorest countries  as well as of global problems ofpopulation  unemployment and environmental deteriorationin all parts of the world.Political and economic dialogue between donor andrecipient countries must be given new content  goingbeyond the traditional framework of relations betweenthem.The Republic of Belarus hopes that the movement thatbegan in the Philippines at the International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies and developed further atManagua will make it possible for countries in transitionand developing countries to unite and to develop acoordinated approach within the framework of the UnitedNations to consolidate democracy and create a free market.Countries with economies in transition find themselvesat different stages on their road to democracy and a marketeconomy  and for that reason the success of reformsdepends to a large extent on support from the internationalcommunity. Hence  the Belarus delegation would proposethat in 1996  under the auspices of the United Nations  aninternational conference on sustainable development incountries with economies in transition should be held. Co-organizers of the conference might include the UnitedNations Economic Commission for Europe  the EuropeanRegional Bureau of the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme  the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment  the European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment and other interested institutions.We also believe that the granting of most-favoured-nation status  giving countries with economies in transitionbroad access to international markets and integrating themfully into the world economy  would be in the interests ofthe international community as a whole.There is a growing need to broaden cooperation andstrengthen coordination between the United Nations  theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and otherregional organizations and arrangements. In thisconnection we welcome the granting of observer status inthe General Assembly to the Commonwealth ofIndependent States. Belarus advocates a clearer definitionof areas of cooperation between the United Nations andthe CIS. Such cooperation could include joint efforts inpeacemaking  disarmament  the environment  anti-terrorism  drug control and industrial conversion.We believe that peace-keeping operations should notbe allowed to overshadow the crucial problems of socio-economic development. Administrative and financialreform must become the most important aspect of UnitedNations renewal. One way of achieving that would bethrough a more rational distribution of the financialburden between the United Nations and other internationalinstitutions  including regional organizations. Anotherway would be to reject existing approaches to calculatingthe scale of assessments of Member States for the regularbudget of the United Nations and for peace-keepingoperations. It would be fairer to assess the contributionsof States primarily in light of their actual capacity to pay.In conclusion  may I say that the general debate atthis session attests to the genuine interest of MemberStates in achieving the full realization of the UnitedNations potential as a truly effective internationalorganization  as a centre for harmonizing and coordinatingthe activities of the nations of the world. The Republicof Belarus fully shares that commitment and is ready tocooperate with all countries of the world community toachieve that goal  so that the end of this century may godown in history as the time when the aspirations andhopes of all mankind were finally met."
"22",865,"BLZ",49,1994,"The delegation of Belizewarmly congratulates you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. We are proud that such an illustrious son of Africahas been selected to preside over our deliberations in thisperiod leading up to the celebration of the Organization’sfiftieth anniversary year.Permit me too to express my delegation’s thanks andpraise for the sterling performance of your immediatepredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally ofGuyana.Once again we gather to review the state of worldorder. And of the year just past it might perhaps be saidthat it was the best of times and the worst of times.On the one hand  a jubilant South Africa kept itsrendezvous with freedom and now appears to be bathed insunlight. Furthermore  the peace in the Middle East presaged by the Agreement on Palestinian self-rule  istaking root. Tension on the Korean peninsula has eased and the cease-fire in Northern Ireland represents a hithertounimaginable breakthrough.On the other hand  the pall of nuclear weapons stillhangs over our fragile planet. So does the gloom ofconventional armaments  the din of battle and the smell ofrotting flesh in the Balkans  parts of our beloved Africa andwestern and central Asia. In particular  the scale of thetragedy in Rwanda has been incomprehensible. The initialparalysis of will of the world community  our belatedresponse in the face of horrible genocide  has not been ourfinest hour. That hesitation  that failure of leadership underscores the need for the United Nations system’spreventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keepingmechanisms to be better developed as a matter of urgency.The fact is that there is still rampant lawlessnessabroad on our planet  and we continue to be traumatizedby the death and destruction it brings. In particular  theliving hell of refugees  fleeing almost inconceivableconditions of terror  seems to have become a stock featureof our end-of-the-century international existence.In this sort of depressing world political climate even small countries such as mine must do what we canto ease the pain. Thus it was that Belize became the firstsmall State to agree to participate in the multinationalforce currently overseeing the end of tyranny in Haiti.We took seriously the Security Council’s particularinvitation to regional States and hope now that thecollective response will succeed in giving our beleagueredsister republic surcease from its unhappy history and achance of lasting peace and true democracy. We salutethe Haitian people and we congratulate President Aristide.We expect soon to be able to send our messages ofcongratulations direct to the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince.In Belize’s own neighbourhood  theredemocratization of the Central American isthmuscontinues apace. In the last year  the free elections andorderly transitions of power that have taken place inPanama  Costa Rica  El Salvador and Honduras havevindicated our new-found  or rather rediscovered  destiny.In Guatemala  a plebiscite  congressional elections and theOslo Agreement between the Government and the UnidadRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrillagroup have strengthened the internal order. Furthermore that country has undertaken  in its letter to the Secretary-General (A/49/94 of 14 March 1994) to abide by pacificprinciples and good-neighbourliness in its relations withmy country. As a Member of this Organization  with ourhistorical and constitutional land and sea bordersuniversally recognized as inviolable in accordance withthe principles of self-determination  sovereignty andterritorial integrity  Belize welcomes this Guatemalancommitment. It is a further encouragement to regionalpeace.Talking of peace  we note with interest thedevelopment of the concept of stand-by forces. This ideaneeds to be deepened and refined  and arrangementsshould be made for appropriate training in regionaltraining centres. In this regard  Belize’s offer to serve asone such locale  making special use of our jungle terrainand facilities  is a matter of record.4This Organization must be allowed to develop anagency for rapid and effective military deployment. Again we call for the implementation of Article 43 of the Charter.What we are saying is that security and world ordermust be significantly improved. Mankind and the vision ofour founders must be vindicated. In that light  we reiteratethe call we made during last year’s debate for reform of theSecurity Council. Since that time  we have refined ourideas on that subject. These include our proposals thatcertain developing countries  on account of sheer populationnumbers and geopolitical realities  should be permanent  orindefinite  members; that contributions to the peace-keepingbudget should be a relevant criterion for permanent  orindefinite  membership; and that  in both existing categoriesof membership  adjacent States should be permitted to pooltheir resources as composite or constituency members. Wenow call upon all the members of this Assembly to ensurethat  by the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization  weshall demonstrate our commitment to world order bydemocratically bringing the Council to a better state ofgrace.Another aspect of international order that deservesmention is that of the number of entities which are not fullyembraced by the notion of universality in our Charter andwhich do not participate completely in the system ofinternational order. These entities are mostly in or aroundthe Asia-Pacific region  the Atlantic  the Mediterranean andthe Caribbean. We call on all parties in good faith tocontinue their various dialogues to resolve this issue.To contribute to this restructuring of world order  weare in the process of finalizing a massive new economicdimension with the conclusion of the multilateral tradenegotiations  the establishment of the World TradeOrganization  the development of new mechanisms for theresolution of trade disputes and the deepening and wideningof the system of norms relating to international commerce.We applaud the transformation of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade and these other advances  while urgingthat the less well-endowed countries receive their due  bothunder domestic jurisdictions and laws and in adjudicationsby the new organization. Rampant unilateralism andprotectionism must now take a back seat. We are satisfiedat the expansion of the institution of non-discrimination intosuch new areas as trade in services and trade-relatedinvestment measures. We are also happy that dumping andsubsidies regulations have now been significantly improvedand that progress has been made in the trying area ofsafeguards.We hope  however  that the thread of liberalism thatruns through these new instruments will not become anoose to suffocate those of us that did not inherit a headstart. We therefore call for sensitivity in the applicationof those various provisions for special and differentialtreatment of such countries.In the same vein  we would wish for increasedsensitization on the part of the Bretton Woods institutions.Even as the global order swings to and fro  we call forimprovement of the various mechanisms as they affectour sensitive economies.In Belize we have begun our own adjustmentprocess. This is necessary if we are to cope with theinitial dislocations to small economies  which will be theinevitable consequence of the new international tradingrealities. As well  the profligate behaviour of the centralGovernment between September 1989 and June 1993 hadresulted in an unmanageable deficit  precipitouslydeclining reserves and imprudent short-term  high-interestforeign borrowing.So we seek now to restore fiscal discipline andregain macro-economic stability. We are also intent onremoving the traditional distortions inherent in thedomestic trading regime  and on instituting tax reformthat will eliminate our overreliance on import duties.This is a process that we must manage carefully  sincedrastic reductions in public expenditure and tradeliberalization will work initial hardship on our localeconomy. In this context  the Bretton Woods institutionshave a duty to respond to our special circumstances.Support for our public and private sectors must beforthcoming  for the brave new economic world that wemust enter  whether voluntarily or otherwise  will nodoubt prove a most inhospitable clime to those notclothed with the requisite garb.In particular  the funds for skills training  humanresource development and poverty alleviation must befound. Our young people are already hostage to thesubculture of violence perpetrated as much by thetelevision images transported undiluted from the firstworld  as by the indigenous problems peculiar to oursmall societies. The hope-extinguishing cycle ofalienation  joblessness and incarceration must be broken.Otherwise  those nice new economic edifices we are socarefully constructing will come crashing to the ground undone by the confrontation and social chaos thatcontinued marginalization of our youth will surelyengender.5We repeat  then  that small  hitherto hardy democracies must not now be swamped by a heedlessforward march of soulless economic principles. And thecase for urgent Bretton Woods social and economicassistance should be even more compelling in the instanceof voluntary  vis-à-vis imposed  structural adjustment.We are somewhat embarrassed that  almost 50 yearson  this journey into a putative glorious world order justnow sees us seriously crafting new substantive agendas forwhat are really some very old problems. Yet  we must dealwith reality. The development decades and the newinternational economic order were  in part  chimeric orexercises in rhetoric. But I believe we are truly nowengaged in writing a new  coherent  agenda fordevelopment. Let it be a properly annotated agenda. Infact  let it be a fully programmed model that entirelyanticipates what lies ahead.We are grateful that this Organization is also takingnote of the unfulfilled promises of the Second World Warorder. It is now 53 years since the call for social justicewent out in the Four Freedoms and the Atlantic Charter.Yet we are far from freedom from want and improvedsocial security. Now  with the recently concludedConference on Population and Development  and with theWorld Conference on Women and the World Summit forSocial Development just before us  the opportunity is hereagain. Let us seize it and develop bold concepts andeffective normative systems. And while we do so  let uscontinue to develop such recent notions as those relating tothe relief of children in difficult circumstances. Let us alsodevelop this Organization’s capacity for technical assistancein crime prevention and interdiction to those United NationsMembers which are increasingly beset by the scourge ofviolence  weapons and narcotics. These plagues are  almostinvariably  brought on by demands and excesses importedfrom thousands of miles away  mostly with the aid of theelectronic media.Another area in which we are still in the agenda stageis that of humanitarianism. Despite unfair criticism  theSecretariat has done what it could to carry out the promisesmade in the Charter. We commend all concerned with theestablishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and we pledge to work beside them.Another relatively recent watchword is sustainability.It has a redolence to which we have all taken with alacrity.It warns the well-endowed of the truth of the adage ""Wastenot  want not"". It reminds the less fortunate to try toresolve their dilemma wisely  as necessity obliges them toreduce their woodlands while leaching the present vitalityof the land. It has brought us out of our slumber andhumbled us into sincere discussions about fish stocks fragile low-lying developing small island and coastalareas  and global warming.We have seen the Commission for SustainableDevelopment and the Global Environment Facility taketheir faltering first steps. While they are to some extentfurther examples of the somewhat unstructured way inwhich the Organization is sometimes obliged to operate we nevertheless commend those agencies. And wesincerely hope that sustainability will keep us whole.Another area in which the Organization has beendiscovering its role is human rights. We all recentlyparticipated in the stimulating exercise of establishing thepost of High Commissioner for Human Rights. We haveseen the number of instruments on that subject increase.Human rights bodies have become more experienced andeffective. Even in the field of population anddevelopment  we notice how the recent Cairo Programmeof Action uses human rights as its main point ofdeparture. It is striking that  in places  that documentalphabetizes the basic species of human rights. So didthe Assembly’s resolution establishing the post of HighCommissioner. We did this to stress the non-selectivityand neutrality of the various genres of human rights.That is to say  cultural  economic and social rights are asmuch our concern as civil and political rights. Thecoincidence of development with population and otherconcerns in the Cairo document  and the stress of theright to development both in the resolution establishingthe post of High Commissioner and in the Cairodocument  underscore the coequal importance of thatcategory of right. I believe that we are now seeing thebeginning of the concretization of international concernabout a wider range of human rights for individuals and I beg to stress  groups and peoples.Above all  these recent developments in the field ofhuman rights  sustainable development and social justiceare pointing us to the reality that values must become anintegral part of statecraft and of diplomacy. Only byinculcating respect for values will our world straighten upand fly right.In our fledgling world order  my subregion of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM) has begun to showsigns of coming of age. We have established several newstructures for subregional integration and cooperation.We recently joined our friends and neighbours in the6non-English-speaking Caribbean and proximate mainlandareas in signing a treaty to establish an ambitiousAssociation of Caribbean States designed to bring aboutcoordination  concentration and cooperation in our far-flungproto-region. Even before this  CARICOM had begun todevelop separate cooperative relationships with CentralAmerica  Colombia  Mexico and Venezuela. In all of theseendeavours  it has become more widely noted that Belize isideally situated to assist with this bringing together ofvarious subregions. We are equidistant from Tijuana andParamaribo and  in other respects  are at the very centre ofthis new Caribbean. Belize is bilingual and multi-cultural.Besides  Belize has a history and a polity which well equipus for this role.We earlier referred to the issue of equitablerepresentation on and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council. This is an important aspect of the worldorder. It is also the quintessential example of the need forreform and revitalization of this Organization.The General Assembly’s health is generally quitegood. However  in some respects it needs improvement.One such area is the roster for this general debate. Theannual seating arrangements for our numerous members aremade quite democratically and scientifically. Yet the orderof the list of speakers in this debate is not fixed in quite thesame manner. What is the justification for annually placingcertain nations at certain positions at the end of the list? Iremember that the Christian Bible makes flatteringreferences to what comes ""Out of the mouths of babes andsucklings"" (The Bible  Psalms 8:2). Similar expressionscan be found in every philosophy and religion on thisplanet. It is time that this be learned and observed by thosewho prepare the annual speakers’ list.With many others  we call for the development of animproved system of coordination here at Headquarters ofthe structure of the Organization’s machinery in the socialand economic sectors. More thought must also be given tothe rationalization and coordination of the Organization’smultifarious development agencies in the field.Even as the World Trade Organization and the BrettonWoods institutions develop their separate complexes ofstructures and prescriptions  my delegation sees a greaterneed for overall coordination by this premier Organization.The United Nations must be appropriately developed as thefirst among equals within the global organizational system.We laud the Secretary-General and the Assembly forimprovement in the systems of oversight and conditions ofservice  especially in the area of gender equity. Butequitable distribution of staff posts and responsibilitieswithin all United Nations bodies must be radicallyimproved.Above all  the United Nations must learn to speakto  not at  the peoples of the world. In the ongoingefforts to rearticulate  reinform and reinforce the vision ofthe Charter’s framers  we can even envisage our ChiefExecutive going on camera on popular talk shows teaching new constituencies about what is after all theirorganization. He should continue to find bully pulpits inthe global electronic information meeting-place  for theneed to sound the themes that underline the continuingvitality of our world body is particularly urgent at thistime. After all  in the run-up to our fiftieth anniversarywe must be able to give a proper account of ourstewardship  to withstand the special scrutiny we willsurely now provoke. Our world Government has todemonstrate that it is relevant  effective  moral and  aboveall  democratic. It is only then that we can fully expectthat it will be able hereafter to call out ever more clearly forcefully and directly to ""We the peoples of the world""."
"23",912,"BOL",49,1994,"I am honoured to convey the greetings ofPresident Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and of the people ofBolivia to the Heads of State and Government in attendanceat this the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly; tothe Foreign Ministers; to the President of the GeneralAssembly  Mr. Amara Essy  and to his predecessor Ambassador Samuel Insanally  as well as to our dear friendVice-President Sergio Abreu; to Secretary-General BoutrosBoutros-Ghali; and to the whole of the internationalcommunity  so worthily represented here.As the highest forum of the peoples of the Earth  thisnoble Assembly constitutes the ideal setting to reflect onand debate the issues of our day.Bolivia is striving to enter the twenty-first centurywhile bringing about substantial changes based on theprinciples of the United Nations Charter.During its first year in office  the Government ofPresident Sánchez de Lozada devoted its efforts tocarrying through the reforms needed to make the State aneffective instrument for our society’s democraticdevelopment  centred on the well-being of our people.Thus  our reforms have been based on the concept ofcomprehensive development  combining human andeconomic development  social equity  and sustainabledevelopment.Now that Bolivia has thus completed the reform ofits political constitution  it is putting into effect changesthat will enable it to consolidate democracy and economicdevelopment  in conditions of fairness and social justice.My country has embarked on a dynamic policy ofparticipation by the people  a process of educationalreform  and a recasting of the shareholding andproductive structures of public enterprises through aninnovative concept of capitalization.During the second phase of its programme  theBolivian Government is planning to implement new legalprovisions to increase investment and production in orderto provide more and better job opportunities  and to findconcrete solutions to the problems of poverty and themarginalization of broad sectors of society. It is in thisconnection  in the context of our Government’s policy that the participation of the people is of particularsignificance.On the subject of sustainable development  mycountry has proposed the holding of a meeting ofPresidents of the hemisphere; that meeting is nowscheduled for 1996 in Bolivia.The future of our peoples and their material andspiritual well-being can only be the work of their ownhands  as they are both the subjects and the objects ofdevelopment. It is therefore most encouraging that - notonly within our country but within the United Nationssystem as well - there is a conviction that a central rolefalls to organized participation  both individual andcollective  as an essential factor for change in a creativeand positive direction.Mechanisms for popular participation will make itpossible to imbue the liberty  independence  sovereignty26and progress of nations with vitality and social content. Itis a matter of appraising the role of all social sectors:workers and entrepreneurs  women  indigenous and ruralcommunities  the marginalized  the young  the elderly  thedisabled and all those who have the right and duty tocontribute to building a better future.It is with that conviction that the Bolivian Governmenthas contributed actively to the preparatory work for theforthcoming World Summit for Social Development  to beheld in Copenhagen in 1995  and the Fourth WorldConference on Women  in Beijing the same year.In that same spirit  the International Decade of theWorld’s Indigenous People will be inaugurated at thissession of the General Assembly. My country is confidentthat the observance of this Decade will be not merelysymbolic  but essentially a practical and concrete endeavourin its objectives and its scope. To that end  the meeting ofrepresentatives of Latin American and CaribbeanGovernments  grass-roots peasant organizations andinternational agencies  held in the Bolivian city ofCochabamba last June  framed a series of recommendationsto be included in the strategy of the Decade. Thoserecommendations have also been brought to the attention ofGovernments and the United Nations system. We hope toreceive a prompt and positive response so that thelegitimate claims of indigenous peoples will not be lost inthe labyrinths of international bureaucracy or the oblivionof another 500 years of solitude.Resolving age-old problems surely calls for a greatcapacity to understand the values  customs and ways of lifeof other cultures. Bolivia hopes that the InternationalDecade of the World’s Indigenous People will provide anopportunity for the international community to fullyunderstand the topic of the coca leaf  a form of vegetationtraditionally grown in Andean regions. The cultural andmedicinal uses of the coca leaf need to be re-evaluated inorder to distinguish it clearly from the social problemsbrought about by the abuse of one of its derivatives in thedeveloped countries  which creates a growing demandassociated with an international cycle of crime.Let me take this opportunity to declare formally  onceagain  that the Government and the people of Bolivia areearnestly and firmly committed to international efforts tofind the best-suited mechanisms to guarantee the success ofthe policies delineated within the framework of the changesrecommended in General Assembly resolution 48/12 adopted at the last session.Less than two weeks ago  on an initiative ofPresident Sánchez de Lozada  the most representativeorganizations of Bolivian society  together with the armedforces and the police  took a historic step when theydebated the problems of the coca leaf in a framework ofpluralistic participation and cooperation. The mainconclusions of that meeting  which I take the liberty ofsummarizing to this great forum of nations  stressed theurgency of combating drug trafficking through a world-wide strategy of shared responsibility; the need to adoptas a primary goal the fight against the dire povertyaffecting over two-thirds of Bolivia’s population; andsupport for initiatives aimed at the comprehensivedevelopment of coca-producing areas.Bolivia is grateful for the international community’swillingness to draw a perfectly clear distinction betweenthe positive aspects of the native coca leaf and the graveharm done by dint of the external demand for cocaine.We trust that this positive attitude will make it possible inthe near future to address this problem without prejudice.But the international agenda at the end of thecentury encompasses other equally complex issues thathave recently been brought to light by the end of the coldwar  although their roots can be traced back to centuriesof accumulated injustice.The Republic of South Africa has given the worldinvaluable lessons in its struggle against apartheid and fordemocracy. My country is joyful at the outcome of thatprocess and  on behalf of Bolivia  I welcome PresidentNelson Mandela to the General Assembly.Deeply moved as well by news of the tragedies inRwanda and in other regions of the world  Boliviaexpresses its solidarity with peoples which  throughviolence and catastrophe  are showing us what we sowwhen problems are not resolved in timely fashion problems such as hunger  poverty  mass migration  thevarious forms of injustice inherited from colonial timesand the plundering and lawless acts carried out eventoday by Powers large and small against other States.Bolivia welcomes the advances achieved throughdialogue in the Middle East  and we trust that in thefuture dialogue will become the principal instrument indealing successfully with international disputes andconflicts. The Bolivian people hopes for a just andlasting peace between Israel  Palestine and the Arabpeoples. May the deliberations of the General Assemblycontribute to consolidating that process.27The situations in the former Yugoslavia and in otherareas are a direct consequence of actions in the service ofmisguided geopolitical interests aimed at social and politicaldestabilization of foreign territories  We hope that thesenseless repetition of such practices  which have had suchwoeful effects in Central Europe  Asia and Africa  will notlead to similar disasters in other regions. Furthermore  theGovernment and the people of Bolivia condemn policies of""ethnic cleansing"" in the strongest terms and call upon theinternational community to take resolute and clear measuresto put an end to those actions and to punish thoseresponsible for them.Latin America stands unconditionally in support ofdemocracy and against the illegal use of military means andforce  in accordance with the recent declaration of thepresidential summit of the Rio Group  the resolutions of theOrganization of American States and of the United Nationsand the numerous proclamations of Parliaments and popularorganizations from all over the continent.Democracy  of course  cannot be left undefended.Bolivia has had the bitter experience of long dictatorialinterruptions in its institutional life. Consequently  Boliviastands today with the people of Haiti and its legitimateGovernment  and it supports the immediate return ofPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the restoration of thedemocratic regime.History has shown that peace  justice and respect forthe principle of self-determination can be guaranteed onlywhen there are consolidated democratic institutions capableof defending and promoting human rights. Solidaritycannot be left at the rostrum. My country reiterates itswillingness to help  within its available means  in theprocess of restoring Haitian democracy to the extent thelegitimate Government of that country deems our helpuseful.The ending of the cold war must apply also to LatinAmerica and make it possible  through dialogue andunderstanding among the parties concerned  for Cuba to bereintegrated into the inter-American community.All States of the world must contribute to ensuringpeace  brotherhood and the timely solution of problems thatare as yet unresolved. To that end  action must be taken toenable peoples to develop  since economic backwardnessand its social effects are at the root of the crises andconflicts we face.We therefore attach high priority to the themes ofthe ""Agenda for Development"". Economiccomplementarity  the transfer of technology  trade  theopening up of economies  foreign investment and co-operation should be our instruments for strengtheningsolidarity and friendship among peoples andGovernments.In this spirit  Bolivia strongly supports LatinAmerican unity and subregional integration  hemisphericagreements  and any opportunity that may present itselffor exchanges between nations.These aims - cooperation and complementarity friendship and solidarity - must serve as the basis of thenew international order. For that reason  the observanceof the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter inSan Francisco should provide an opportunity to makesubstantive progress in adapting the United Nations to thenew realities and demands of the world community.Governments on all continents must demonstrate theability to save future generations from the scourge of war.We must make human rights  individual and collective fully effective. International justice must become possibleand be assured  and social progress within the broadestconcept of freedom must be promoted.In international relations in the third millennium  lawmust cease to be the instrument of the stronger  servingto entrench injustices  and must become the sole andeffective means of resolving disputes  rectifying the errorsand excesses of past generations as often as may benecessary.On the subject of respect for the rules of inter-Staterelations  Bolivia welcomes the entry into force of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea andwelcomes the fact that 1998 is to be the InternationalYear of the Oceans. Convinced that recovering ourcountry’s access to the sea is an inalienable right ofBolivia  the Government of President Sánchez de Lozadais working to secure for the Bolivian people  during thecurrent decade  a real solution to the unjust land-lockedsituation with which it has had to contend for over100 years. My country believes in the force ofconvictions  in the force of international solidarity  in theforce and the evolution of law  and in the possibilities offriendly negotiation with a view to overcoming disputes.Democracy must find clear expression in inter-Staterelations. Participation by countries large and small in28the resolution of issues that affect all of them must beequitable and not  as is sometimes the case  mere words.This presupposes  among other things  a change in theorganization and composition of the Security Council sothat with its permanent and non-permanent members  it willbe representative of the realities and requirements ofappropriate participation  reflecting the obvious emergenceof new centres of power in different parts of the world. Itwill also be necessary to strengthen the role of the GeneralAssembly and to restore the United Nations its central rolein the resolution of the major economic problems of theplanet  a task which  for the present  remains the exclusivepreserve of the super-Powers.The right to development is an objective necessity although exercise of the right still seems remote for the vastmajority of the world’s population. We must assume aneffective commitment to give that right the same prioritytreatment as is given to the human rights of individuals.If the present generation is unable to defeat growingpoverty and secure employment opportunities for thealready vast global army of the indigent  it will beimpossible to ensure the peace and well-being in thedeveloped regions of the world. Population growth  massmigrations and globalization will take their toll  with anegative effect on the dignity  the peaceful co-existence and the hopes of all mankind for a better life.Over the centuries  the Andean peoples of Boliviahave wisely been guided by three fundamental rules which in the Quechua language  are: ""AMA SUA  AMALLULLA  AMA KHELLA""  meaning ""Do not steal  do notbe idle  do not lie"".If those three rules were also applied in relationsbetween States and nations today  they would have to be:""Do not unjustly exploit the fruits of your neighbours’work. Do not complacently enjoy your splendid life-styleamid universal poverty. Do not make promises ofsolidarity and understanding that you are not prepared tokeep.""I feel sure that the ability of all of us to live togetherwould be infinitely enhanced were we to be guided by suchrules."
"24",959,"BRA",49,1994,"It is with great pleasurethat I present my compliments to you  Mr. Amara Essy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Côted’Ivoire  and congratulate you on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.I would also like to extend my recognition toAmbassador Samuel Insanally  who  as President of theAssembly at its forty-eighth session  dignified not only hisown country  Guyana  but all the countries of the Amazonand South American region as well. I also greet theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to whomI convey my gratitude for the tireless efforts he has beenundertaking at the head of this Organization.The close of this century is marked by the force oftransformation. In the last few years there has beenprodigious change. This has been of such a radical naturethat we could  like Hamlet  say that ""The time is out ofjoint"" (Shakespeare  Hamlet  Act I  scene v). The processhas been so fascinating that some have deludedthemselves with the fantasy that the future is alreadyunder control. That is not the case. Transformation doesnot have a fixed  inexorable course. We must not allowourselves to be enticed by hasty interpretations or bymere appearances. It is our responsibility to givemeaning to change and to guide trends in accordance withthe greater interests of the world community.1It will be five years next November since the BerlinWall crumbled. That period is sufficient for evaluating thedistances that have been covered and  above all  forcharting a course that will lead us to a safe harbour. Thecold war took place under the sign of denial  a situationreflected even in the language that marked the period. Theexpressions that identified and explained almost 40 years oftense relationships denoted confrontation  exclusion or  atbest  uncomfortable coexistence of opposites. Thecatchphrases of the day were ""iron curtain""  ""containment""and ""balance of terror"".Today we are in the midst of transition. Taking stockof these last few years  we can say that the results  thoughtenuous and imperfect  are positive. The cause of peacehas made significant headway. Nuclear war has ceased tobe an impending threat. Conflicts which many of us judgedinsoluble either have been or are in the process of beingsettled through dialogue and negotiation. In southernAfrica and in the Middle East  steps of historic significancehave been taken toward a more just and a more peacefulworld. In Central America and in South-East Asia progress is tangible. Throughout the greater part of ourplanet  the logic of confrontation is giving way to the logicof cooperation.It is that very logic that we wish to see firmlyestablished in our own region. Peace and fraternity areLatin America’s vocation. We have been striving to bringthe sister Republic of Cuba fully into the inter-Americanand international fold by means of a policy of outstretchedhands  of dialogue and of rapprochement. Political economic and commercial isolation  apart from beingunjustifiable  only contributes to aggravating the hardshipendured by the Cuban people at a time when we perceivepositive indications of democratic reform and ofreconciliation. Here too the stasis of confrontation mustgive way to the dynamics of dialogue  putting to rest thisremnant of the cold war.Given a set of entirely different characteristics  we areequally interested in promoting a lasting solution to theHaitian crisis  the return to office of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide  and national reconciliation. Thediplomatic efforts of the international community  which wefirmly support  must have as their point of reference theprompt removal of the de facto authorities by peacefulmeans - the only means to avoid even greater suffering forthe Haitian people. We consider it disturbing that theprinciples of non-intervention and self-determination are theobject of interpretations that are incompatible with thecharters of the United Nations and of the Organization ofAmerican States. The gravity of the Haitian crisis andthe urgency of the need to solve it do not make us unableto see the inherent risks of a situation that evokes traumasand scars that are still very vivid in the memory of LatinAmerica. Once the legitimate Government is re-established  it will be the responsibility of theinternational community to provide Haiti with assistancein the daunting task of national reconstruction.We are still far from universal peace. Conflicts ofenormous cruelty shock the world and are the cause ofunspeakable suffering for millions of human beings.Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina are emblematictragedies of our times. The scenes of horror shown bythe media attest to the difficulty of finding effectivesolutions to the imbalances which challenge all peoples.The intensification of migratory flows toward developedcountries has been accompanied by an exacerbation ofxenophobia and racial discrimination.Critical situations continue to challenge theinternational community’s ability to ensure peace andharmony. In Angola  a country so closely linked toBrazil by historic and cultural ties  we witness with painand indignation the prolongation of a conflict that is thelongest and most devastating civil war today. We areencouraged by the prospects that the negotiations underway in Lusaka between the Government of Angola andUNITA may be promptly concluded. In paying a tributeto President José Eduardo dos Santos for his politicalconduct  we urge UNITA to demonstrate a realcommitment to stability and peace in the country  and wecall upon all those with an influence on the Angolancrisis to do likewise.We welcome the progress achieved in Mozambique.The process of national reconciliation will culminate inthe general elections to be held next October  when thepeople of Mozambique will be able to choose  in free andfair elections  the government that will lead the countryin this new era of its history. President Joaquim Chissanohas played a central role in this process. Brazil takespride in the fact that Brazilian troops are participating through the United Nations Operation in Mozambique(ONUMOZ)  in the reconstruction of Mozambique.In the case of East Timor  we have also notedpositive signals in the negotiating process promoted bythe Secretary-General  to whom we pay a tribute.Democracy and the values associated with it are thegreatest conquest of our time. We are experiencing an2ethical revolution. The concern with human rights gainsuniversality alongside a growing awareness of theimperative of public probity. The international context hasceased to be the exclusive domain of the raison d’état andhas acquired a more human dimension directed to thewelfare of the individual.In the economic and commercial sphere  recentdevelopments are also positive. After eight years ofdifficult negotiations within the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  weadopted the Marrakesh agreements. The World TradeOrganization (WTO) will open up new and promisingoutlooks for the economic relationship among nations.Unilateralism and protectionism  derived from parochialinterests  will lose any semblance of legitimacy.The effective progress achieved cannot obscure thefact that there are challenges that continue to demand firmresolve from the international community.The fundamental rights of individuals  despite havingbeen incorporated into the realm of universally recognizedvalues  still demand the firm and decided support of allthose who believe in them.The social conditions of the majority of the world’spopulation continue to deteriorate. In the last 20 years  thegap has widened between rich and poor nations  betweenthe millions of people who are adequately fed and educatedand have a surplus for leisure and the billions who arestruggling for survival. The pressures for migration towardthe developed North and the many conflicts of theimpoverished South are two sides of the same coin. Youth in particular  continues to be a victim of deprivation and ofa lack of prospects in most of the world.The globalization of the economy and thestrengthening of free trade have yet to demonstrate inpractice their undeniable potential as factors of growth andwell-being. Lingering protectionism  now draped in newcolours  resists the assault of economic rationality. Thepositive impact of the Marrakesh agreements is undersubstantial threat from new conditionalities that will havea restrictive effect on the flows of international trade.Issues that are in themselves legitimate  such as theprotection of the environment and universally acceptedlabour standards  cannot and should not serve as pretextsfor even greater barriers to the access of goods produced inpoor countries to the markets of wealthier nations. Thecost of readjustment of the most prosperous economiescannot be shunted onto the shoulders of those whopossess little or nothing.The mastery of technology is a major watershedbetween industrialized and developing countries. Thedifficulties in access to advanced technologies are anobstacle to overcoming the disadvantages of developingcountries  reducing their competitiveness and creatingbarriers to the transformation of productive processes.The new international division of labour cannot re-enactpast formulas that have proved to be inefficient. Thecompetitive integration of developing countries into theworld economy must build upon dynamic comparativeadvantages  not static ones  with an increasing integrationof knowledge into the productive process. Alongside theindispensable internal efforts of each country  such aqualitative leap requires an international environmentbased on cooperation.In order to consolidate peace and ensure that theprogress already achieved shall be irreversible  we mustbe able to develop a vision for our future  an attainableand forward-looking Utopia. Brazil is convinced that atruly new order must be based on a pluralistic anddemocratic perspective on international relations.We do not contend unrealistically that States andother international players will refrain from affirmingtheir specific and often conflicting interests. The fact isthat we all stand to gain  and our interests will be betterserved  once the basic aspirations of the great majorityhave been reasonably satisfied.Interdependence must be understood in an integratedway  and not merely as the expression of a market-economy phenomenon. It presupposes the political abilityto act in coordination with others toward the fulfilment ofobjectives shared by all mankind. In an interdependentworld the improvement of living conditions in a poorcountry may have an impact on the creation of jobs in adeveloped nation. The integration of those that areexcluded and the promotion of participation by all inworld affairs is not only a moral obligation  but  first andforemost  a demonstration of lucid judgement.The fundamental commitment to development is thecornerstone of the order to which Brazil aspires. Thisconcept has the advantage of encompassing the essentialneeds of all nations  large and small  rich and poor.Development reinforces freedom  invests the dignity ofman with a concrete dimension  stresses efficiency 3promotes stability and enhances democracy. Developmentbuilds peace.The promotion of development stands to benefit fromthe lessons of the past. We must formulate a concept ofdevelopment that recognizes each country as the main actorin creating its own prosperity  while incorporating thevarious features of its international dimension in the fieldsof trade  investment and flows of technology.A renewed international effort in favour ofdevelopment will be successful only under an active andmutually advantageous partnership between the countries ofthe North and those of the South. Advancement of theinterests of the richer nations requires their involvement inefforts to overcome the backwardness of the lessprosperous. To hold the opposite view would betantamount to believing that a fire in our neighbour’s housecannot reach over the fence into our own. In short  it is anabsurdity the price of which even the wealthiest cannotafford.The nations of the world have a fundamental role toplay in the construction of an open and equitableinternational system.We must undertake a profound reformulation of theUnited Nations performance in promoting development. Noother task under the United Nations mandate will moreadequately support and promote peace and establish a justand stable order.We must avoid the crystallization of an undesirabledivision of labour between the United Nations on the onehand and the Bretton Woods institutions on the other.Peace and development constitute an indivisible whole andmust support each other. This great forum cannot be keptoutside decisions on matters arising from objectivesinscribed in its very Charter.These concerns have been at the root of the launchingof the Agenda for Development  in which Braziliandiplomacy has been deeply involved.Several United Nations Conferences  some havingalready taken place  others yet to come  are significantlycontributing to shedding light upon the need for acomprehensive and coordinated consideration of thedevelopment issue. In one way or another  developmentwas a central concern  or will continue to be so  in Rio deJaneiro at the Conference on Environment andDevelopment  in Vienna at the Conference on HumanRights  and in Cairo at the Conference on Population andDevelopment  and it will continue to be so in theforthcoming meetings in Copenhagen on SocialDevelopment  and in Beijing  on Women. Awareness ofthe fact that the decisions reached at these encounters willproduce effective results only if all these issues areexamined in an integrated fashion is becomingincreasingly firm and universal.With a view to fostering a debate on all such issuesin a wider conceptual framework  the BrazilianGovernment proposes the convening of a United Nationsconference on development  possibly in 1996  whichwould seek to synthesize the initiatives and programmesdesigned to promote human dignity and well-being.Democracy should be the rule for political relationswithin and among States. To bring democracy intopolitics and international relations is a goal which can beturned into reality. The strengthening of the role of theGeneral Assembly and the expansion of the SecurityCouncil  with the participation of developing countries inall member categories are important and necessary stepson the road to democratization and greater legitimacy.Like other Member States  we favour a reform of theSecurity Council that will increase its effectiveness. Weunderstand that such effectiveness will be ensured only bya composition truly representative of the worldcommunity. At the beginning of this month the Heads ofState and Government of the 14 nations from LatinAmerica and the Caribbean which form the Group of Riomet in Rio de Janeiro and stated that""in accordance with their legal tradition and theircontribution to the cause of peace  the LatinAmerican and Caribbean region must be included inany expansion of the Security Council"".Brazil has participated actively in the debate on theexpansion of the Security Council. We have clearlystated our readiness to assume all responsibilities requiredof countries eligible to occupy permanent seats.Elected to the Security Council for the currentperiod  Brazil has lived up to its responsibilities. Wehave based our positions on respect for principles such asnon-intervention  as well as on the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of States; we have consistentlyfavoured peaceful and negotiated solutions to conflicts  aswell as consensus; we have stood by the rule of law insafeguarding the international public order; we have risen4in defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms; andwe have increasingly participated in peace-keepingoperations in several regions of the globe.As part of Latin America  we are proud of sharing itslong history of peace. Latin America is the least armedregion of the world and the only one to have become  byvirtue of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  definitively free fromnuclear weapons. Cuba’s adherence to the Treaty announced in a letter from President Fidel Castro toPresident Itamar Franco - in response to a Brazilianinitiative - has brought this process to a conclusion.Latin America has been a factor of internationalstability in a turbulent world. Our legal tradition  builtthrough decades of efforts to regulate inter-Americanrelations  represents a relevant contribution to theinternational community. As pioneers in the promotion ofdisarmament  we feel entitled to seek equivalent gesturesfrom the entire international community  and in particularfrom the nuclear-weapon States. In this context  weattribute special significance to the prompt adoption through multilaterally negotiated commitments  of effectivemeasures to reduce  and not merely control  their arsenals including sensitive nuclear material such as plutonium. Itis likewise imperative that negotiations on a comprehensivetest-ban treaty be successfully concluded  leading tosignature.Brazil is ready to join in the construction of a newinternational agenda based on universal participation andcooperation for peace and development.This readiness derives from our own identity. We area pluralist and open society  having emerged from themeeting of different cultures and ways of life  which in turnproduced a new culture and way of life  founded ontolerance and understanding. We enjoy peacefully definedborders with 10 neighbouring countries  and an absence ofconflicts for more than 120 years.Forged through dialogue  conciliation and peacefulreform  Brazilian society is experiencing a moment ofintense democratic affirmation under the leadership ofPresident Itamar Franco. In a few days we shall be holdingthe largest elections in our country’s history. Nearly 100million voters will cast their ballots  in an atmosphere ofabsolute freedom  to choose their representatives in theexecutive and legislative branches at the State and federallevels from as many as 35 000 candidates.Ours is one of the most diversified economies in thesouthern hemisphere. As we head toward economicstability  with a strong currency  conditions becomefavourable for the resumption of a sustained process ofeconomic growth which will undoubtedly place Brazilonce again among the most dynamic economies in theworld.We have made important advances in increasing theexposure of our economy to world trade. As of nextJanuary  we will have brought into force a commonexternal tariff  along with Argentina  Paraguay andUruguay  and will have consolidated a Customs Unioncapable of generating growth and prosperity  one of thefirst customs unions among developing countries. Theinterest expressed by other South American countries injoining MERCOSUR - Common Market of the South -provides ample proof that the vision of a South Americanfree trade area is gradually materializing. Theseaccomplishments represent a telling example of theenterprising capacity of Latin American nations  andconstitute a fundamental step toward a harmonious andintegrated South America.Our efforts in developing political and economiccooperation go well beyond Latin America. In line withthe universal inspiration of our diplomacy  we have setout to reinforce the ties that associate us to friendlynations in all regions of the globe  as well as to expandinto new and important political and commercialpartnerships. Such actions range from the intensificationof traditional relations within our hemisphere and withindustrialized countries to new and creative formulas forcooperating with countries in Africa  Asia and the MiddleEast. In all cases  we have tried to raise the dialogue toincreasingly higher levels and  in many instances  havesucceeded in establishing dynamic and privilegedrelationships.The ties between Brazil and African nations havebeen strengthened through the action taken to givestructure to the community of Portuguese-speakingcountries. This new and important forum will unite ourbrothers and sisters on different continents and lead toeven greater understanding and cooperation.Beginning in the South Atlantic which we share  weintend to expand the horizons of cooperation betweenAmerica and Africa  with the added strength  in thepolitical and moral spheres  brought about by the electionof Nelson Mandela in the new South Africa.5The zone of peace and cooperation of the SouthAtlantic will transform this area into a zone free of nuclearweapons  constituting an example of solidarity andbrotherhood between two continents. With this objective inmind  the 24 countries that make up this forum have justmet in Brasilia  with very encouraging results for friendshipbetween Africa and South America.Brazil desires for itself what it desires for each andevery other nation. We know that there can be nohappiness and prosperity in the midst of strife andmisfortune. Together with the family of nations  Brazil which does not countenance any form of hegemony  seeksto move forward in a spirit of confidence toward thecreation of a world order responsive to the aspirations fordemocracy  stability  disarmament and respect for thesovereignty of States and a world order committed todevelopment."
"25",1003,"BRB",49,1994,"Mr President  it is a pleasurefor me to congratulate you  Foreign Minister Essy  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. The Barbados delegation hascooperated closely with Your Excellency in the past  andwe have every confidence that you will guide the work ofthis session with distinction.It is with a deep sense of pride and satisfaction that Ialso offer my Government’s congratulations to our outgoingPresident  Ambassador Rudy Insanally of Guyana. As thefirst representative from the Caribbean to hold that highoffice  Ambassador Insanally has represented the entireregion with exemplary skill and diplomacy  and has leftmuch seminal work for us to build upon over the comingmonths.I also extend the good wishes of the BarbadosGovernment to our distinguished Secretary-General  DrBoutros Boutros-Ghali  whom the Barbadian people had thehonour of receiving in Bridgetown earlier this year. Weoffer him our continued support in his difficult task at thehelm of the Organization at so crucial an epoch in worldaffairs.On 23 June this year  the Republic of South Africareceived a warm and emotional welcome back to this Hallas it formally resumed its participation in the work of theAssembly.As it did then  Barbados warmly welcomes thereturn of South Africa to the community of nations. Aswe rejoice at the demise of apartheid  we are still greatlymoved by the tremendous sacrifices made by the men women and children of South Africa that made ademocratic South Africa possible  and by thesteadfastness and the statesmanship of the South Africanleaders  particularly President Mandela  whose greatstature and wisdom captivated this body some seven daysago. We also acknowledge the sterling contribution ofthe Special Committee against Apartheid  which for32 years worked unremittingly to achieve this remarkableoutcome.South Africa is well poised to play a significant rolein this Organization  and the international community hasmuch to learn from the South African experience.It is  however  imperative that we recognize thatSouth Africa still very much needs our assistance with thegreat challenges that lie ahead. The Government ofBarbados pledges to support the Government of SouthAfrica as it strives to improve the quality of life for itscitizens.Barbados is greatly encouraged by the progress madein the search for a just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast since the signing of the Washington Declaration byIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization inSeptember last year. The Cairo Accord  which paved theway for the commencement of Palestinian self-rule in theGaza Strip and in Jericho  and the Israeli-JordanianDeclaration  signed in Washington in July this year  arewelcome steps on the difficult path towards the attainmentof peace in that region.Barbados hopes that future resolutions on the MiddleEast will be reflective of these advances and will serve asa fillip to the parties engaged in the negotiation processas they strive to achieve a comprehensive peace inaccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).The people of Barbados went to the polls on6 September and  in an incident-free election  voted a newGovernment into office. I am honoured to be a part ofthat new order. The democracy that Barbados practices6is ingrained in the culture and habits of its people. Forthem  freedom of speech and association and freedom tovote at regular intervals for a Government of their choiceand to have the Government installed in an immediate andorderly transfer of power are the simple and natural normsof life. Yet  sadly  what we in Barbados take for granted others close by in our own hemisphere still struggle toachieve.My country  Barbados  has gained internationalrecognition for its comprehensive network of socialservices  its people-oriented development policies and itshigh quality of life  which have earned it first place in thedeveloping world in the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme’s Human Development Index. The presentGovernment of the Barbados Labour Party fully recognizesthe challenges that lie ahead for a small  middle-incomecountry like Barbados to sustain that achievement in aninternational economic environment that continues tomarginalize the small and fragile in the developing world.With few resource endowments  our survival must dependexclusively on the skills of our industrial and committedpeople and on the God-given beauty of our naturalenvironment.The new Government has responded immediately tothat challenge in its manifesto ""Charter for Change""  afundamental policy document that represents a solemncompact by this Government to work together with itscitizens in seeking for Barbados a strong  strategic positionin the global community of nations as we approach thetwenty-first century. We are determined to use theopportunities created by the technological andcommunications revolution to overcome the obstacle of sizeand to harness our natural and strategic assets to convertBarbados into a full-service economy. We will encouragethe development of tourism and the international financialservices and informatics sectors to their fullest potential.We will create a business-friendly environment that will beconducive to new investment  both local and foreign. Wewill facilitate the growth and development of the small-business sector and encourage entrepreneurship. Aradically restructured Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ForeignTrade and International Business  under my direction  hasbeen put in place to spearhead this endeavour.Against this background  the people of Barbados viewwith concern the tragic situation of Haiti. For far too longHaiti has been a burden on the collective conscience of theregion. For too long a just and equitable solution has notonly eluded the countries in our own hemisphere  buteluded also the grasp of the Security Council of the UnitedNations. We are greatly encouraged that the deploymentinto Haiti of the multinational force took place underpeaceful circumstances and that the spectre of a bloodyconfrontation was averted. The participation of Barbadosin the multinational force and the United Nations Missionin Haiti  authorized by Security Council resolution 940(1994)  is testimony to our commitment to ensuring thatthe will of the Haitian people is finally respected andtheir lawful President and his administration restored tooffice without delay. The clear terms of resolution 940(1994) must be honoured in full  and the power of abrutal and lawless military and its callous leadershipeffectively and permanently neutralized.As stated by Prime Minister Owen Arthur ofBarbados in his recent address at the White House onbehalf of the Heads of Government of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM):“Where democracy has taken root  it should beencouraged to grow and to flourish. Like the SovietUnion and South Africa  Haiti too deserves itsrendezvous with democracy. The Haitian peoplewished for it. They suffered for it. They voted forit. And now they are dying for it.”Haiti’s rendezvous with democracy has now begunin earnest. Hope is finally returning to a people that fora very long time had felt that all was lost. But as we inCARICOM have warned on numerous previous occasions the ballot box is merely the beginning of the democraticprocess. The international community must noworchestrate a massive effort to put in place theinstitutional infrastructure necessary to maintain andstrengthen the fledgling Haitian democracy and to buryforever the ghosts of the past. The reconstruction of Haitientails the creation of conditions that will ensure that therights and freedoms of all Haitian people are respected.It must also respond effectively to the criticaldevelopment needs of the Haitian population and to theirjust aspirations to share equitably in the resources of theircountry.The Governments of the Caribbean Community arecommitted to playing their part in this vital phase of theprocess  and to this end have agreed to provide assistance in concert with other members of the internationalcommunity  in the development of a civilian force as aprofessional organization for maintaining the peace andrespect for human rights in Haiti. They are also preparedto make available to the constitutionally appointedauthorities in Haiti a cadre of officers from the public7service of the member States of CARICOM to providetraining in public administration  the conduct of electionsand other activities in support of the institutionalization ofthe democratic process.As we look across the Caribbean Community  we seemuch that gives us cause for hope. The private and publicsectors of our subregion are collaborating more and more while  at the same time  intergovernmental cooperation hasincreased. The political dialogue between Heads ofGovernment is flourishing  and economic cooperation isexpanding. Concerted efforts are also being made to boostintraregional trade and to improve the economic  social andcultural well-being of our peoples.This year the Caribbean Community celebrated itstwenty-first anniversary. A pioneer among integrationmovements in our hemisphere  CARICOM has sought torespond to the reality that Caribbean peoples share acommon destiny  which is best realized throughcoordination and cooperation in pursuit of their economic social and political well-being.This year also  building on the foundations laid bymany statesmen of the Caribbean and on the ideas mostrecently developed by the West Indian Commission  theleaders of 25 States whose shores are washed by theCaribbean Sea met at Cartagena  Colombia  to sign theConvention establishing the Association of CaribbeanStates. The Association will bring together in theircommon pursuit of development 40 Caribbean-basin States countries and territories with a total population of200 million. Its stated aims are: to promote  utilize anddevelop the collective capabilities of the Caribbean regionto achieve sustainable cultural economic  social  scientificand technological advancement; to develop the potential ofthe Caribbean Sea through interaction among memberStates and with third parties; to promote an enhancedeconomic space for trade and investment with opportunitiesfor cooperation and concerted action  in order to increasethe benefits which accrue to the peoples of the Caribbeanfrom their resources and assets  including the CaribbeanSea; and to establish  consolidate and augment  asappropriate  institutional structures and cooperationagreements responsive to the various cultural identities developmental needs and innovative systems within theregion.Barbados fully supports the aims of the Associationand welcomes its establishment as an important step in theconsolidation of the regional integration effort. But ouraims to foster development across the Caribbean will not becomplete until all of the partners are free to participate onan equal footing. In this regard we believe the time hascome to remove the last vestige of cold-war rivalry fromour hemisphere. We join the international community inappealing to the United States to lift its punitive economicembargo on Cuba and to facilitate the economicreintegration of that neighbouring State into the worldeconomy. We urge that political will be found to resolvethe remaining differences between the two countriesthrough further dialogue.Earlier this year  116 countries and 150non-governmental organizations were represented at theGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States  held in Barbados. Thefirst follow-up activity to be held in fulfillment of amandate from the International Conference onEnvironment and Development  the ""Earth summit""  theConference aimed to develop a blueprint of priorityactions for the implementation of Agenda 21 in thespecific context of small island developing States. Theresults of the Conference will shortly come before theGeneral Assembly for its endorsement at this session.We urge the international community to lend its fullsupport to the measures proposed to ensure sustainedfollow-up and implementation of the proposals containedin the Barbados Programme of Action.On 16 November  the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea will come into force  12 years after itwas opened for signature at Montego Bay. We welcomethe recent developments which have enhanced theprospects of universal participation in the Convention andlook forward to the inauguration of the work of itsrelevant organs. We look forward too to the successfulconclusion next year of the Conference on Straddling FishStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks  and to theadoption of a legally binding regime to regulate theconservation and management of these threatened stocks.The wise observation by the Secretary-General that“development is a fundamental right and the strongestfoundation for peace” has been recognized by the GeneralAssembly  which in recent years has been giving priorityattention to social development by convening a number ofinternational conferences devoted primarily to social andeconomic issues  as envisaged in Article 55 of theCharter.The recent International Conference on Populationand Development spoke volumes about the changingnature of international dialogue and the changing role of8women. In greater numbers and with greater strength  civilsociety in the form of non-governmental organizationsworked alongside Governments to craft a plan of actionwhich might realistically address the reproductive health ofwomen and the broader needs of women in thedevelopment process. We owe a debt of gratitude toMs. Nafis Sadik  Mr. Fred Sai and the rest of theConference leadership  who pushed for and achieved abroad consensus on many difficult issues which fall into therealm of the population and development dialogue.For my country  the outcome of the InternationalConference on Population and Development and the Plan ofAction confirm much of the effort which has been spent onimproving women’s access to family planning and healthservices. I stand before the Assembly as an example of theprogressive attitude which Barbadians hold regardingwomen’s status and leadership potential. I am alsoreminded that we too need to work on areas highlighted bythe population Conference proceedings: difficult issuessuch as reducing maternal mortality  addressing the needsof special groups such as youth  and looking at how ourpolicies and programmes further women’s empowerment.Still  I am heartened by the openness of the UnitedNations processes to the contributions of citizens’ groupsalongside Governments  and will watch with great interestthe progress at the social summit and women’s conference.These conferences  together with the 1990 World Summitfor Children and the 1992 Rio de Janiero Conference extend along a continuum which urges action to look intothe difficulties faced by our citizens and at howGovernment policies can relieve the uneven pressures whichare put upon women.Barbados considers that these meetings are of vitalimportance and that their core themes demand the adoptionof a meaningful programme of action that woulddemonstrate a firm commitment to the oft-repeated conceptthat the human being should indeed be placed at the centreof development. Poverty  unemployment  gender equality children’s rights and other integrated issues must be tackledwith the same urgency and resolve as other aspirations ofthe Charter if this Organization intends to signal a trueturning-point in its human-development strategy.The United Nations has contributed significantly topromoting and ensuring respect for and observance ofhuman rights since the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration on Human Rights on 10 December 1948. Thelegal framework and the established human rightsmachinery have been greatly strengthened by the ViennaDeclaration and Plan of Action adopted by the WorldConference on Human Rights held at Vienna in June1993. The Conference affirmed that democracy development and respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutuallyreinforcing  and especially emphasized that the right todevelopment is a basic human right.At its forty-eighth session  the General Assemblyhonoured the Latin American and Caribbean region byappointing His Excellency Mr. José Ayala Lasso ofEcuador as the first United Nations High Commissionerfor Human Rights as a first step in implementing theVienna Declaration. At its forty-ninth session  theGeneral Assembly must now seek with equal vigour toimplement the other important measures of the ViennaDeclaration. Barbados urges that the Working Group onHuman Rights pursue its mandate in a coherent transparent and balanced manner in order that the long-term interests of human rights may be truly served.Barbados believes that every human being is entitledto the unfettered enjoyment of all human rights and thatthe ultimate human right is the right to life. In thiscontext  we urge that the Assembly give seriousconsideration at this session to the harmful impact thatillicit drug trafficking  organized transnational crime andterrorism have on the effective enjoyment of humanrights. Barbados welcomes the recent decision of theCommission on Narcotic Drugs to establish a workinggroup to pursue areas of collaboration with theCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice inmaritime trafficking. We are also encouraged by theprogress the Working Group has made on the draft statutefor an international criminal court and support therecommendation by the International Law Commissionthat the General Assembly convene an internationalconference of plenipotentiaries to study the draft statuteand to conclude a convention on the establishment of aninternational criminal court.My Government has always been a strong supporterof the United Nations. We believe that in the emergingnew world order it is more critical than ever for theUnited Nations to be capable of fulfilling its role as theprimary guarantor of the security and independence ofsmall States  and as the protector of the powerless andeconomically vulnerable who form the vast majority of itsmembership. It is also important for the small  butmorally authoritative  voices of this world body tocontinue to stress the absolute necessity for the9international community to use equitably and responsiblythe powers conferred upon it in the Charter.Over the past year  priority attention has been given inthe work of the General Assembly and the Economic andSocial Council to the task of elaborating an Agenda forDevelopment as a necessary corollary to  and indeed aprerequisite for  the ""Agenda for Peace"". We have takencareful note of the Secretary-General’s report to the forty-eighth session in this regard and look forward to givingdetailed consideration to the recommendations which hewill present in his report to this session.While we recognize that the United Nations has aninescapable responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  we must acknowledge alsothat peace and development are indivisible. The rootcauses of most conflicts are to be found in the legacy ofpoverty and dispossession that underdevelopmentengenders. While we agree that the world body must ofnecessity respond to critical conflict situations as they arise it must at the same time be pointed out that the vastmajority of the world’s population does not live in a stateof war or civil conflict. The betterment of the economicand social conditions of that majority deserves a centralplace in the deliberative and decision-making bodies of theUnited Nations and must be the principal objective of anAgenda for Development.An Agenda for Development must promote a newconsensus on international cooperation for development andan integrated approach which is people-centred.Furthermore  it must be based on creating a newcooperative relationship between the United Nations and theBretton Woods institutions  one which recognizes thefundamental importance of the social dimension todevelopment. The policies pursued by these institutionsover the past decade  particularly within the framework ofstructural-adjustment programmes  have left a legacy whichconvinces us of the need for radical reform.We must remind ourselves that the improvement ofhuman well-being is the fundamental criterion to which thedevelopment objective must respond. There is little valuein short-term economic growth if the measures used toattain it result inevitably in social disintegration. TheBarbados delegation therefore strongly supports the view ofthe South Centre that fresh approaches must be sought anda new social contract established if social  political andeconomic objectives are to be reconciled. The UnitedNations is the appropriate forum to ensure that thisreconciliation of objectives can be promoted in auniversal  transparent and democratic manner.Several useful views have emerged over the pastyear during the discussion of the Open-Ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council.We look forward to an intensification of these discussionsduring the forty-ninth session. Any enlargement of theCouncil must only be contemplated within a context thatdeals also with the issue of equitable geographicalrepresentation  the question of the veto  and the questionof increasing the transparency of the operations of theCouncil and its accountability to the wider internationalcommunity. Decisions arrived at hastily to deal with onlyone aspect of the issue  or merely to respond to anarbitrary deadline of next year’s celebrations  will notprovide a lasting solution to this critical issue.The United Nations will have reached a remarkablemilestone in 1995 as it celebrates 50 years of tirelessservice to the goal of enabling all mankind to live indignity and enjoy better standards of life in largerfreedom. While it is fitting that we acknowledge thismilestone with appropriate ceremony  we must recognizethat the United Nations will be called upon to facechallenges in the twenty-first century that could beimmeasurably more difficult than those of the previousera. Global stability will depend more and more on theability of the United Nations to promote economic andsocial justice than on its ability to silence guns.The kind of challenges I have in mind are poignantlyetched in the following quotation from an unpublishedwork in progress entitled ""The Rwanda Poem"" by thedistinguished Barbadian poet and writer Mr. KamauBrathwaite  who  only a few days ago  received theNeustadt International Prize for Literature:""Sa/hell crumbles into these flickering milesMiles of the silences of holesOf the cold dry moon in our bellyMarrow burning its protein into its soundSkin smouldering to ashHolocaust of dome - there is no music anywhereHeads propped up on sticks of skeletonsBald headed children naked of all elseBut large deep agate space-age eyes""Global stability will be difficult to maintain if thecries of the majority of the world’s peoples  whose livesare marked by a lack of food  shelter and education and10who are afflicted by poverty  disease  and other forms ofsocial misery  continue to go unheeded and are merelyreflected as glaring statistics in United Nations reports onthe world’s social situation.It is Barbados’ belief that the challenge that willconfront the United Nations in the era ahead will lieundoubtedly in the humanitarian sphere. This Organizationis the only universal body with the legitimacy to take upthis challenge. But if it is to meet this challengesuccessfully  it must be made more efficient  effective andalert. In this context  prevention must supersede reaction.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization next year  ""We the peoples"" must renew ourcommitment to this unique body and strive to ensure itsrelevance to the twenty-first century. Mr. President  beassured of Barbados’ commitment to these endeavours."
"26",1035,"BRN",49,1994,"My congratulations  Mr.President  on your election to this high office. You arewell known in United Nations circles and your election isa tribute to your country  Côte d’Ivoire  and to you.May I also congratulate Ambassador Insanally andthank him for his great contribution. We are proud that afellow member of the Commonwealth has served theUnited Nations with such skill and distinction.It gives me great pleasure to welcome South Africaback to the General Assembly. We have long admiredthe courageous leadership of President Mandela in hiscountry’s struggle for freedom. He now faces equallygreat challenges in rebuilding South Africa. We wishhim success.I must also congratulate the people of Palestine ontheir courage and vision in signing the historic PeaceAgreements. The people of Palestine also face thechallenge of putting their painful past behind them and ofbuilding a peaceful and prosperous future. To succeedthey will need the support of the international communityand the United Nations.In our region the people of Cambodia are alsostruggling to build a new future. The United Nationsplayed a crucial role in Cambodia  but some obstaclesremain. My country supports the efforts of KingNorodom Sihanouk and his Government to rebuild andreunite Cambodia. We wish them success.The end of the cold war has placed economics at thetop of the international agenda. The challenge is how toincrease economic cooperation through more trade andinvestment. The world now needs a stable internationalenvironment to allow this to happen. We must resist thetrend towards protectionism. Instead  we must encourageand reward those who liberalize and open up theireconomies.The United Nations and its specialized agencies canhelp in this. But the end of the cold war has stretched theresources of the United Nations. Bosnia  Rwanda  Somalia Haiti and other trouble areas are consuming much of thelimited financial and manpower resources of the UnitedNations  and this has reduced its role in promotingdevelopment. It is tragic that problems of development areon the back-burner. This is not the fault of the UnitedNations. The United Nations can do no more than itsMembers are willing to do.One way to reduce the drain on United Nationsresources is for regional organizations to work with theUnited Nations in accordance with Chapter VIII of itsCharter. We may not have fully used the potential ofChapter VIII. As the Secretary-General has pointed out regional arrangements can help to reduce the burden on theUnited Nations. The United Nations takes the primaryresponsibility for international peace and security  butregional organizations such as the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) can reduce its load throughpreventive diplomacy and regional economic cooperation.They can complement the United Nations.Of course  there are many regional organizations;every region has its own. But not all of them work. If weare to realize the potential of Chapter VIII  we need freshapproaches to regional arrangements. Regionalorganizations must be realistic in their goals. They have tobuild a framework for cooperation which suits theirconditions.ASEAN  of which Brunei is a member  has achievedsome success. ASEAN offers one possible vision ofregional cooperation and development. We do not have setinstitutions and legal undertakings  as does the EuropeanUnion. Our aim is more modest. We seek to foster aculture of cooperation. Through consultation  consensusand cooperation  we have been able to contain  resolve orreduce our differences. We have concentrated on workingtogether for our common interests. This is a process ofenlarging a set of shared values. Since ASEAN wasformed in 1967  its members have evolved an informalstyle of sorting out their differences. Cooperation is not theresult of formal agreements but comes from a strong senseof common purpose.We are not without our problems. Most ASEANcountries have unresolved territorial questions with oneanother. Sensitive questions of ethnicity  culture andreligion are often involved in our relations with each other.We do not deny the existence of these issues  but wecontinue to work together wherever we can. Differencesamong us do not stop cooperation for mutual benefit.It is wiser for regional organizations to start withless ambitious goals. It took ASEAN a quarter of acentury  from 1967 to 1992  to establish habits of closecooperation and consultation. Only after this wasachieved did ASEAN feel confident enough to take thesignificant  though modest  decision to set up an ASEANFree Trade Area (AFTA) within 15 years from 1992. Weare now discussing how we can speed up AFTA andcomplete it within 10 years.We have also formed a number of growth trianglesstraddling the adjacent territories of three or moremember countries. We are all members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)  anorganization for economic cooperation and tradeliberalization  which will give greater opportunities to all.Because of such cooperation and the general stability ofthe region  trade and investments have greatly increased.All ASEAN countries are industrializing rapidly  withhigh growth rates.I offer these comments on ASEAN in the hope thatthey can contribute to discussions that will strengthen theUnited Nations system. ASEAN is well aware of its ownlimits and limitations. ASEAN does not exist in avacuum. We could not have succeeded without afavourable international environment.ASEAN is not an alternative to the United Nations.Where ASEAN succeeded  as in Cambodia  it wasbecause we worked with the major Powers within aframework defined by the United Nations. Otherwise  wewould have failed. We will and must continue to workclosely with the United Nations. All regional institutionsneed the over-arching framework of the United Nations.The United Nations  and particularly the permanentmembers of the Security Council  must retain primaryresponsibility for international peace and security.No regional organization can succeed if it shuts itselfoff from the world. Our goal is an ASEAN of all South-East Asian countries. We are gradually creating what canbe loosely described as a culture of peace and security inSouth-East Asia. We hope to extend it by linking up withother regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific region.ASEAN wants to engage all the major Powers in apattern of constructive relations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The ASEAN Regional Forum  inauguratedin Bangkok in July  brings together all major and middle-2sized Powers - the United States  Japan  the EuropeanUnion  China  Russia  Canada  Australia  South Korea andNew Zealand - in a common framework. We want theUnited Nations and all major Powers to associatethemselves with ASEAN’s Treaty of Amity andCooperation.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations isapproaching. It is an appropriate occasion for us to rethinkhow we can strengthen the United Nations system to enableit to face successfully the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. I offer my comments in the spirit of contributingto our common goal of strengthening an open world thatwill benefit all countries."
"27",1077,"BTN",49,1994,"I have the honour toconvey to you  Mr. President  and  through you  to all thedelegations here present the warm greetings and goodwishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King ofBhutan  for the success of the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly.I should first like to congratulate you  Mr. President on your unanimous election  which is a testimony to thehigh regard that the international community has for yourcountry and the confidence of this Assembly in yourpersonal leadership. Given your long association andintimate knowledge of the United Nations  we are sureyou will provide the necessary direction on the manyimportant issues that we are about to take up during thissession.I should also like to take this opportunity to place onrecord our deep appreciation and gratitude to HisExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for the excellent mannerin which he conducted the proceedings of our last session.His innovative and vigorous pursuit of discussions on thereform of the United Nations  the restructuring of theSecurity Council and the hearings on development haveset the stage for the current discussions.We should like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his distinguishedleadership. We appreciate his tireless efforts to steer theUnited Nations in bold and new directions.We had the opportunity to welcome PresidentMandela and to hear his historic and enlightened addressin this Hall. We welcome the end of apartheid and SouthAfrica's return to the family of nations.In the Middle East  the transition of the Gaza Stripand Jericho to Palestinian self-government  the return ofPresident Yasser Arafat and the signing of theWashington Declaration between Jordan and Israel clearlydemonstrate the increasing desire for peace in the region.We applaud the parties for the brave decision to embark16on the difficult path to peace. It is our hope that all partieswill join the process towards peace and reconciliation based on the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is ourhope that the international community will support thePalestinian people in bringing about economic developmentin the self-rule areas.The situation in the Gulf warrants our close attention.The international community must reject any threat againstthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. We urgeall parties to abide by and fully implement the relevantSecurity Council resolutions.The problems in Rwanda  Bosnia and Herzegovina Haiti and many other parts of the world still demand thecareful and urgent attention of the United Nations. Theseconflicts severely test the international community'scapacity and resolve to deal with humanitarian needs andconflict resolution.We welcome the continued reduction of nuclearweapons and the turning-away of such weapons from theirprevious targets. We support the extension of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons beyond 1995 andthe proposal for the negotiation of a comprehensive testban. We urge the Democratic People's Republic of Koreato continue negotiations in earnest and to comply with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency's safeguardsagreement; thereby avoiding suspicion and doubt.My delegation supports the proposal for both thereduction and the clearance of anti-personnel mines. Themanufacture of  trade in and deployment of such weapons which cause indiscriminate and mindless death andmaiming  are unconscionable. We urge all parties toparticipate in the United Nations Register of ConventionalArms. The scope of the exercise should be expanded toinclude not only trade but also manufacture and stockpiling.The arms trade should cease to provide an opportunity forprofiteering on the part of any State.For several years now we have been talking aboutrestructuring the United Nations. The discussions continue but  so far  little  if any  substantive reform has taken place.In our humble view  reform of the United Nations mustreflect the perceptions and expectations of all Members.For many of the larger Member States  the United Nationsis a forum in which to project and promote nationalpolicies. But in the case of the developing countries — inparticular  the smaller Member States — the UnitedNations guarantees independence and sovereignty andprovides an opportunity to participate in internationaldialogue. The United Nations also provides both theintellectual and the material input required for social andeconomic development in many developing countries.It is clear that the General Assembly — the onlyforum in which all Members of the United Nations arerepresented — must be the main focus of our attention.The relationship between the General Assembly and otherUnited Nations organs must be reviewed and put inproper perspective. The General Assembly itself must beable to appreciate and understand the work of thespecialized and other agencies of the United Nations andto provide direction. It must also organize itself in sucha way that it can deal more effectively with its business.Routine and symbolic resolutions must be dealt withefficiently  allowing the Assembly to focus on new andmore important challenges.The relationship between the General Assembly andthe Security Council is particularly intriguing. It is acommon mistake to think that these two bodies functionlike the legislature and the executive of a government.This myth has been perpetuated by decades of SecurityCouncil paralysis and by the artificial prominenceachieved by the General Assembly through the passing ofineffective but symbolically important resolutions. Thereality is that there is only one body of authority in theUnited Nations — the Security Council. The Council'sdecisions are binding on all Members. They carry thesanction of international law. The Assembly is explicitlyforbidden to interfere in the work of the Council unlessrequested to do so.The case for reform of the Security Council isoverwhelming. The Council must be expanded to reflectthe new realities of international relations and to make ita more representative body. It is also important that thedeeper structural flaw be redressed and the Council bemade more accountable.The financial position of the United Nationscontinues to be a matter of concern. The sudden andquantum jump in expenditure on peace-keepingoperations — now more than three times greater thanexpenditure on development — is becoming difficult tosustain. There are large-scale arrears in contributions.We do not object to peace-keeping operations  but it isclear that the finances of the United Nations must be puton a sound footing. Financial expenditures reflect the17direction and priorities of the United Nations  as well as thecommitment of its Members.The Secretary-General  in his report entitled “AnAgenda for Development”  states:“Development is a fundamental human right.Development is the most secure basis for peace.”(A/48/935  para. 3)These statements provide  in brief form  the best rationalefor recommitment to development in the post-cold-war era.Like peace  development is not a new issue before theUnited Nations; the United Nations and its agencies havebeen engaged in international development for decades.What is alarming today is that the gap between thestandards of living of developed and of developingcountries — the rich and the poor — is growing. Theconcern arises not because the well-to-do are doing betterbut because the poor are doing worse. It is no longer justpoverty but the destitution of one fifth of the world'spopulation that must be addressed.Poverty saps the human spirit. It replaces hope withdespair  creativity with dullness  admiration with envy  andcompassion with indifference. Poverty weakens the body making it susceptible to sickness and disease. Povertyclouds the mind  making it difficult for people tounderstand the circumstances of their deprivation  andgenerating bitterness against those they perceive as thecause of their misery. What is unfortunate is that in thisday and age  given the advances that mankind has made inscience and technology  commerce and industry and civiland social thought  poverty need not exist.Considerable efforts have been made to put into properperspective the major development issues of our time. TheWorld Summit for Children  the United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development  the Eighth UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTADVIII)  the World Conference on Human Rights and therecently concluded International Conference on Populationand Development not only generated a remarkableconvergence of views but also resulted in commitments toredress global concerns in the participants' respective areas.We have no doubt that the international community willapproach the World Summit for Social Development andthe Fourth World Conference on Women  to be held in1995  with the same resolve and determination.We have all committed ourselves to accepting theconclusions of the major conferences  including the variousprogrammes of action and the prescribed targets. Allcountries are working hard to translate the commitmentsinto action  but the resources available are insufficient foreffective and lasting intervention. It is a matter of greatconcern that  in fact  the resources made available fordevelopment are declining.The future of global development clearly hinges onthe provision of additional resources — additionalresources in the shape of increased official developmentassistance for both multilateral and bilateral programmes;additional resources from international financialinstitutions; additional resources through direct foreigninvestment and trade; and additional resources generatedinternally through the creation of financial markets andthe expansion of the revenue base.While there seem to be many avenues for increasingthe transfer of resources  the reality is that they haveyielded little for most least-developed countries.International banking and investments are highly selectiveand  by their nature  will not be attracted to the least-developed countries  many of which have a smalleconomy and a poor infrastructure. The creation ofinternal financial markets and the expansion of revenueare hampered by the low level of savings and the limitedcash flow in the economy. The capacity of the least-developed countries to compete in international trade isalso limited. Clearly  without increased officialdevelopment assistance many least-developed countrieswill fall further behind — and their situation is alreadyprecarious.It is ironic that resources for internationaldevelopment should decline when the United Nationsagencies are embarking on a major thrust for povertyalleviation and sustainable human development. We urgethe donor community to continue supporting the UnitedNations funding agencies. Although the trend towardsbilateral cooperation is understandable  the donorcommunity should draw on the advantages of workingthrough the United Nations agencies  given their longexperience and commendable performance in many areas.These agencies must regain the confidence of the donorcommunity through greater efficiency and bettercoordination.Credit is an essential form of input in any majordevelopment effort. The crushing debt burden of manydeveloping countries and the manner in which futurecredit requirements will have to be met must be clearlydealt with in our dialogue on development. Our18discussions must include the role of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  which must be made to work in harmony withthe efforts of United Nations agencies.Bhutan long ago accepted that development must beparticipatory and environmentally sustainable. To this endBhutan has committed itself to maintaining 60 per cent ofits land mass under forest cover  including 20 per cent asnational parks. All development activities have been builtaround this approach. We have been fortunate to receivethe generous assistance of  among others  India Switzerland  Japan  Denmark  the Netherlands  Austria Norway  Kuwait  Germany  Australia and the UnitedKingdom. Considerable support has also been madeavailable from the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  the UnitedNations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)  theInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) the World Food Programme (WFP)  United NationsVolunteers (UNV)  the Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO)  the World Health Organization (WHO)  the WorldBank and the Asian Bank. We have never taken theinvolvement of any of our development partners forgranted  and we take this opportunity to express the sinceregratitude of the people and the Government of Bhutan to allof them.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is a timefor celebration. There is much that the United Nations hasachieved for which we should all be proud. Yet it is alsoa time for reflection and self-assessment. The success ofthe next 50 years of the United Nations will depend largelyon our ability to meet the challenges of global humandevelopment."
"28",1118,"BWA",49,1994,"The Government andpeople of Botswana salute your elevation to the Presidencyof the forty-ninth session of the Assembly. Your election byacclamation is a fitting tribute not only to your personaldistinction but also to the African continent  on whose soilyou were bred and nurtured. It goes without saying therefore  that the confidence we repose in you as youguide our deliberations is beyond measure.The Secretary-General’s legendary tenacity of purposeat the helm of our Organization has continued to serve usvery well indeed. He remains undaunted by thecomplexities of the problems he faces as the world’s chiefdiplomat and peacemaker in an era marred by thecontinuing absence of peace. We salute him and his staff ofdedicated international civil servants.Let me also pay a deserved tribute to our dear brother last year’s President  Ambassador Samuel Insanally  whosetenure of office was most effective  productive and creative.We wish him a happy  hard-earned retirement from theservice of our General Assembly.The new world order remains a misnomer. Misery andwretchedness are the order of the day in many parts of theworld. The post-cold war era was to be the era ofdemocratization  peace and development  so we hoped. Yes democratization has taken root in many parts of the world including our own continent  Africa. That is to becelebrated  and should be celebrated. Unfortunately  theenergies and resources that the international communitycould be deploying to help buttress and nurture emergingdemocracies have to be expended on the search forsolutions to a multiplicity of intractable civil wars.Tragically  some of these civil wars show no sign ofamenability to solutions. They have become perennial; sois the United Nations mission to mitigate them. This placesthe United Nations in a terrible dilemma  both moral andmaterial. Unfortunately  there is very little choice for ourOrganization. It would be absolutely unconscionable toabandon a Bosnia or a Somalia to its own wretcheddevices.Nevertheless  there is no doubt that the UnitedNations peacekeeping commitments are threatening tooverwhelm the Organization’s capacities. Financialresources to sustain these commitments may soon dry up if indeed they are available  in tandem with the drying upof support for peace-keeping generally  particularlyamong the big contributors.The past year has been a year of mixed blessings forAfrica. The continent won a major victory with theliberation of South Africa from the shackles of apartheidand racism. Three-and-a-half centuries of white minoritydomination have ended  and the construction of a newnon-racial society has begun in earnest in South Africa.We heartily congratulate all the people of South Africa in their racial and cultural diversity  on the wisdom andcourage they have shown in coming to terms with theircommon destiny. We welcome the new South Africa intoour midst with open arms.Southern Africa  the erstwhile cockpit of conflict has suddenly found salvation and begun the process ofreconstruction and regional cooperation and integration.Since peace and stability are universal prerequisites fororderly economic and social development  both of whichwe have begun to savour in southern Africa  there isevery reason why we should be excited about the futureof our region.With the holding of multiparty elections in the sisterRepublic of Mozambique  the process of democratizationin the region will have come closer than ever before toculmination. Increasingly  the region is being guided inthe ordering of its political affairs by a set of commondemocratic values. Through the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community’s economic fraternity mechanisms are being developed to promote regionalapproaches to the protection of human rights and thesafeguarding of the democratic milieu that the region haslaboured so hard and shed so much blood to bring about.As an example  I would mention the case ofLesotho  about which members will have heard.Recently  when democracy was placed in danger there the region  through the good offices of three Presidents ofsouthern African countries - Zimbabwe  South Africa andBotswana - sprang into action to engage the Basotholeaders in a dialogue  which happily culminated in thecherished Lesotho democracy being saved without a shot30being fired. It was regional conflict-resolution anddiplomacy at their very best.Yet we remain troubled and pained by the fact that notall is well in other parts of the African continent by anystretch of the imagination. Our south western sisterRepublic of Angola has never had a moment of tranquillity peace or stability ever since it attained its independence 19years ago. Blood has continued to flow in that torturedcountry in ever-increasing profusion  even as we are toldthe Lusaka talks are on the verge of a successfulconclusion. This is the precious blood of innocent Angolansshed needlessly because the multiparty democracydemanded by UNITA and its supporters was won threeyears ago  only to be subjected to another round of brutalcivil war. We remain hopeful  however  that the marathontalks in Lusaka  capital of the Republic of Zambia  willproduce an agreement for the parties to implement withoutreservation.The Somali tragedy remains intractable. The presencein the fractured country of 18 000 United Nations peace-keeping troops  including Botswanans  has not made muchof a difference in the restoration of peace and tranquillityto the Somali people.Now we are faced with a threat to abandon thecountry to its fate. The international community has everyreason to be frustrated and exasperated by what looks likea total absence of any intention on the part of the warringSomali factions to reconcile and give their nation a chanceto drag itself out of the quagmire of civil war. Weunderstand this frustration and exasperation  and yet wewould find it absolutely unconscionable for the UnitedNations simply to uproot itself from Somalia when it isabundantly clear that such a course of action would havecatastrophic consequences. The decision to withdraw theUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) mustbe carefully weighed against the obvious consequences ofthe vacuum it will create.There is also Liberia  whose agony clearly knows nolimit. The madness that is being displayed by the warringfactions there is surely beyond comprehension. Is thenewly intensified fighting which has caused another exodusof refugees to neighbouring countries and wasted moreinnocent lives the way to thank the monitoring Group of theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOMOG)and the international community for the cost in lives andmaterial they have suffered and incurred in an attempt tosave Liberia from self-destruction? The first world isalready showing signs of extreme weariness about the costof peace-keeping. Soon even ECOMOG may run out ofthe means and the will to persist in its seeminglyimpossible mission to save Liberia from itself. And aslong as Liberia is in the state in which it is there is thecertainty that peace in the region at large will be andremain imperilled.Although the carnage has ended in Rwanda  thetragedy that has befallen its people has not. TheRwandese nation cannot reconcile so long as chunks of itare languishing and dying in refugee camps in foreignlands. Rwanda cannot endure any more cycles of civilwar and genocidal massacres. The tens or hundreds ofthousands of refugees encamped at present in theneighbouring countries must be helped to return to theirhomeland lest out of the frustrations of exile in theirsqualid refugee camps they ignite another cycle ofgenocide.On the perennial question of Western Sahara Botswana shares the view that it is taking far too long tohold a referendum in the Territory to allow the Sahraouipeople to decide their future. The Territory cannot andmust not be allowed to mark time forever in a limbo ofuncertainty as if the fulfillment of the aspirations of itspeople can be delayed until their final submission.Beyond the African continent  the agony of Bosniaand Herzegovina has continued to outrage the conscienceof mankind. The senseless bloodletting in that tormentedregion of Europe remains stubbornly impervious tosolution. Peace plan after peace plan has failed toimpress one side or the other  and the result is that thepatience of the international community  which has todeploy enormous resources to maintain a massivepeace-keeping presence in the area  is being tested beyondendurance. The question we ask is: How can theperpetrators of that cruel conflict ever make sense out ofit? We appeal to them to stop the carnage. Meanwhile we urge the International Tribunal set up to bring tojustice the authors and perpetrators of that barbarous warto spare no effort in doing so.We hope that in the Caribbean  the people of Haitiwill take advantage of the massive assistance they arereceiving from the international community to normalizethe situation in their country. They have a goldenopportunity to do so and to resume the journey theystarted three years ago towards a democratic future.There may be no second - or third - chance.31Botswana believes that the time has come for Cubaand the United States to negotiate an amicable end to theirprotracted estrangement. Intractable problems all over theworld  are being resolved through negotiations  and we donot believe that the cold war between Cuba and the UnitedStates is beyond resolution by negotiation. Botswanavalues the friendship of both countries and cherishes thehope that soon there will be peace and reconciliationbetween the two neighbours.The Middle East has broken out of the straitjacket ofno war- no peace. We hail the agreement clinched last yearbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO) and the rapprochement between Israel and Jordansymbolized by the signing of the Washington Declarationto bring to an end the state of war between the twocountries  and we urge that no stone be left unturned in thequest for a comprehensive solution to the problems of thatvery important area of the world.Unfortunately  the sound of the drums of war in theGulf area are piercing our ears once again. We hope thatthis time the parties involved in the war dance are merelytrying to exorcise the demons of the politics ofbrinkmanship  without any intention whatsoever of bringingworld peace to the brink and beyond.The arbitrary division of the island of Cyprus remainsunrepaired. We urge the parties to reintensify their searchfor a mutually acceptable dispensation that will makepossible the reunification of the island and its people.The same applies to the two Koreas. The people ofthe North and South are Koreans in every sense and soonthey must realize that  like the people of South Africa  whohave just triumphed over racial division  they too cantriumph if they try harder  over ideological division.We live in the age of dialogue and negotiation  the ageof reconciliation and forgiveness. No one will be excusedfor refusing to negotiate an end to a disagreement.Over the past two decades my country has experiencedan unprecedented period of economic growth. Between1970 and 1992 Botswana achieved an annual real growthrate of 12 per cent per year in gross domestic product.After being viewed as one of the world’s poorest countries with a per capita income estimated at $70  Botswanasuddenly became Africa’s success story  a success born outof a stable  democratic political system and a free-marketeconomy. Our democratic system is now so entrenchedthat it has become our nation’s second nature. The happyresult is that Botswana is free from any ethnic or tribalconflict.Regrettably  we have not been spared the wrath ofthe world recession and have thus experienced dramaticdeclines in growth rates. Our economic growth  heavilyinfluenced by the development of minerals  particularlydiamonds  has experienced adverse effects arising fromthe fall in the price of diamonds. Our country hasentered the most challenging period since independence.Africa as a whole is engaged  in one form oranother  in economic and political reforms that need thesupport and cooperation of the donor community and themultilateral financial institutions. Poverty is anunderlying factor of underdevelopment that many Africancountries have to contend with today. Regrettably implementation of the structural adjustment programme welcome as it is in the restructuring of Africaneconomies  has in many instances worsened the socialconditions of the poor in the short term. This is whyBotswana looks forward to the forthcoming WorldSummit on Social Development  where we will have theopportunity to address these anomalies in a very seriousmanner.Botswana is encouraged by the ongoing process ofreform and revitalization of the United Nations in theeconomic  social and related fields. The adoption ofGeneral Assembly resolution 48/162 has brought aboutunprecedented changes in the working of the UnitedNations system  at the level both of the Economic andSocial Council and of the Second Committee of theGeneral Assembly; we welcome all of this. It is our hopethat these changes will bring about efficiency andeffectiveness in addressing the needs and concerns ofdeveloping countries at the policy-making and operationallevels.With regard to reform of the Security Council  I cando no better than quote the African Common PositionPaper on United Nations Reforms:""The expansion and equitable representation in theSecurity Council has become imperative because ofthe need to democratize and make the Council more32efficient and transparent. In this era  the democracythat is being preached at national level should pervadethe international system. It is thus necessary to reviewboth the composition and the decision-making processof the Council  in line with the above principles  andtaking into account the relationship between theCouncil and the General Assembly. In implementingthese ideals  it is necessary to bear in mind the needfor equitable geographical representation  whichemphasizes increased permanent membership fordeveloping countries  particularly in Africa.""We are due to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of this Organization. The United Nations hasamply vindicated its existence. It survived the distractionsand ravages of the cold war with its sense of purposerelatively intact. Botswana’s fidelity to the purposes andprinciples of the Organization’s Charter remains unstinting.It is therefore our cherished hope that the next century willusher in an environment in which the Organization willthrive in the pursuit of these purposes and principles."
"29",1161,"CAF",49,1994,"The delegation of the new Central African Republic which is attending a session of the General Assembly forthe first time  is pleased to be here and expresses to you Mr. President  and all other representatives  its warmestgreetings and the best wishes of the Government andpeople of the Central African Republic.It is with pride that my delegation sees you Mr. President  guiding the General Assembly’sproceedings at its forty-ninth session. Your well-deservedelection  which honours all of Africa  is a tribute to yourcountry  Côte d’Ivoire  with which the Central AfricanRepublic enjoys excellent relations of friendship fraternity and cooperation.Since 1994 has been called the year of Africa  mydelegation and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to thememory of the late President Houphouët-Boigny.We welcome the presence in this Hall of the sisterRepublic of South Africa  and we congratulate it on thearrival of democracy there.It is with genuine pleasure that my Governmentcongratulates the President of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session  Mr. Samuel Rudolph Insanally  andcommends him for the competent and intelligent way inwhich he discharged his mandate.We also congratulate the Secretary-General  a worthyson of Africa  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who  as head ofthe Organization  made the preparations for the year ofAfrica. His admirable dynamism  realism  patience andwisdom have effectively helped to contain manyinternational problems  despite meagre resources. We wishto reiterate our firm support for him and our best wishes forevery success in his multifaceted initiatives for peace security and development.In the wake of the Second World War the UnitedNations was created as a successor to the League ofNations. It set itself the objective of  inter alia  settling ofdisputes in order to promote the economic  social andcultural development of nations.What has happened since that time? The world wasdivided into two camps — one capitalist  the othercommunist — while in between the two the third-worldcountries described as non-aligned gradually achievedinternational sovereignty. This situation led to the adventof regimes born of military coups d’état in almost all thecountries of the third world  especially in Africa. Thosemilitary regimes  which were anti-democratic because theywere not elected  seized power and held freedom hostage thereby curtailing the economic  social and culturaldevelopment of our nations. They plunged theirpopulations into unprecedented impoverishment.While the international community and the wealthycountries indulged and fostered this policy of domination waste  corruption and mismanagement  the colonized anddominated populations fought unceasingly for access todemocracy  the basis of all development. At last  near theend of 1990  the populations’ cries of alarm were heard bythe international community  which then quickly facilitatedthe third world’s access to democracy.A new era dawned  starting in the East  wherecommunism crumbled. The wind from the East blewthrough the African continent  where exhausted andtraumatized populations accepted unprecedented sacrificesand waged a ruthless battle against the military regimes inpower.Certain African countries opted for the formula ofsovereign national conferences  while others chose free democratic and transparent elections. The Central Africanpeople resolutely chose the latter path  at all cost.In this context  the Central African Republic  which Irepresent today at the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly  elected me President  Head of State of theRepublic  in a setting of serenity and transparency  andover eight other candidates who enjoyed broad supportfrom abroad. This was a victory not only for me and myParty but also for the entire Central African people. Itwas a victory won through change in favour of a new andtruly democratic Republic.I take this opportunity to thank earnestly  once again the friendly countries and international institutions thatparticipated unfailingly in the process of democratizingthe Central African Republic. I would like to mention inparticular France  the United States of America  Germany Japan  the Republic of China in Taiwan  the EuropeanUnion  the World Bank and the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP).The Central African Republic would like to base itshopes on the concrete decisions that the GeneralAssembly will be taking to eradicate the last remaininghotbeds of tension in the world at large and in Africa inparticular.Bosnia and Herzegovina  Rwanda  Burundi  Angola Liberia and other countries must find peace again  as didSouth Africa — and we welcome the presence here ofSouth Africa’s hero: the illustrious  democraticallyelected President  His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela beacon of the struggle against apartheid and for a new multi-racial and fraternal South Africa.In this context  firmly convinced of the importanceof humanitarian action in Rwanda  we supportedunhesitatingly the helpful intervention of France  whosecourage and determination we extol. That interventioncurbed human suffering and restored peace to Rwanda.I also take this opportunity to extend  on behalf ofmy country  congratulations to His Excellency Mr. BillClinton  President of the United States of America  and tothe American people for their intervention in Haiti aimedat restoring democracy and returning the democraticallyelected President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide  to office.At its forty-ninth session the General Assembly musttake concrete and urgent measures to prevent and containconflicts by establishing and strengthening legalinstruments. For weapons have never provided anylasting solutions. It is only if these legal instruments areestablished that the so-called poor countries will be ableto begin to lay the foundations of their economic  socialand cultural development in peace and tranquillity and2that the intervention of the international community and thewealthy countries will be only complementary.As to the Central African Republic  since my electionon 27 September 1993  we have endeavoured to lay thegroundwork for real democracy by giving priority todialogue and concord between all the sectors of the CentralAfrican nation.A truly democratic constitution  which reflects theprofound aspirations of my people  is being drafted and willsoon be submitted to a referendum  in December 1994.This constitution  which is the result of a broad consensus places great emphasis on justice  on fundamental freedoms and on social and family well-being achieved through work.It applies the mechanism of decentralization  alongwith its corollary  regionalization in order  on the one hand to bring the people closer while  on the other  to mobilizeall available local resources for the agro-industrialprocessing of raw materials and mineral resources  for oursubsoil is very rich  so as to improve the standard of livingin the countryside and the provinces.How will the Central African Republic  a land-lockedcountry  accomplish such a programme if its neighbours the countries of its subregion  are not at peace? A goodportion of our exported and imported goods pass throughneighbouring countries such as Cameroon and Congo.Furthermore  at the domestic level  the work of ourpeaceful peasants is systematically undermined by aphenomenon known as “zaraguinas”  or those who blockthe road. These “zaraguinas” are simply a reflection of thepolitical and military situation of our neighbours.The General Assembly will understand why theCentral African Republic agreed to act as mediator betweenthe Government of Chad and a politico-military group witha view to restoring peace to that fraternal country in itsnorthern sector. This is because peace in Chad  inCameroon  in Congo  in Sudan and in Zaire will allow theCentral African Republic to develop harmoniously promoting a dynamic and fruitful policy of good-neighbourliness and of the complementarity we require.My country has embarked on the path of mediationbetween the parties in Chad because it believes in thevirtues of dialogue and harmony in a spirit of tolerance andunity within a diversity of political opinions.Today  the agreement reached between theGovernment of Chad and the National Salvation Council forPeace and Democracy in Chad (CSNPDT) of Moise KetteNodji is entering the stage of implementation in the field thanks to the follow-up committee of Bangui II  since thisKette movement  which in the past was a politico-militarymovement  has now basically become a political party ofa conventional type  which is officially recognized.The Government of Chad  on the initiative of themediator  has just announced an amnesty for thecombatants of the CSNPDT in order to rebuild confidenceamong all Chadians and to create conditions conducive togenuine reconciliation within Chad before the forthcomingelections in the country.We are also prepared to make our contribution to thesettlement of internal conflicts in those neighbouringcountries that have appealed to us for assistance.I have elaborated on the major problems of concernto my country  the Central African Republic  and alsothose of neighbouring countries as concerns lasting peacein Central Africa and in the world at large  and theAssembly will understand that I am deeply committed torespect for human rights and for the rule of law. I am afree man  and I say what I believe. I tell the truth because the truth makes one free. I am a biologist  andI know that a good metabolism requires bothmacro-elements and oligo-elements.Therefore  it is impossible to claim respect forhuman rights and for the rights of nations if  in one wayor another  we promote discrimination for whateverreason.In the past  it was discrimination between the Eastand West blocs  whose consequences  in the form of thecold war  plunged a large part of mankind into acatastrophic situation. In the past  it was discriminationbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. In the past  it was racial discrimination inSouth Africa. Today  we still see discrimination:between the People’s Republic of China and the Republicof China in Taiwan.And yet  the Berlin Wall has fallen  as did the wallsof Jericho in days gone by  marking the end of the East-West bloc system. The conflict between Israelis andPalestinians has yielded to coexistence between the Stateof Israel and the State of Palestine. The criminalfoundations of apartheid have crumbled and given way toa new  democratic South Africa with a human face.3Why not today help the two Chinas to overcome theirtemporary divergences  which arise out of past history  inorder that China might be reconciled with itself in thehigher interests of the Chinese people and of the peoplesthat are friends of the two Chinas? Why exclude theRepublic of China in Taiwan from the great family of theinternational community? Why reject a State that has21 million inhabitants? Where is our respect for them?Why encourage the conflict between the Chinas  when weknow that the two exchange technologies and complementeach other?For my part  and on behalf of the Central AfricanRepublic  I reaffirm that we intend to maintain diplomatic economic  cultural and social relations with the two ChineseStates without restriction. The choice resides solely withthe People’s Republic of China or the Republic of China inTaiwan.The same applies to the two Koreas  because we wantto benefit from the technology of all these friendlycountries for our development. Towards this end  we baseourselves on the fundamental principle of the UnitedNations Charter: there are no large nations; there are nosmall nations.That is why my country  a co-sponsor of the draftresolution on the “Consideration of the exceptional situationof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the internationalcontext  based on the principle of universality and inaccordance with the established model of parallelrepresentation of divided countries at the United Nations” deeply regrets that this item was not placed on the agendaof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Therace towards the great market of the People’s Republic ofChina should not obscure the problems of discriminationthat exist between the Chinese peoples. I am stillconvinced that patience and wisdom will prevail one day as they have recently in many of the countries wementioned earlier.Our Organization will soon celebrate its fiftiethanniversary. It is appropriate at this time to draw up thebalance-sheet for this half-century and conduct a realassessment in order to set general policy guidelines for theyears to come. Loyal to our policy of decentralization inCentral Africa  we would also propose that the Assemblybe decentralized at the level of each continent  and that ithold its sessions in New York only every two or threeyears  in accordance with a mechanism to be establishedafter a study by experts. In this way  the other bodies ofthe United Nations system would also be brought closerto the peoples of the different continents.As regards the Security Council  Africa has achievedmaturity  and  with one third of the world’s population  isentitled to a permanent seat and also to the right of veto.This is the proposal for adaptation to present circumstancethat we draw to the Assembly’s attention.Before concluding my statement  I should like toremind to General Assembly that the late BarthélemyBoganda  founding President of the Central AfricanRepublic  had a prophetic vision of the development ofthe African continent. He proposed regrouping States intopolitical and economic entities  with a view to launchingthe economy of the African countries at the subregionaland regional levels. The guiding idea was to establish theUnited States of Africa. Unfortunately  those ideas which were put forward at such an early date by the lateBarthélemy Boganda  were not well understood by hispeers and therefore were systematically fought anddiscarded. The individual countries  out of nationalchauvinism and egoism  chose to make their own way.Today  Africa has regressed. It is absent at theinternational level as regards trade and industrial andagro-industrial development. And yet Africa has a wealthof all kinds of raw materials. Why have our economiesbecome so fragile? Why have our education and trainingsystems not attained their objectives — true technical scientific and socio-professional instruction  the essentialbasis for a real policy of reconstruction in our countries which are in an unprecedented state of dilapidation? Whydo our health-care systems no longer meet the aspirationsof our populations? Why are our roads in such a state ofdisrepair that it is virtually impossible to travel freelyfrom one country to another? In a word  why must westart all over?All this has happened because of differentideologies  based on the selfish interests of individualnations. It is also due to a lack of active solidarityamong African nations.Contrary to other regions of the world  where thereare clear signs of the resumption of economic growth  thepersistence of poor economic results in Africa remains asource of concern and of constant disquiet. In fact  at thepresent time  Africa accounts for under 2 per cent ofinternational trade transactions. It is being crushed underthe weight of debt  and various programmes for structuraladjustment have done nothing to change the worsening4standard of living of the entire continent  which does however  have an enormous potential in its peoples and itsnature.The trend towards a decline in the prices of rawmaterials and commodities is continuing inexorably  and thetransfer of technology is proceeding in an unsatisfactorymanner  placing Africa on the sidelines. What we need tosave the continent is a real Marshall Plan  because at thepresent time multilateral and bilateral assistance remaininsufficient to promote sustained and lasting growth.Without this growth  which is necessary to raise theAfrican people’s standard of living  lasting peace can beonly an illusion. In a word  the Central African Republicappeals for international solidarity in favour of the poorestcountries  with a view to the relaunching of theirdevelopment.In this context  my country expresses the hope thatthis session will mark a new stage in effective cooperationfor progress and peace in the entire internationalcommunity.The Central African Republic believes that toleranceand peace for development must henceforward be the mottoof the United Nations.Long live the General Assembly!"
"30",1207,"CAN",49,1994,"Canada is very pleased  Sir  that you have been elected tothe presidency of the Assembly  and it is certain that youwill  with tact and efficiency  assume the responsibility ofguiding our work. You can count on our full cooperation.The United Nations has always had a special place inCanada’s foreign policy. As I address the Assembly for thefirst time as Minister of Foreign Affairs  I am reminded ofsomething one of my illustrious predecessors  Lester B.Pearson  said about the United Nations:""We must cultivate international ideals  developinternational policies  strengthen internationalinstitutions  above all the United Nations  so thatpeace and progress can be made secure.""The Government that I represent shares his broad andnoble vision of the role and place of the United Nations.In order to face the challenges that await it at the dawn ofthe twenty-first century  the international community needs more than ever  a strong  credible multilateral institutionequipped with the tools needed to fulfil our expectations.These challenges are the maintenance of peace andinternational security  as well as development  justice democracy  human rights and the fight against inequalities.At a time when we are preparing to celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  there is no moreurgent task than the intensification of our efforts forreform in order to give our Organization the second windit needs. Let us draw inspiration from the vision andenthusiasm of the people who drafted the Charter of theUnited Nations 50 years ago.The extensive upheavals that have shaken our planetsince the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the coldwar can be symbolized in a few images. I am thinking ofthe moving image of President Nelson Mandela taking theoath of office as democratically elected President of SouthAfrica and the historic handshake between Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organizationleader  Yasser Arafat. For their people and those inCambodia  El Salvador - and soon  perhaps  Mozambiqueand Angola - who have discovered the road to peace  withthe help of the United Nations  the future is filled withhope.There is also hope in Haiti  where a courageouspeople has been subjected for too long to oppression andabject poverty. We shall share their joy when they canfinally welcome to his native land President Aristide  aliving symbol of nascent democracy.But there are also unbearable images of the victimsin the market in Sarajevo and the flood of humanityfleeing the killings in Rwanda.The international community cannot remainindifferent to conflicts that threaten the lives of millionsof innocent people and expose them to the worstviolations of their most fundamental rights. Recentexperience has shown us that only a concerted anddetermined effort on the part of the internationalcommunity can solve these problems.It is no easy task. Faced with the problems inBosnia  Somalia  Rwanda or even Haiti  some people willbe tempted to give up and wonder if the United Nationsis wrong in trying to resolve essentially internal conflictsthat have numerous complex causes.Canada does not share this opinion. We think that despite these problems  the Security Council is on theright track  even though the steps it has taken have notalways proved capable of solving all the problems.Consistent with that belief  we have always made atangible contribution to United Nations operations  as faras our circumstances permit.9The Canadian contribution to peace-keeping operationsin the territories of the former Yugoslavia totals more than2 000 soldiers and civilian police. The CanadianGovernment decided a few days ago to renew once morethe mandate of its troops for a six-month period. Canadahas always been convinced that there can be no militarysolution to the Yugoslavian conflict. It is because we wishto give peace another chance that we have chosen tomaintain our contribution to the United Nations ProtectionForce.We have also responded to the Secretary-General’sappeal for help in the tragedy of Rwanda. For two monthsours was the only country providing an air bridge to Kigali.There are 600 Canadian soldiers serving under the UnitedNations flag  and many Canadian non-governmentalorganizations have mobilized to provide help to those indistress.We will also be in Haiti  with 600 soldiers and 100police officers when the time comes to deploy the UnitedNations peace-keeping force. Our participation is a logicalsequel to our numerous efforts of the past three years torestore the democratic process in this country  to which weare attached by language  geographical proximity and themany personal ties between our peoples. The Haitianpeople can count on Canada’s lasting help as they rebuildtheir economy.We are also contributing to the Middle East peaceprocess. As the leader of the multilateral Working Groupon Refugees  we are tackling with determination that taskentrusted to us by the international community. Ourobjective is to contribute to the construction of a renewedregion where  10 years hence  no one will consider himselfor herself a refugee. We are also providing substantialfinancial assistance to the Palestinian people’sreconstruction projects. We would favourably considersending peace-keepers if the need should arise  thuscarrying on a lengthy tradition of Canadian participation inpeace-keeping operations in the region.(spoke in English)The economic and social problems facing theinternational community often receive less headlineattention than the armed conflicts. However  they are everybit as urgent. Hundreds of millions of people around theworld continue to be condemned to a life of poverty. Forwhole sectors of humanity  such basic needs as a properdiet  drinking water  education and medical care are moreof a dream than a reality.Certain parts of the developing world are currentlyexperiencing remarkable progress  while others unfortunately - the African continent in particular - arecontinuing to struggle.It is estimated that there are an unprecedented 19million refugees and displaced persons in the world. Weare witnessing a massive movement of people that noneof our societies is able to manage without the cooperationof the entire international community.The recent Cairo Conference revealed the urgentneed for effective measures to cope with the problems ofpopulation and development  problems that cannot beresolved without giving full recognition to the essentialroles of women.Our ability to translate into reality the concept ofsustainable development will have a very direct impact onthe daily lives of our fellow citizens. The fishermen ofNewfoundland and the Maritime Provinces of Canada areall too familiar with this problem. Their livelihood hasdisappeared  through the plundering of fish stocks ininternational waters off our shores. This is why webelieve an agreement must be reached without delay onfishing on the high seas.We could easily add to the list of pressing problemsthat I have just mentioned. And no one can challenge thefact that all of these problems - from peace-keeping todevelopment  including the fight against AIDS  drug-trafficking and the protection of human rights and theenvironment - require a determined  coordinated effort onthe part of the international community.A great deal has been done over the past few yearsto help our multilateral institutions to effectively facethese numerous challenges. However  much more needsto be done. Too often  the intervention of the UnitedNations comes too late  is too slow and is carried outunder inadequate conditions.The lack of political will on the part of MemberStates cannot be blamed on the Secretary-General. Onthe contrary  I would like to pay special tribute to theSecretary-General and his staff. They have done moreand better than anyone should expect from an institutiondeprived of the most elementary resources  lacking evena solid financial foundation.We must fully assume our responsibilities and givethe United Nations the tools required to fulfil its unique10mandate successfully. However  it seems that we areunable to take a second look at the habits of the past.We invest too much energy in activities of marginaluse and in unimportant quarrels when there is anemergency right under our noses.We waste valuable resources by allowing thenumerous institutions and agencies we have created overthe years to jealously protect their independence and resistchange when circumstances require a pooling of energies.As a result of our extreme reticence to implementadministrative reforms  we are handicapping the onlyinstitution on which we can depend  when modern andflexible management methods would enable us to respondmuch more effectively to the needs of the moment.Canada believes that the reforms of the United Nationssystem must be deepened and accelerated. We must domore and better with the resources at our disposal.Efforts should be concentrated on the following fivemajor priorities  which I would like to bring to yourattention.Firstly  we must strengthen the United Nationssystem’s capacity for preventive action. The UnitedNations already has a number of tools for detectingpotential conflicts  and can use a variety of mechanisms totry to eliminate problems before crises break out. Lack ofinformation is not the problem; what we need is the abilityto better analyse this information  to develop appropriatestrategies and above all to mobilize energy from allcomponents of the system.In order to act rapidly  the United Nations must beable to count on qualified human resources  available onshort notice  to complement its own personnel. This is whyCanada has prepared for the Secretary-General an inventoryof resource persons suited to missions of good offices orspecializing in elections  human rights  the administrationof justice and other such fields.At its first summit in January 1992  the SecurityCouncil recognized that non-military sources of instabilityin the economic  social  humanitarian and ecological fieldshave become threats to international peace and security.Let us recognize once and for all the need to expand thetraditional concept of security  and to mobilize allcomponents of the United Nations system to attack conflictat its very roots.We also feel that the preventive capacity of theUnited Nations system will be strengthened if we makebetter use of the expertise of those who have directknowledge of the field. The United Nations Economicand Social Council should periodically hold publichearings  similar to those held last June on the Agendafor Development  with a view to assisting the UnitedNations to better anticipate problems and to developstrategies for attacking the economic and social causes ofconflicts. The findings of its hearings could and shouldbe provided to the Security Council and the Secretary-General so that they can develop appropriate preventivemeasures.Any strategy for preventing armed conflicts alsoinvolves pursuing tangible disarmament objectives.Canada has established two priority objectives for thenext few years: nuclear non-proliferation and the controlof conventional arms.Nuclear arms control and disarmament are underway: we are continuing negotiations on a comprehensivetest-ban treaty to ban nuclear testing for all time. Canadais working in the Conference on Disarmament to securea mandate for negotiations on a convention to prohibit theproduction of fissile material for weapons purposes.Together  these treaties will have the effect ofconstraining and preventing a future nuclear arms race.In 1995 we will have to decide the fate of theworld’s nuclear non-proliferation regime; the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is veryimportant for Canada  and we believe that there is onlyone option: that the NPT must be indefinitely extended.I urge all Governments to support this option  which willallow for the continuation of a crucial instrument inpreventing the spread of nuclear-weapon technology andprovide new impetus to reduce existing stocks.We must also recognize that  although the threat ofnuclear weapons is of prime concern  the ongoing use ofconventional weapons is an equally dangerous and veryreal threat to peace and security.The task of controlling conventional weapons is theresponsibility of every Government. Huge sums arebeing spent each year purchasing such weapons  often tothe detriment of services essential to the public  such aseducation and health care. Those who are moreconcerned about the size of their military arsenal thanabout the welfare of their people should no longer expectto receive unconditional international aid.11The recently established United Nations Register ofConventional Arms is a start  and I urge Member States tomake information available to the Register as Canada hasdone.More can be done  however. For example  next yearwe will be reviewing the Convention on certainconventional weapons that deals with land-mines. Theabuse of land-mines is responsible for continued sufferingand death of civilians long after the fighting has stopped.I welcome the proposal made by President Clinton onMonday to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of anti-personnel land mines. He can count on the support andassistance of the Government of Canada on this useful idea.We must strengthen the Convention by extending its scopeto cover internal as well as international conflicts and byinsisting on effective verification measures to ensurecompliance. We will create a task force in Canada toconsider other initiatives that might be taken in the comingmonths  and I look forward to sharing ideas on this subjectwith other ministers.Secondly  we must conduct an in-depth review of theUnited Nations economic and social activities. I think Ispeak for most members of the Assembly when I expressserious concerns regarding what can best be described asthe drift of the United Nations in the economic and socialsectors. While the debate on the United Nations mandatein the areas of peace and security is lively and productive it is unfortunately too often vague and directionless whenwe tackle economic and social problems.We are not saying that everything must be changed -far from it. But certain reforms have already beenintroduced; to mention but one  we welcome the decisionto make the United Nations Development ProgrammeAdministrator responsible for system-wide coordination.But at a time when large sectors of international economicactivities are beyond the control of States  and when theresources devoted to development and internationalcooperation are subject to all manner of constraint in all ofour countries  we must rethink the role and mandate of allour multilateral institutions  including those of BrettonWoods. These questions will be taken up at next year’sGroup of Seven summit  to be held in Halifax  and shouldbe debated as widely as possible within other relevantinstitutions.Canada is ready to proceed with a comprehensive re-evaluation of its multilateral system as it applies toeconomic and social issues. If necessary  the relevance ofcertain institutions must be rethought  and a real solutionmust be found to the problem of duplication.We expect great things of the next chapter of theSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development. We shareto a great extent his visions of development  whichencompass all facets of human activity  and particularlyits social dimensions. Although the full importance ofthese dimensions has finally been grasped  they are stillpoorly integrated in our development strategies. The timehas come to translate this vision into new operationalpriorities and to adapt our institutions and structures to it.The Secretary-General should not hesitate to recommendradical reform if necessary. Together we can restore therelevance and leadership of the United Nations system.We must adapt it to the new realities of an ever-changingworld.Thirdly  we must strengthen the rapid-interventioncapability of the United Nations. The implementation ofa number of the proposals advanced by the Secretary-General in ""An Agenda for Peace"" has enabled the UnitedNations to make great strides in the area of peace-keeping. Last April the Government of Canada took theinitiative of inviting the major troop-contributing countriesto a meeting in Ottawa to discuss problems associatedwith political direction  command and control and thetraining of peace-keeping- operations personnel.In this regard  I am pleased to announce that Canadawill soon open a centre for peace-keeping research andtraining. The centre  to be located on the site of theformer military base in Cornwallis  Nova Scotia  will benamed after Lester B. Pearson  Canadian recipient of theNobel Peace Prize. I invite Member States to come andjoin us so they can share our experience and help fine-tune our future approach.The experience of the last few years leads us tobelieve that we need to explore even more innovativeoptions than those considered to date. Recent peace-keeping missions have demonstrated the limitations of thetraditional approach. As we now fully realize  rapiddeployment of intervention forces is essential.In the light of the prevailing situation  theGovernment of Canada has decided to conduct an in-depth review of the short-  medium- and long-termoptions available to us to strengthen the rapid-responsecapability of the United Nations in times of crisis. Fromamong these options  we feel that the time has come tostudy the possibility  over the long term  of creating a12permanent United Nations military force. We will ask theworld’s leading experts for their input and will inform allMember States of the results of the study.(spoke in French)Fourthly  we must improve the functioning of UnitedNations decision-making bodies.The Security Council currently bears enormousresponsibilities. Its decisions are binding on all MemberStates and have a determining influence on millions ofpeople. It is essential that the Council be able to reflect asaccurately as possible the wishes of the entire internationalcommunity. For this reason  it is imperative that thecomposition of the Council be reviewed. By making theCouncil more representative of today’s world  we canenhance the legitimacy of its actions and facilitate theirimplementation. Canada will continue to play an activerole in the negotiations launched during the last session ofthe General Assembly  with a view to concluding anagreement as soon as possible.However  an expanded Council must not be seen as apanacea. As we have said on a number of occasions  theCouncil must make its working methods more transparentand become more receptive to the viewpoints of non-member States with special concerns. More specifically Canada has advocated closer dialogue between the Counciland troop-contributing countries. The informal practicesdeveloped in recent years are a good start  but in our viewwe must look for practical ways to institutionalize them.We ask the members of the Council to keep an open mindin this regard.Finally  we must put the United Nations on a soundfinancial footing.It goes without saying that the United Nations canfulfil the mandates we give it only to the extent thatMember States meet their financial obligations andcontribute generously to its voluntary funds. The sums inquestion are no doubt modest when compared with thoseinvested elsewhere  but they represent none the less aburden that is already significant and growing larger at atime when many of our countries  Canada most definitelyincluded  are going through a difficult period of budgetaryadjustment.Our taxpayers do not question the need to contributeto the United Nations  but they are entitled to expect thattheir contributions will be spent judiciously. That is whywe attach such great importance to the need for soundmanagement of the system’s resources. The recentcreation of the new position of inspector general shouldhelp tighten controls and improve administrative practices.There is also a need to review budgetary procedures inorder to make them more transparent and to simplifythose that govern peace-keeping operations.Reviewing the scale of assessments is always aperilous undertaking  but I believe the need to do so hasbecome urgent. The current system suffers from seriousdistortions and no longer reflects properly Member States’ability to pay. We hope the General Assembly will makethis a priority issue at the current session.In the final analysis  the future of the United Nationsdepends on the willingness of its Member States to lendit political and practical support. This support depends inturn on the degree of support the Organization receivesfrom our respective citizenries. It is not only MemberStates’ credibility that is at stake  but  even moreimportant  that of the United Nations.Governments must strive to work together and incooperation with private enterprise and non-governmentalorganizations to define our new vision of the UnitedNations for the next century. This is  in part  why theCanadian Government has provided support to theCanadian Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of theUnited Nations. That Committee  which brings togetherleaders from all sectors  has prepared a remarkableprogramme of activities to commemorate the anniversaryeverywhere in our country. The emphasis is being placedon youth education and the main subjects of the UnitedNations agenda.Next year at this time  all eyes will be turnedtowards the General Assembly. Let us make thatanniversary the beginning of a new era for the UnitedNations."
"31",1268,"CHL",49,1994,"May I first congratulate you  Sir  on your election topreside over our work.I wish you every success in your presidency  andassure you that you may rely on the full cooperation ofthe delegation of Chile.I wish also to greet the Secretary-General and toassure him once again of our support in the performanceof his difficult task. When he visited Chile a few daysafter the inauguration of President Eduardo Frei  theSecretary-General had an opportunity to appreciate ourreadiness to cooperate in the activities of the UnitedNations system  in the conviction that multilateral actionwas essential to the strengthening of international peaceand security and to the improvement of the livingconditions of men and women the world over.36The fall of the ideological barriers imposed by thecold war gave rise to expectations of an era of peace andglobal security. These expectations are strengthened by thespread of democracy and the emergence of a newawareness of the importance of human rights throughout theworld. At the same time  the processes of globalization andeconomic interdependence are creating new opportunitiesfor progress and making the dissemination of technologyand knowledge more feasible.Nevertheless  five years after the end of the cold warwe must acknowledge that the reality has fallen far short ofour dreams. The last decade of this century is one ofuncertainty and contradictions. Regrettably  along with thesigns of hope there has been a re-emergence of manyeconomic  political  ethnic  religious and cultural conflictsand a tendency towards fragmentation and differentiation which pose new threats to the peace and new challenges forthe international order.This process of transition has enhanced the role of theUnited Nations as the guarantor of world peace andsecurity. It has compelled our Organization to assume newresponsibilities  both in negotiations for conflict preventionand in operations for the maintenance or restoration ofpeace.Nevertheless  the immediate concern to maintain peaceand security should not prevent us from recognizing andattacking the root causes of these conflicts. Poverty inequality between individuals and between nations environmental deterioration  unemployment and ignorance over-population  disorganized migration  and discriminationagainst women and young people are today as importantfactors in creating conflict as is military proliferation orideological confrontation - if not more so. Tackling theseproblems requires using the imagination  creativity andsolidarity of the international community  as well asresources as large as or even larger than those being spenttoday on resolving conflicts that have already begun. Thesecurity of human beings must be an international priorityalong with widespread promotion of respect for humanrights.In March of this year a new phase in the Chileandemocratic process began with the installation of theGovernment of President Eduardo Frei. The continuity ofthis process has made it possible to strengthen the stabilityof democratic institutions and has increased respect forhuman rights in the country. Of course  we do not claimthat our democracy is perfect; many aspects of it stillrequire further attention  and with that in mind draftlegislation on institutional changes is currently beingdiscussed in the National Congress. Nevertheless  we arecertain that  together with the other countries of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean  Chile will continue toadvance along the path of political stability  democraticinstitutionality and respect for human rights.Our recent economic experience has been successful.Since the return of democracy we have had an averageannual growth of more than 6.5 per cent with a very lowunemployment rate and controlled inflation. On the basisof these facts the Government has formulated anambitious modernization strategy focusing on three mainareas: education and training  development ofinfrastructure  and modernization of the State. Thereforms in education seek to respond to the need foreffective and creative integration of young people intosociety  and to meet the challenge of competitiveness.The changes in the functioning of the State entail aspecial concern for ethics and probity in the exercise ofpower.Attainment of these priorities should enable us toraise our productivity and increase our capacity tocompete in international markets in the context of agrowing open economy. We are concerned at thedifficulty the major countries are neverthelessexperiencing in opening up their economies in sectors thatare vital to the equitable functioning of world trade. Wereject an international trade system based onprotectionism by the powerful directed against those whoare prepared to accept competition.Nevertheless  economic advances would lackmeaning if they did not lead to a substantial improvementin the living conditions of the majority of Chileans. TheGovernment recognizes this and has made the eliminationof extreme poverty an essential priority of its programme.Without equity  growth would lose its raison d’être andstability would be threatened by the tensions arising outof the privations experienced by large sectors of thepopulation. Economic growth and social justice constitutetwo terms of a single equation.Latin America and the Caribbean are our naturalframe of reference and external action as a region thatshares both political and security interests and majoreconomic interests. The region has overcome thepolitical  institutional and economic crisis which afflictedit in earlier decades. Most countries of the continent haverecently held elections  or will do so in the comingmonths. The tranquillity  openness and participation that37today characterize these processes are convincing proof thatLatin America has embarked on a major process ofmodernization and stability.Along with this has come a major expansion ofcooperation and regional integration. Integration initiativesand mechanisms of varying geographical coverage andthematic scope have multiplied. Chile has participated inthese efforts  negotiating economic complementarity andfree-trade agreements with the majority of the countries inthe region. In the immediate future  Chile hopes to be ableto make a new contribution to the creation of a broad LatinAmerican economic area by achieving closer links with theCommon Market of the Southern Cone and by signingcomplementarity agreements with Ecuador and Peru to addto those already concluded with Mexico  Venezuela Argentina  Bolivia and Colombia.We also view with enthusiasm the strengthening of ourlinks with the Central American and Caribbean countrieswith which we have significantly expanded our political andeconomic relations and cooperation.We wish to promote a climate of peace  dialogue solidarity and mutual trust among the countries of theregion. We are sure that today this is more possible thanbefore  given the presence in the region of more democraticregimes than it has ever had in its history.In this context  the Rio Group has become asignificant regional political cooperation mechanism  and itsactivity has recently expanded to cover economiccoordination aspects. The strengthening of the Rio Group which emerged from our continent’s re-democratization andresurgence  is a key to Latin American’s ability to speakwith a unified voice in the new international context. Thatis how our main partners in the world  with whom we meetperiodically in discussion forums to which we are attachingincreasing importance  perceive it.Our policy towards Latin America and the Caribbeanis fully compatible with closer integration into worldmarkets. Chile today is a country that is open to the world dependent for 40 per cent of its gross national product onexternal transactions and seeking to strengthen its relationswith the dynamic centres of growth and technologicalinformation. We define our policy as an open regionalism one which seeks regional integration not in order to closeits markets but in order to achieve greater integration intothe world economy.In this connection  our preference for multilateralismis well known. We support all the phases of theextensive negotiations under the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  and arenow in the process of ratifying the agreements reachedthere.Our attitude in this respect matches that of our mainpartners in Latin America. During the eight years forwhich the Uruguay Round lasted the countries of theregion unilaterally reduced their tariffs by an average ofmore than 50 per cent and contributed by makingsignificant concessions  despite the fact that not all theobjectives they were seeking to negotiate were achieved.Accordingly  we now have the right to call for theresults of the Round to be implemented and  once theWorld Trade Organization has been established  forprogress to be made in discussion of the many problemsthe Round left pending  especially in relation toagriculture and services.Nevertheless  it is obvious that in the current phaseof the world economy multilateralism is beingaccompanied by the negotiation of partial or regionaleconomic agreements which are progressively extendingover a large part of international trading activity. Henceour interest in the integration progress in North America our search for sounder and more imaginative patterns ofeconomic relations with the European Union  ourimminent entry into the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council (APEC) and our constant readiness shared with our region  to move ahead with economiccooperation with all regions of the world.Current international circumstances have led toprogress in various areas which it is important toemphasize: the defeat of racism and apartheid  progressin disarmament  the solution of international conflicts cooperation and détente - all issues which have led to thestrengthening of the world Organization.Chile salutes the people and the Government of thenew South Africa in the person of President NelsonMandela and welcomes the success achieved by theUnited Nations and by the South African peoplethemselves in building a democratic and just South Africawhich respects the principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations.We wish also to express our support for the peaceand negotiation process under way in Angola and38Mozambique. We urge the rebel forces in both countriesto negotiate seriously and in good faith to end this conflict in compliance with United Nations resolutions. In the caseof Angola  the date of 30 September set by the President ofthe Security Council for the ending of the negotiations isapproaching  and it is accordingly essential to arrive at aspeedy solution on the basis of the ""Acordos de Paz"".Let me also express our satisfaction at the progressmade through the agreements between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization  which are overcomingobstacles to the attainment of a lasting peace throughout theMiddle East. On behalf of my country  I wish to reiterateour support for the negotiations under way between Israeland Jordan  as well as those between Israel and Lebanonand between Israel and Syria.In contrast to these positive steps  we view with greatconcern the tragedy in Rwanda  horrified at its magnitudeand at the inability of the international community tocontain it. Chile conducted a national campaign ofsolidarity with the children of Rwanda which met with anextremely good response in our country. The risk is that if efforts are not made to eliminate the deep-lying causes oftragedies such as this  other similar sources of tension mayarise in other countries  testing the capacity of our systemto react.Likewise  we cannot fail to express our most profoundconcern at and most energetic rejection of the extremes towhich the fratricidal struggle in the former Yugoslavia hasbeen taken. We urge the warring parties to abandon theuse of force as a means of solving their disputes and tosubmit them to the internationally recognized peacefulmeans of settlement.Chile is also profoundly concerned at the situation inHaiti resulting from the protracted usurpation of power andthe non-implementation of the Governors Islandagreements. The military occupation of a country is alwaysa regrettable occurrence that we should all like to avoid.Nevertheless  it is important to recognize that in thisinstance such action was taken on the basis of a SecurityCouncil resolution and in response to repeated failure tocomply with international commitments  failure for whichthe Haitian military alone are responsible.We reiterate in this Assembly our support for themeasures taken by the United Nations and  in particular our full acceptance of the resolution adopted by theSecurity Council. The Government of Chile will fulfil itscommitments to participate in the reconstruction of Haiti in the manner agreed upon with the democraticGovernment of that country  as soon as institutional orderhas been restored.Chile has cooperated in peace-keeping operations and it has recently expressed its readiness to expand thatcooperation  in the profound conviction that improving thecapacity of the United Nations system in these efforts isa priority task. The current bureaucratic mechanisms which place a very heavy burden on the countriesproviding peace-keeping contingents  must be replaced byothers that will make it possible to provide the UnitedNations with the best in human resources and equipment.It is essential to reach agreement on a statute forprotection of United Nations personnel and to create aninternational fund to administer the financing ofpeace-keeping operations.The new impetus in international disarmamentnegotiations  particularly with respect to a nuclear-test-bantreaty  increases the need for a global  democratic andparticipatory approach in this area. There is an urgentneed to increase the membership of the Conference onDisarmament - the only major multilateral negotiatingforum on these topics - to make it sufficientlyrepresentative and enable it to respond appropriately tothe new challenges.Chile considers that prohibiting the use of fissionablematerials for hostile purposes and universalizing securityguarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States would bepositive steps in the direction of nuclear disarmament.Nevertheless  their success would depend on fullacceptance of inspection and verification procedures. Instep with progress in the substantive negotiations  a needis making itself felt to extend and expand safeguards andcontrol regimes until they become universal  withoutthereby impeding the access of developing countries tosources of science and technology.The recent ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco byChile  Argentina and Brazil  as well as Cuba’s decision tosign it  will enable Latin America to become a genuinenuclear-weapon-free zone. This  together with themanifest reduction in tension and armaments in theregion  constitutes an effective contribution by our regionto world peace.In this context  we have indicated our interest inbecoming a member of the Security Council for theperiod beginning 1996. We have done so convinced thatChile can legitimately and adequately represent the39interests of Latin America and the Caribbean in thatimportant body.We can and must make substantive progress indesigning better systems for preventing conflicts or takingimmediate action to restore peace. But  unless wesimultaneously attack the enormous inequalities andprivations that lie at the root of many conflicts we shall notsignificantly reduce international tensions. The origins ofthese tensions lie in the exclusion of major sectors of theworld’s population from the benefits of the new order  anexclusion aggravated by population growth and by thecharacteristics of the new world economy  for when factorssuch as knowledge and technology come to outweighothers  such as the availability of raw materials or low-costlabour  the hopes of those who possess only an abundanceof the latter are increasingly disappointed  thus wideningand deepening the social gaps within and betweencountries.From a bitter past  Chile has learned the lesson of theclose relationship that exists between peace  democracy economic growth and social development. The centralobjective of a security policy is the security of individualsand of the communities in which they live. Theaccentuation of inequality or exclusion is not only ethicallyunacceptable  but also politically dangerous. No newinternational order will be stable or lasting if it is based onthe exclusion of the majority of those who comprise it.We are convinced that the absence of democracy andthe lack of economic growth centred on the human beingare at the root of the international instability thatcharacterizes our era. President Frei has spoken of a""diplomacy for development""  referring in these terms tothe necessity to adjust foreign policy to the objectives andneeds of each country and to the link that must necessarilyexist between our international action and our internalobjective of growth with equity. We therefore attach thegreatest importance to the Agenda for Development that isunder discussion in the United Nations.This was the thinking behind the convening of theWorld Summit for Social Development  unanimouslyapproved by the General Assembly. The analysis by Headsof State and Government in Copenhagen next March shouldlead us to a new policy to combat poverty  promoteemployment and accelerate social integration. In particular we believe that the social Summit should adopt a commoncommitment to eradicate extreme poverty in the worldthrough a concrete and efficient plan of action. What isdecided there will be intimately linked to the conditions ofsecurity and coexistence in the emerging internationalorder.The social Summit  together with the recentConference on Population and Development  held inCairo  the World Conference on Women  to be held inBeijing in 1995  and the Secretary-General’s proposedAgenda for Development  indicates the growing interestthat this Organization is taking in social issues.Chile intends to comply with the agreements reachedat the Rio de Janeiro Summit and to promote a newpolicy on environmental issues. In this context  itsNational Congress recently approved the Convention onBiological Diversity  and our ratification has just beendeposited with the United Nations. In turn  we areconvinced that environmental problems will remainunresolved  and may even become exacerbated  if thenecessary resources are not available to deal with themthrough joint action by developed and developingcountries. This is becoming increasingly apparent insome developing countries  where poverty is acceleratingenvironmental deterioration as a result of the excessiveand uncontrolled use of certain resources.The dual task of maintaining peace and at the sametime creating conditions for the elimination of structuralsources of conflict is an enormous challenge to thisOrganization. Nevertheless  we are convinced that if wedo not take up the challenge we shall reach the beginningof the next millennium without having laid the realfoundations for a new international order that will permitthe peaceful coexistence of mankind.Taking up this challenge is not a task for the majorPowers alone  although their involvement is essential;rather  it is a task for all nations capable of making acontribution - especially the medium-sized countries which make up a large part of the internationalcommunity.Chile is prepared to be a part of this effort  as are we are sure  all the countries of Latin America. Thecentral role of this Organization must be strengthened andsupported in the crucial years that lie ahead  for this is theonly way to ensure that the settlement of conflicts doesnot alter international legality  that arbitrary interventionis prevented and that the rights of the weakest arerespected."
"32",1314,"CHN",49,1994,"At the outset  I should like warmly tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency ofthe current session of the General Assembly. I amconvinced that given your outstanding talent andconsummate experience  you will fulfil this lofty missionwith distinction. At the same time  I should like to expressmy appreciation and thanks to Mr. Samuel Insanally for thepositive contribution he made during his presidency at thelast session.I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to extend ahearty welcome and congratulations to the delegation ofSouth Africa  which is taking part in the work of thecurrent session. We are convinced that a united democratic and non-racial new South Africa led byPresident Nelson Mandela will contribute positively to thepeace and development of Africa and of the world as awhole.The world is still undergoing profound changes  andthe transition toward multipolarity has accelerated.Economic factors are playing a greater role ininternational relations. Relaxation of tensions has becomethe main trend of the world today. However hegemonism and power politics continue to hold out.Regional hot spots flare up intermittently. Destabilizingfactors tend to multiply  thus compounding the volatilityof the international scene. The maintenance of peace strengthening of cooperation and promotion ofdevelopment remain the major challenges of our era.To eliminate regional hot spots and settleinternational disputes are the world’s priorities and thecommon concern with which the international communityhas been trying to deal in one way or another.Experience has shown that such practices as interfering inother countries’ internal affairs and resorting to pressure sanctions or even force at will cannot help; they can onlyincrease the complications and difficulties that stand inthe way of a final solution. In the interest of maintainingregional peace and stability  the international communityand regional organizations should take an appropriate andeffective approach  that is  to promote dialogue andnegotiations between parties directly concerned so as toreach a solution acceptable to all sides. This has beenbest illustrated by the breakthrough achieved in theMiddle East peace process and by the progress made onthe Korean nuclear issue.United Nations peace-keeping operations can play apositive role  but not all of them have been successful.Experience and lessons learned in this regard should besummed up. It is our consistent view that peace-keepingoperations should strictly conform to the principles of theUnited Nations Charter and the norms of internationalrelations. Such operations should be undertaken with theconsent and cooperation of the parties concerned  and animpartial and unbiased attitude should be maintained. Nopeace-keeping operations or humanitarian aid programmesshould be permitted to interfere in the internal affairs ofany country  still less to use force or become embroiledin a conflict between the parties. A lesson should bedrawn from what befell the United Nations peace-keepingforces in Somalia.Here I wish to underline the importance of strictadherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistenceas the basic means to prevent international conflicts.9These principles  namely  mutual respect for sovereigntyand territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression non-interference in each other’s internal affairs  equalityand mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence  were jointlyinitiated four decades ago by China  India and Myanmar -called ""Burma"" at the time - and were subsequentlyembodied in the 10 principles formulated by Asian andAfrican countries at the Bandung Conference and in thepurposes and principles espoused by the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations and other regional organizationsof the developing countries.The history of the past four decades has testified tothe immense vitality of the Five Principles. All nations notwithstanding their differences in social systems ideologies  values or religious faiths  can live in amity andcarry out mutually beneficial cooperation as long as theyabide by these principles. Failure to do so will lead tofriction  confrontation or even military conflicts. In a worldas diversified as ours  nations have no alternative but toadhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence andto find common ground while shelving their differences inorder to live together amicably and pursue commondevelopment.The peoples of the world have long lived in theshadow of a nuclear holocaust  due to the all-out nucleararms race between the two super-Powers during the coldwar  which resulted in a massive stockpiling of nuclearweapons. Now the international situation has drasticallychanged. Not only can we avert another world war  but thechances have increased for the complete prohibition andthorough elimination of nuclear weapons and for mankindultimately to eliminate the threat of a nuclear war.China has always stood for the complete prohibitionand thorough elimination of all weapons of massdestruction. The Chinese Government holds that aconvention on the complete prohibition of nuclear weaponsshould be concluded in the same way as the conventionsbanning all biological and chemical weapons  respectively.As a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  China is in favour of its extension. Yeta mere extension of the Treaty is obviously not sufficient.With a view to ultimately ridding mankind of the threat ofa nuclear war and ushering in a nuclear-weapon-free world the Chinese Government proposes the following.All countries that possess nuclear weapons shouldpledge unconditionally not to be the first to use them andshould immediately start negotiations to conclude a treatyon non-first-use of nuclear weapons against each other;efforts for the establishment of nuclear-free zones shouldbe supported and all nuclear Powers should undertake notto use or to threaten to use nuclear weapons against anynon-nuclear-weapon State or nuclear-free zone;negotiations should be undertaken with a view toconcluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty notlater than 1996; the principal nuclear Powers shouldimplement their existing nuclear disarmament treaties asscheduled and go on to drastically cut back their nuclearstockpiles; negotiations should be undertaken to concludea convention banning the production of weapon-gradefissile materials; a convention on the complete prohibitionof nuclear weapons should be signed under which allnuclear Powers should undertake the obligation to destroyall their nuclear weapons under effective internationalsupervision; and international cooperation in the peacefuluse of nuclear energy should be vigorously promotedsimultaneously with the efforts to prevent the proliferationof nuclear weapons and step up the nuclear disarmamentprocess.The above points make up an integrated andinterrelated nuclear disarmament process. We hold thatall States  whether they possess nuclear weapons or not are entitled to participate fully in this process.Since mankind has been able to make nuclearweapons and tap nuclear energy for peaceful purposes inthe twentieth century  we are confident that in the twenty-first century it will be able to completely ban and destroynuclear weapons and fully harness nuclear energy toenhance its own welfare. Before the advent of the newcentury  we stand ready to join the other nuclear as wellas non-nuclear States to blaze the way towards this loftygoal and make our due contribution to its ultimaterealization.It is now an international trend to give priority toeconomic problems. Hence all countries are devotingthemselves to economic development and the expansionof international cooperation. This year the worldeconomy has started a recovery and East Asia continuesto maintain a high growth rate. But there is unevennessin the world as a whole. It is disturbing to note that theimpoverishment of some developing countries hasworsened. In the interest of common development  wecall for the abolition of protectionism and ofdiscrimination in international economic relations andtrade. Neither global multilateral trade arrangements norregional economic and trade cooperation should beexclusive. The principles of openness  equality andmutual benefit should be upheld. The World Trade10Organization  to be founded next year  should from theoutset be a broadly representative and open trade institutionbased on equality and mutual benefit.The world economy is an interdependent whole.Developed countries should make more tangiblecontributions to global economic development and theexpansion of international economic cooperation. Primarilythey should take effective measures to open their markets provide development funds  transfer technology andincrease assistance to the developing countries to reducetheir debt burden  thereby contributing to their economicgrowth  social stability and relief from poverty. Suchactions will in turn bolster the economic growth of thedeveloped countries themselves.The international community and the United Nationsshould be more concerned with development matters and inparticular should actively help the developing countries toachieve prosperity. We appreciate the Secretary-General’sefforts in submitting the Agenda for Development pursuantto General Assembly resolutions. We hope that ourdeliberations thereon will serve to reinvigorate worldeconomic development and international cooperation.The Chinese Government considers economicdevelopment the central task of the whole nation and makesreform and opening its basic state policy. This year wehave taken a new series of major steps to intensify thereform and opening which have the effect of ensuringsustained  rapid and healthy economic growth. Grossdomestic product  foreign trade volume and overseasinvestments registered increases in the first six months of11.6 per cent  25.5 per cent and 54.9 per cent respectively compared with the corresponding period last year. We willstep up our all-directional opening-up and continue to workfor world prosperity. We have been striving for an earlyresumption of our contracting party status in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. A solution to this matterwill be in the interest of both China and the world as awhole. China needs to cooperate with the rest of the worldwhich in turn needs such an important trading partner asChina. A World Trade Organization without China wouldbe inconceivable.Human society continues to move forward and makeprogress. But social ills still stand out starkly such aspoverty  unemployment  the deteriorating environment  thepopulation explosion  refugees  illegal immigration  drugtrafficking  crime and injurious and unfair treatment ofsocial groups such as women  children and the disabled.Some of these problems have become even more acute  andhave cried out for a remedy by the world communitythrough international cooperation. We consider that it isnecessary to step up such cooperation. Becauseconditions vary  different countries face different socialproblems. Each country has to draw up socialdevelopment policies adaptable to its own conditions.International cooperation in this field should adhere to theprinciples of mutual respect  equality and mutual benefitwithout political strings or interference in domesticaffairs. Developing countries account for the majority ofthe world’s population and are in a disadvantaged positionsocially. This is where the emphasis of the UnitedNations social programmes should be placed.In recent years we have actively supported andparticipated in important international conferences on theenvironment  human rights and population under theauspices of the United Nations. We will actively takepart in the World Summit for Social Development  to beheld in Copenhagen next March. The ChineseGovernment attaches great importance to the FourthWorld Conference on Women  to be held in Beijing inSeptember 1995. The Chinese people  our women folk inparticular  are preparing for and looking forward to thisgrand event with tremendous enthusiasm.In response to the call in the documents of the 1992United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the Chinese Government has analysed theactual conditions in the country and drawn up ""Agenda 21- White Paper on China’s Population  Environment andDevelopment in the 21st Century""  which will be animportant guide in the formulation of our medium- andlong-term national  economic and social developmentplans.To ensure and protect human rights is an essentialpart of a nation’s social policy. My Government makesit a basic policy to constantly enhance the people’senjoyment of human rights commensurate with oureconomic and social development. We always hold thatthe principle of universality of human rights must beviewed in the context of the actual conditions of a givencountry. Conditions vary from country to country. It isinevitable and normal that there is divergence of views onhuman rights issues. We are in favour of dialogue on thebasis of equality and mutual respect so as to increasemutual understanding. We are against using human rightsas a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of othercountries.11Next year will mark the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations. Both the world and theUnited Nations have undergone drastic changes in that halfcentury. The United Nations is the most representativeintergovernmental Organization of sovereign States.Members of the Organization are equal  irrespective of size strength or wealth.Notwithstanding its shortcomings  the status and roleof the United Nations in global international affairs remainirreplaceable by any other international organizations orgroupings. It is the hope of the people of the world thatthe Organization will better fulfil the mission conferred onit by the Charter and and that it will make even greatercontributions to the maintenance of peace and thepromotion of development.To cope with the greatly changed internationalsituation and grim challenges ahead  United Nationsinstitutions should undergo relevant and necessary reforms.In our view  any such reforms should serve to maintain andenhance the positive role of the United Nations ininternational affairs and improve its efficiency. At thesame time  the reforms should take full account of theconcerns and interests of the developing countries  whichmake up the majority of the membership  so that their rolemay be enhanced. The function and role of the GeneralAssembly should be strengthened. Reform of the SecurityCouncil must be aimed at facilitating a better performanceof its functions under the Charter. Any enlargement of theCouncil’s membership must fully conform to the principleof equitable geographical distribution to ensure broaderrepresentation. Actions by the Council should better reflectthe collective will and common aspirations of the entireUnited Nations membership.To prepare for the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  China has set up anational committee  in accordance with the relevant UnitedNations resolution. We hope that the commemoration invarious countries in the coming year will be used to reviewthe experience of the past and look to the future so that wemay carry forward the purposes and principles of theCharter and enable the Organization to do a better job inmaintaining peace and promoting development.It was sad that the first half of our century witnessedtwo world wars with disastrous consequences for mankind.The ensuing cold war cast a dark and menacing shadow ofwar over the world for the greater part of the second halfof the century. It is gratifying  none the less  that we havebeen able to fulfil the historic mission of eliminating thecenturies-old colonial system from the Earth within thiscentury. This is unquestionably one of the greatestachievements of contemporary human society.Looking ahead to the twenty-first century  we arefully confident of the future of humanity.

"33",1349,"CIV",49,1994,"Eachyear’s session of the General Assembly provides us with anopportunity to take a panoramic view of the world’s greatquestions and to reflect on the prospects for its future.For my part  I am honoured to be speaking for thefirst time in this Assembly as President of the Republic ofCôte d’Ivoire. This experience is all the more stirring forme since I am returning to this lofty site of modern historywhere I participated in numerous sessions when I was mycountry’s young Ambassador in Washington to the greatAmerican nation. My vivid memory of those years is ofhaving all alone represented my country on the day of itsadmission to the community of sovereign nations throughthe Security Council. That was 34 years ago.I am equally proud that you  Mr. President  a worthyson of Côte d’Ivoire and of Africa  are presiding over thisforty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My pride isshared by the entire people of Côte d’Ivoire  on behalf ofwhich I extend warm congratulations on your noteworthyelection to this prestigious post.This election attests to the confidence and esteemwhich you enjoy in this forum thanks to your qualities asan experienced diplomat and to your great knowledge acquired over more than two decades  of internationalrelations  in particular in Geneva and New York. It alsoexpresses recognition of the balanced pragmatism withwhich  for 34 years now  Côte d’Ivoire has beenconducting its foreign policy.I am therefore convinced that you conduct the workof this session with competence and skill.Mr. President  allow me to thank your predecessor Ambassador Samuel Insanally  for the outstanding workhe accomplished throughout his mandate  as well as allthe members of his General Committee.Finally  on behalf of my delegation and in mypersonal capacity  I should like to pay a well-deservedtribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-Generalof our Organization  for his courageous action and histireless efforts for peace and for understanding amongpeoples. We should like to assure him once again of ourfull confidence and of our total support in his quest forpeaceful solutions to the problems the world isexperiencing.May I also take this occasion to voice  on behalf ofall citizens of Côte d’Ivoire  our deepest  most sinceregratitude to the eminent representatives of the Statesgathered here for the outstanding demonstration offriendship and solidarity shown toward my country at thetime of the death of President Félix Houphouet-Boigny.The tribute to his memory in this very Hall  on 9December last  and the moving expressions of sympathyon the day of his funeral  7 February 1994  will remainforever enshrined in the collective memory of the citizensof Côte d’Ivoire.14I am gratified to take this opportunity solemnly toassure the international community of my determination topursue the policy of openness and the search for peacebegun by my illustrious predecessor.The end of the Cold War had given rise to hope forfruitful relationships based on peace and on sharedeconomic and social development. Now there is generalastonishment at the fact that the world  which the UnitedNations is destined to serve  has entered a stage ofuncertainty. No one imagined that the fall of the BerlinWall  whose symbolism marked the beginning of thosegreat changes that we have been witnessing since 1989 would expose such serious defects  which today are makingtheir appearance in the most untenable forms in humanrelations. In fact  we are ashamed at the idea of beingwitness to political  ethnic and religious tensions and armedconflicts that we believed belonged to a bygone age.The painful examples of the former Yugoslavia  ofAngola  Burundi  Liberia  Rwanda and Somalia show us theintensity of the tragedies that we are experiencing.As concerns Liberia  the implementation of theCotonou Agreement of 25 July 1993 is encounteringdifficulties on the ground. Indeed  aside from thedifficulties which occurred in the establishment ofinstitutions and the formation of the transitionalGovernment  this Agreement has come up against thesensitive issue of the disarmament of the factions. Thatdisarmament was the precondition for the electionsoriginally planned for 7 September 1994.Unfortunately  out of a force assessed at approximately60 000 troops  only 3 000 soldiers of the United LiberationMovement for Democracy (ULIMO) and the NationalPatriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) have laid down their armssince the first days of the disarmament operations. Sincethen  the proliferation of factions and mutual distrust havefrozen the positions. We hope that the agreement justconcluded in Ghana on 12 September 1994 will experiencea better fate  leading to general elections and to the exerciseof democracy in Liberia.It is well known that Côte d’Ivoire has made greatefforts for years now to find a peaceful solution to thisconflict  which has repercussions of all kinds in thesubregion  especially in my country.As to the tragedy in Rwanda  despite the burden of theLiberian conflict on our economy  we are ready toparticipate  as long as we receive the necessary logisticalsupport  in the efforts of the international community torestore peace in that ravaged country. Here we shouldlike to hail the courageous initiative undertaken by Franceto render humanitarian assistance to all those who havefallen victim to this tragedy.Other actions  particularly those undertaken by ourOrganization and other Member States within theframework of the United Nations Assistance Mission forRwanda (UNAMIR) also deserve our encouragement.Concerning all hotbeds of tension  be they on theAfrican continent or elsewhere in the world  we launchthe same appeal for peace  tolerance and understanding.As my illustrious predecessor  the late Félix Houphouet-Boigny  used to say  a hungry man is not a free man.These social and political difficulties that have arisen ina number of States are caused for the most part bymisery  extreme poverty  hunger  fear  injustice  exclusion ignorance and intolerance. That is why  now that theCold War is over and the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization is fast approaching  Côte d’Ivoire wouldpropose to this Assembly that 1995 be proclaimed theInternational Year of Universal Solidarity.Every man and woman should not only eschewtribal  religious  political and ideological hatreds  butshould also contribute individually and collectively to thecampaign against hunger  disease  ignorance and in favourof the implementation of the ideal of shared welfare.While the world continues to rend itself apart several particularly positive events are genuine sources ofsatisfaction and give grounds for hope.In this regard  it gives me great joy to extend  onbehalf of Cote d’Ivoire  a warm and fraternal welcome tothe South African delegation. As I did in Tunis duringthe thirtieth Summit of the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  I should like to take this opportunity to reiterateto President Nelson Mandela our sincere congratulationson his outstanding and historic election to the presidencyof a democratic and multi-racial South Africa.Another reason for satisfaction is the Middle East with the signing in Washington on 13 September 1993 ofthe Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement between Israel andthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  whoseimplementation began with the arrival in Palestine ofPresident Yasir Arafat and the formation of the firstPalestinian Government.15May I here hail the Israeli and Palestinian builders ofthis process  as well as all those who encouraged this event which was welcomed unanimously. We also extend ourbest wishes for the success of this great and nobleenterprise and we hope that this highly sensitive region ofthe Middle East will enjoy a just and lasting peace.Now more than ever  the world needs peace to releasethe energies mankind needs to flourish. That is whydemocracy  perceived as one of the ways to guaranteefreedom  promote private initiative and the participation ofall citizens in development  is something I particularlycherish.In this regard  my Government and I have decided  asa priority in Côte d’Ivoire  to promote genuine politicalpluralism and the strengthening of democratic institutions while guaranteeing their proper functioning  for in our timesdemocracy is irreversible and is an imperative for all ofhuman society - and our prestigious universal Organizationitself is no exception.Hence  discussions begun several years ago on therestructuring of some of its bodies  in particular theSecurity Council  seem to us timely in providing broaderrepresentation for Member States without  however damaging its effectiveness.Moreover  in October 1995  the internationalcommunity will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary ofour Organization. This will provide an opportunity toproceed to a review - in our judgement  positive - of thisinstitution to which mankind owes so much. It will also bethe time to recall that the founding fathers had risen upagainst the injustice of unequal development. They foresawits tragic consequences which  unfortunately  we note today.Efforts to establish greater justice in internationaleconomic relations have not yielded the expected results and there is now an exponential increase in the gap betweenthe developed and the developing countries. While theformer continue to enjoy continually rising standards ofliving and welfare  the latter  on the contrary  are nowexperiencing a more serious deterioration of theireconomies - if not generalized impoverishment. Thegrowth rates noted in some of these countries cannotconceal or substantively reverse this deplorable trend.The frontiers of poverty in Africa  as elsewhere  canbe made to recede only if the international community and in particular  the United Nations rethinks the machinery forinternational cooperation and firmly commits itself topromoting development in these countries.The economic and financial crisis Africa continuesto experience since the beginning of the 1980s has led toa setback in growth in nearly all of the countries of thecontinent. Nearly all these countries’ economicparameters and indicators are today negative despite allthe bold recovery and economic restructuring measuresthat have been undertaken.That is why we call for ever closer solidaritybetween North and South  by which I mean a realpartnership taking into account their genuine interests inan international economy of sharing.Did not the international community very early ongrasp this need for complementarity and solidarity byadvocating as long ago as 1974 a new  more just andequitable international economic order?Faced with geopolitical upheavals and newformations of economic blocs  and given the severe trialswhich have struck them specifically  the African Statesdemonstrated their joint will to integration by signing theTreaty creating the African Economic Community on 3June 1991 in Abuja. The Treaty entered into force on 3June 1994  and this demonstrates our determination tocope with these problems.However  all our efforts will be in vain without afavourable international economic environment andsubstantial support by the international community.For its part  Côte d’Ivoire  sorely tried by theeconomic crisis of the past few years  has  since 1981 engaged in several successive programmes of structuraladjustment. These sacrifices  which followed 20 years ofsustained economic growth  clearly highlighted the needto make further use of the abilities of our nation in thecreation and implementation of a development policy.The economic reforms undertaken under the aegis ofinternational institutions have called for significant effortsby the rural sector on which our development was based without granting it social investments on a proportionatebasis.The change in parity of the CFA franc  which tookplace at the beginning of this year for 14 Africancountries  is aimed at guiding the national economytoward exports in order to achieve an economic take-off.16This return to growth cannot be accomplished without theappropriate integration of the concerns of the various socialgroups.Côte d’Ivoire is considered one of the Africancountries that have made the most significant humaninvestment during the first years of independence. On theaverage  almost 7 per cent of its gross national product hasbeen devoted to education. In our subregion  it remains thecountry with the greatest number of personnel with highereducation in all areas of economic activity. It is thereforeincumbent upon us to proceed to an appropriate use of ourhuman resources as the sine qua non for new growth anddevelopment.That is why it is important that increased efforts bemade and that the appropriate means be provided tostrengthen the campaign against the terrible scourgesafflicting various regions of Africa that are dangerouslyjeopardizing the future of our societies. Malaria  thetraditional affliction of our continent  and AIDS  whichappeared a decade ago and whose brutal force is wellknown  are today the most significant of the epidemicscrippling Africa  which nevertheless aspires to developmentand makes no secret of its determination to succeed.If we look at the past three decades  we see an Africancontinent that has gone from a period of growth to onecharacterized by a constant decline in productivity  ageneral exacerbation of the problem of poverty and theweakening of social parameters - in short  a progressivedeterioration of the economic situation.The international community  it must be said  has notabandoned Africa. On the bilateral level and in multilateralbodies  policies have been devised to cope with the specificsituations experienced by the countries of our continent.These efforts are commendable  for they are a concretedemonstration of an all-important human solidarity.But the world is changing  and Africa knows that itmust  through its own abilities  win its own place in worldtrade and play an outstanding role commensurate with itsimmense potential. It is aware today more than ever of itsassets as well as of the challenge posed by its nearlymarginal position in relation to other regions of the world.It will know how to take advantage of the manyopportunities open to it by relying first and foremost on thewill of its peoples  their intelligence and creativity  andtheir capacity for reflection and initiative  in order toparticipate in the drafting and implementation of long-termdevelopment policies. It will also rely on the rest of theinternational community  its indispensable partner  tocreate new forms of active  mutually beneficial solidarityimplemented in full respect for the dignity of allparticipants.Of course  problems remain. Some  linked to therecent past  such as the problem of debt  seem to beobstacles to the development of new initiatives. Theinternational community and friendly countries mustunderstand that indebtedness  which is designedspecifically to ensure a country’s development  should notbe turned against it and transformed into a deliberaterestraint on its growth. Solutions to this problem havealready been put forward; all have the potential topromote a return to growth and renewed forms ofcooperation.But Africa must turn its attention to new challenges.It must  for example  consider how to preserve andprotect its environment in order to ensure present andfuture generations an adequate and healthy framework inwhich all forms of life can develop in harmony. It musttake advantage of the great potential of recent agreementson the organization of world trade in order firmly tointegrate itself into the flow of global exchanges. As thecontinent most blessed with reserves of raw materials  itmust master the technology to adapt them to its needs.That will be the basis for its true resurgence. It has longbeen aware of all these imperative needs. Throughsuccessive steps  particularly by regrouping on thesubregional and continental levels  it has begun to acquirethe means necessary to its reawakening.Africa will succeed. It will succeed in warding offthe dark fate that seems to loom over it. It will succeedin ridding itself of underdevelopment in order to be apositive participant in the immense task of building aprosperous future for all humanity."
"34",1394,"CMR",49,1994,"Over and above the usual civilities  Sir  the very sincereand warm congratulations of the Cameroon delegation onyour election to preside over the current session of theGeneral Assembly are addressed to you both as an ablediplomat and as a worthy representative of Côte d’Ivoire a country that is a friend of ours and with which we arehonoured to have longstanding relations of fraternalcooperation. On behalf of the delegation of Cameroon  Iwish you every success in the exercise of your importantfunctions.Ambassador Insanally of Guyana  your predecessor successfully reflected and expressed our concerns whenpresiding over the forty-eighth session. We should like toexpress our deep appreciation to him.Since his election our Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  has placed all his courage  energy anddetermination at the service of our Organization to promotepeace  justice and progress in an increasingly difficultclimate. Cameroon would once again like to assure him ofits firm and constant support.Despite the uncertainties  upheavals and crises we areexperiencing in the evolving international environment several major events since the last session give grounds forsatisfaction and hope.The emergence of a united  democratic and non-racialSouth Africa  under the leadership of President NelsonMandela  has sounded the death knell of the apartheid era now a thing of the past  while marking the advent of a newera on our continent. South Africa can now get down to itseconomic and social development with increased vigour.Cameroon  which was at the forefront of the struggleagainst the scourge of apartheid  once again solemnlywelcomes South Africa’s return into the concert of nations.The credit for this happy return goes to the UnitedNations  the Organization of African Unity and the forcesof progress in the world for their combined efforts  butmainly to the South African people and leadersthemselves  in particular Nelson Mandela and Frederik deKlerk  who have always distinguished themselves by thebreadth of their vision  their courage and theirdetermination.Echoing the new era beginning in Pretoria  animportant stage has just been reached in the long processleading to the normalization of relations between Israeland the Palestinians on the one hand  and between Israeland its other Arab neighbours on the other hand.The advent of Palestinian autonomy in the GazaStrip and Jericho  pursuant to the agreements concluded and the significant progress in the negotiations betweenthe Jewish State and Jordan are significant advancestowards a just and lasting settlement of the question ofthe Middle East  in accordance with the relevantresolutions of the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly. We must encourage this promising  but stillfragile  development and give it all the necessary attentionand determination.The judicial settlement of the conflict between Chadand Libya over the Aouzu Strip  which has finally comeinto being following lengthy negotiations  deserves to bewelcomed with satisfaction  particularly since itconstitutes a model for others to follow.By bringing the question of the border and territorialdispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over Bakassi tothe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and itsmachinery for the prevention  management and settlementof conflicts  to the Security Council  which is responsiblefor the maintenance of international peace and security and to the International Court of Justice  which is chargedwith the peaceful and judicial settlement of conflicts  itwas the intention of Cameroon to subscribe fully to thevirtues of preventive diplomacy.It is an established fact that  like non-aggressionpacts and mutual assistance pacts  preventive diplomacyis an interesting innovation and one that may well preventnew conflicts and suffering  and even reverse thetendency towards confrontation and war which is socharacteristic of our continent.For this reason  preventive diplomacy should beencouraged and supported by the international community.13For its part  my country would like to thank all those whohave supported it in regard to the Bakassi affair. Themeans of action and the machinery of diplomacy at thedisposal of the OAU and the United Nations should befurther strengthened.The positive developments in South Africa and theMiddle East coincide  unfortunately  with the persistence orthe eruption of hotbeds of tension throughout the world. InBosnia and Herzegovina  in Cyprus  in Afghanistan  as wellas in Cambodia  peace is still threatened. It is threatenedeven further on our continent  a fact to which the tragedyof Rwanda bears witness.This is an opportunity to renew an urgent appeal toour brothers in Liberia  Somalia  Rwanda  Burundi  Angolaand Mozambique  as well as in other countries beset bytension  conflict and warfare  to rise above their variousdifferences so that they may be able to make the necessaryefforts to meet the challenge of peace.The persistence of these conflicts and hotbeds oftension  so harmful in their consequences  compels us toinitiate and resolutely and vigorously pursue any actionconducive to peace  security and the building of confidence which are so necessary in the struggle against poverty anddestitution.Within States we should  for instance  promotetolerance  respect for the rights of others  participation byall in the affairs of the country  and fair distribution of thefruits of growth.In relations between States  the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of States must berespected  while at the same time this should not be anobstacle to mutual cooperation in the event of naturaldisasters and calamities that require humanitarianintervention.The creation by the African Heads of State of theOAU machinery to which I have referred  and the initiallingby the States of central Africa of a non-aggression pact inSeptember 1994  are among the efforts we have beenmaking to promote good-neighbourly relations based onconfidence and free from any threat of the use of force.Although at the outset this machinery has alreadyachieved some excellent results  nevertheless  like theStanding Consultative Committee on Questions of Securityin Central Africa that was created by the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations in the context of preventivediplomacy  it needs the support of the internationalcommunity.In the final analysis  these regional initiatives topromote confidence-building measures and progressivedisarmament should  on the global level  be encouragedin order to achieve the objectives of the internationalcommunity with respect to disarmament  peace andsecurity.Thus  we welcome the respect being shown for themoratorium on nuclear testing  as well as the progressachieved in negotiations between the United States andthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea over theNorth Korean nuclear programme. We encourage bothcountries to find a peaceful solution to that dispute.Regarding the current negotiations at the Conferenceon Disarmament to conclude a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  Cameroon joins the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in expressing the hope that thisconvention will be signed before the AmendmentConference in 1995.Finally  whether we speak of nuclear weapons orother weapons of mass destruction  conventional weapons toxic waste  mine clearance or anti-personnel mines Cameroon also wishes to see the international communityworking towards general and complete disarmament.In his report entitled “Agenda for Development”(A/48/935)  the Secretary-General noted very aptly thatpeace was the foundation of development; that theeconomy was the engine of progress; that the environmentwas the basis of sustainability; that justice was the pillarof society  and that democracy represented goodgovernance.These preliminary reflections deserve great attention since the “Agenda for Development” is a follow-up to the“Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277). It reaffirms furthermore  that economic  social and culturaldevelopment is a fundamental right of the human being.Furthermore  global talks on development  whichwere held in New York in June 1994 on the initiative andunder the presidency of Ambassador Insanally  the high-level debate and the recent session of the Economic andSocial Council on the “Agenda for Development”  theMinisterial Declaration that followed the commemorativeceremonies for the thirtieth anniversary of the Group of77 and the substantive session of Economic and Social14Council indicate that development is a complexphenomenon  requiring constant effort on the part of Statesand of the international community as a whole.It is therefore our hope  that on the basis of thepriorities identified during these meetings  the measuresrequired to deal with these issues will be considered by theGeneral Assembly on the basis of a new report by theSecretary-General.The urgent need to set in motion a new UnitedNations programme for the development of Africa in the1990s should be stressed. The timeliness and relevance ofsuch a step was reaffirmed by the international conferenceon the development of Africa held in Tokyo. The Africaneconomy  as we know  is essentially based on primarycommodities. Any strategy for the sustainable developmentof the continent must consequently take into account theneed for diversification. We would like to reiterate theappeal we made last year from this same rostrum for thecreation of a fund for diversification of commodities forAfrica.In a different context — and this cannot be repeatedtoo often — debt is a major obstacle to development. Thedebt of developing countries has steadily increased  risingfrom $1.662 billion in 1992 to $1.770 billion in 1993. Wewelcome the efforts made so far to relieve or rescheduledebt for developing countries. However  a great deal stillremains to be done  as is emphasized in the 1994 edition ofthe Human Development Report.Drought and desertification are another subject ofmajor concern. We welcome the fact that negotiations weresuccessfully concluded last June in Paris to draw up aninternational convention on drought and desertification  amatter of undoubted importance for the world ecosystemand  more specifically  for the implementation of Agenda21 in Africa.If the conclusion of multilateral economic negotiationsin the context of the Uruguay Round provides furtherprospects for a dynamic revitalization of international trade it is important that steps be taken in parallel to reverse thepronounced trend towards the marginalization and theimpoverishment of Africa  which could be promoted by thenew machinery established at Marrakesh.Human rights are universal and indivisible  and wemust therefore attach equal importance to economic political  cultural and social rights. Whether in terms of therights of women  children  youth  the disabled  the aged orother vulnerable groups  the human being must remain thecentral focus of the international community’s concerns.We should welcome the Plan of Action adopted at therecent International Conference on Population andDevelopment  held at Cairo  for it takes account of thatrequirement. The Plan of Action does not focus onmankind as an abstract entity  but on human beings rootedin their economic  social  cultural and religious diversities all of which need to be kept in mind.That is why the forthcoming Copenhagen WorldSummit on Social Development ought to result in specificcommitments to reduce poverty  to create productive jobsand to strengthen social integration  particularly amongthe most vulnerable strata of society.The same concerns are reflected in the importancewe attach to the Fourth World Conference on Women  tobe held at Beijing in 1995.It is in the interest of us all to pursue collective unified action to struggle against the harmful effects ofdrugs  the spread of the AIDS pandemic  and naturalcatastrophes  if necessary combining emergencyhumanitarian assistance with measures for therehabilitation and reconstruction of the stricken countries.In another area  the entry into force next Novemberof the Montego Bay convention — the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea — next November isa particularly encouraging development setting the seal onthe universality of that important legal instrument. Wehope that it will promote exploitation of the seas andoceans for the benefit of all.As we near the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  our wish is that the Organization will meet thechallenge of reform and renewal. Whether it be therevitalization of the General Assembly and its subsidiaryorgans  the enlargement and strengthening of the SecurityCouncil  the rationalization of activities and procedures orthe consolidation of the Organization’s financial basis Member States should strive to mould an institutionworthy of the vision and the inspiration of its foundingfathers."
"35",1435,"COD",49,1994,"At the dawn of the twenty-first century  ourplanet is seeking a new world balance. Five years havepassed since the struggle for world hegemony came to anend and the arms race became less frenzied. Unfortunately the problems afflicting mankind remain unchanged: death disease  war  famine  poverty  hotbeds of tension  and thetragic wandering of entire populations. The East-Westblocs have been replaced by North-South blocs. Thewealthy North is worried because the poor South is a threatto its serenity and comfort.Far from making the international climate better  theend of the cold war has unleashed instability in the southernhemisphere. Our world is facing a threefold crisis —political and economic crises and a crisis of humansociety — which is sorely testing international solidarityand the interdependence of States. The many hotbeds oftension in Latin America  Europe  Asia and Africa arouseanxiety and concern in our Organization. A number ofideas have been put forward to check these evils on aglobal scale  with greater or lesser degrees of success  butwe feel that the best approach lies in the old saying: “Anounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”.Preventive diplomacy seems to us to be decisive inmaintaining and promoting peace  as recent world historyshows. Indeed  it is clear that many current conflictsmight have been avoided had the international communityinvolved itself in time to prevent them from worsening.For obvious reasons  I should like to dwell on thecrisis in Rwanda.A review of the roots of this tragedy shows that theimplementation of preventive diplomacy could haveprevented it or at least mitigated its effects. If we goback to the earliest manifestations of the ethnic conflictbetween Hutus and Tutsis  we see many opportunities toresolve it which the international community passed up.But let us look at recent history.It is clear that if the parties involved had respectedthe Arusha Agreements  the Rwandese tragedy would nothave taken on its current dimensions. It is equally clearthat the international community could have guaranteedrespect for these Agreements. Moreover  the presence onRwandese soil of foreign and international troops shortlybefore and during the massacres could have preventedthem.The Zairian delegation has recalled the past so thatwe can learn the lessons it teaches for present and futureproblems. What are these problems?Millions of Rwandese left their country and tookrefuge in neighbouring countries. This mass exoduscaused immeasurable damage and created extremelyserious social and economic imbalances in thosecountries. Zaire  for instance  had to absorb nearly 3million people in less than three months. The little cityof Goma  with a normal population of 200 000  on 14June alone took in 10 000 refugees a minute. Themodern world has never seen such an uprooting ofpopulations.The effects of such a situation could only be tragic:the swamping of infrastructures  the re-emergence ofendemic disease  housing shortages  the devastation ofcrops  environmental destruction  disputes among peopleliving in close quarters  insecurity  and countless otherexamples. In addition to all this  the nationality problemis worsening — and it was already a matter of concern inthat part of Zaire.The current situation in countries bordering Rwandameets all the preconditions for preventive intervention bythe international community. Of course  it is alreadyengaged in humanitarian operations on behalf of the15refugees. My delegation takes this opportunity to thank allthe countries and organizations involved in these operations.France in particular deserves a special tribute for havingsaved so many lives in “Operation Turquoise”. But it ishigh time that the international community moved beyondthe humanitarian aspect towards a solution of thefundamental causes of the Rwandese tragedy and its effectson neighbouring countries.These causes relate to the displacement and presenceof refugees in countries that are in no way equipped to takein such human masses. Thus the solution lies in the returnof refugees to their country of origin. Yet we note thatnone of the countries directly concerned by thisphenomenon can cope on its own with the situation withoutassistance from the international community.Let us take the case of my country and of Rwanda.The tragedy of Rwanda  which occurred shortly before theinstallation of our current Government in Zaire  couldbenefit only from stop-gap measures on the part of ourGovernment  given the already disturbing situation of theeconomy in Zaire — and the problems remain unsolved.From this rostrum  Zaire issues a fervent appeal to theinternational community for support equal to the difficultiesexperienced by our population.We know that the return of refugees to their countriesis being thwarted by various factors: their administrativeand political organizations were reconstituted in the camps;the militia  who are difficult to identify  and the formercivilian and military authorities  are intimidating therefugees; the commitment by the new masters of Kigali topersuade their compatriots to embark on a voluntary  securereturn seems inadequate  to say the least; in an effort torespect the spirit of the relevant Organization of AfricanUnity convention on refugees  the Government of Zaire with no means  is confronted with enormous difficulties intrying to remove the former soldiers from the borders.All of these factors should lead the internationalcommunity to realize the gravity of the situation —particularly as the evolution of the Hutu-Tutsi conflict risksswinging back and forth: today we are witnessing a massreturn to Rwanda of Tutsi refugees who were driven intoexile 30 years ago; if the international community is notcareful  however  tomorrow we will witness another tragedyin Rwanda  this time tied in with the return of the Huturefugees.It is thus urgent that the world help these two ethnicgroups to learn how to live together again in harmony.We believe that solutions to the tragedy in Rwandashould include the four following elements: powersharing between the parties involved; the establishment ofa multi-ethnic army; the establishment of guarantees forthe safe return of refugees; and assistance by theinternational community to the countries of asylum and oforigin.Having sketched out the very dark and disturbingpicture of the situation that prevails in the Great Lakesregion  I would now like to turn to the situation in myown country  Zaire.Situated in the heart of Africa  Zaire is a country indeep crisis. Since the beginning of this decade  Zaire hasbeen experiencing a serious institutional crisis  punctuatedby individual events which have contributed to destroyingall the basic balances of our economy.Our country just barely averted a crisis which couldhave been comparable to the one in Rwanda. As weknow  the democratization process initiated in Zaire on 24April 1990 was one of the most tumultuous of the entireAfrican continent. A national conference which lastedalmost two years was unable to reconcile the politicalactors. National unity was harmed by the reappearanceof centrifugal and sectarian movements. Ethnic tensionserupted here and there throughout the country. In short we might well have experienced the same phenomena ofmassacres and mass displacements of populations wedeplore in Rwanda.Zaire succeeded in averting this great tragedy owingin large part to the timely assistance provided by theinternational community.We do not wish to minimize either the wisdom andthe work done by the internal forces in Zaire  or theongoing support from what we call the troika: the groupof countries consisting of Belgium  France and the UnitedStates of America.We should also like to recognize that it was underthe good offices of the Secretary-General of ourOrganization that meetings were held that broughttogether all of the political trends in Zaire.The results of these meetings were of major politicalimportance because they put an end to the duplication of16constitutional texts as well as of institutions of transitiontowards a new democratic republic.On 11 July 1994 the transitional parliament establisheda Government which represents the majority of the peopleof Zaire. This Government intends to conduct the nation’spolitics exclusively through parliamentary control.In Zaire as elsewhere  democratization is a lengthyprocess which requires considerable material and financialresources. I am thinking not of the resources needed atparticular moments — for example to organize and holdfree and transparent elections. I am referring to thesubstantial resources needed to stabilize the economic andsocial environment  which will provide the framework fordemocratization. This stability has long been ignored  buttoday is increasingly being recognized as the prerequisitefor progress towards democracy.If this is truly the case  then many countries in Africaand throughout the world have small hope of completingtheir democratization  or at least of completing it within areasonable time-frame. For in these countries  politics aregrossly distorted by ills such as poverty  malnutrition ignorance  violence and so forth.When a country relies only on its national efforts toresolve all of those ills  it very quickly gets locked into avicious circle which only exacerbates its problems.The second crisis facing mankind is economic innature. This crisis dates back to the 1970s and derivesfrom fundamental inadequacies in the economic systemestablished at the end of the Second World War. Thegranting of independence to countries that were colonies atthe time completely changed the international situation.This crisis derives from structural lacunae and fromthe imbalance in interdependent areas such as those ofcommodities  trade  energy  currency and finance.For this reason  we would propose that the concept ofpreventive diplomacy be transposed into the economic area.This would imply action being taken on the part of theinternational community to deal with the imbalance in anational economy before that imbalance leads to awidespread social crisis.Socio-economic conditions have worsenedconsiderably in Zaire since the beginning ofdemocratization. In the last five years  the basic balancesof the Zaire economy have been completely destroyed. Asa result  there is a particularly acute economic andfinancial crisis.This economic crisis has been accompanied by aprofound moral crisis  which has led to plundering andsystematic destruction of the economic fabric.It goes without saying that such an economicsituation can hardly lead us to the blossoming ofdemocracy  due to its negative impact on the livingconditions of citizens.It is equally obvious that Zaire cannot emerge all onits own from this situation. The current Government hasof course included in its programme specific short-termmeasures to slow down somewhat the continuingdeterioration of social conditions. But these measures andthe Government’s recovery plan as a whole can beeffective only if they are supported by strengthenedcooperation between Zaire and its bilateral andmultilateral partners.However  as is known  this cooperation has beensuspended  and most of Zaire’s partners are making theresumption of such cooperation conditional on tangibleprogress being made towards democracy and progress ineconomic management. Thus  we find ourselves facedwith a complex conditionality. The assistance my countryneeds to move towards democracy and good managementis made conditional on the prior achievement ofdemocracy and good management.My country is not an isolated case. This kind ofconditionality is increasingly a determining factor incooperation between developing countries  particularly inAfrica  and their multilateral and bilateral partners. Inother words  many countries today are confronted by avicious circle that obstructs their access to the resourcesof the international community.Our Organization must find some means of breakingthis circle because the survival of vast numbers of theworld’s citizens — if not that of the human race as awhole — is at stake. It is important to note that thesearch for these means must lead us off the beaten trackso we can find new and imaginative paths. In our searchwe must create new solutions  such as those that made itpossible to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.The third ill afflicting the world today is the crisis ofsociety. Human society is falling prey to the re-emergence and supremacy of force and violence over the17rule of law in relations between States  in contempt of allthe rules of good conduct. Two thirds of the human racesuffers from hunger  endemic disease  malnutrition undernourishment  unemployment  lack of information acculturation — in short  total underdevelopment. Thepolitical and economic crisis also has a negative effect onsociety.The Government of which I am the head is aGovernment of transition between an old order and a new emerging republic in which we will recognize everycitizen’s right to freedom of thought  expression association and movement  a new republic where justice isindependent  where the police and the army must serve toprotect the citizen  a new republic where the press is free.My Government intends to make respect for humanrights in Zaire one of its fundamental priorities of action.From this rostrum I make an appeal to the specializedagencies of our Organization to share their enrichingexperience with us and to help us effectively in realizingour aims.The establishment of institutions for our new resolutely democratic republic will involve the organizationin the near future of free  transparent and honest elections.My Government hopes to see the United Nationscommunity join Zaire in this last stage of our long journeytowards our goal — a State of law — by assisting in thepreparation  organization and monitoring of these electionsat all levels.Before concluding  I would just like to express to you Mr. President  the great satisfaction my delegation feels atseeing you presiding over the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. We are all aware that your election isa tribute to your country  Côte d’Ivoire. But it alsorepresents the international community’s recognition of yourqualities as a statesman and knowledgeable diplomat. Yourcompetence and experience are without any doubt aguarantee of the success in our work. We also wish tocongratulate all the members of the General Committee.I would be remiss if I did not say how greatly mydelegation appreciates the way in which your illustriouspredecessor presided over the forty-eighth session.We extend our best wishes and our support to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hiscommitment and his tireless efforts to promote peace andrespect for human rights.I wish to take this opportunity to pay a warm tributeto the people of South Africa for their political maturity which  along with the assistance of the internationalcommunity  made it possible to do away with apartheidand to bring democracy to that country. It is with greatjoy and genuine pleasure that  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Zaire  I congratulate thenew  democratic  multiracial Republic of South Africa onits return to the United Nations.Finally  I should like to congratulate the politicalleaders of the State of Israel and of the PalestineLiberation Organization  as well as all those who servedas mediators  for their contribution to a comprehensiveand definitive settlement to the conflict in the Middle Eastand the question of Palestine.To sum up  I would simply say that I came herewith three messages. The first one is that of theinterdependence of nations in mutually beneficialcooperation and with no exclusions. My second messageis that  in its action  my Government attaches the highestpriority to the swift establishment of a new Zaire  a Stateof law where fundamental freedoms and the rights ofcitizens will be the major concern of those in power. Mythird message is a call for the effective implementation ofthe concept of preventive diplomacy to promote peaceand eradicate poverty in the world."
"36",1482,"COG",49,1994,"At this forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations  the African continent hasevery right to feel honoured in this great body. Throughthe brilliant election of its President  our Assembly has paida tribute to the merits and the qualities of a great Africandiplomat. I would add that above and beyond therecognition so richly deserved by his country  Côted’Ivoire  for its contribution to peace  we also find in hiselection a posthumous tribute to its founder  PresidentHouphouët Boigny  that unforgettable monument ofmodern-day Africa. I would like to extend to our Presidentthe warmest congratulations of the Congolese delegationand to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Samuel Insanally  Ambassador of Guyana  who served asPresident at the forty-eighth session with such greatcompetence and skill.My congratulations go also to our Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who since becoming the leaderof our Organization has endeavoured with such dedicationto bring our Member States closer to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter. On behalf of the Congolesepeople  I would like to reiterate to this humble servant ofmankind our most earnest encouragement as he dischargeshis lofty responsibilities.Many peace-keeping and goodwill missions of theUnited Nations are currently to be found on African soil.We welcome this necessary assistance  while we hope thatthe peoples concerned will do even better in fosteringconditions for a return to peace.Finally  how can one not feel overcome with joy at thetriumphant welcome given the return of the Republic ofSouth Africa to the commonwealth of free nations? Thisreturn  which puts the finishing touches on the liberation ofthe African continent from colonialism and racism  is surelya source of legitimate satisfaction for the Members of theUnited Nations who devoted so much energy and so manyresources in the battle of the South African people againstapartheid. To the delegation of that country that embodiesthe hopes of an entire continent  I would like to extend awarm  fraternal welcome.At the beginning of this forty-ninth session theAssembly faces a complicated situation that combines realreasons for satisfaction with extremely worrisome issues.A marked trend towards dialogue and cooperation insearch of solutions to the problems that confront ourworld encourages our desire for a new system ofinternational relations that would be more humane andmore just. The United Nations has to its credit manyachievements in the restoration and creation of peace.Conflicts that have been solved or are in the process ofbeing solved give  little by little  faith and confidence inthe future  indeed I would say to life  to those peopleswho have been subjugated by despair  if not by thedisturbing resurgence of civil wars  ethnic tensions andreligious crusades.The abolition of apartheid in South Africa  whichseemed impossible yesterday  is a reality today  as if togrant the wishes of the international community and toreward the strictures of the United Nations  a peacefultransition has given birth to a united  democratic and non-racist South Africa.A peaceful settlement to the question of the Aouzoustrip has rid Central Africa of a fratricidal conflict. Ihope the example of Libya and Chad will inspire otherStates as well.Firmly and resolutely  the dynamic of peace begunin the Middle East is growing stronger and is openingprospects for cooperation to peoples long ruined by warand yet fated by geography and history to live together.This is why  in hailing the significant progress achievedin this process  the Republic of the Congo hopes that wewill see rapid progress in the Arab-Israeli negotiationswith a view to the establishment of a thorough  just andlasting peace in the Middle East.But the hope offered by the progress that has beenachieved remains frustrated by the persistence of localwars that continue their bloodshed in various parts of theworld. Political differences and ethnic  racial or religiousdiversity  far from enriching society  have elicitedintolerance  hatred  violence and  worst of all  thedestruction of what is most precious to us all: humanlife. From Bosnia to Angola  the similarities are striking.Of these crises that conceal several basic questions  wesee that a record number are in Africa: Angola  Somalia Liberia  Rwanda ...The Republic of the Congo remains greatlyconcerned about the situation in its sister republic andneighbour Angola. We deplore the continuation of thisfratricidal  murderous war  sustained by the intransigenceand rigidity of UNITA. The Congolese Government41supports all peace efforts undertaken by the internationalcommunity in the attempt to settle the conflict peacefully especially as part of the Lusaka negotiations: negotiationsin which Angola has made very constructive proposals thatshow the determination of President Dos Santos and hisGovernment to find a solution that might take into accountall the political sensibilities of that country. My countrywould like to reiterate its wish to see Angolans finallyreach understanding and reconciliation  so that they candevote their energies to the rebuilding of their country  tornapart by a war that has lasted far too long.With regard to Liberia  we hope that the recent signingin Ghana of the cease-fire agreement by the variousprotagonists will lead to better prospects for that country.The genocide we have seen in Rwanda  another sadchapter in the history of mankind  is only the most extremeand inhuman manifestation of the problems facing Africatoday. Violence  poverty  famine  disease  refugees spiralling population growth - such is the widespread imageof contemporary Africa. This well-known  gloomy pictureno doubt stems from a habitual pessimism rather than froma thorough study of reality.The increase in the inequality between the richest andthe poorest countries has grown more complex with theemergence of worldwide markets  trade  communications -even  unfortunately  pollution. Africa  long relegated to thebackground  seems to have combined all the socialpathologies that inexorably strike ever-growing and ever-poorer populations. In our underdeveloped countries chronic indebtedness and the drop in the prices of our basiccommodities  compounded by the pernicious reduction inpublic aid for development and investments that continue toignore our legislation  however attractive and liberal it maybe  are worsening the disappearance of sources of financingand development.Here growth is slow to appear  whereas early signsalready herald the beginnings of expansion in the worldeconomy. The unemployed population is increasing  andworkers are under a constant uncertainty. As if to completethis picture  natural disasters - drought and desertification -compete with epidemics such as AIDS and malaria.Infections we thought to have eradicated are reappearing.In this context of a disastrous economy  a populationexplosion has eliminated any hope of redressing theimbalance between an almost zero economic growth rateand a population growth rate that is out of control. Thissituation has destroyed all our efforts at recovery.Congo  for its part  has not escaped this commondestiny. The socio-political crisis which has shaken mycountry to its very foundations and brought great grief tomany Congolese families has to a large extent torn thesocial fabric and has completely ruined our economy.This crisis has at least had the merit of destroying manyillusions.We had thought - or pretended to think - that it wasenough simply to copy the old Western democracies andhold free elections under international supervision toensure that democracy prospered  that it was unnecessaryto take local realities into account.Surely the European Parliament learned a bitterlesson from its failure  because it said to the newdemocracies that peoples and Governments should findformulas which would enable them to create democratic lawful institutions based on their own history and culturalidentity.How can we claim that in two years’ time we havedone away with the ills of 30 years of badly assimilatedMarxist-Leninist culture  a culture which wasfundamentally hostile to pluralistic democracy andfundamentally opposed to individual growth. And whatshould we say of the harmful effects of so many years ofMarxist management of an economy that is today doomedbecause of that failure?Congo’s economy today is suffering from thedisastrous consequences of ill-advised economic policies which has given my country the honour of being placedamong the most indebted countries in the world. Inaddition to this economic bankruptcy we find the waste the ruin of our cultural and moral values  and abreakdown of the innate genius of our people.Insidious and pernicious  destitution and povertyhave crept into the private lives of men and women every day becoming more numerous  men and womenwho to survive must hide behind the ultimate bulwark ofethnicity  which has become a factor for segregation anddivision.Made idle and vulnerable  and subjected to chronicunemployment  our youth are now indulging in theillusion of drugs and the armed defence of dubiouscauses.42Thus  we see the scope of the consequences of somany harmful factors in a society where people have lostall sense of perspective. Violence then becomes the outletfor venting all sorts of political  economic and socialfrustrations.The outbreaks of violence in the Congo are the mostabsurd manifestation of this. We must rely on ourtraditional values to revive our dedication to dialogue andpeace and hence realize how vain such extreme behaviouris - indeed  nothing more than human folly.We have given new life to the democratic process; wehave started all over again. This is a process redirectedtowards democratic transition  the first stage of power-sharing; it is the result of a policy of administrativedecentralization  one of the foundations of the developmentprogramme of President Pascal Lissouba. Today leaders ofthe opposition are mayors of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire -the main cities in the country - and are thereby makingtheir contribution to the national recovery.Congo’s experience highlights the challenges facingthe new democracies  in particular young Africandemocracies  which in order to build one nation mustemerge from the condition of multi-ethnic States and one-party or feudal systems and pass on to full democracy withits corollary  a market economy.In order to meet these challenges  Congo has opted fora programme of economic and social recovery that isalready under way. The programme involves therelaunching of our country’s development.Our bitter experience has led us to conclude that wemust give pride of place to the economy in order tosafeguard the young and fragile Congolese democracy andgive it a solid basis  especially taking into account thecrucial needs of our peoples  our own values andgeopolitical realities.To fulfil this objective  the programme involves in itsinitial phase a structural adjustment programme concludedwith the Bretton Woods institutions  a programme we aredetermined to carry out successfully in spite of theenormous sacrifices this will entail for our people. Thismust be done because we are determined to stimulatedevelopment and to revive hope among our people. We arebanking on relaunching progress  but Congo cannot succeedalone. Africa is our salvation.Indeed  it is in the integration and complementarityof our economies that we should try to find solutions sothat we can emerge from the grave economic and socialcrisis that has engulfed our countries  and especiallyrelaunch our growth and development. Let us hope thatthe African States will be able to create the conditions forthis complementarity  especially through the use ofscience and technology.This initiative gives a good idea of the crucialimportance of the establishment of the African EconomicCommunity. But in order to succeed this endeavourrequires human as well as financial resources. In thisconnection  the international community is called upon togive resolute help to our countries in their efforts to findcompetent men and women who can promotedevelopment by their know-how  in the appropriateinstitutions.Development and the effective use of humanresources are a decisive factor for the socio-economicdevelopment of our African continent. That is why guided by this requirement of development  the CongoleseGovernment has established the Panafrican Institute ofManagement and Innovation to train people in themanagement of resources  including human resources.For the initiator of this project  His ExcellencyPresident Pascal Lissouba  development cannot be definedsolely in terms of growth; it must also be defined in termsof the ability to master the art of management.The second requirement of this endeavour is to fundit. In this connection  we are not relying only onfinancial resources - that is  a massive influx of capitalinto our poor economies. The economies would still haveto be able to digest such capital.Above and beyond the generation of financial flowsto our countries  what Africa needs above all is theestablishment of a financial instrument  whose machinerywould be brought into harmony with the other  existinginstruments of international cooperation. This financialinstrument  with the support of all the African countries would obtain appropriate support from the internationalcommunity  especially the Bretton Woods institutions.Thus  the African Development Bank is in our viewthe best institution to deal with the financial aspect and furthermore  to study a system for funding science andtechnology for development. Today more than ever43before  science and technology are part and parcel ofdevelopment; they are requirements of development.The favourable developments in the world politicalsituation have given rise to the hope that a new era ofpeace will give the United Nations the role that its foundersintended it to play.Everything - or almost everything - would seem toaugur well for a new world order: an outpouring offreedom and democracy; a revival of the universalawareness of human rights; and the pre-eminence of theUnited Nations in resolving issues linked to internationalpeace  development and security.Unfortunately  the psychosis of nuclear apocalypsecharacteristic of the cold war has given way to a violent deadly expression of freedom and of local wars in a largenumber of developing countries  especially in Africa. Wehave already stated that economic frustration is at the rootof these events. Therefore  peace and security in our Statesand throughout the world require a solution to our people’seconomic and social problems as well as the transformationof the world economic system with a view to establishinga more just order. It is only then that we can have a trueidea of the Agenda for Development and of its capability ofmeeting the expectations and concerns of the developingcountries.The vagaries of the Rwandan tragedy  especially at thetime when the critical decision was taken by the SecurityCouncil to withdraw the United Nations Assistance Missionfor Rwanda (UNAMIR)  should awaken the conscience ofpeople everywhere and make them pause and reflect. Thejoint efforts of the United Nations and of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) were crystal-clear. The continent-wide organization  through its conflict-prevention -management and -resolution machinery  had committeditself to continuing these efforts.My country welcomes the return of United Nationspeace-keeping forces to Rwanda after a departure that hadleft us with the bitter feeling that the decision wasinappropriate.Congo  in spite of its internal difficulties  from thevery outset had felt concerned over the Rwandan tragedy.In a manifestation of fraternal solidarity  my country hastaken part in all the humanitarian and peace-keepingoperations in Rwanda  ranging from the OAU observermission  UNAMIR I and operation ""Turquoise"" to today’sUNAMIR II.In drawing conclusions from these tragic events  the11 States of Central Africa  brought together in theUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa  have decided to create fromamong their respective armed forces a single peace-keeping unit. This unit  once set up  will take part inOAU and United Nations peace-keeping operations.Today more than ever  in that part of Africa so sorelytried by instability and civil war  this advisory committeewould appear to be a valuable instrument for preventingcrises and conflicts and seems deserving of the attentionand support of the international community. The recentsigning of a non-aggression pact among the States of thesubregion is a most concrete example of this.This framework body for joint efforts for subregionalpeace and security  which my country will host in Marchand August 1995  will help  we are convinced  to preventcrises and conflicts and thereby lay the foundations forgenuine peace and cooperation in Central Africa.In an international context where we still see certainconflicts  we must acknowledge once again the pre-eminent role of the Security Council  which safeguardsinternational peace and security. The spectacular increasein the membership of the United Nations as well as theemergence of new political and economic forces theworld over require an expansion of this body on the basisof equitable geographic representation. In so doing  wewould only be abiding by the criterion of universality which has always guided our Organization and whichmust be constantly adapted to newly emerging realities.Our destinies are bound to become increasinglyintertwined  our horizons to broaden  and all this in aspirit of diversity  complementarity and solidarity withoutany will to power or domination. Increased developmentsin science and technology will result in a globalization ofthe challenges we must face.44May we be able to make the best possible use of thevast potential open to us  so that our long-suffering peopleswill finally see the dawning of the era of peace andprosperity they so legitimately desire."
"37",1529,"COL",49,1994,"It is a great honour for me  as President ofColombia  to speak in the General Assembly  which  as theOrganization reaches the fiftieth anniversary of itsestablishment  remains the principal forum for thediscussion of topics of concern to mankind and for thesearch for peaceful solutions to its distressing problems.Fifty years ago  when the United Nations system wascreated  the world hoped that the spectre of war was finallybeing laid to rest. But lack of understanding betweennations  ideological fanaticism and the politics of force ledto the world’s polarization into two antagonistic blocs. Formany years  the cold war put on ice the hopes held at thebeginning for developing a world-wide system ofcoexistence. Such coexistence reappears today when wesee a black person at the helm of South Africa; when wesee Palestinians and Jews discussing fruit groves in the hillsof the Golan; and when we see all Berliners drinking goodColombian coffee on the spot where the wall of infamyonce stood.Before the end of this century  we shall have to striveto resolve peacefully the most important conflict to outlivethe cold war: the conflict with the brotherly Republic ofCuba.We now have the happy opportunity of reviving thespirit of the San Francisco Charter and of reinitiating thedeferred task of building a new world system based onsolidarity  respect for the self-determination of peoplesand the real search for better living conditions for all - aswas stated a few years ago before the General Assembly by a distinguished Colombian  Indalecio Liévano Aguirre in his capacity as its President.The history of the 1990s must not be one morerecord of the frustration of our aspirations to peace  well-being and justice. Our objective can be nothing less thanthe human person. Our actions must be directed towardsthe struggle against poverty and for the attainment ofsocial justice. Our commitment is to make the arbitraryuse of power and abuses of human rights things of thepast.But this task - this vital task - is not free of threats.Neoprotectionism threatens the free-trade prospects ofdeveloping countries. It is true that tariff protectionismhas come to an end  but a new and dangerous form ofprotectionism is now emerging: non-tariff protectionism:barriers to the export of plants and vegetables  customsbarriers  quotas  anti-dumping clauses  social clauses  therationale of ""reasons of State""  and fears of losingelections. We developing countries are no longerstruggling against the barbed wire of hostile tariffbarriers: we are struggling against an army of invisibleenemies moved by the most diverse interests andsystematically opposed to the rhetorical aspiration to freetrade - an aspiration that would seem to have somethingin common with our feelings about paradise: we all wantto get there  but not quite yet.Impoverishment is another threat. Granted  we areall committed to the openness of our economies  but thatmust not mean that we can ignore the need to manage theobvious social costs. Unemployment  the postponementof social investment programmes and neglect of the livingconditions of the rural population can ultimatelydelegitimize in vast regions of the world - this  at least  istrue of Latin America - the efforts made over many yearsto democratize our political systems. The only thingmore serious than poverty is impoverishment  and it isbeginning to make itself felt in many parts of the world.Either we leaders renew our commitment to the people orthe social costs of economic change will in the enddestroy our achievements in political consolidation.Finally  there is the threat of the formation of blocs.The development of economic blocs runs counter to the6idea of a world based on the democratic rules of free tradefor all on an equal footing. What is at stake today is notthe exchange of goods and services but rather the exchangeof the means necessary to produce those goods andservices.Selective appropriation of the means of productionputs those of us in the developing countries in the worst ofworlds. We do not have the means of production nor dowe have fair access to them  but we do have the arduousresponsibility of competing on an equal footing with theworld’s most industrialized countries.It is not a matter of repeating the third-world litany ofcomplaints and demands. The point here is to define newrules that can enable us to gain access to technology and tofinance our infrastructures on favourable terms  that canenable us to reach acceptable levels of competitiveness  thatcan enable us to break with dependency on the cartels ofservice companies and to buy market outlets in a worldwhere what counts and what is important is not producing but selling.That aspiration to develop new conditions that canenable us to play a vital role within the new spectrum ofworld forces must take the shape of a new developmentmodel for our countries  an alternative model which Ishould like to discuss with you this afternoon in this Hall.I am speaking of an alternative model that will be analternative to the protectionist system of the 1960s  for theglobalization of the economy requires not only open andcompetitive economies but an alternative to theneoliberalism that irresponsibly leaves it to the market tocorrect all imbalances.I am speaking of an alternative to the old assistancepopulism  for there must be social change based oneconomic criteria  and for an alternative to fiercecapitalism  which sets up the rule of every man for himselfas a form of social selectionism.I am speaking of an alternative to the blind criteria ofpublic interventionism as well as an alternative to attemptsto sell out the State to the highest self-interested bidders  tothe Government abandoning its own responsibilities withregard to the unprotected masses.I am speaking of an alternative to anachronisticconcepts of representative democracy but also of analternative for meeting attempts to reduce the free play ofdemocracy to sterile confrontation between private interests.The objective of this alternative model  the model ofthe South  should be the establishment of a new and moreproductive citizen in the economy  a citizen whoparticipates to a greater degree in politics and who ismore supportive in the social sphere.Words and phrases like ""social investment""  ""goodgovernmen t""   ""ag r i cu l tu ra l deve lopmen t""  ""competitiveness""  ""harmonization"" and ""gradualness"" areall part of a new alternative vocabulary that will enable usto speak the language of a new identity  of our ownidentity as countries seeking our own way.The new model of development  if it is to begenuine and not simply an abstraction  must take intoaccount some basic elements.First  it must allow for the modernization of ourproductive structures. We gain nothing if we continue toopen markets when we have nothing to sell  because weproduce nothing or very little.Modernization goes hand in hand with thedevelopment of an adequate infrastructure oftransportation and communications and the optimum useof energy sources.We must develop new conditions of productivity especially in the field of technology  and adopt moreefficient and environmentally sustainable productionprocesses. The world today is not divided between thehaves and the have-nots but  rather  between those whoknow and those who do not  and we  the developingcountries  are among those who lack knowledge. Wemust buy  develop and assimilate new technologies.Secondly  there is the concept of social solidarity.Our greatest challenge in this sphere is to give legitimacyto a new economic system through real social-development proposals. Investing in the human being isthe best business. Investment in health  education andhousing is highly profitable  not only in social terms but -especially - in economic terms.Thirdly  in addressing those two great revolutions ofcompetitiveness and solidarity it is necessary to changethe ideas of those who today act as agents of theeconomic process.What should the role of Government be? Above andbeyond the dilemma of privatization or nationalization the dilemma of whether or not to reduce the size of7Government  it is imperative that Government work  andthat it do so honestly. Good governance must be our goalin reforming Government.Good Government means building a new type ofGovernment  one that promotes efficiency. It means thetraining of technically skilled bureaucracies. It meanstransparency and the streamlining of administrativeprocedures in such a way that the roots of corruption areextirpated. It means administrative decentralization andcitizen participation  and it means the organizing of civilsociety on bases other than the old contradictions betweencapital and labour.Fourthly  and lastly  we must bear in mind that thisprocess is occurring in the context of the globalization ofthe world economy and of interindependence amongpeoples. The principal problems affecting every countrytoday are no longer merely national in nature; they areglobal  and for that reason they require the coordinatedaction of all nations.The new cooperation the international communityrequires is based on adjusting domestic policies to globalobjectives within a framework of respect for thesovereignty of States  the principles of international law anddomestic legislation. Only if we can attain a new conceptof cooperation will we avoid the pitfall of interventionism which threatens to make its way through the open door ofinterdependence and globalization. Cooperation  as analternative to intervention  is the route that can ensure forthe community of nations the fulfilment of its aspirationsfor peace and stability.I come from Colombia  a country that respectsinternational law and the principles that ensure peacefulcoexistence; a country that has placed its faith in LatinAmerican and Caribbean integration; a country with adynamic Constitution and an economy sound as few othersin Latin America; a country that is moving forward thanksto the sacrifices and steadfast labour of its people  creativepeople avid for progress and imbued with a sense of themagic of life about which García Márques  our Nobellaureate  has written; a country searching for peace becauseit so loves life.The times we are now living in are times of crisis  butalso of opportunities. In Colombia we have had to learn tolive with terrible difficulties  always inspired by the biblicalinvitation to maintain a vision as a people in order toprevail as a nation.I know that some here must have asked themselveswhy I have not referred in this speech to the problemwith which my country is everywhere associated: theproblem of drug trafficking. I have not done so becausein Colombia we believe that we are entitled to berecognized by other  positive factors: those that identifyus as an honest  hard-working people that offers respectto friendly countries and expects respect in return.Of course  we have struggled and will continue tostruggle out of conviction  while paying a high price tofight the scourge of mankind that is drug trafficking. ButI must confess that we sometimes feel alone in this task.We feel alone when we see the drug consumption ratesincrease in countries that request our help to defeat aproblem whose origins and consequences concern all ofus. We feel alone  very much alone  when we seemayors who are avowed chronic drug users elected bypopular vote. We feel alone when  after extensive effortsto eradicate illicit crops  the doors are closed to us whenit comes to selling exactly those products that we havemanaged to cultivate  with great effort  as alternativecrops.Therefore  in the midst of this lonely struggle thathas left many victims dead in the fields  a struggle ofwhich I count myself a fortunate survivor  what many ofus want is for Colombia to be looked at from a differentperspective - that it be recognized for the soundness of itseconomy  that Colombia be taken into account when itcomes to investment decisions. We want those presenthere to get to know the Colombian people - my people.We want visitors to see our country so that many morepeople the world over will be as much in love with mycountry as are those of us who were born  who live andwho will die in that privileged corner of Latin America -Colombia."
"38",1570,"COM",49,1994,"At the outset  I should like  on behalf of the delegation ofthe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  to extend toMr. Essy my warmest congratulations on his election to thepresidency of our Assembly. I am convinced that hiswealth of experience in international relations will be for usthe best guarantee for the success of our work. Throughhim  the Assembly has also paid resounding tribute to hiscountry  Côte d’Ivoire  and to one of its illustriousdeparted sons  the late President Houphouët-Boigny  agreat statesman and acknowledged visionary whosewisdom and intelligence made a great contribution to theadvent of a world of peace and progress.I wish to join previous speakers in expressingprofound gratitude to his predecessor for the effectivenesswith which he presided over the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session.I also take this opportunity to convey to Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  our Secretary-General  our high esteemand fraternal gratitude for his tireless efforts to reducepockets of tension and strengthen international peace andsecurity. His devotion and talent reinforce the role of ourOrganization.These past five years  the world has seen greatupheavals that have put an end to the cold war andideological blocs. Despite the emergence of certainconflicts  the world is on the threshold of a new  morepromising era in which dialogue and joint action seem tobe prevailing over confrontation.We are one year away from the fiftieth anniversaryof the establishment of the United Nations  and in thepresent circumstances we must think about defining thenew missions our Organization has to carry out  inaddition to those bestowed on us by history. Even if thegoal of a peaceful world society has not yet been reached it is acknowledged that our Organization has contributedbroadly to decolonization and the progressivedevelopment of international law. Of the positive resultsachieved by the United Nations  the definition andpromotion of human rights is inarguably the mostimportant. This world forum has made it possible fordeveloping States to make the international communitymore aware of their difficulties and to express theirdemands. Thanks to the United Nations  some globalproblems  such as those of population and environment have become priority concerns for all nations  small orlarge  rich or poor.The climate of détente and the easing of tensions ininternational relations undoubtedly made it possible toresolve the conflict that beset South Africa for so long.The first non-racial  democratic elections held in SouthAfrica  resulting in the election of President NelsonMandela  are the best evidence of the positivedevelopment of law there. My country is particularly18pleased to see the Republic of South Africa occupying itsseat in our great family. All Africa places its hopes inSouth Africa  whose leaders have demonstrated wisdom anddetermination. We earnestly hope South Africa will be ableto pass peacefully and harmoniously through its new stageof transition.One of this year’s felicitous events is clearly theconcretization of the peace process that started with theWashington agreements between the Palestinians and theIsraelis. Their mutual recognition has provided freshimpetus  and it heralds an era of peace in that part of theworld  which has for so long been bloodied by war. I takethis opportunity to congratulate President Arafat and thePalestinian people on their tireless efforts to give Palestinea sovereign  independent State within internationallyrecognized boundaries.If peace is to be established in the Middle East  theremust be a comprehensive settlement of the differencesbetween the State of Israel and the Arab States of theregion. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  anArabic-speaking and French-speaking African State  willspare no effort in sincerely encouraging all the partiesconcerned to strive for peace. We therefore welcome theagreement reached between the Kingdom of Jordan andIsrael.My country has always respected our Organization’sprinciples  and therefore has always advocated dialogue andconcertation in the settlement of conflicts. In that spirit  itendorsed the General Assembly’s recommendations on thequestion of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Need I recallthat in this regrettable dispute  which started 19 years ago [between the Comoros and France]  in 1975  the Comorianauthorities have always expressed a willingness to negotiatewith France on the legal and practical modalities for thereturn of the Comorian island of Mayotte to its naturalcommunity. Unfortunately  France has always opposedconcertation on this issue. Quite the contrary: that greatcountry  an unchallenged defender of human rights  isprolonging its administrative and military presence inMayotte. It has also undertaken in this part of our smallterritory reforms and socio-economic development planswhose clear aim is to separate for all time the four sisterislands that geography  history  race  religion  language andeconomy had joined together with ties that were bothidentical and complementary. For Comorians  faith anddignity have made this problem a cardinal point of oursovereign existence.While we take note of the tangible results of therebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe  the opening upof Africa to multiparty politics and the easing of tensionsbetween Powers  we cannot be but concerned at theappearance of conflicts that are undermining worldstability and equilibrium. The case of Bosnia andHerzegovina is a constant and striking reminder that westill have a long  long way to go on the road to lastingpeace. My country calls on the Serb and Bosnian partiesto comply with the relevant Security Council resolutionsand to accept the plan for territorial division proposed bythe Contact Group. Nothing would be more tragic thanallowing passion and pride to prevail over reason and takeprecedence over the lives of thousands of women children and old people  who are the daily victims of thisincomprehensible conflict.We are equally at a loss when we look at thegenocide that has ravaged Rwanda. We still wonder howall the macabre events that have torn Rwanda apart couldhave taken place. Fortunately  peace has been restoredand normalization seems to be gaining ground. I take thisopportunity to express our deepest gratitude to France for""Operation Turquoise "" as well as to all the States thatsupported that operation  for without it Rwanda wouldhave ceased to exist. We express our gratitude to theneighboring States for the very African hospitality theyshowed in saving the lives of human beings in distress.I urgently appeal to the new Government of Rwanda tospare no effort to bring about national unity  withoutwhich the reconstruction of Rwanda cannot be assured.In addition  we salute the courage and determinationof the political authorities and the people of Burundi fortheir avoidance of another tragedy with incalculableconsequences.The international community must assist Africa -particularly the Organization of African Unity  which hasnever remained indifferent to the various conflicts thathave embroiled certain Member States - to preventconflicts and manage them better. It is imperative thatwe finally wake up to Africa’s economic realities andunderstand that its instability and destitution are astanding threat to society throughout the world.While we recognize that the world political situationhas eased considerably  we must also take note that theinternational economic situation shows us no glimmer ofhope. Political stability will be fragile if there is not aclear improvement in the economic sphere and  inparticular  if growth is limited to the wealthy countries.19The developing countries are bearing the full brunt of theill effects of the crisis  in the form of deteriorating terms oftrade  rising protectionism  decreasing net flows of externalresources and  on top of all that  the debt burden  whichnullifies the efforts of the developing countries.The widening gap between wealthy and poor countriesreduces the effects of the economic recovery in theindustrialized countries in recent years has seemed to beclearly appearing on the horizon. In this context  it is ourcollective responsibility to combat poverty  famine anddestitution in the developing countries.Given the distress of the developing countries and aninternational economic system in crisis  we must devise anew and constructive vision  one capable of restructuringthe world economy while reflecting the interests of bothparties within the framework of sincere cooperation.We place our hopes in a renewed United Nations thatwill take concrete action to establish more balancedinternational economic relations.In the opinion of my country  the Federal IslamicRepublic of the Comoros  cooperation between North andSouth is vital to the balance of the world economy. TheFederal Islamic Republic of the Comoros also believes thatcooperation between the countries of the South isimperative; indeed  we have made cooperation with thedeveloping countries an essential element in our relations.For us  the development of South-South cooperationis a bounden duty in order to insure the continuation andstrengthening of development assistance. We have chosena policy of regional solidary and integration as an effectivetool for economic and social progress. Our commitment tothe Indian Ocean Commission  and our membership in theAfrican Economic Community  as well as our participationin the preferential trade area  ZEP  demonstrate theimportance the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comorosattaches to the General Assembly’s recommendations on theneed for the developing countries to cooperate on a regionallevel in order to better confront their own problems. It isin this spirit that our regional institutions have adopted astrategy aimed  first and foremost  at strengthening tradeand industrial cooperation  and at improving transportation telecommunications and so forth.Since the democratic election of His Excellency Mr.Sáíd Mohamed Djohar to the Supreme Magistrature  theFederal Islamic Republic of the Comoros has committeditself to working for a democratic  dynamic and opensociety and to combating corruption  in order todefinitively bring about economic and financial recovery.In this effort  the Comorian people adopted a newconstitution and  last December  democratically elected anew Parliament composed of all the country’s mainpolitical parties.The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comorosunderstands that international cooperation alone cannoteradicate the evils of underdevelopment. Thus it hassigned a programme of structural adjustment with theinternational financial institutions  with the aim ofachieving economic recovery and of improving publicfinance. It is a trial that the Comorian people is enduringwith courage and sacrifice. But the recent devaluation ofthe Comorian franc has exacerbated the crisis by seriouslyundermining the Comorians’ purchasing power. In sucha difficult socio-economic context  how can one convincestarving people and demoralized State workers thatdemocracy brings hope? The measures taken as a resultof the structural adjustment programmes do not facilitatethe role the public authorities of a country must play inthe context of social renewal.While it is true that the easing of internationalpolitical tension and of certain regional conflicts hasreinforced hopes for peace  the gravity of the internationaleconomic situation is also creating doubt.The victims of the world crisis are still the same:men  women and children of the African  Asian  LatinAmerican and Caribbean regions.Indeed  the same people are always the ones who areconfronted with famine  poverty  natural catastrophes anddesertification. Other modern scourges such asfundamentalism  terrorism  epidemics and drug-traffickinghave been added to an already hostile socio-economicenvironment. The harsh reality of the poor countries isaccentuated by their exclusion from the decision-makingprocess concerning the international economic situation.As the twentieth century draws to a close  the long-cherished hopes of the third-world peoples are giving wayto disappointment.The special session of the General Assembly oneconomic cooperation  the Paris Conference on the leastdeveloped countries  the five years of the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990sand many other programmes and projects that have beendrawn up and carried out over the last 20 years have notattained the goals set for them by the General Assembly20in the area of development. Specialists in developmentassistance and economic cooperation are unanimous infinding that the current trend is towards stagnation and evenregression.Our General Assembly must now find a solution to theproblem created by the failure of international economicrelations.We must insist more strongly on our sense ofsolidarity and shared responsibility.My country has always advocated strengthening therole of the United Nations in all areas of internationalrelations. But it also believes that the structures of theUnited Nations system must correspond to the new worldscene. We are among those who believe that the victors ofthe Second World War do not have a monopoly on themaintenance of peace and on the socio-economicdevelopment of nations.The General Assembly must be the central body wherethe relevant decisions of our Organization are taken.It is difficult to understand why there is no connectionbetween the political determination expressed here byStates  the essential components of the protagonists ofinternational life  and the international financial institutions.On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Sáíd MohamedDjohar  President of the Federal Islamic Republic of theComoros  and on behalf of the Government and the peopleof the Comoros  I should like from this rostrum to make asolemn appeal to the international community to provideeffective support to the Comorian people in its efforts atsocio-economic recovery and in its irreversible commitmentto democracy.I should like to request that the Security Councilreconsider the sanctions adopted against Libya  because  asa result of sanctions condemning inadmissible acts  anentire people is being penalized. It is in this spirit that therelevant resolutions adopted by the League of Arab States the Organization of the Islamic Conference and theOrganization of African Unity should be taken intoconsideration  so that this fraternal country may enjoy itssovereignty.We welcome the imminent return of President Aristideto Haiti. May the peace-keeping operation there bringstability and security so that Haitians  in their renewedunity  can work together to rebuild a free and prosperousnation.We also extend these wishes to our brothers inLiberia  Somalia and Angola  so that  as in Mozambique they may resume dialogue and lay down their weapons.We also wish to encourage the Algerian authoritiesin their efforts at national reconciliation in the greaterinterest of the Algerian nation.According to several sources  it seems that there hasbeen a significant movement of Iraqi troops towards theKuwaiti border. We venture to hope that thesemanoeuvers are intended for a purpose other thanaggression against Kuwait. Indeed  our Organization willnever accept a repetition of Iraq’s aggression of 1990.It is difficult for us to believe that Iraq has notlearned the lessons of that famous  much-covered Gulfwar  from which the Iraqi people  the ultimate victims are still healing their wounds.The aggression against a sovereign State and theattack on its territorial integrity are a clear violation ofinternational law. It is an act that goes against thefundamental principles of the Charter of thisOrganization.That is why  on behalf of the Government andpeople of the Comoros and in the name of the sacredprinciples of Islam  I appeal to the Government andpeople of Iraq to halt any attempt to invade Kuwait. It isup to the Security Council to use all peaceful means tospare us a second Persian Gulf war. If it does not mankind will not be able to understand why each timepeace seems to be established another war looms.May I conclude by repeating my delegation’sfraternal congratulations to the President of the GeneralAssembly on his election. We are at his completedisposal to assist him in any way in his discharge of thatlofty  noble mission."
"39",1609,"CPV",49,1994,"Mr. President  we welcome with greatsatisfaction your election to preside over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly in the certainty that your qualities as an outstanding and experienced diplomat  in addition to your well-known personal dedication  will guarantee that our work is fruitful and effective. Through you  your country and all of Africa will have the well- deserved opportunity to contribute to the deliberations that lie before us.We should like to express our gratitude to your predecessor. Ambassador Insanally  for the able manner and constructive spirit in which he guided the forty-eighth session.We should also like to express to the Secretary- General our appreciation for the far-sightedness with which he is performing the task of guiding the United Nations in the new era into which it has entered.In recent years there has been broad agreement that the great events that have shaken the world  giving rise to great hopes of human progress  have led to different and in many respects contradictory changes and prospects  and that there has been a delay in forging a genuine consensus among nations.Democracy as a way of life has been established in a large number of countries in every geographical area and is developing with obvious dynamism. We hope for a kind of rebirth  inspired by an ever-greater participation in the whole social fabric of national life. In this framework  the civic aspect is coming to the fore and taking on increasing vigor.Long deemed indispensable to economic progress  private enterprise has seen its role considerably increased in many developing countries.Unquestionably  there is an increased general awareness of the environment throughout the world  and the idea that the value of the planet's resources must endure as a condition of our very survival is gradually becoming a guide and a criterion for human activities. International action to combat violations of human rights in all forms and to encourage the exercise of those rights has become a constant  despite the distance separating us from the attainment of our desired objectives. The rejection of the social inequality of women is gaining ground  and we shall from now on be discussing the way this is reflected in practice.Those are the salient factors  in addition to others of equal importance  that are among the positive trends which are at our disposal and which must be developed at all costs so that we can derive the full benefit of their great potential.However  in the two major areas that constitute yardsticks for assessing mankind's well-being - those of peace and development - the present situation is far from satisfactory. Conflicts continue to proliferate  and positive settlements have been achieved to very few of them. Situations of poverty have assumed vast proportions and even critical levels in several regions  particularly in Africa. The persistence of these evils in the post-cold-war era reminds us that the community of nations still lacks a direction that might lead it towards the fulfillment of its own concept of genuine community. There has been a lack of vision to recognize the true scope of collective interests and the political will and ability to implement them. There has also been a lack of cooperation and tolerance as independent values untouched by the systematic quest for the upper hand.Peace and development are closely linked. Moreover  we are convinced that the most complex challenge concerns development and that the most decisive influences on the relationship arise from that challenge. Indeed  collective security hinges on shared progress - shared within a framework that provides justice and equality. It is a fact that during periods of expanded economic growth the most visible effects of imbalance have  for better or for worse  been attenuated. However  the development to which we aspire cannot be limited by narrow so-called realism. Equality as an inherent element of progress cannot be described as an ideal today. It is  rather  a prerequisite.The United Nations shouldered a very specific responsibility and role when  in its Charter  it solemnly committed itself to working towards a better world. The United Nations is a unique body and its indispensability in serving the interests of all is becoming ever clearer today. It is indeed in this universal forum that there is a need jointly to establish guidelines for the entire world  that the random developments we experience converge  and that mechanisms and measures commensurate with today's issues are promoted.In order to increase its ability to carry out its mission in the present context  the United Nations has decided to reform its structure to make it more effective and stronger and to ensure greater participation: Under the dynamic and tireless coordination of the Secretary-General  the process is under way and we hope that at the present session of the Assembly new and fruitful progress will be achieved allowing the Organization further to promote economic and social development  prevent conflicts and eliminate their causes. In this regard  the Assembly will continue to make use of the guidelines set down in its ""Agenda for Peace"" and will have the opportunity to evaluate the report containing the draft of an Agenda for Development.The strengthening of the legitimacy and authority of the United Nations will remain linked to an improvement of its democratic representativeness and to better regional balance  as well as to safeguarding the identity of all  including that of smaller States. In this context  Africa has recently formulated its current position on the reform of the Organization. This reform must provide genuine political and operational consistency to all the bodies and structures of the system  within whose framework the African continent must have an appropriately expanded representation.In the meantime  the question of the expansion of the Security Council has been answered by some States with expressions of their readiness to assume increased responsibilities within it. As to the diversification of regional representation  we note with satisfaction and welcome with great fellow-feeling the announced candidacy of a Portuguese-speaking country  Brazil.Since the opening last year of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly  several important political events have taken place in the world. We were particularly struck by the magnificent example of maturity and vision offered by the people of South Africa and its leaders  particularly President Mandela. We wish to share with them the pride of all Africa and the admiration of the international community.Unfortunately  the lessons to be derived from this example have not yet been put into practice in some cases in our region. Recent events in Rwanda  which have brought such great pain to its people and especially its children  are a tragedy which our conscience demands never be repeated on our continent. Moreover  hostilities continue that could and should have been over by now  while opportunities for peace and reconciliation have been missed again and again  in particular in Liberia. The agreements already concluded among the Liberians must now be implemented and an end must be put once and for all to armed clashes and their repercussions on neighboring countries and the West African region.The conflict that has so long afflicted Angola has passed through a stage of incredibly destructive  deadly violence following the failure peacefully to implement the results of the elections of September 1991  even though those elections were supervised and declared free and fair by the United Nations. We very much hope that the present stage of negotiations between the Government of Angola and UNITA will finally herald a cessation of hostilities in the near future and the opening of an era of peace  reconstruction and progress so long awaited by a people with which Cape Verdeans feel such brotherly solidarity.The coming elections in Mozambique will doubtless close an era in which national interests have prevailed. but also in which the United Nations and the international community have rendered praiseworthy assistance. We wish Mozambique all success in these elections  during which Cape Verde will be present as part of an observer team from the United Nations Operation in Mozambique. It is essential that the parties continue rigorously to observe the rules of the democratic game by unequivocally accepting the outcome of the elections once these have been declared free and fair by the international community.We are gratified by the way in which the recent first legislative and presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau took place and by the peaceful respect shown for its results. This attests to the sense of responsibility of the political leaders of the country.In Sao Tome and Principe  the established democratic system was reaffirmed by the calm that prevailed during the electoral process that was completed at the end of last week.We also wish to declare our support and encouragement for the continuation of the talks which are taking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General between Portugal  Indonesia and representatives of East Timor. We hope that they are taking place on the basis of forms of participation that respect the fundamental rights of the citizens of East Timor.As regards the maintenance of peace  it must be recognized that in recent times notable progress has been made on the international level  in the United Nations in particular. The improvement of this capability must continue  and this will require even greater cooperation and complementarity with the regional organizations. Africa is showing what it can do in this area  but obstacles to maximizing this potential remain in the form of gaps that must be filled through more consistent  predictable and timely support by the United Nations and the partner countries.The prevention of conflicts remains  in any case  the primary objective to be sought. The action to be taken to this effect finds its reference points in the recommendations in ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). However  the ultimate success of prevention will continue to depend on the longer-term task of eliminating the deeper causes of the conflicts  which  of course  are many. In addition  it will be crucial to tackle them simultaneously  not only to produce synergy but also so that the relevant lessons can be learned concerning these causes and the relations between them. One of the major causes of the instability that generates conflict is poverty  to which we referred earlier. That in itself would be sufficient to lend urgency to the eradication of poverty. However  the scope and nature of the phenomenon require of us a reaction based on the moral aspects of the heritage of mankind.Today  it is understood that all peoples must live in dignity; that is their basic human right  and we must guarantee them the realization of that right. This need must transcend the present stage of mere words  and a program must be implemented to transform the situation. A particularly valuable contribution to this is in the works: the World Summit for Social Development  for which preparations are now under way. Within this framework  there will be a need to analyze the development of the human being in society  and not just some reduced concept of the social element as an objective. We still have enough time  and it is our duty to muster the necessary will to achieve the goals set for this important Summit.The fact that for countless individuals it is impossible to benefit from contemporary parameters of well-being has resulted in the major migrations of our era  which reveal the critical imbalances which continue in certain regions of the world. The solution can  clearly  come only from development and from the rejection of scenarios in which some parts of the world or groups of people are excluded or marginalized. In the meantime  we emphasize the need to see implemented the recommendations of the International Conference on Population and Development concerning refugees  displaced persons and migrants  a timely instrument which has been made available to us.Within the framework of global development one of the major questions that arises is that of Africa. This question must continue to be given very high priority on the international agenda and on the agenda of the United Nations. The seriousness of the situation prevailing on our continent  the longstanding nature of the problem and the observation of indicators for future prospects deserve to be met as a particularly complex challenge and should never be considered as a pretext for showing lassitude or indifference. The lack of progress in Africa would be a set-back for all  not just for the Africans. We are convinced that this fact will become increasingly clear to us.In the 1990s in particular  Africa undertook  in rather difficult conditions  reforms and economic adjustments as well as political and managerial transformations. The African achievement certainly has not yet reached its optimal goal  but it must be said that on many occasions it was not adequately supported by external measures and resources  which are  after all  indispensable complements.The African economic and political systems doubtless still have a long way to go  and they must become more effective and be based on the participation of all. African regional cooperation must increase its pace and must obtain increased benefits. However  the continent must be the beneficiary of  inter alia  a major reduction in its debt burden  the elimination of obstacles to its exports  vigorous foreign investments and increasing international assistance better adapted to national policies.Referring again to the constraints that are affecting Africa in particular  we reiterate the need to mobilize adequate and sufficient resources to allow for the implementation of the International Convention to Combat Desertification  in particular concerning the Sudan and Sahel region and in cooperation with the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel. For Cape Verde  which is coordinating the activities of this Committee  it is particularly important that this event be crowned with success.Next year  as we approach the end of the twentieth century  we shall be marking the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. There are numerous reasons to celebrate this event  especially if we were to try to imagine what the world would be like without the United Nations. My country cannot forget the role which the Organization played in its political emancipation and in its development efforts following that emancipation  nor do we forget that it offers a forum in which small countries can have their say and participate in the deliberations. We welcome in this context the holding of the United Nations Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  and we hope that the results of the Conference will be fully implemented.The time has come to consolidate the feeling of a shared destiny among the diverse nations that are today gathered together within the Organization. We must no longer put off the task of setting out on those re-charted paths which our aspirations require."
"40",1654,"CRI",49,1994,"Costa Rica hails and congratulates you mostwarmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. We also wish to thank the Secretary-General  whose untiring efforts have made this anOrganization which is daily playing a more dynamic andeffective role in the advancement of peace  security anddevelopment.We are Members of an Organization whose namebespeaks hope and dreams - the United Nations; not alignedor groups of nations but one single family of peoples united in the struggle for peace  human rights anddevelopment.In those dark days of 1945  filled with suffering hatred and ruin  those who forged the United Nationscreated an Organization with medium- and long-termobjectives. Rather than setting up a transitory league ofvictors  their vision was to look to the future in unity.They thought not only of themselves; they thought as wellof their children and their grandchildren. They alsothought of the children of their former adversaries  andthought as well of those who had stayed on the marginsof the tragedy.My country is proud to have been a foundingmember of this fraternity. It is also proud to say that theideals of the United Nations live on in the spirit and inthe daily lives of our people. And although my countryis not wealthy  not powerful  not big  we feel we havehonourably served the cause of this Organization bothwithin and beyond our borders.Despite the limitations inherent in our small andpoor country  the Costa Rican people have proved theyare capable of dreaming bold dreams and of making thosedreams come true. Forty-six years ago  when the UnitedNations was about to take its first steps and the worldwas just beginning to emerge from the horrors of theSecond World War  a group of men and women of visionin our country began to pursue the dream of a worldwithout wars and armies  and decided that the dream shouldbegin to be made a reality right at home. We thusabolished our army and began a long period of economicgrowth  accompanied by social well-being and politicalstability. We became a model of human development in adeveloping country and a force for the abolition of war andviolence in our region. It is through our commitment tomaking this dream a reality within our own borders that ourcountry has made its most important contribution to thecause of the United Nations.Today  as humanity stands at a decisive crossroads the need to build new utopias has become of the utmosturgency. As human beings  we are at our creative bestonly when we are in pursuit of a dream  when our eyesshine with the gleam of that dream. Given the magnitudeof the dangers we face  the international community  nowperhaps more than ever before  needs to muster all itsenergies in pursuit of renewal.As a people living at the centre of the Americas  weare deeply concerned by the threats hanging over mankind.We are especially concerned about growing tensionsbetween the proponents of social progress and those of thenatural environment that supports it. At times  thecountries of the world seem to be playing out a macabreglobal compact for self-destruction. While the productionand consumption patterns of the industrialized world arewreaking havoc on nature  poverty in the third world is alsocausing serious environmental damage. The end result isa rapid deterioration of the natural resource base uponwhich all of life and society depends  to the point where thevery survival of humanity is in jeopardy. With everypassing day  awareness is growing of the fact that thisabsurd path the world has chosen to follow is notsustainable.Given such a formidable threat  the United Nationsonce again shines like a beacon of hope for the world. Asa forum pooling the energies of the internationalcommunity  it has already acted resolutely in dealing withthe environment. From a variety of vantage points  manyof its agencies have launched efforts to preserve andconserve the world’s resources and to establish norms ofsocial organization that are compatible with the life cyclesof the planet. At the Rio de Janeiro Summit  that decades-long effort of the United Nations in this area was clearlyexpressed  and the adoption of Agenda 21  along with theconventions on biodiversity and climatic change  which mycountry has signed  is to a large extent the fruit of the workof the United Nations.As the community of nations tackles new commonchallenges  Costa Rica once again affirms its commitmentto play a useful role. Aware as we are of our limitationsas a small and poor country  we can but offer the best wehave. We pledge our land and our collectivedetermination as a contribution to building utopias andkeeping hope alive.We wish to assume our role in these global causeswith two reasons in mind: we are committed to theworld-wide struggle to ensure the existence and well-being of mankind  and we feel it is urgent for us toprovide our people with the kind of development that willmake of nature an ally and not an enemy.Today  we acknowledge that the social and economicprogress made in Costa Rica in recent decades wasachieved at the expense of a serious deterioration in ourenvironment. Our polluted rivers  our eroded soil and ourrapidly disappearing forests are the unfortunate proof.For the future  only sustainable development can offer uscontinued abundance and growing well-being  generationafter generation.All too often throughout history  human beings haveopted for the easy way out - only economic growth superficial and fleeting change and an irrationalexploitation of the environment. Aware as we are of thedeplorable results of such an approach  we Costa Ricanswish to rid ourselves of such self-deception. We envisagesustainable development as one that is mindful of themacro-equilibrium that in turn makes long-termdevelopment possible - I refer to political stability  socialequity  economic balance and harmony with nature.The enjoyment of peace  democracy and stability inCosta Rica is in large measure because of the sustainedinvestment we have made for decades in education  healthand other services to ensure the well-being of our people.By abolishing our army  we have been able to convertmilitary expenditure into expenditure on socialprogrammes and to avoid the threat of stunteddevelopment such as often occurs under militarydictatorships. Building on these traditions  we are nowattaining new and ambitious goals.To achieve sustainability  major changes are in storefor us in our way of life  and to make these changes wewill have to set free the energies and the determination ofour citizens. That is why we are shifting away fromrepresentative democracy and moving towards morecomplex forms of participatory democracy.2Since we have chosen to pursue sustainabledevelopment we are committed to finding medium- andlong-term solutions to the cyclical economic imbalancesfrom which we have suffered over the years.Desirous as we are of changing the ways in which weinteract with the natural world  we in Costa Rica haveundertaken an ambitious programme based on socialconsensus  the work of the scientific and technologicalcommunity and the historical ability of new Stateinstitutions to promote development. Decades ago  whenthe topic of environmental conservation was not yet a keyitem on the agendas of Governments or internationalorganizations  my country was already working to set up asystem of nature conservation areas which today cover onefourth of our national territory and provide protection forvirtually all our animal and plant species. Today we aretaking yet a further step and endeavouring to arrive at anintegrated scheme to combine nature conservation with theproductive use of tropical biodiversity. Our goal to live inharmony with nature has helped us to realize that our landwas for the most part meant to be forested. The objectivesof our programme include improving the net absorption ofcarbon dioxide through forestation programmes carried outin conjunction with developed countries  the exportation ofplant trees and the development of technologies for tropicalreforestation. These and other projects are part of anational plan designed to implement all the elements ofAgenda 21  adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.In the pursuit of these and other  similar goals weintend to make Costa Rica into a model of sustainabledevelopment. Indeed  we hope to become the firstdeveloping country to make the leap to sustainabledevelopment. Like other dreams we have cherished andrealized in the past  through our own efforts and with thehelp of the international community  this dream is bold andambitious.Costa Rica cherishes this aspiration for all of CentralAmerica as well. We are committed to our region’s effortsto achieve sustainable development  efforts that are todaybeing carried out under a common programme that wasagreed to at our recent meetings of Presidents.During the tragic years of the Central American crisisCosta Rica did not suffer the ravages of war or dictatorship nor did it see any of its freedoms taken away.Nevertheless  our national development was hampered bythe backwardness  injustice and violence that held swaythroughout the region. Today  we Costa Ricans reaffirmour conviction that our destiny as a nation is indissolublylinked to that of the other nations of the Isthmus.Costa Rica vividly remembers and continues to begrateful to the United Nations for its valuable support inbringing peace to our region. We recall the exceptionalefforts the Organization made. Its action of solidarity mobilizing substantial resources and devising specificprogrammes  was at that time of great benefit to CentralAmerica.Today  the situation is very different. In our regionwe have put an end to the fratricidal conflicts that bled usfor decades and we have ushered in an era ofreconciliation  peace and democracy. Today  CentralAmerica offers much more fertile ground for ever-higherlevels of human development. Today  our peoples aremore capable of building a better future for themselvesand therefore of establishing mutually beneficial andcooperative relations with international organizations andfriendly countries.Today’s watchword is ""interdependence"". Theindustrialized countries will be able to maintain theirstandards of living and levels of production only if theycan foster development in the rest of the world. This iswhy we invite them to forge closer ties of cooperationwith us so that Central America’s goals can be shared andmore easily attained by our countries.Notwithstanding innumerable difficulties and despite40 years of cold war and a multitude of conflicts  theUnited Nations has a record of accomplishmentunprecedented in history.We derive great satisfaction from the imminentfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Never beforein the history of mankind has any joint effort for peacemanaged to endure so long  and never before has anyinternational effort taken on such universal proportions.We nevertheless hope that this universality willbecome total as soon as possible  without any exceptionswhatever. Today  Costa Rica would like to reaffirm itsstrong support for the legitimate aspirations of theRepublic of China in Taiwan to take part in the efforts ofthe United Nations. We believe that the people of thatnation must be represented in this family of nations. It isa reality  and it is also an issue that the Organizationcannot continue to sidestep.3The impending anniversary is also a good time for usto set a new course for the United Nations so that we cansuccessfully meet new challenges. We consider the ideason this subject contained in the Secretary-General’s""Agenda for Peace"" to be of the utmost importance  and wehope that we will be able to contribute to making them areality.""An Agenda for Peace"" is a particularly importantguide for the international community. Its naturalcomplement  the agenda for development  optimisticallyreflects mankind’s new concerns and offers us greatopportunities to work dynamically in building the newmillennium.Indeed  there is a great deal of work before us.Although there is no longer a cold war  although manyStates have rejected totalitarianism  it is still true that weare faced with the horror of the unfolding tragedy ofRwanda  the aggression being pursued against Bosnia andthe resurgence of ethnic and religious fanaticism. We arefrustrated to see that the best efforts of the organizedinternational community have not been sufficient to find away out of the Cuban crisis  in our America.We feel indignation in the face of the violence andexploitation to which women and children continue to besubjected and alarm at the steady increase in drugtrafficking and its occasional ally  terrorism. We are sad tosee that hunger and poverty continue to be a daily realityfor millions in Africa  Asia and our own Latin America.These painful realities must not  however  weaken ourresolve. Recently we have seen hopeful and bright signalsto the effect that things can and should be different. Wehave witnessed the Republic of South Africa peacefullyputting an end to a shameful regime and becoming themother of all its children  regardless of the color of theirskin.We have seen Israelis  Palestinians and Jordanianstogether plough furrows of peace through the Holy Land.The first steps have been taken towards reconciliation inNorthern Ireland. There are signs of lessening tensions onthe Korean peninsula  and we trust that  throughnegotiations  there will be effective control of NorthKorea’s nuclear programme.Just a few days ago we saw how the efforts of theinternational community had finally provided the people ofHaiti with a chance of real peace and democracy. CostaRica would like to make a proposal that it considers basicfor human development in Haiti. To this end we ask theUnited Nations to work with others on a democratizationprogramme  with the gradual and irreversible abolition ofthe army in that country. The time is ripe for such aninitiative; by carrying it out we would protect this long-suffering nation from many future injustices.Having for many years been committed to thestruggle against poverty and underdevelopment  CostaRica has strong hopes of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  to be held in Denmark next March. Mycountry shares and supports its objectives and willenthusiastically participate in activities at the Summit andafterwards.We optimistically hail  as part of the restructuring ofinternational relations  the establishment of the WorldTrade Organization. We are confident that its creationwill lead to greater legal consistency in international traderelations  a new era of global economic cooperation anda greater dynamism in trade  as well as higher volumes.For countries such as the banana-producing countries ofLatin America  today facing serious problems because ofreduced access to markets in the European Union  thisnew forum will be of particular importance. We are gladthat its priority topics include the links between tradepolicies  environmental policies and sustainabledevelopment.Costa Rica was present in San Francisco to declareits faith in the future of the world. We have been herefor half a century  bearing witness to our trust in theUnited Nations. Today Costa Rica is present again to callon all Member States to continue to look forward  firmlycommitted to working with still greater dedication for theattainment of the common goal of securing the well-beingof our peoples.We must have faith in the future  but we must workto build it. Let us forge a new spirit in our minds and fillour hearts  and this Organization  with a new kind offeeling. Let us adopt as our own the attitude embodiedin the lessons of an old proverb:""Fear less and hope more; complain less and breathemore; speak less and say more; hate less and lovemore; and all good things shall be yours."""
"41",1723,"CUB",49,1994,"As we who are gathered here deliver our statements  a small and impoverished Caribbean nation is being subjected to military occupation. The inconceivable deal struck with the generals responsible for the coup d'etat - yesterday threatened as murderers  but today turned into complacent partners - ignores the decisions of the international community and the will of the Haitian people. The fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter - indeed  the authority of the Security Council and of the United Nations itself - are among the victims of this unfortunate event  as they have been totally ignored in actions carried out allegedly on their behalf.History is repeating itself. It was the guns of invaders and the boots of foreign occupants that installed in Haiti the various dictatorships of this century and trained and supported those who are still perpetrating tyranny on their people. How  then  can we trust them to promote democracy in the future?Cuba has always supported and promoted efforts to restore the constitutional order in Haiti with the unconditional and unrestricted return of President Aristide and has rejected the attempts to resort to foreign intervention as a means of resolving the conflict. At the appropriate time  Cuba denounced the Security Council's decision to go along with the violation of the Charter by some of its members and to join in their interventionist designs. Now that we are faced with a fait accompli  we can do nothing except reiterate our Government's position: those who are today applauding the invasion could become tomorrow's victims.It is clear that an essential component of this tragedy is the manipulation to which the United Nations - an organization born under the pretext of the sovereign equality of its members - has been subjected.Cuba reiterates its firm rejection of the attempts to adopt unilateral decisions on issues of vital importance to all peoples and of the abuse of the anachronistic privilege of the veto  granted by the Charter to a group of States with permanent membership of the Security Council.It is urgent to ensure that democracy prevails in international relations and in the United Nations. We must ensure respect for the Charter and put an end to its systematic violation by the most powerful.On this the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations it is imperative that the Organization be democratized without any delay. The time has come for this institution to stop catering to the interests of a handful of big Powers.Mr. Mishra (India)  Vice-President  took the Chair.The President of the Assembly  a distinguished son of the African continent whose election to the presidency honours us all  is well aware that Somalia is still fresh in our minds. The tragedy of hunger and starvation in that sisterly nation has continued  even if television newsreels no longer show the horrible pictures that served as a prelude to the so-called humanitarian invasion sponsored by this Organization.In spite of such invasions  Haiti and Somalia will continue to be poor countries. The evils of the third world are not resolved through military occupations  which are merely used to serve selfish interests.In both cases  which have already become dangerous precedents  the Security Council acted under pressure from a big Power  which monopolized the implementation of these actions and even prevented the majority of Member States from voicing their views. In both cases  under the alleged authority of the Security Council  neutrality and impartiality  essential principles of that body  were violated.These are examples of the Security Council's illegitimate foray into areas beyond its mandate: intervention based on vague arguments of humanitarian protection  or the authorizing of one or several States to take unilateral punitive actions  under Chapter VII of the Charter  in operations of invasion  occupation and intervention.In fact  what is at stake is the sovereignty  self- determination and political independence of countless countries  mainly but not only of the third world.Attempts are being made  at the expense of the suffering of a number of peoples  and without their consent  to openly give carte blanche and a predominant role to the Security Council regarding issues alien to its mandate and on which this Organization has no prerogative whatsoever.There is no doubt that the specific functioning of the Security Council deserves careful consideration  and that this body must become democratic  with an enlarged membership more representative of the countries of the third world. Poor and small countries are rightly entitled to be present on the Council and to demand that it follow equitable and transparent procedures in its activities. There should be permanent members from Latin America  Africa  and the developing countries in Asia. Membership should not be the preserve of large economic Powers associated with the West.The Security Council cannot arrogate to itself powers that have not been invested in it  nor overstep the Organization that created it and to which it is accountable. The General Assembly must assert its control over the actions of the Security Council and demand that it respect the Charter.There should also be greater response to the interests of the developing world in other areas of the Organization. The crucial problems of its peoples are not and cannot be resolved with invasions nor with allegedly humanitarian military operations. Nor can they be resolved with emergency assistance programmes whose only aim is to mitigate the most alarming consequences of structural underdevelopment.If the international community and the United Nations  its most representative organization  do not adopt the timely measures and programmes required to develop the third world  we will be using this forum to debate the causes and consequences of the arrival of underdevelopment in the first world.The growing concerns of industrialized countries over immigration issues is quite illustrative  as confirmed by the debates undertaken in the recently concluded International Conference on Population and Development.It is clear that concepts regarding cooperation imposed from the North are prevailing  with flashy titles but devoid of any practical meaning for the solution of the problems brought about by poverty  and tending to mutilate the right to development for which peoples of the world are clamouring. Although concepts such as sustainable development  human development or sustainable human development may contain defensible ideals from a theoretical point of view  they are actually being used to corrode the commitments achieved during long years of efforts aimed at facilitating international cooperation for development on a just and democratic basis.Unacceptable conditions and interference in the domestic policy of States are thus being imposed  and attempts are being made to fix strategic priorities for development in countries that  though poor  are sovereign and independent. Hence  the right to development proclaimed by this Organization is being subordinated to the interests of the large transnational economic powers  which are actually continuing to dictate the rules and practices of international economic relations.The United Nations agenda for development must not be allowed to replace the International Strategy for Development and other important instruments that were the result of the efforts of the developing countries to defend their interests and on which they exhibited great flexibility and the ability to compromise.Nor should the United Nations continue to be allowed to be used for the imposition of neo-liberal economic models  bringing backwardness and misery to millions of persons in exchange for short-term economic growth benefiting only the elitist minorities in third world countries and their partners in the affluent North.The fundamental approach  in Cuba's view  should be focused on comprehensive economic growth based on justice and equity to meet pressing social needs. International economic relations must be restructured on the basis of effective  just  equitable and non-discriminatory cooperation with the countries of the South.Poverty is not a predestined fate  let alone a human right  no matter how hard the rich countries try to prove otherwise. As long as universal respect for human rights continues to be manipulated by a handful of rich nations  the have-nots of the South will continue to play the role of the accused  with the affluent societies in the North playing the parts of judge and jury.All attempts to impose as universal dogmas systems of government designed by the privileged nations of the first world  regardless of the different social  economic  historical and cultural realities of the third world  are unacceptable and doomed to failure.We must also put an end to hypocrisy.It would be unforgivable for us to remain indifferent to the tragedy of humankind while wasting our efforts on elitist concerns. War  xenophobia  neo-fascism and racism are proliferating in our midst; the degradation of women and children is increasing; unemployment is on the rise; the environment is deteriorating and the culture of entire populations and nationalities is being crushed. Millions of human beings are afflicted by poverty and starvation; they are denied access to basic medical care and education. Yet the United Nations has done very little indeed to deal with these issues as what they really are: clear violations of human rights.Countries that are struggling  on the basis of equity and justice  to attain their development are really working in favour of the human rights of their peoples; countries that prevent us from developing are violating the human rights of our populations.The Association of Caribbean States was recently established as a means of responding to the globalization of the international economy and of strengthening cooperation among the States  countries and territories of our region. We  the peoples of the Caribbean  are conscious of the fact that only by closely reconciling our interests can we become competitive markets. That new organization  brought into being by urgent needs  contributes  together with the Ibero-American Summits  to promoting the indispensable economic integration and joint analysis of common strategies in an environment that links us through history and culture.As an integral part of that community of Latin American and Caribbean nations  Cuba has decided to sign  at the appropriate moment  the Tlatelolco Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region.It is well-known that warships armed with nuclear weapons are anchored both in the portion of our territory illegally occupied by the United States and in neighbouring Puerto Rico. Without renouncing our demand for their withdrawal  we subscribe to the noble aims of Tlatelolco. We do so as testimony to our will to join with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean  as a gesture towards our brothers in the region  and out of a desire to broaden our mechanisms for reconciliation and dialogue.At the Ibero-American Summits  held since 1991  Latin peoples south of the Rio Bravo have for the first time met exclusively among themselves to discuss issues of common interest. Meanwhile  another Summit has been convened in  of all places  Miami. All the Governments in America except the one I represent have been invited. It is said that three main issues will be discussed: free trade  collective security and the promotion of programmes to alleviate extreme poverty.We will have to determine which of the two Americas stands to reap the greater benefit from the Miami Summit. If positive results for Latin Americans were to emerge from the meeting  Cuba would sincerely welcome its convening  even if we were not present. It could become an excellent opportunity to demand of our neighbour to the North fair treatment in trade and financial relations  as well as in the transfer of technology  and to request the Host Country to fulfil its obligations in the field of international cooperation. It remains to be seen how a Government that has cancelled its meagre aid programmes to the region could raise the necessary funds to alleviate poverty among the countries convened.Let me now say a few words regarding my homeland. On two consecutive occasions this forum  by an overwhelming majority  has demanded the elimination of the economic  trade and financial blockade imposed upon my country by the Government of the United States. In both cases the United States has replied with silence.It is not  as some would have it  a matter of victory for the blockaded nation and defeat for the blockading nation. Our friends or the Governments that fully support our policies were not the only ones that voted to put an end to this irrational siege. The simple fact is that the great majority of the world is witnessing an action that has no legal justification  moral virtue or ethical principle - an action that violates not only Cuba's sovereignty but also the most basic precepts of international coexistence. It is a policy rejected by all countries that espouse the rule of law and mutual respect in relations between States.In this complex and convulsed world that is supposedly pluralistic  free and democratic  the United States is trying to deny my country  Cuba  its rightful place as a sovereign nation. It is as if two centuries of relations between the two countries meant nothing. What is worse  it is as if the cold war had frozen forever on our tiny spit of land and sun  merely because we had committed the ""sin"" of wishing to be free and truly independent a scarce 90 miles from the most powerful country on the planet.My homeland has been subjected to hardships probably greater than those suffered by any other country. With the collapse of socialism in Europe  our markets and our sources of raw materials and financing disappeared overnight. The process of overcoming domestic difficulties and reforming the economic and administrative structures conceived at a certain stage of our socialist project was also disrupted by the reinforcement of the policy of isolation and strangulation that our people had already been stoically facing for years.In the midst of this dangerous combination of elements; despite forecasts  since 1989  of a Cuban collapse  my country has not collapsed  nor will it collapse. We have survived all kinds of strategies  from those promoting terrorist and subversive actions from abroad to those of exerting pressure in different directions in order to reinforce the blockade  which  as I said  this Assembly has rejected for two consecutive years.This does not mean that the plight of my people is no longer harsh and complex. In recognition of the proven patriotism and national dignity of the Cuban people  this world forum should issue an unequivocal appeal for justice and reject once and for all the cruel hostility to which Cuba has been so long subjected.The unequal struggle forced upon us for so many years has not mitigated our love of peace. Cuba still aspires to negotiated solutions to its disputes with any country  provided that those solutions are based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. This Organization is well aware of that. We are a mature and flexible people: civilized and faithful to agreements based on equality and sovereignty.The series of bilateral meetings recently held in New York led to partial solutions to the age-old dispute betweenCuba and the United States. The spirit of seriousness and respect that prevailed in those negotiations and the will on the part of both sides to find solutions made it possible to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement that  if fully implemented  will lay the foundation for the normalization of migratory relations between the two countries.We desire peace with all our neighbours: peace with dignity. Our sovereignty  our independence and the socialism that we freely chose will never be bargaining chips at any negotiating table  nor will we ever demand concessions of such a nature from any country.We are increasingly opening ourselves to the world  without demanding or acceding to conditions. A great Power  however  is blockading us - and is blockading its own people and the sons and daughters of my people who live on its territory  preventing them from assisting and rejoining their families. Such cruelty has no parallel in the history of wholesale violations of human rights.We do not beg  for our national hero  Jose Marti  the centennial of whose death in our struggle for true independence will come next year  taught us that mankind can never be ruled by cowardice and indifference. And  as he instructed ""We ask the world  certain of its reply  whether the sacrifice of a generous people that is immolating itself in its efforts to open up to the world will meet indifference or hard-heartedness from mankind  for whose sake it is acting."""
"42",1769,"CYP",49,1994,"I should like to extend to you Sir  my warmest felicitations on your well-deserved electionto the high office of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. This is not only a mere recognition of yourlong experience and your outstanding ability and diplomaticskill but also a reflection of the esteem in which yourcountry  Côte d’Ivoire  is held in the United Nations.I should also like to express our great appreciation andadmiration for the work of the Secretary-General and forthe determined and prudent leadership which he hasdemonstrated on vital international issues.Despite important positive developments on a greatnumber of issues occupying the attention and energy ofour Organization  a significant number of old problemsremain unresolved. Ethnic conflicts  nationalisticchauvinism  ethnic cleansing  xenophobia  racialdiscrimination  expansionist opportunism  social andeconomic disparities  underdevelopment  the waste ofscarce resources on fraternal enmities  the lack ofnecessary commitment for the protection of theenvironment and gross and massive violations of humanrights are only some of the evils still afflicting humanitytoday.Among our priorities therefore should be theunequivocal reversal of the results of aggression andforeign occupation  support and defence of democracy the inversion of social and economic inequalities  theprotection of our environment and  finally  the protectionand enhancement of human rights for all.In order to accomplish such goals on a universalscale our Organization has to adapt  expeditiously andeffectively  to the changing conditions and to the newchallenges. Better coordination between the variousbodies that form the United Nations system is urgentlyrequired. The Secretary-General’s recent decision toboost the coordinating role of the United NationsDevelopment Programme on all developmental issues isa commendable step in the right direction.We are constantly witnessing world calamities.Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia are dire and goryexamples. Our common goal should be to strengthen theUnited Nations in order best to respond to today’schallenges and the increased expectations of mankind forsecurity  economic viability and democracy. Theseexpectations can only be met by making the United Nationsmore effective through the implementation of its ownresolutions and the mandatory provisions of the Charter.The General Assembly  the most prominent globaldemocratic forum  represents the full membership of theUnited Nations. It functions on the principle of sovereignequality. As such  it has played a major role towards therealization of the objectives of the world community andmust continue to do so in accordance with its mandateunder the Charter.Given today’s political realities  however  the SecurityCouncil has a substantially enlarged agenda and a moredynamic role to perform. In accordance with the Charter that organ has the ability to decide and to act. Nowadaysit is able to act more effectively in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. In today’s post-cold-warera the Security Council is in a position to play a broaderand much more important role than ever before. In a worldwhere new challenges require urgent solutions  such adevelopment is welcome. Within the context of thereinforced and expanded role  a successful outcome of thedeliberations on the review of the Council’s membership toreflect the realities of today’s world is highly appreciated.However  the effectiveness of the most powerful organof the United Nations is seriously compromised if it appliesdouble standards. It must act in every case withdetermination and consistency. The record of itsperformance indicates clearly that in those cases where theinternational community has shown steadfastness to defendthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter andfully to implement its provisions  peace and justice wasachieved. On the contrary  in those cases where unity ofpurpose had not been exhibited or the interests of nationsor alliances had been placed above the universal principlesand the rule of law  the problems remain and peace iselusive.The financial difficulties confronting the Organizationpose severe constraints on its ever-increasing role in today’sworld affairs. Every effort should be made to provide theOrganization with the necessary means to perform its vitalmission effectively. In this regard I would recall that myGovernment decided early this year  after an appeal by theSecretary-General  to double on a voluntary basis itsassessed contribution to all peace-keeping operations.Our commitment to the peaceful settlement ofdisputes was thus manifested once again in a concrete andpractical way. We hope that our gesture will soon beemulated by others. Our Organization desperately needsgenerosity by its Member States if it is to continueperforming its herculean mission effectively.It is widely acknowledged that economics plays animportant role in today’s world politics. Development the protection of the environment  poverty alleviation social progress  the improvement of health standards proper education and sound technology require financialmeans for their attainment. In this exercise the UnitedNations  through the Secretariat itself  the recentlyenhanced United Nations Development Programme andthe various specialized agencies  performs one of the mostimportant missions  that of pursuing the betterment andthe economic well-being of peoples throughout the world.These activities are also amply outlined in the Secretary-General’s report  and therefore I do not intend to dwell onthem other than to declare that we are cognizant of theirimportance and that they have our full support. Wecommend the Secretary-General’s integrated approach todevelopment issues in ""An Agenda for Development"" which complements his ground-breaking ""An Agenda forPeace"". We fully subscribe to the Secretary-General’sassertion that development is a fundamental human rightand that development is the most secure basis for peace.In accordance with the deliberations on the subject a successful implementation of the agenda fordevelopment depends on the priority to be given thefollowing elements: the alleviation of poverty and itsunderlying causes  especially in Africa and other least-developed regions; health and the status of women.There is an urgent need for clear and effective populationpolicies.In this regard  the recently concluded CairoConference on Population and Development rightly placedgreat emphasis on development and the environment.The new characteristic of the Conference’s Programme ofAction is precisely this linkage with sustainabledevelopment and protection of the environment. Itconstitutes progress by integrating control of population environmental protection and economic growth into theapproach to population issues.2The Rio Conference was a historic turning point inthis direction. Yet the follow-up and implementation of thedecisions taken at the Earth Summit remain contingent onthe political will to save our living space’s web of life.The Barbados Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  as the firsttest of the international community’s attachment to the Riocommitments  focused on the acute problems that smallisland developing States are confronted with. Cyprus  anactive member of this group  reiterates its commitment tothe early and prompt implementation of the Barbadoscommitments  and expresses the hope that every member ofthe international community will conscientiously fulfil itsrelevant obligations.We also welcome the recent broader agreement onseabed issues of the Convention on the Law of the Seapromoting universal application of the new legal ordergoverning the seas and thus opening a new chapter ininternational relations.In the light of our philosophy and experience  weattach much importance to the effective functioning of theprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations - theInternational Court of Justice. The increase in itsjurisdiction in contentious cases is encouraging. We alsoattach great significance to the possibility of clarifying legalpoints in political disputes through advisory opinions. TheInternational Court of Justice is indeed an integral part ofthe United Nations peacemaking efforts and wewholeheartedly support the Secretary-General’s proposalthat he be authorized to seek advisory opinions from theCourt as an important component of the peaceful settlementof disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter.The Secretariat’s role in an improved  rationalized andmore effective United Nations is irrefutable. We havenothing but praise for the many men and women in theinternational civil service whose competence and dedicationunder harsh circumstances enable the Organization torespond to the ever-increasing demands in today’s globalenvironment. The Secretary-General has already donemuch in the direction of rationalizing and streamlining theSecretariat. He certainly has our support in the additionalmeasures needed to carry out this task. We join inrecognizing the imperative need for adequate financialresources for the Organization  and for assessedcontributions to be paid in full and promptly by MemberStates.It should be recognized that true respect for humanrights provides the foundation for the structure andorganization of any society. Past and recent experiencein every region of the world has demonstrated that theprotection and promotion of human rights is anindispensable ingredient of a stable  just and democraticworld order. Over the years  the United Nations hasplayed a leading role in affirming human equality  whichin essence forms the core of all rights  and in eliminatingseparations based on ethnicity  religion  culture  socio-economic disparities and political philosophies.If we recognize the value of the axiom that in Statesgoverned by the rule of law the rights of citizens must beprotected unconditionally  then we should also accept theanalogy: that the same rights should be safeguarded forevery single citizen of a global State governed by the ruleof law.All the efforts of today’s global community shouldtherefore be exerted towards the implementation of thebasic idea inherent in the international law of humanrights - namely  that all the social mechanisms shouldexist to enhance the dignity of human beings  not toexploit them. Human rights are a powerful means to thisend.In order to achieve full respect for human rights andto eliminate human suffering  the world community mustclearly oppose extreme nationalism  take unequivocalstands against policies of ""ethnic cleansing"" and continueexerting steadfast efforts until we achieve the concretedismantling of unjust and inhumane social systems thatare based on ethnic segregation.The effective promotion of human rights is naturallyentwined with the global trend towards democratization.Cyprus is in the vanguard of States that have becomeparty to international instruments for the protection ofhuman rights  both at the global level  within the UnitedNations and at the regional level  primarily through theCouncil of Europe.We have had occasion in the past to express oursupport for the Secretary-General’s constructive andtimely suggestions for improving the potential of UnitedNations peace-keeping. We are encouraged that muchprogress has been made in this field. In view  however of the ever-increasing demands and the worseningfinancial problems associated with peace-keeping  weshould continue to do our best to assist in discharging  aseffectively as possible  this major responsibility of the3Organization. In this regard  may I recall that Cyprus  itselfa victim of foreign aggression  invasion and occupation  hasvoluntarily undertaken the onus of paying on a yearly basisone-third of the total cost of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)  which for the current12-month period amounts to $18 million. Similarly  theGreek Government generously offered a voluntarycontribution to UNFICYP of $6.5 million for the sameperiod.Since the Republic of Cyprus has itself been one ofthe longest beneficiaries of peace-keeping operations  Iwould like to avail myself of this opportunity to express theappreciation of my country and its people to theOrganization and its peace-keeping function. I also takethis opportunity to express to the troop-contributingcountries our gratitude for sustaining UNFICYP for somany years until the anomaly in the financing of the Forcewas finally overcome in June 1993. On this occasion  Ishould like to express the hope that a sound and fairsolution to the question of reimbursement to troop-contributing countries will be found during the deliberationsat this session. My country stands ready to offer everypossible assistance towards the attainment of this aim.I shall refrain from addressing the long list ofinternational problems described in this year’s report by theSecretary-General (A/49/1) with which the Organization isactively dealing and which extend to all five continents.Each issue presents its own complications and specialcharacteristics. Together  all the issues provide a measureof the enormity of what is expected of the United Nations the awesome burden of responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the respect and admiration he deserves incarrying out these tasks. As he has rightly pointed out inthe past:""The United Nations  by undertaking a range ofproblems as wide as the globe itself  must be expectedto achieve successes but also to experience failures.""(A/48/1  para. 512)Our world has witnessed in the last few years thecreation of new areas of tension and conflict through theunleashing of the destructive and centrifugal forces ofchauvinism and ethnic strife. There have also been at thesame time some notable successes through the resolution ofseveral regional issues and the withdrawal of foreign forcesfollowing the end of our bipolar antagonistic world. Wehave witnessed in many parts of the world the triumph ofreason  the entrenchment of democracy and the emergenceof free market economies. The achievement of putting anend to the odious practice of apartheid in South Africabroadens the vistas of human wisdom; the historicAgreements between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) on the one hand  and between Israeland other neighbouring Arab countries on the other marka new era in the Middle East. We express the hope thatthe rest of the countries involved in this conflict will verysoon be able to join the others  thereby signifying one ofthe major turning points in the history of the region.Cyprus  an immediate neighbour  expresses the hope thatsuch a catalytic positive evolution in our region will notleave our own problem unaffected.Cyprus  almost a decade after the Cold War beganto subside  remains divided as a result of foreignaggression and military occupation  and its people forciblyseparated. As a result of ethnic cleansing by theaggressor  Cypriots are victims of gross violations ofhuman rights. A large component of the Cyprus questionin its present dimensions is the massive violation of thehuman rights of the displaced persons who have beenevicted by force from their homes by the Turkish forcesof occupation and whose properties have been usurped byillegal settlers imported from Turkey to Cyprus in asystematic and well-planned policy made by the aggressorto change the demographic composition of the occupiedparts of Cyprus. In the same vein  the humanitarian issueof the enclave is another staggering dimension of theCyprus question. The missing persons still remainunaccounted for 20 years after the Turkish invasion andoccupation of one third of the territory of the Republic ofCyprus. This constitutes a severe violation of the humanrights both of the missing persons themselves and of thetragic figures of their relatives.I put it before the Assembly today that Cyprus is atest case for the resolve of the international communityand of this Organization to demand and to enforce respectfor its will as expressed in a plethora of resolutions.Twenty years after the Turkish invasion of 1974  theproblem remains unresolved. The number of Turkishforces  despite resolutions of this Assembly calling for thewithdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus  has in factincreased  as is stated in the Secretary-General’s report of30 May 1994. The presence of Turkish occupation troopsconstitutes a serious threat to the people of Cyprus  andhas naturally given rise to a kind of arms race.The General Assembly and the Security Councilhave repeatedly reaffirmed the legal framework withinwhich a just and lasting solution should be sought. In its4most recent resolution  resolution 939 (1994) of 29 July1994  this basis is reaffirmed to be""... a State of Cyprus with a single sovereigntyand independence and international personality and asingle citizenship  with its independence and territorialintegrity safeguarded  and comprising two politicallyequal communities as described in the relevantSecurity Council resolutions  in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation  and that such a settlement mustexclude union in whole or in part with any othercountry or any form of partition or secession""(para. 2).The Greek Cypriot side has for years accepted that abi-zonal bi-communal federation was the basis for thesettlement of the Cyprus problem. The Turkish Cypriotleadership  fully supported by Turkey  has now made itclear that they have abandoned federation as the basis ofthe solution and are promoting a loose confederation withseparate sovereignty for its two component parts.The Secretary-General rightly and clearly attributed thefailure to make progress as follows:""For the present  the Security Council finds itselffaced with an already familiar scenario: the absence ofagreement due essentially to a lack of political will onthe Turkish Cypriot side."" (S/1994/629  para. 53)In the same report to the Security Council  theSecretary-General states the following:""... a good offices mission  which by its nature isdependent on the consent and cooperation of theparties  is not an adequate method to deal with asituation in which  for the past several years  one sidehas consistently flouted the wishes of the internationalcommunity  as represented in the Security Council.""(ibid.  para. 58)My view is that if this flouting and violation ofSecurity Council resolutions is allowed to continue  therewill be no solution of the Cyprus problem. It is thereforenecessary for coercive action to be taken against the sidethat flouts the United Nations resolutions.There is also a further issue that requires to beurgently addressed. This is the problem of the militarybuild-up which is taking place in Cyprus. The anxietiescreated by the presence of foreign troops on Cypriotterritory have given rise to a significant military build-up.Security is an extremely significant area  and is anissue of substance as well as a way to improveconfidence. I have therefore proposed the following.Firstly  the leaders of the two communities duringthe intercommunal talks should make a solemndeclaration to the Secretary-General on behalf of theirrespective communities renouncing the use of forceagainst each other and undertaking to take all thenecessary measures to prevent attack by members of onecommunity against the other.Secondly  the Government of the Republic shouldtake the following measures: repeal the National GuardLaw  disband the National Guard and hand over all itsarms and military equipment to the custody of the UnitedNations peace-keeping force; undertake to maintain thepolice force of the Republic at its present numericalstrength  armed only with light weapons; undertake thetotal cost of a substantially numerically increased UnitedNations peace-keeping force; agree that the UnitedNations peace-keeping force will have the right ofinspection to ascertain compliance with the above; agreethat the National Guard armoured cars  armouredpersonnel vehicles and tanks  which will be handed overto the custody of the United Nations peace-keeping force can be used by the United Nations peace-keeping force topatrol the buffer zone and to prevent intrusions in it; anddeposit in United Nations accounts all money saved fromdisbanding the National Guard and from stopping thepurchase of arms after deducting the cost of the UnitedNations peace-keeping force  to be used after the solutionof the problem for the benefit of both communities.The Turkish Government  parallel to the above should withdraw the Turkish occupation forces fromCyprus  as well as the illegal settlers  whose presence inCyprus  apart from violating United Nations resolutionscalling on both sides to respect the demographiccomposition of Cyprus  constitutes a military threat.The Turkish Cypriots under arms should disband andhand over their weapons to the peace-keeping force.The Turkish side complains that it has been isolatedinternationally. The responsibility for this does not fallon the Republic of Cyprus or on the internationalcommunity. It falls squarely on the shoulders of theTurkish leadership  which  by an act of purportedsecession  declared a separate State. The internationalcommunity and the Republic of Cyprus simply respectedSecurity Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984) 5which deplored the purported secession  asked all StatesMembers of the United Nations not to recognize it andcalled upon the Turkish leadership to recall the act ofsecession. All States respected these resolutions exceptTurkey.A small country has been violated by an aggressor  incontravention of the Charter of this Organization  whichdenounces the use of force. Twenty years have passed  andthe Security Council’s many resolutions remainunimplemented. Unless the aggressor is faced withprogressively more severe consequences for its disregard ofinternational legal order  a very bad example and precedentwill be allowed to cast doubt on the internationalcommunity’s resolve and effectiveness.With the advent of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  we are bound to review our pastperformance and chart new avenues for the future. Did wemeet the goals set in 1945 by our founding fathers in theaftermath of two devastating wars? Did we create theprerequisite for a just and peaceful world? Did we savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war? As wenear the milestone of the Organization’s fiftieth anniversary let us do some soul-searching  let us not be complacent andlet us no longer be guilty of errors of omission andcommission. Above all  let us not remain inactive becauseof inertia. People and nations all over the world have ever-greater expectations of the Organization and the way inwhich it responds to the new challenges of our times. TheCharter  by and large  has stood the test of time  but it isour responsibility to make the United Nations a moreeffective Organization. It is the world’s last chance forpeace."
"43",1793,"CZE",49,1994,"Please accept my most sincere congratulations  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Let me also thank the outgoing President  Ambassador Insanally  who displayed exceptional diplomatic skills in managing the business of the General Assembly this past year.I wish to welcome the delegation of South Africa  which has joined us after an absence of many years. We have been following developments in that country with particular attention and are delighted with the remarkable progress it has chalked up. The restoration of South Africa's full membership further augments the universality of the United Nations  which is something we all favour.The Czech Republic takes very seriously the responsibility it shares for the maintenance of international peace and security. This is reflected  on the one hand  in our participation in United Nations operations in the former Yugoslavia  Mozambique  Liberia and Iraq and  on the other hand  in our aspirations to become a member of Atlantic and European security organizations - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Western European Union. This is why we have also joined the Partnership for Peace  one of whose priorities is coordination and cooperation by its participants for peace-keeping missions. The Czech Republic is also participating as best it can in humanitarian assistance to stricken countries. We are fast approaching the time when we will be able to provide direct economic development assistance as well.The active part the Czech Republic is trying to play in the Security Council stems from our belief that we were elected to serve: to serve not our particular interests  but certain fundamental principles  irrespective of where in the world they may be imperilled.The Security Council has in recent months dealt with several truly extraordinary situations. Let me examine some of them.With regard to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia  reaching a political settlement is a key objective of world diplomacy. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has been a critical element in managing this problem  and my country is proud of having a mechanized battalion integrated in this Force.Belgrade  in accepting the Contact Group plan  has taken a helpful step towards an overall solution of the area's problems. We also welcomed Belgrade's closing of the border with Pale. In response  the Security Council re- evaluated the extent of sanctions imposed on Belgrade  hoping that its change of attitude would turn out to be serious and lasting. We will  nevertheless  be carefully examining reports of international monitors on how strictly Belgrade keeps its international border with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina sealed.The mutual recognition of the States of the former Yugoslavia within their internationally recognized borders is the most important next possible step  one that is important for all countries of the region.We are following closely the operations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) forces and their cooperation with the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). The case of Georgia is viewed by some observers as paradigmatic: this was the first time that a peace-keeping operation - to wit  UNOMIG - included the forces of a Power of the region. It was also the first time the Security Council actually welcomed the use of a force dominated by such a Power - the CIS force - in solving a local conflict. According to this view  cooperation between UNOMIG and the CIS in Georgia might perhaps serve as a model for resolving certain other conflicts elsewhere in the CIS. The Czech Republic  however  strongly believes that each peace-keeping operation is sui generis. Each conflict is different  and each operation therefore has to be evaluated on its own merits.Africa  the continent of the President of the General Assembly  has this year seen some of the greatest tragedies to befall mankind since the Second World War. The scope and ferocity of the genocide in Rwanda is hard to comprehend. It goes far beyond anything that can be considered a ""mere"" civil war  and we are hard pressed to find any parallel to it. We welcome the conciliatory attitude of the new Rwandan Government.The multinational force in Haiti led by the United States has raised many hopes in the initial phase of its operations. Its difficult task will be to curb and  better yet  prevent violence in a society that has seldom known any other way of solving political differences.The Middle East is  fortunately  moving towards peace  and we congratulate the leaders of Israel  Palestine  Jordan and others who have amply demonstrated that even the most intractable problems of the world can be solved.In some circumstances the United Nations has played a gallant role in the region. The liberation of Kuwait was a case in point. Since the Gulf War  we have insisted that Iraq fulfil all of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We have great appreciation for the work of the Special Commission (UNSCOM) and have taken serious note of a number of measures Iraq has undertaken to meet the demands of Security Council resolutions concerning weapons of mass destruction. We are still  however  looking for a declaration by appropriate Iraqi authorities recognizing the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait within its internationally respected borders.Even this review suggests that a large portion of the Security Council's agenda has to do with peace-keeping operations. Following the end of the cold war  their number increased dramatically  with skyrocketing costs. This could not of course continue unchecked. Exercising restraint in authorizing new peace-keeping operations is the first condition for putting the whole system on a sound footing. In peace-keeping  as in every other aspect of its operations  the United Nations must live within its means.There are of course two financial flows that determine the means at the disposal of the United Nations. On the one hand there is the outflow: a function of how troubled our world is and of which of its troubles we choose to tackle. On the other hand there is the inflow: a function of equity in allocating the financial burden and of the discipline of Members in shouldering it.Only a few operations come to mind as having been largely successful. Let us take a closer look at one of these - the United Nations Operation in Mozambique. In that operation we see the following success factors: a well- crafted peace plan; a realistic mandate for the United Nations force; the fact that the politicians concerned put the interests of their country above all else; the tenacity of United Nations personnel in carrying out their mandate  and the timing of the operation. One wonders whether  today  the necessary troops could even be assembled.By contrast  a number of peace-keeping operations are facing difficulties. Angola's peace plan  for example  was probably not crafted quite well enough; post-election fighting is a consequence of the fact that the antagonists kept their armies intact. In Somalia  the factions do not seem to agree that there ever was a peace plan in the first place. This is perhaps the case in Liberia as well. In the former Yugoslavia  the strength of United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops is in many ways not commensurate with their mandate.We must therefore draw the necessary lessons. It is very important to examine the key success factors of successful operations and to try to ensure that they are present in every peace-keeping operation. But the main lesson is this: the United Nations is not a panacea for all of the world's ills. The Security Council is often sought out by factions who cannot agree on anything among themselves. But we have to insist on one principle: in general  it is the people and the leaders of a country who themselves have to demonstrate a readiness to tackle their problems before the United Nations can come in and assist them.So much  in general  about the outflow of resources. At the same time  the United Nations faces a terrible crisis of inflow.A radical reform of the existing system of financing is needed to overcome the crisis in the financing of peace-keeping. We strongly support the idea of replacing the existing arbitrary mechanism with a system based on standard  objective and quantifiable criteria. We also support the idea of establishing an independent body to study the principle of the capacity of countries to pay. This should become the fundamental criterion for determining the scale of assessments.The Czech Republic meets its financial obligations towards the United Nations in full and on time. It has also covered an appropriate share of the obligations of the former Czechoslovakia. My country has not yet  however  been assessed for peace-keeping operations  pending determination of the group in which it should be placed. This matter should be settled in the context of agreement on objective criteria for making such determinations in general.The increase in the number of peace-keeping operations has increased the dangers faced by their personnel. We therefore consider it particularly important to complete as soon as possible the work on a convention dealing with responsibility for attacks on United Nations and associated personnel. Last year we were acutely aware of the need for greater responsiveness on the part of the Security Council to United Nations personnel at large. This need continues  but some slight progress has been attained. Meetings of Security Council members with countries contributing troops to major peace-keeping operations have become more frequent  perhaps even routine.Improved cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations would no doubt improve the efficiency of both in dealing with international crises. We are particularly interested in further strengthening the cooperation on the part of the United Nations with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  but also its cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That is why last January  during our Presidency of the Security Council  we suggested the possibility of a United Nations seminar with regional organizations. Understanding full well that they all have different charters  characters and qualities  we still feel that a continuing exchange of experience can enrich the entire international system of multilateral diplomacy. We commend the Secretary-General for organizing the first meeting along these lines earlier this year.The future shape of the Security Council is one of the most important questions this General Assembly session will deal with. The effort exerted to date is reflected in the report of Ambassador Insanally  Chairman of the ad hoc Working Group. The basic role of the Security Council - maintenance of international peace and security - determines its unique position. There is no question about the need for it or about its impact on international affairs. This exceptional position of the Council should be maintained.Efforts to improve its functioning are thus informed by other considerations. It has to earn the greater confidence of Member States. Even after it is reformed  the Council will have to remain rather small to maintain its efficiency. If its work improves  that should not be because of increased size or expanded responsibilities but because of its enhanced authority. The countries that should be considered for new permanent membership are those that have the economic  political and military potential to contribute to the maintenance of global security  are prepared to assume the responsibilities implied by permanent membership  and are ready actively to participate in the implementation of Security Council decisions. The key factor  in our view  is the global influence of candidates. The principle of unanimity and its obverse - that is  veto power - expressed in 1945 the fundamental responsibility of the great Powers for maintaining world peace. Since the dissolution of the bipolar world  this responsibility has  if anything  further increased. We therefore favour maintaining the unanimity principle.We are delighted that our last General Assembly session resulted in the creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights and congratulate Ambassador Ayala Lasso on his appointment. Even during his very first few months in office  he has demonstrated its usefulness. We have no doubt that this Assembly will follow through with the implementation of additional recommendations of the 1993 Vienna International Conference on Human Rights.The danger of nuclear proliferation has not disappeared. Ongoing discussions with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are one example that proves this point. We support an indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and we will advocate this position at the fifth Review Conference of that Treaty next year. We support an increased role for the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying how the Treaty is being adhered to.We favour accelerating work on the comprehensive test-ban treaty. We share the view that the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons and of nuclear explosive devices should be banned. We support maintaining a moratorium on nuclear tests and an agreement on banning all such tests  as well as further negotiations on limiting nuclear arsenals and on the measures necessary to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear material.Ours is a small world full of problems  with almost 50 years of global peace but replete with local wars; abundance side by side with poverty; success in South Africa  progress in the Middle East  but a Bosnia and a Rwanda torn asunder. All this  and much more  is characteristic of today's world and is reflected in today's United Nations. Our fervent hope is that when the leaders of the world meet here next year  they will be celebrating 50 years of an Organization that will have become even more successful in a world that will be much closer to overall peace  prosperity and democracy."
"44",1855,"DEU",49,1994,"First  I should like tooffer you  Sir  my personal congratulations on your electionas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession  and also those of the European Union  on whosebehalf I am addressing the Assembly today. We wish youluck and success in your high office.We thank Ambassador Insanally for the wiseleadership with which he guided the forty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.I am addressing the Assembly on behalf of a Europethat has become more closely integrated as a result of theMaastricht Treaty  a Europe which in a few weeks’ timewill admit four new members  and which intends tobroaden its cooperation based on partnership with theworld’s other regions as well. I am speaking for aEurope that is committed to world peace and developmentand whose political actions are determined by its belief inindividual freedom  democracy and the rule of law  aEurope which sees in the realization of justice a crucialprecondition for avoiding war and the use of force andwhich is prepared to play its part in promoting theeconomic development of all regions  the struggle againsthunger  and measures to protect the Earth’s naturalsources of life. But I am speaking above all on behalf ofa Europe that wishes to place the United Nations in abetter position to meet its foremost obligation asguarantor of peace and security in the world.Next year’s fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations coincides with that marking the end of theSecond World War. The founding of the United Nationswas the response to that catastrophe  which had its originsin Europe. Today we can look back on impressiveachievements by the United Nations. The 51 members in1945 have grown into a membership of 184. The UnitedNations has thus developed into a truly universalOrganization.By recently concluding the negotiations on the Lawof the Sea Convention  the United Nations has madeoutstanding progress in promoting the reconciliation ofinterests and the peaceful settlement of disputes aroundthe world. The choice of Hamburg as seat of theInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is a tokenof confidence in Germany and an obligation for mycountry.The achievements of the United Nations areconsiderable  yet it is often the object of unfair criticism.The United Nations can be only as good as its Membersallow it to be. It needs their active support. Many of itspersonnel  both soldiers and civilians  have done theirutmost to help alleviate distress and save lives. No smallnumber of them have lost their own lives in the process.We pay tribute to them and honour their memory.15Many of us believed that the ending of the cold warwould usher in an era of peace. Today we know unfortunately  that that hope was premature. Day in andday out  hundreds of people are falling victim to hostilitiesand thousands more are dying of starvation or disease.What has happened and is still happening in Bosnia Somalia and Rwanda is appalling.The European Union sees a response to these globalchallenges in a strengthening of the United Nations and ofthe multilateral system for the safeguarding of peace worldwide  in more intensive preventive diplomacy and conflictprevention within the United Nations and regionalinstitutions  in respect for human rights in the world and forthe rule of law  and in closer development cooperation inand among the regions.We Europeans therefore welcome the report of theSecretary-General on an Agenda for Development. AnAgenda for Development must soon find its place alongsidethe Agenda for Peace. With his report  Mr. Boutros-Ghalihas again pointed the way for our Organization’s futuredevelopment and work. I wish to convey to him theappreciation of the European Union. We pledge aconstructive contribution to the debate on this document.Following the disaster of the Second World War Europe had the opportunity for political renewal and it tookthat opportunity. We Europeans derive courage andstrength from that renewal. No other region in the worldhas such a dense network of regional  intergovernmentaland supranational institutions  and no region in the worldhas such close relations with other nations and theirorganizations. In the field of security  therefore  it is ouraim to create a network of mutually supporting institutionswhich will include  together with the European Union (EU) the Western European Union (WEU)  the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). All mustwork closely with the United Nations. NATO and theWEU are already helping the United Nations to carry outits difficult mission in the former Yugoslavia.Because our interests are interwoven as they havealways been  we will not allow ourselves to be discouragedby set-backs and will therefore do our utmost to bringabout a peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia. TheUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has ourunreserved support. The terrible war of destruction inBosnia and Herzegovina must be brought to an end.Federation is  we believe  a first and indispensable steptowards a peace settlement. Winter will be here soon andthe people will once again have cold and hunger tocontend with. But the precondition for lasting progressand for peace is the will for reconciliation among allethnic groups. The European Union is trying to help  andwe shall continue to do so. For that reason we haveestablished an administrative office in Mostar  whichbegan its work in July under the courageous leadership ofHans Koschnick.The entire international community must constantlymake it unmistakably clear to the Bosnian Serbs that inrejecting the peace plan they cannot reckon with tacitapproval. There must be no toleration of a policy of warand expulsion. We seek a solution for the Croatianterritories under UNPROFOR protection which will beacceptable to both sides. The territorial integrity ofCroatia must be respected. Autonomy arrangements willhave to be found for the Krajina Serbs. We Europeansbelieve that an extension of the mandate of UNPROFORis absolutely essential for this purpose.The United Nations envisages a world in which it isnot the law of the strongest but rather international lawthat prevails. We Europeans share that vision. We areeven more convinced by what has happened in the formerYugoslavia that a relapse into divisive nationalism mustbe prevented.We  the Members of the United Nations  mustsummon the strength to make a great joint effort toprovide the United Nations and its Secretary-General withthe means to meet their global responsibility. The UnitedNations must become what its founding fathers aspired toin their noble vision nearly 50 years ago: mankind’sprincipal guardian of the peace.But we  the Members of the United Nations  mustabove all be prepared to stand up for the cause of peace.The members of the European Union have played  andare continuing to play  a major role in helping maintainor restore peace in many of the world’s trouble spots onbehalf of the United Nations. We Europeans are guidedby the following basic principles.First  for its peace-keeping measures the UnitedNations should be able to rely on the broadest possiblesupport and involvement of its Members. Suchoperations ought to foster peace and unity among thembut not divide the community of nations.16Secondly  we Europeans will always be in favour ofgiving priority to non-military means of safeguarding peacewherever possible. But aggressors must also realize thatthe United Nations is capable of military intervention whereother means of achieving the aims of the Charter havefailed  and that it has the will to take such action.Thirdly  the use of military force cannot be an end initself. Successful peace-keeping presupposes anunequivocal mandate based on international law  aconvincing political plan for settling the conflict  and theequitable participation of the Member States.Fourthly  we Europeans welcome the idea of stand-byarrangements developed by Secretary-GeneralBoutros-Ghali. It can effectively help reduce the length oftime between the decision to mount a peace-keepingoperation and its actual implementation. Many members ofthe European Union  including Germany  are willing tocontribute to stand-by arrangements.Fifthly  in many countries military training is gearedsolely to the traditional duties of the army. The specifictasks of peace-keeping require a completely different kindof training. The national preparation of Blue Helmetsneeds to be coordinated to a greater degree by the UnitedNations. What is needed for this are common trainingguidelines and the training capacity of the United Nations.Joint training and exercises are  at the same time  importantsteps in confidence-building.Speaking as the Foreign Minister of Germany  I wouldadd that last year I stated in the Assembly that my countrywas willing to shoulder more responsibilities with regard toUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. Today I canconfirm that Germany will be able to join fully inpeace-keeping operations of the United Nations  theGerman Federal Constitutional Court having cleared theway a few months ago.The European Union looks for the revitalization of theUnited Nations and its various organizations. In the courseof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly aworking group considered all aspects of the question ofincreasing the membership of the Security Council andother matters related to the Security Council. The workinggroup had a substantive and constructive discussion. Itsreport states that""... while there was convergence of views that themembership of the Security Council should beenlarged  there was also agreement that the scope andnature of such enlargement require furtherdiscussion."" (A/48/47  para. 8)Security Council reform is an important issue whichrequires a productive outcome. These days  the mostimportant decisions on security and peace are made in theSecurity Council. We therefore look forward to a reporton enlargement of the Security Council membership andrelated issues from the open-ended working group  and toproductive results.Transparency in the Council’s decision-makingprocesses is important  particularly in peace-keeping where the interests of contributor nations are involved.Indeed  the cost of establishing and consolidating peaceis enormous. The explosion of the peace-keeping budgethas almost brought the United Nations to a standstill. Inorder to overcome the financial crisis  three tasks must beaccomplished.The United Nations urgently requires more efficientmanagement and better organization. The creation of theOffice of Internal Oversight Services by the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session was an important steptowards this objective  and the fact that a German hasbeen appointed as the first head of that Office is a markof confidence in my country. Members’ contributionsmust be brought more into line with their actual capacityto pay. The aim of comprehensive financial reform mustbe to establish a scale that is transparent and reliable reflects Members’ financial situations  is automaticallyadapted to changed national circumstances  and givesconsideration to the needs of countries with low percapita incomes. But it is crucial that all Members bewilling to meet their membership obligations. We cannothave a situation in which the United Nations hasdifficulty carrying out its responsibilities becauseindividual Members feel exempted from their duties.It is always better to prevent a fire than to have toput it out. The European experience is that conflicts mustbe prevented -but this is not a purely Europeanexperience. We bank on the power of preventivediplomacy  confidence-building and the early detection ofconflicts. The United Nations must further enlarge andstrengthen its instruments of preventive diplomacy. Thisincludes helping countries along the road to democracyand observing elections. The establishment of and respectfor human and minority rights  as well as measures tobring about economic and social stability  are other basicelements of prevention.17The Declaration and Programme of Action of theWorld Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna callsfor more active implementation. Our priority must be tosupport the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Inaddition  we must substantially increase the resourcesavailable in the United Nations for human rights activities.It is  I believe  inadequate for the United Nations to provideonly 1 per cent of its funds for this task.Work on the establishment of an international criminalcourt must proceed apace. Human rights and the protectionof minorities are indivisibly linked. Ethnic or culturalarrogance and the curtailing of minority rights are onecause of the ever-swelling refugee flows in our worldtoday. That is why minorities need the protection of theUnited Nations. We Europeans are striving to implementthis objective. In Europe  the Pact on Stability is designedto promote political stability and the protection ofminorities.We do not want to close our eyes to our ownshortcomings. There must be no room for racism andxenophobia in Europe. That is why we have made it ourgoal to develop a Union-wide strategy against racism andxenophobia in the course of the coming year. We needmore efficient management of humanitarian relief actions.The need for resources and measures to alleviate emergencysituations through disaster relief operations is likely toincrease rather than decrease.We expect the United Nations Disaster ReliefCoordinator to ensure more effective coordination ofmeasures within the United Nations system. He must beable to intervene before it is too late for the peopleaffected. I should like to stress that point. Work on thedrafting of a convention for the protection of the work ofhumanitarian organizations must be brought to a speedyconclusion.One task of preventive policy as we understand it is tocombat terrorism. There is no justification for terrorism.Drugs and organized crime are an ever-increasing dangernot only to our young people  but also to the social andpolitical stability of whole societies. To combat thesedangers we need international alliances  and we need themurgently. The European Union offers comprehensivecooperation and the experience it has gained in this field.Disarmament policy  too  is preventive policy. Overthe past few years  major successes have been attained inthis field. These must now be made irreversible. TheSTART Treaties must be implemented quickly. In Europe the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces has proved tobe a milestone.Uncleared mines are amongst the worst legacies ofwar and civil war. We Europeans are in favour of theestablishment of a United Nations fund for mine-clearingand of more stringent provisions under international lawto protect civilian populations.The increasing proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  the continuing operation of unsafe nuclearplants and the smuggling of plutonium and other nuclearmaterials are among the new global dangers of our age.We must counter them at the national and global levels.We Europeans urgently appeal to North Korea to fulfil itsinternational obligations. We in the European Union arecommitted to the indefinite  unconditional extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. InGeneva  we want to arrive at a universal and universallyverifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. Ibelieve that it is also high time that consensus wasreached there on negotiations to bring about a ban on themanufacture of weapons-grade fissile material.The European Union  together with its partners  isproviding considerable funds for improving the safety ofnuclear plants in the neighbouring countries to our east.What happened at Chernobyl must never  ever berepeated. That would indeed be terrible.I appeal to all signatory States to ensure speedyratification and implementation of the chemical weaponsConvention at the national level in order for it quickly tobecome fully effective.The dangers I have just mentioned affect us all. Asthose dangers have a global dimension  action by theUnited Nations  too  is called for. At its summit meetingon 31 January 1992  the Security Council rightly statedthat the proliferation of all weapons of mass destructionconstitutes a threat to international peace and security.The United Nations  the Security Council and all of usmust resolutely shoulder our responsibility to overcomethese new threats.A fair balancing of interests through the ever-closerregional integration of States and ever-increasingcooperation between regions of our planet in the spirit ofArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations are thenecessary response to the huge economic  ecological andsocial challenges and the manifold ethnic conflicts we arefacing today - unfortunately  I might add. No one region18alone can master the global tasks confronting us. Nor canthe United Nations accomplish everything itself. Theburden on the United Nations can be substantially reducedwith the help of regional associations and cooperation. Weshould strive to achieve that objective.For Europe  the post-war era has finally reached anend. A few weeks ago  the last Russian soldiers leftGermany. Russian troops have also withdrawn from theBaltic States and other Eastern European countries. Nowthe aim must be to prevent new divides from emerging inEurope. The European Union will become not a ""FortressEurope"" but a Europe based on partnership and solidarity.The European Union is supporting the countries ofCentral and Eastern Europe on their way to democracy andthe establishment of market economies. The peoples in thereformist States fought for their freedom. We encouragedthem in their struggle and we will not now abandon them.We will gradually smooth their path towards theEuro-Atlantic institutions. It is important to mention thatthere will be no pan-European order of peace without oragainst Russia. The European Union has concludedpartnership and cooperation agreements with Russia andUkraine. The North Atlantic Alliance’s ""Partnership forPeace"" enhances Europe’s security.The CSCE  as a new instrument of conflict-prevention confidence-building and conflict resolution  can set anexample for other regions of the world. And it can  as aregional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the Charter relieve the United Nations as the guardian of peace. At theCSCE Summit in December the European Union will urge on the basis of a German-Dutch initiative  that the CSCE begiven priority in conflict settlement and prevention withinits area and that it be equipped accordingly.The European Union wants to further extend andtighten its network of regional cooperation. Transatlanticrelations with the United States and Canada remain thecornerstone of European policy. The Summit meetingbetween the European Union and the United States inBerlin in July this year confirmed our resolve to furtherstrengthen transatlantic relations.We are seeking closer relations with the countries ofAsia. In Germany a few days ago we discussed with theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) thepossibilities for even more intensive political and economiccooperation. We are following with interest ASEAN’sinitiative to launch a policy dialogue on security inSouth-East and East Asia  and I wish to emphasize theEuropean Union’s interest in and willingness to cooperatemore closely with the Asia-Pacific Economic CooperationCouncil (APEC).The European Council meeting in Corfu reaffirmedthat it attaches great importance to relations with thecountries of Latin America and with their regionalassociations. The institutionalized dialogue with the RioGroup has become for us an important element for theconsolidation of democracy and peace. We intend tobroaden the cooperation agreement with the States of theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).Through its policy on the Mediterranean  theEuropean Union will have made available a total ofroughly $9.6 billion between 1975 and 1996. Europeattaches great importance to security in theMediterranean.From the outset the European Union activelysupported the Middle East peace process  playing aleading role in international assistance for thedevelopment of the Palestinian economy and society.With the roughly $600 million earmarked for direct aidfrom 1994 to 1998  the European Union is thePalestinians’ largest international donor.Cooperation in southern Africa has made greatstrides. The course South Africa has embarked uponunder Nelson Mandela shows that it is possible for formeradversaries to be reconciled and to shape a commonfuture  given the necessary political will and wiseleadership. At the Berlin conference with the States ofthe Southern African Development Community (SADC)early this month the European Union initiated a newphase of cooperation with southern Africa.We in Europe want closer dialogue with theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on conflictprevention and security cooperation because we wantpartnership with the countries of Africa and thereby agreater United Nations peace-keeping capacity.Agreement on an agenda for development isbecoming ever more urgent. One billion people in thisworld are still living in absolute poverty. Globalexpenditure on arms still amounts to as much as theincome of half of the five and a half billion people on ourplanet.Poverty  increasing demographic pressure andirresponsible harming of the environment have made the19dangers to peace and stability greater  not smaller. TheConference on Environment and Development in Rio andthe International Conference on Population andDevelopment  which ended in Cairo a few days ago confirmed that there are no simple answers to globalproblems. The two conferences none the less sent out anencouraging signal: there is growing recognition that wemust tackle such problems together  and this I believe is avery important basis for the World Social Summit  whichwill be held next year in Denmark.In many countries women are still excluded fromactive participation in public life. We expect the WorldConference on Women  to be held in Beijing next year  toheighten awareness of this.In the Maastricht Treaty we Europeans for the firsttime made development policy an integral part of a treatysystem for Europe. We undertook to seek the sustainableeconomic and social development of the South  to promoteits integration into the global economy and to combatpoverty.Despite the huge budget difficulties facing its memberStates  the European Union has increased its developmentassistance from over $1 billion in 1988 to almost $3 billiontoday. Funds for emergency disaster relief and food aidwere increased to $1 billion this year. Even moreimportant than such financial transfers  however  is the taskof integrating the countries of the South into the worldeconomy. Without doubt  the conclusion of the UruguayRound improved the chances of growth for all Statesparticipating in world trade. The aim now must be for theTreaty to enter into force on 1 January 1995  as planned and for the newly-established World Trade Organization tocommence work.The treaty-based cooperation between the EuropeanUnion and the other regions of the world is designed tofurther liberalize world trade. Every region should be ableto participate in the European market. That is why wewant to complete the forthcoming review of Lomé IV including the new finance protocol  on time  and we areworking to achieve that end.Speaking here last year I suggested the developmentof an early detection capacity for environmental disasters indeveloping countries  and for the European Union I cantoday say this: World-wide energy consumption isincreasing  although the use of fossil fuels is alreadyendangering climatic stability. In particular  we  theindustrialized countries  therefore need a moreenvironment-friendly and resource-friendly attitude on thepart of producers and consumers and increased recyclingof raw materials. Reducing carbon dioxide emissionsmust be tackled as a matter of urgency.The destruction of the forests continues mercilessly.Soil erosion  loss of bio-diversity and impairedregeneration are the consequences. This destruction mustbe halted. We Europeans will seek better internationalcooperation in the United Nations for the sustainableutilization and protection of the forests. The UnitedNations is the guardian not only of peace  but also of theenvironment.The historian Arnold Toynbee was right when heconcluded that people are entirely capable of learningfrom disasters and finding responses to historicchallenges. Today we Europeans know that onlyintegration and cooperation lead to the desired goal  andthe international community’s response to the globalproblems is and has to be to strengthen the UnitedNations. Our central tasks for the future are: first  tosecure peace world-wide; secondly  to respect humanrights and the rule of law; and  thirdly  to create theconditions for lasting stability through economic andsocial development.Our common goal is to create a better world for all.But the determination with which we implement this goalin practice is the precondition for success against whichwe will be measured."
"45",1893,"DJI",49,1994,"It is a special pleasure andhonour for me to extend to my brother  Amara Essy  mydelegation’s warmest congratulations on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. He is a highly esteemed and valued friend tomany of us  and we can rest assured that his vastdiplomatic and political experience  coupled with hisproven leadership qualities  will guide this Assemblythrough a very productive and successful session.The Assembly is also most grateful for theexemplary and skilful manner in which AmbassadorInsanally successfully conducted the affairs of theforty-eighth session during his tenure as President.We must also recognize the dynamic and resourcefulmanner in which the Secretary-General has guided theSecretariat of the United Nations during this period ofmomentous internal and worldwide change. That theordinary citizens of the world and its many poor have ahumane and sensitive advocate in the halls of power ofthe United Nations is a great stabilizing factor. We wishthe Secretary-General well in his unending efforts to bringpeace and development to all corners of our troubledworld.As our Organization moves towards its fiftieth year there is an air of concern for the state of the world  its24people and the United Nations itself. Building upon ouremphasis last year on the rights of the individual  thepurview of the international community has expanded toencompass the right of the individual to a better economicand social life. The population Conference at Cairohighlighted the pressures of population on economic growthand development  and marked specific areas for action  withtargets and goals  and next year’s Copenhagen conferenceon social development will explore widespread poverty andunemployment  and the critical issue of social integration.We have come to realize that these problems cannot besolved in isolation by any of the principal actors - -individuals  States or even the international community.Only by cooperating and working together to reinforce thespecial attributes of each can we begin to arrest thepervasive social disintegration  endemic conflict and worlddisorder that threaten our security and our future.Fortunately  in the United Nations  whatever its limitations we have a truly international Organization at the centre ofall these issues  which needs only proper use andreinforcement to reverse these corrosive trends.As we review the developments of the past year in thelight of the triumphs and tragedies experienced by theworld body and by the international community  the picturewhich emerges is one of persistent conflict and pervasivepoverty. Happily  some perennial points of antagonism such as South Africa and Palestine  have witnessedextraordinary developments. For some  the dramatic accordbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) andIsrael  negotiated entirely by the Palestinians themselves continues to be viewed with a measure of astonishment.True enough  the accord will not satisfy everyone  andconditions remain on future progress  but after so manydecades of having a minimal voice in their destiny and ofpaltry changes in their condition  the Palestinians havemade the first real breakthrough towards a Palestinian State.Efforts towards political and democratic institutionalizationand administrative refinement  accompanied by widespreadpolitical participation and empowerment  are evolvingslowly and may demonstrate to the international communitythe level of support lent by Palestinians to the directionimplied by the accords. The substantial internationalassistance pledged and envisaged to underwrite the requisitestability and progress must be forthcoming in order to meetthe urgent needs of the Palestinian governing authority  andto achieve the goals of a functioning and efficientPalestinian entity.The Palestinians have suffered long and hard under aharsh and often difficult occupation  enduring numerousfalse starts and misdirected illusions. They have nowembarked on the road to self-determination and shouldreceive the total support of the international community.But the eventual realization of a full Palestinian Statemust be clear  and any measures tending to render theoccupied territories merely ""self administered"" Bantustans supplying labor to Israel’s more developed economy must be resisted by all means.Not only the continent of Africa  but the entire worldmust take pride in the remarkable progress unfolding inSouth Africa. Under the inspiring and extraordinaryleadership of President Mandela  South Africa hasbecome an exemplary model for the internationalcommunity of national reconciliation and unity. Duringthe recent dramatic period in its history  South Africa waslikewise fortunate to have had a visionary in the personof Mr. de Klerk  who was aware of the role of timing andrecognized the need for change. While there have beenmany players in the struggle against apartheid  certainlynone are more deserving of praise and recognition thanthe majority people of South Africa themselves. SouthAfrica cannot fail to appreciate that all of Africa  and infact the world  shares in its joy. We can only urgePresident Mandela and his country to continue to worktogether to advance the task of restructuring South Africaso that it truly realizes its undoubted greatness.By now the world is painfully aware of the fate ofRwanda  torn apart by sheer hatred and intolerance  byleaders bent upon exploiting ethnic differences for selfishgains. Employing all manner of fear  intimidation andpropaganda  they succeeded in stirring up nearly an entirepeople to turn against another  until the eventual humancarnage  in so compressed a time span  was no doubtunequalled in human history. Even now  the intransigentleadership of the millions of suffering Hutus  eking out abare existence in the volcanic soils of eastern Zaire or theother surrounding countries  refuses to acknowledge theplight of their people  dissuading them with threats andviolence from returning to their country. Their actionscannot be pardoned; the perpetrators of this insaneepisode must be brought to justice and punished.Otherwise  their implacable goal of rearming andreturning one day to the battle field promises a long nightof recurring horror for Central Africa. Regrettably  bypaying no heed to the early signs of pending troubles  andby seeking ways to severely limit its involvement  theworld body lost the opportunity to play a significant partin preventing this tragedy. Worse still  the difficulty inassembling and suitably equipping a United Nationspeace-keeping force has not helped to instil in those who25have fled the confidence needed to return  and in those whohave remained the confidence needed to stay.All this leaves the new Government of Rwanda in thethroes of a critical dilemma  requiring immeasurable soulsearching. For a country from which nearly one-third ofthe population has fled - in the case of Rwanda some 2million people - the numbers are so large anddisproportionate as to deny the Government a large measureof the legitimacy it badly needs. Something very seriousmust be done to bring the two peoples together inmeaningful national reconciliation  with a Government thatreflects this. Certainly the spirit and intent of the ArushaAccord remains even more valid today in the light of whathas taken place.Note must also be taken of the valiant efforts of theUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) facing terrible odds in a situation of such frightening chaos.Despite its small numbers  its attempts to alleviate thesuffering and protect the vulnerable undoubtedly savedmany lives and provided a measure of sanity in a sea ofmadness. The world body should recognize with pride andgreat appreciation what has been done by the personnel ofUNAMIR and its illustrious leader  General Romeo Dallaireof Canada.One reason for pessimism in Central Africa is the factthat many of the factors that led to breakdown in Rwandaare also present in Burundi. There the ominous rise inkillings  coupled with the accelerating pace of rearmament should cause extreme concern to the world community.With the army at the epicentre of power  and with weaponscalling the shots  so to speak  government and politics couldremain tense and unstable. However  we are stronglyencouraged by the recent indications of an emergingpolitical consensus  as evidenced by the installation of anew president. This is a positive trend which we hope willmanifest itself in all aspects of political  economic andsocial activity.The plights of Angola and Liberia are likewise grave;both are locked in a destructive state of shootingnegotiations. In both  the humanitarian situation is againregressing and a cease-fire is nowhere in sight; the gun isagain the preferred method of voting. Fortunately  progresstoward peace and an elected national Government is still onits course in Mozambique  where the leadership seems to beserious about ending the prolonged and destructive state ofconflict and engaging for the first time in building ademocratic State through national elections  scheduled forOctober this year.The United Nations Observer Mission inMozambique (UNOMOZ) is determined to fulfil alltargets and tasks on schedule and believes in theprospects of success for the people of Mozambique. ItsstrongIn Haiti  the long-anticipated internationalintervention  sanctioned in Security Council resolution940 (1994)  has taken place. A multinational force haspeacefully secured the country  thanks in large measure tothe good deal of prudence shown  and the intensediplomatic efforts undertaken  by the United States. Weare pleased that the junta has deemed it unwise to opposethe world  and instead has agreed to relinquish power inorder to facilitate the return of the democratically electedPresident  Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.In other areas  Djibouti remains saddened by thestatus quo in the bilateral discussions between the twoGulf neighbours  Iran and the United Arab Emirates concerning the three islands of Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunband Abu Musa. We believe there is an urgent need for arenewed and serious effort to resolve this dispute throughall possible peaceful avenues  including its referring it tothe International Court of Justice.Bosnia remains a high-profile internationalflashpoint. Despite the warning of dire consequences  theBosnian Serbs have rejected the final compromiseproposal of the five-nation Contact Group  which awardsthem 49 per cent of the country  over two-thirds of whichthey have taken by force. In the weeks since therejection  nothing has been done to punish the BosnianSerbs  as it had been intimated would be done. In fact the Serbs continue to apply consistent pressure on theBosnian Government and the United Nations  targetingSarajevo and its airport  blocking United Nations foodconvoys and strangling safe areas such as Srebrenica andGorazde. Even ""ethnic cleansing"" has resumed. Oneshudders to think what would have happened immediatelyif it had been the Muslim party that had rejected theproposal.This inaction reflects the blatant unwillingness of theinternational community to take any meaningful actionagainst the culprits  let alone punish them. This onlyencourages further intransigence. The Serb reaction todifficult situations consists in resorting to wild  radicalbehaviour  eliciting retreat and concessions by thepeacemakers. One can never say what they will dotomorrow  which means their word today has no intrinsicvalue. To have rewarded Belgrade with a loosening of26the sanctions in the absence of a viable and comprehensivepeace agreement or concrete proof of compliance is tomistake the form of this family dispute for its substanceperhaps because there is none. And what is the benefit forthe Bosnian Government  which agreed to the peace plan?Will steps be taken to remedy the onerous military andhumanitarian imbalance? Will Serbia-Montenegrorecognize Bosnia within its current borders or agree tocooperate with the International Tribunal? The propercourse of action  in the absence of any semblance of sanityand settlement  is to lift the arms embargo against theBosnian Government. What else?I would now like to address the question of Somalia.The return to a functioning civil society in Somalia is  ifanything  even more remote  as meaningful inter-factiontalks have ceased  security is evaporating  the dream ofnational reconciliation fading and the United NationsOperations in Somalia (UNOSOM) focused on the processof withdrawing. The only certainty in Somalia is politicaluncertainty. As a neighbour that has observed and knowsall too well Somalia’s convulsive history  Djibouti can onlybe distressed at the continuing problems and utterhopelessness.What is to be done? For too long the United Nationshas sought voluntary disarmament  conferences of nationalreconciliation  interim government and hopefully  in theend  a government elected by the people. Creating pressurefor this process is the looming departure of UNOSOMscheduled for 31 March 1995  when operations may beclosed down. Although we anticipate that the people willultimately have the final say through elections  at present itis the warlords and their factions that have been given acomprehensive veto. On the assumption that they are thepowers that be in Somalia  considerable time has been spentattempting to gain their agreement in the hope of eventuallyreaching the people through them. But clearly the factionleaders desire the political process to stop with themwithout flowing through to the people. So at their dooreverything stops  and the people are never given a say or aninput.The obvious plan of the faction leaders is undoubtedlyto induce the United Nations to believe conditions arepropitious for withdrawal and then to settle scores amongthemselves until someone is victorious. But in the process can we discount the possibility of a return to conditions ofstarvation and famine  the kind of Somalia that existed priorto the arrival of the United Nations? What will be theimmediate and long-term consequences or implications ofleaving Somalia in anarchy to the forlorn women  childrenand innocent population of Somalia and to its neighbours which are already weighed down under an incessant flowof refugees? Will there be a Somali State in the end?Perhaps yes  perhaps no. It is hard  however  to precludea positive eventuality  however far-fetched that may seemat present.Clearly  what is absent from the whole process is thevoice of the people in the selection of true  legitimateleadership and government to counter the presentabdication of power to bands of gun-holders. We mustfind ways of directly giving voice to the people  leadingstraight to legitimate government. Solidifying these stepswould then be the job of ample United Nations forces onhand  drawing upon this Organization’s experience inCambodia  Mozambique and elsewhere. Certainly  thethought of leaving Somalia with nothing in place and somany lives at risk is both abhorrent and unacceptable  acase where it will be interpreted that a ""failed State"" hasbeen abandoned by the United Nations. Walking out ofa society in a mess before reconstituting it as afunctioning entity will undeniably mark a precedent in thehistory of the United Nations and will certainly representa far cry from the hopes  promises and commitmentsenshrined in the Charter.Although I have briefly explored situations in anumber of world trouble spots  the sad fact is that othersappear to be gathering wind in their sails  ready to burstforth. Consequently  demands for expanded UnitedNations involvement can be expected to rise  and thequestion that must again be asked  based upon recentexperiences is: Could the Organization cope? More andmore we see peace-keeping patterns of an ad hoc nature struggling under the lack of equipment  logistics intelligence and manpower  poor coordination andcommunications. But the fault can hardly be laid at thefeet of the United Nations if its urgent requests formaterial and human resources are not met or are metslowly or inadequately. With no force or equipment ofits own  and therefore required to begin each operationfrom scratch  the resulting delays have severely hamperedtimely United Nations reaction - leading  for example  togenocide in Rwanda. And all this says nothing of thedifficulties stemming from ever-dwindling resources.Such a state of affairs must be a cause for concern as the United Nations will increasingly be forced to limitits responses to diplomatic initiatives  such as we haveseen in Haiti. In place of classic peace-keeping  we willwitness a growing reliance upon ad hoc multinationalintervention  the so-called posse response  but that too has27its limitations - for we are concerned with whether there isto be meaningful collective security. If United Nationspeace-keeping withers  and in its place we are forced torely on ad hoc interventions  then we need to ask underwhat basis that involvement will be forthcoming. In viewof these developing trends  the United Nations may beforced to rely more upon simply letting conflicts run theirnatural course  as in Somalia.What this situation amply demonstrates is that theUnited Nations needs a well-trained  mobile  standing forcewith rapid deployment capability. Delayed deployment ofundermanned and under-equipped units  as was the situationin Rwanda  fails to inspire confidence. The availability ofa rapid reaction force may at least address a good numberof probable conflict situations  often serving as a deterrentsimply by virtue of being in a position to act quickly.It is fashionable these days to say that we live in aninternational world  a ""global village"" in which nations canno longer avoid the effects of developments in theirneighbours or the world. For Djibouti  this fact has aparticularly telling impact  for we have been forced tograpple with the effects of years of past instability  warfareand massive national disintegration in the Horn of Africa as in Somalia at present. From the financially debilitatingincursion of heavily armed militia to the equally drainingcost of demobilization that we face right now; to the floodof refugees  the care and cost of which has overwhelmedour infrastructure and health  educational and housingservices; to the crippling loss of vital markets  as inSomalia  for our services; coupled with the devastationbrought by the seemingly unending drought and pestilence Djibouti has inevitably been slowly moving towardsnegative growth and development in the last few years.Yet  whatever the extent of our difficulties arisingfrom these circumstances  Djibouti has steadfastly sought toremain a good-neighbourly State  contributing  to the extentpermitted by our meagre resources  to regional stability andpeace efforts.Moreover  recognizing the need to further involve thepeople of Djibouti in the complex process of developmentand governance  we have an overhauled our politicalstructure and institutions.Still there remains a disturbing predicament facingDjibouti and other countries like it in the world  namelythat countries which are relatively stable  moderate anddemocratic and which are contributing  and participating ininternational efforts  to bring relief  reduce tensions  haltaggression and conflict tend to be overlooked by theinternational community. Despite the drain on ourmeagre resources because of refugees and market losses and despite our continuing positive contributions toregional and international peace efforts  it seems that thegeneral calm and freedom prevailing in my country arelulling the world into believing that there are no reallypressing concerns or needs or for assistance. Too often little attention too often is paid to a nation  it seems  untilit is too desperate and near collapse  or until it isperceived by the international community as a source ofnew danger to peace and security  thereby qualifying itfor aid and assistance. This makes little sense  and isindeed a mockery of the preventive measures that areoften-mentioned but seldom instituted. We deserve better but we remain quite confident that both our efforts andour urgent needs for critical resources will be recognizedby our friends and development partners.Djibouti  and all the countries of the Horn  havebeen subjected to the ravages of destructive naturalcauses  well beyond our individual power to cope withthem. Such is the inexorable drift of the Saharasouthward  or the severe drought conditions leading tofamine which now plagues the Horn. Overall  anestimated 20 million people are at risk in 10 countries facing farms that are parched  rivers that are dried up  andpestilence. Anticipating possible mass starvation resultingfrom the lack of rain and water  food stocks were madeready  only to be virtually depleted by a suddenemergency elsewhere  as in Rwanda. A pervasive air ofhopelessness and apprehension now grips the nations ofthe Horn  the urgency of which merits the immediateconcern and attention of the international community.Adding to the difficulties arising from natural causes nations just as often face social forces over which theyhave little control. Domestic macro-economic policies inmany industrialized countries  seeking to combat inflationor balance international payments  often have drasticeffects on the demand for third-world products and oncommodity prices. The result  as one analyst explains  isfrequently declining terms of trade  sharply increasedinterest rates  reduced exports  massive increases incurrent account deficits  interest and debt-servicepayments  all at a time of reduced aid and other capitalflows. External payment restraints  in particular  haveaffected levels of domestic production in both industrialand agricultural sectors  at times even production forexport  leading to inflation  acute financial crises andmounting debt.28Many third world countries simply lack the economiccapacity and flexibility to react in the short term. In thelong run  everyone benefits from greater coherence andefficiency in the international economic system. Clearly theworld’s economic and financial system requires much moreorder  predictability  coordination and fairness.Along these lines  I feel it is imperative to refer againto the issue of the restructuring and revitalization of theUnited Nations in the economic  social and related fields -in particular the relevant General Assembly resolutionsbearing particularly on the vital field of operationalactivities for development  and the General Assembly’simportant coordinating role. As the most trulyrepresentative body of the world’s people and States  theGeneral Assembly needs to return to its original role ascontemplated by the founding Member States and set forthin the Charter. It must provide a more decisive lead instrategy and policy  in reviewing  in critiquing andapproving the operation of the total system.Likewise  as opposed to the extreme decentralizationcurrent in United Nations economic activities andinstitutions - each one a separate entity unto itself  often atcross purposes - we must also return to the original roleforeseen in the Charter for the Economic and SocialCouncil as an economic security council. The Economicand Social Council must remain open to receive andaddress the concerns of Africa  which should not behampered in its effective and beneficial participation in theCouncil and its subsidiary bodies. In this regard  wewelcomed the Secretary General’s report ""An Agenda forDevelopment"" which provided the opportunity for acomprehensive review of world economic and socialproblems  particularly in Africa. Africa’s developmentconcerns have been well documented in General Assemblyresolution 48/214 on the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s  which we hopecan serve as a basis on which the international communitycan act in solidarity in mobilizing new and additionalresources to solve the pressing problems of the poor. Forif we are to address constructively the questions ofeconomic growth and development  of the formulation oftruly beneficial international macro-economic systems  weneed to begin to take those confidence- building measuresthat will bring the North and the South closer andstrengthen the concept of partnership.In the area of collective security  there remainsthe imperative need to expand the Security Council and tomake it more transparent and democratic through anincrease in its membership and by making it moreaccountable to the General Assembly. There should beperiodic reviews of the Council’s structure and functionsin line with international developments. A more equitablegeographical representation is critical  along with anincrease in permanent representation for developingcountries."
"46",1915,"DMA",49,1994,"Mr. President  permit me to extend my delegation’scongratulations to you and your country  Côte d’Ivoire  onthe occasion of your election to the high office of thepresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. There is absolutely no doubt in mymind that with your proven diplomatic skills andconsiderable experience the affairs of the General Assemblywill be conducted in a manner that will redound to thecredit of this institution. At the same time I must expressmy delegation’s heartfelt appreciation and thanks to yourimmediate predecessor in office  Ambassador SamuelInsanally  for the competence which he demonstrated in thedischarge of his duties. His commendable performance isa source of pride to me as it is to all citizens of theCaribbean region.(spoke in French)I am very happy that we are here with you today Sir.(spoke in English)While the maintenance of peace and security remainsthe main objective of the United Nations  the globalenvironment  the widening gap between rich and poornations  the failure of the ill-defined new world order tomaterialize  and the forces released by the ending of thecold war present the Organization with new problems andchallenges. As regional conflicts erupt  the consequentialincrease in the number of displaced persons and refugeesexerts greater pressure on the United Nations peace-keeping apparatus at a time when its available resourcesare already severely taxed. It is imperative  therefore that the United Nations continue with its restructuringprogramme and with those initiatives calculated toincrease efficiency  reduce costs  and enhance thecapability of the Organization to achieve desirable results.However  cost-effectiveness  commendable as that maybe  should not be at the expense of those worthwhileprogrammes designed to benefit small developing nations.We firmly believe that the United Nations has thecapacity to maintain those programmes while it strivessimultaneously to exercise the necessary budgetaryrestraints.The ethnic and tribal conflicts in the formerYugoslavia and Rwanda and the reported acts of genocideand other atrocities are troubling and must exercise theminds and hearts of human beings everywhere. Theinternational community cannot appear to condone suchreprehensible acts  and appropriate measures must betaken to punish those responsible. Accordingly  Dominicaunhesitatingly supports the establishment of internationaltribunals for the trial and punishment of those personsfound guilty of crimes against humanity.The Commonwealth of Dominica supports theindefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and as we lookforward optimistically to a nuclear-free world we callupon all nations possessing weapons of mass destructionto join in a cooperative effort to reduce and finally toeliminate those weapons from the face of the Earth. Wemust also express concern at the apparent unwillingnessof the international community to stem the increase in therate of production of conventional arms of increasingsophistication and potential for destruction. Acquired in11many instances by third world nations  ostensibly tomaintain secure borders and deter aggression  theseweapons very often become effective instruments ofinternal repression and the cause of national and regionalinstability. Time after time the United Nations is calledupon to expend its limited resources in repairing thedamage and in alleviating the consequential suffering andmisery. We are consistent in maintaining that a reorderingof priorities is called for and that a slight shifting ofresources away from the acquisition of unnecessary arsenalsand into development programmes would result intremendous social and economic benefits to the citizens ofmany developing countries.In many countries human rights abuses occur on adaily basis. Dominica’s respect for human rights and itscommitment to ensure that the rights of every citizen areprotected cannot be questioned. It is in keeping with thatcommitment that the Commonwealth of Dominica applaudsthe establishment of the Office of the High Commissionerfor Human Rights and will support efforts to make thatOffice and the Centre for Human Rights effectiveinstruments in the promotion and protection of humanrights. We believe  however  that in the discharge of hisresponsibilities the task of the High Commissioner wouldbe significantly strengthened if the United Nations GeneralAssembly were to abandon its present selectivecondemnation of human rights abuses. Human rightsabuses should be condemned wherever and whenever theyoccur and no nation should be permitted to take comfortfrom the fact that its violation of human rights covenantswill escape the glare of publicity and the strictures of theinternational community.The readmission of a democratic  non-racial SouthAfrica to the United Nations on 23 June 1994 is a sourceof tremendous pleasure for my delegation and a tribute tothe many persons and organizations  both inside and outsidethe United Nations  who worked so tirelessly in the longand hard struggle to put an end to the pernicious system ofapartheid. The majority of the people of South Africa mustbe congratulated on their sustained effort and determination as well as on their conciliatory attitude which augurs wellfor the new South Africa. Above all we must congratulateand applaud the President  Mr. Nelson Mandela  and hisSecond Deputy President  Mr. de Klerk  on the courage considerable skill and political enlightenment which theyjointly and effectively harnessed in reaching anaccomplishment that may eventually be regarded as amodel for the world. The journey has only just begun.Many difficulties lie ahead but there are reasons to beoptimistic. With the assistance and support of theinternational community South Africa will succeed.The progress that has been made in the bilateralnegotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in theMiddle East is heart-warming indeed. With the first stepshaving been taken on the road to Palestinian autonomy inthe West Bank and Gaza  and with the signing of theaccord between Jordan and Israel  there appears to be anexcellent opportunity for an eventual resolution of theconflict that has plagued that region for too long.Optimism must be tempered with caution  however. Theimplementation of the accords and full realization ofPalestinian autonomy will depend for their success ongenerous financial support  both private and public. Andwhile the United Nations must not be intrusive  its interestin seeing that the legitimate hopes  aspirations andsecurity needs of the people of the area are realizedimposes upon it a duty to continue to be seized with thesubject-matter and to continue to monitor the process andthe progress towards a full and just peace in the MiddleEast.In different forums and at various times sinceSeptember 1991  the Commonwealth of Dominica hasconsistently called for the ousting of the military regimein Port au Prince  the return of President Aristide to Haitiand the restoration of democracy and the rule of law tothat country. For three years the military leaders in Haitihave authorized  encouraged and condoned brutal acts ofrevenge and wanton violence against the citizens of Haitiand have continued to exercise governmental power indefiance of world opinion. They temporized by enteringinto the Governors Island Agreement  which they laterfailed to honour. Their intransigence and unreliability ledthe Security Council to conclude that the unique characterof the situation in Haiti required an exceptional responseand that there was need for the use of all necessary meansto facilitate the departure from Haiti of the militaryleaders and the prompt return of the legitimately electedPresident.Faced with the prospect of having to confront anoverwhelming multinational force  the military leadershave finally decided to step down  and while recentevents give reason for pause  the prospect of therestoration of democracy to Haiti seems decidedlybrighter than at any time in the last 36 months. When theHaitian people were the victims of officially sanctionedbrutality and violence  we felt their pain. When PresidentAristide returns  we will rejoice with them. We wish theHaitian people well  and we will do whatever we can to12assist in their efforts to attain that measure of freedom thatcan come only from a government established ondemocratic principles. President Aristide is devoted toHaiti and the well-being of Haitians. We must support himand encourage him in this daunting and lonely task that hehas undertaken for his people.However  as friends of the Haitian people  we pleadwith them to understand that democracy cannot be imposedfrom outside; it can only develop from a genuine desire ofthe people of Haiti of all persuasions. A politicalenvironment of intense hatred and passionate desire forrevenge is not fertile ground for a young and fragiledemocracy. Success in their new endeavour will requirethat nobility of spirit that seeks the path of reconciliationand trust and eschews vengeance and recriminations. Noone can pretend that the task will be easy  but the followingexcerpt from a speech delivered by Archbishop DesmondTutu at the commemoration of the Day of the African Childon 16 June 1994 might be instructive to the Haitian people.Speaking of his beloved South Africa  the venerablearchbishop said:“The Minister of Justice of South Africa was detainedseveral times. He suffers from a heart condition. Thesecurity forces tried to kill him by swapping histablets. Today he is writing  drafting the legislationfor an amnesty to forgive the security forces thatwanted to kill him. If it can happen in a South Africawhere it is said the problem is so intractable  nocountry in the world can ever again have an excusefor not being able to resolve its problem. God issaying  I set before you South Africa as a paradigm.This is how it can be done. There is hope for theworld when South Africa can become as it hasbecome.”We are in accord with Archbishop Tutu  and we are firmlyof the view that if it can be done in South Africa it can andmust be done in Haiti.The exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwanfrom membership in this body and from participation in theactivities of its various agencies continues to be of concernto us. It appears incongruous to us that an industrialcountry of 21 million people with a democraticGovernment  with full membership in the AsianDevelopment Bank  the Asia-Pacific Economic CooperationForum  the Pacific Basin Economic Council and the PacificEconomic Cooperation Council  and with the capacity tomake meaningful and worthwhile contributions to theactivities of the United Nations is denied membership wheneveryone agrees that it exercises sovereign authority overa defined geographical area. On the principle ofuniversality alone  the request of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan for membership in the United Nations isjustifiable. We do not believe that the admission of theRepublic of China on Taiwan precludes eventualunification. On the contrary  in our view it is likely tohelp the process along  and no one can pretend thatparallel representation stands in the way. The citizens ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan deserve to be accordedthose rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens of allsovereign States  and the commonwealth of Dominicaadvocates and supports the admission of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan to full membership in the UnitedNations.We are gratified that the participants at theInternational Conference on Population and Developmentin Cairo have wisely arrived at a consensus that givessupport to the view that  in the words of onecommentator  ""sustainable development cannot be realizedwithout the full engagement and complete empowermentof women"". That proposition has long beenacknowledged and incorporated into our decision-makingprocesses  to the extent that today women have equalaccess to education at all levels and gender equalitymanifests itself in all facets of life in Dominica. Werealize that the plan of action requires increased spendingon social programmes for its viability  and it is hoped thatat the Conference in Copenhagen in 1995  participantsfrom donor and recipient countries will arrive at areasonable formula in that regard.We support the establishment of the World TradeOrganization and the liberalization of trade practices  butwe need to remind the international community thatfragile economies of small island states can be easilydestroyed if free trade does not embody that measure offairness necessary for their survival. We require that thelarger and economically successful States be mindful ofthe need for poor small States to survive. The recentformation of the Association of Caribbean States will  wehope  provide a framework for increased trade among theStates in the area and enhance the capability of the regionin its search for ways to reach beneficial accommodationwith more powerful trading groups in the hemisphere.We look forward to the forthcoming Summit of theAmericas and the proposed frank and detailedexamination of such issues as the hemispheric integration13process - including a hemispheric free trade zone - the roleof multilateral financial institutions  sustainabledevelopment  and resource flows and debt in hemisphericdevelopment. We hope that out of that gathering will comenot only a keener appreciation of the vulnerabilities of thesmaller States in the region but also a greater impetus forcollaboration on matters of regional trade and development.After 49 years  its imperfections notwithstanding  theUnited Nations remains the world’s greatest deliberativebody and mankind’s greatest hope for survival in areasonably well-ordered and peaceful global community.As the United Nations prepares to celebrate its fiftiethanniversary  we need to place on record our recognition ofits many worthwhile accomplishments  and we hope that itwill continue in its search for new and innovative ways tomeet the challenges of the future."
"47",1958,"DNK",49,1994,"The unique role of theUnited Nations is to promote the well-being of people  thesecurity and development of nations and the protection ofour common world. It was built on a resolve to maintainpeace and security and to employ international machineryfor the promotion of the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples.The United Nations peace-keeping activities are achallenge for all nations. For Denmark  it is a matter ofthe highest priority. The United Nations can rely onDenmark to respond swiftly and efficiently to the needsof the Organization for troops  civilian police  customsofficials and personnel for humanitarian relief operations.We have made organizational arrangements to make thispossible  even at very short notice. A recent example isDenmark’s decision to contribute civilian personnel toengage in a humanitarian effort and to promote humanrights in Haiti.We favour a combination of peace-keepingoperations with humanitarian relief operations. The16establishment of the United Nations stand-by forces willenhance the ability to respond quickly to emerging crises.Denmark is ready to participate with further elements andis establishing an international brigade for that purpose.Peace-keeping has its own special features. They aredifferent from traditional military training. Peace-keepersmust consistently act in full accordance with their role andmandate. As has recently been said  patience  persistenceand pressure are key elements of peace-keeping missions.Seventy-three nations today contribute troops  militaryobservers or civilian police to the many ongoing operations.The number of troop-contributing nations is increasing.This has placed emphasis on the need for training.Denmark stands ready to share its vast experience andknowledge in peace-keeping training and requirements.The cooperation between the Baltic States  the Nordiccountries and the United Kingdom on a Balticpeace-keeping battalion is a good example of suchcooperation. At present  a Lithuanian platoon is serving inthe Danish battalion in Croatia.Keeping the peace worldwide is costly. Funds arelimited  as is the number of trained and equipped troops.In the future we must utilize preventive diplomacy. InMacedonia  we have seen the positive effects of the firstexample of preventive deployment.Communication between the Security Council and thetroopcontributing countries is imperative. Further progressis needed on this  for instance in the form of regularconsultations between the members of the Security Council the troop-contributing States and the Secretariat.Peace-keeping involves the important question ofsafety and security for United Nations and associatedpersonnel. Peace-keepers act as a neutral force. They mustbe ensured the highest possible standard of protection.Attacks cannot be tolerated. We strongly support theefforts of the United Nations to draft a legally bindingtreaty in this field.The ""Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) led to discussionson a more active role of the United Nations in peacemakingand peace-keeping. It is to be hoped that the ""Agenda forDevelopment"" (A/49/935) will inspire an equally importantdiscussion on the role of the United Nations indevelopment. Development policies must correspond toprevailing social  economic  environmental  religious andethnic problems.We cannot fight tomorrow’s battles with yesterday’sweapons.My Government is proud to host the World Summitfor Social Development in Copenhagen in March 1995.The challenge of the Summit  the first of its kind  is tocreate new foundations of peace through development. Itpresents a unique chance to overcome the North-Southdivide through new approaches. We must eradicatepoverty and enable all people to earn a livelihood. Wemust promote social integration by fostering just  safe andstable societies with the full participation of all people.Discrimination in all its forms must be eliminated andhuman rights respected  and conditions for children andyoung people must be improved.As a link to the Beijing Conference on Women  theSummit must make a strong commitment to achieving fullequality between men and women and to enhancing thecontribution of women to social progress anddevelopment.Progress has been achieved in the preparatoryprocess for the Summit  but this process is still marked bydifficulties. Time for preparation is running short. TheSecretary-General is making untiring efforts to promotethe Copenhagen Summit and to secure its success. It isessential that Member States support theSecretary-General in his endeavours in order to keep upthe momentum of the process. The Summit represents anopportunity for world leaders to commit themselves andtheir Governments to a better and more just world.Members may rest assured that  as hosts of theSummit  we will spare no effort to make it a success.We are very much looking forward to welcoming Headsof State or Government in Copenhagen.The World Conference on Human Rights in 1993was a turning-point in United Nations activities for thepromotion and protection of human rights. It is gratifyingto see one of its central recommendations implemented inthe form of the establishment of the post of HighCommissioner for Human Rights. Steps should now betaken to increase substantially the resources for the UnitedNations human rights programme. We must enable theHigh Commissioner to discharge his mandate in full.Human rights are a vital element in preventing andresolving conflicts. We must therefore develop newapproaches to monitoring human rights. One such step17could be to set up a team of human rights monitors to assistthe High Commissioner.Freedom of expression is a basic human right. Thefatwa against Salman Rushdie and others constitutes aflagrant violation of this right. We urge the IranianGovernment to dissociate itself from this threat.Increasingly we realize that our actions or ournegligence as individual nations affect other nations andtheir populations. All nations have a common future thatwe must protect from nuclear disasters  environmentaldegradation and weapons of mass destruction.Chernobyl taught us how important this aspect ofsecurity is. It is of great concern to my Government thatmany nuclear facilities in Central and Eastern Europe andthe Commonwealth of Independent States are operating atcritically low levels of safety. We must improve thissituation.The Rio de Janeiro Conference in 1992 put renewedemphasis on environment and development. Denmark’sresolve to abide by the Rio principles is strong. Ourinternational development assistance of 1 per cent of grossnational product (GNP) is guided by the principles ofsustainable development. This will provide additionalfinancial resources to developing countries and countries intransition in order to assist them in meeting objectives ofsustainability.Our common future also calls for taking steps towardsdisarmament  arms control and confidence-buildingmeasures. It implies reducing weapons of mass destruction chemical and biological weapons as well as weapons to beused in outer space. We have reached a time that isconducive to these aims and to allowing the role of theUnited Nations to be enhanced.Reform of the United Nations is necessary. Denmarksupports a strong Security Council. We agree that theCouncil needs to be adapted to today’s world and that itneeds to be enlarged. In enlarging the Council  priorityshould be given to additional seats for non-permanentmembers  allocated under the principle of equitablegeographical distribution. A small number of new seatscould be allocated as permanent seats.We entrust the United Nations with mandates to secureworldwide peace  security and development  but we fail toensure the Organization the necessary financial means. Itis not tenable  for instance  that troop-contributing nationscannot be reimbursed  and I simply fail to understandhow some Member States can advocate United Nationsactions  including peace-keeping operations  and thenrefuse to pay the bill.Denmark welcomes the withdrawal of the last troopsof the former Soviet Union from Estonia and Latvia on31 August  in accordance with concluded agreements.This is truly a historic event. It is of significance tofuture relations between the Baltic States and Russia  tostability in the Baltic area and for European security. Theagreements must now be fully implemented by all partiesin order to keep up the momentum.As for the former Yugoslavia  important results havebeen reached since the establishment of the ContactGroup. The decision by the authorities of the formerRepublic of Yugoslavia to close the Serbian-Bosnianborder and to accept international surveillance is a directconsequence of pressure by the international community.The continued negative reaction to the peace plan ofthe Bosnian Serbs must lead to their further isolation.Sanctions remain one of the most efficient instruments inour policy of isolation. We therefore welcome theadoption of resolution 942 (1994) by the Security Councillast week.Against that background  we welcome the deferral ofthe question of lifting the arms embargo. Denmark firmlybelieves that the arms embargo should not be lifted  asthis would entail risks of the conflict’s spreading. Itwould disrupt the peace negotiations  which combine theefforts of the United Nations  the European Union  theUnited States and Russia  and it would make thecontinued presence of the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) impossible.UNPROFOR is playing an indispensable role inattempting to keep the peace and at the same timealleviate the plight of the people. With 1 400 troops civilian police and monitors in the former Yugoslavia Denmark is one of the largest troop contributors toUNPROFOR. We remain committed to our participationin this operation.We believe that a strict and effective sealing off ofthe border between Serbia and Montenegro and Bosniaand Herzegovina will be a new and decisive element. Atshort notice Denmark sent observers for the Mission ofthe International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia(ICFY) to monitor that border.18Denmark continues to make substantial contributionsto the humanitarian relief work in the former Yugoslavia.Coordination by the United Nations and the EuropeanUnion is progressing favourably. Denmark is placing bothpersonnel and financial means at the disposal of thatenterprise.We strongly condemn the renewed ""ethnic cleansings""which the Serbs have systematically carried out. Thepersons responsible for these atrocities must be broughtbefore the international tribunal set up for the punishmentof crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.In the Middle East political will and hard negotiationshave created a historic breakthrough. Denmark warmlywelcomes the signing of the Declaration of Principlesbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO) in 1993 and the Declaration signed between Israeland Jordan in 1994. The Gaza-Jericho Agreement was thenext important step. International support is now needed tokeep up the momentum.The holding of fair and free elections in Gaza and theWest Bank will represent significant progress. Weencourage the Palestinian Authority and the IsraeliGovernment to ensure speedy implementation of theelection process.Progress should also be achieved in the negotiationsbetween Syria and Israel and between Lebanon and Israel.We welcome the clear political will of all parties tocontinue their efforts to bring about such progress. Theyall stand to gain significantly from peace  and the UnitedNations continues to have an important role to play.The tragic events in Rwanda revealed the weakness ofthe United Nations and of the international community. Itwas demonstrated that we were not able to provide aneffective and timely response. The challenge remains tocreate stability and ensure Rwanda the proper conditions fordevelopment. This will require an international effort on aconsiderable scale  which can be successful only if it isfirmly rooted in Rwanda and the countries of the region.On the African scene it is heartening to see theRepublic of South Africa reinstated in its seat in theAssembly. It is now fully participating in the work of theUnited Nations. South Africa has proved to the world thata peaceful transition from repression to democracy ispossible. It has set an example. This also confirms thatthe United Nations has a role to play in bringing aboutfundamental reforms in a repressive society.Denmark has been a staunch supporter of the forcesof democratic change in South Africa. We will continueour considerable financial support to the consolidation ofdemocracy.The best contribution of Member States to theUnited Nations is to reconfirm their will to implement theCharter  to accelerate the reform process and  indeed  topay their dues. The United Nations is  and must continueto be  a vital instrument in the service of the peoples ofthe world."
"48",2003,"DOM",49,1994,"On behalf of the DominicanRepublic and its Constitutional President  Mr. JoaquinBalaguer  I offer to the President of the General Assemblyat its forty-ninth session  Mr. Amara Essy  Minister forForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire  our congratulations on hiswell-deserved election.Likewise  our delegation pays a tribute of gratitude toAmbassador Samuel Insanally  for his stewardship of thework of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and  especially  to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has dedicated allhis time and effort to ensuring full observance of thepurposes and principles enshrined in the United NationsCharter.My Government’s policy towards the pressing need fordevelopment is exemplified by the urgent efforts it ismaking on behalf of its people in the changing context oftoday’s world.Forty-nine years ago  when the United Nations systemwas created following the end of a second major world-wide conflagration  the idea and hope prevailed of bringingabout a new world order that would exorcize the spectre ofwar and  once and for all  do away with war’s attendanthuman degradation and hatred.However  the victorious emergence of twoideologically opposed Powers led to the creation of abipolar international system that gave birth to the so-calledcold war  marked by lateral confrontation and an arms racewhich  because of the ever-present possibility of directconfrontation  could have led to a nuclear holocaust and theannihilation of mankind.Thus it was that the General Assembly became thestage par excellence for the airing and debate of the mosturgent world-wide problems. While its politicaleffectiveness may not have met all the requirements ofpeace because of the structure of world power that hadprevailed since 1945  it did achieve overwhelming successin the actions and programmes of its specialized agencies.Born to foster peace and security and to promotedevelopment  the United Nations was the fruit of the post-Second-World-War era. At that time peace meant theabsence of war and of the justifiable fear of world-wideself-destruction.The hope for a renewed international order based onnew values has gained momentum. Unique andmonumentaL events symbolized by the razing of the ""wallof infamy"" have created the propitious conditions andopportunities for recapturing and relaunching the loftygoals of the signers of the San Francisco Charter.Those events summon us to struggle for a worldbuilt on solidarity  respect for the self-determination ofpeoples  and the quest for a better standard of living forall.A new world and its agonizing challenges requirenew answers and clear and unambiguous objectivescombined with an iron will to achieve them. The humanbeing must be at the centre of all concerns. Our effortsmust thus be aimed at combating poverty and achievingsocial justice. We must foster new democratic ways forthe exercise of power and genuine respect for humanrights. In other words  we must ensure that democracyworks  prospers and prevails.Unquestionably  the present-day world is beset byeconomic and political complexities incompatible with theaspirations of people everywhere to a decent life.Globalization of the economy  intense financialcompetition  national cultural diversity  and the varioustensions between groups  countries and regions  typifiedby the ethnic and religious regional conflicts of recentyears  constitute the features of the new reality.The answers to these challenges and problems are nolonger to be found in the use of arms. They lie in thewill to build a consensus and in the ability to promotedevelopment through fair competition regulated by rulesthat are accepted by all participants.Unless world peace is at stake  the threat or use offorce is no longer a viable instrument for achieving thedecent life to which all peoples are entitled.11How  then  can we defend democracy and ensure that rather than perish  it becomes stronger and more effectivein dealing with starvation  unemployment  drug trafficking the depletion of natural resources  forced migration and thenew forms of trade protectionism that underminedevelopment?If  indeed  we are to protect human rights andstrengthen democracy  we must undertake a thoroughreview of this whole issue and of the very concept ofdevelopment on the basis of equitable access to markets capital and new technologies.The Dominican Republic is one of the most solid anddeeply rooted democracies on the American continent. Itis one of the few Latin American democracies in moderntimes with a record of lasting and commendable politicalstability. It is an example of harmonious and civilizedcoexistence in a society marked by contrasts. We haveshown to the world that our democracy is participatory with reconciliation and dialogue as the channels for thesolution of the major political and economic crises that wehave experienced.In the economic arena  global interdependence poseschallenges  and yet offers opportunities. We must thereforemake progress in harmonizing financial  technological andproduction policies in order to achieve growth at all levels.The development of the most industrialized nationsmay be inadequate without the growth of developingnations. The greatest growth in outlets for the commoditiesof industrialized countries will be found in the markets ofdeveloping countries.We are witnessing a transition towards tradeliberalization that can lead to freer trade and the eradicationof poverty through the creation of more and better jobs.However  certain threats appear on the horizon. Oneof them is neoprotectionism. Even though the ""barbed-wire"" hostility of former protectionist tariffs is beingdismantled  the re-emerging protectionism may not be basedon tariffs  but it conceals certain invisible  yet genuineenemies: environmental regulations  customs barriers quotas  anti-""dumping"" rules  social clauses and others. Inthis way the aspirations to free trade may become mererhetoric.Impoverishment is another threat. Are we fully awarethat opening up our economies can cause us to overlook theneed to properly administer their attendant social costs?Unemployment and the acceleration of socialinvestment plans threaten to negate the efforts we havemade over many years to democratize our politicalsystems. While the formation of economic blocs is anestablished fact  it gives us pause nevertheless: To whatextent might this phenomenon constitute a stumblingblock for a world based on the democratic rules of freetrade and on equal conditions for all?As members know  more emphasis is placed onselling than on producing. However  we do not haveadequate means of production or fair access to them; yetwe are supposed to compete on an equal basis with themore industrialized countries of the world. These are notinvalid complaints and claims. New rules must beworked out to permit developing countries to gain accessto technology and finance their infrastructures onfavourable terms - in other words  to attain practical andacceptable levels of competitiveness.How can we meet these new challenges? To beginwith  any development policy must attempt to modernizeour sources of production. If we have little or nothing tosell  what is the point of continuing to open up ourmarkets? This is closely linked to the development of aproper transport and communication infrastructure and tothe optimum use of energy sources.We must thus create new conditions of productivity particularly in the fields of technology socialdevelopment. If human beings are to be the focus of alldevelopment policy  the fostering of effective programmesbecomes the best possible business. An investment inhealth  education and housing is profitable not onlysocially but economically.All these initiatives and actions to meet the newchallenges that stem from the globalization of theeconomy must be viewed in that context. Therefore weneed a new kind of cooperation  which must be thekeynote of international activities. Among other things we must adjust national policies to global objectives. Weshould be able to achieve a new idea of cooperation.Cooperation is the alternative to intervention  the way tofulfil the international community’s desires for peace stability and democracy.In this new age  we must be keenly aware of thetrends that are shaping the end of this century and thebeginning of the next. The world is becoming smaller more interdependent and globalized; the survival ofhuman life is gravely threatened by the deterioration of12the environment and by short-sighted  uncoordinatedpolicies to stem the tide of problems besetting the planet.We in the Dominican Republic  have our share ofproblems  but one stands out: we live geographically nextdoor to the poorest nation of the hemisphere. Haiti haswritten glorious pages in the history of the struggle forfreedom and equality. Its past  heavy with confrontationand long periods of authoritarian rule  has unfortunatelyturned it into a nation requiring international assistance.There must therefore be a determined and generous showof cooperation on the part of the international communityso that the Haitian people may pursue its destiny -economic and social  as well as political. The DominicanRepublic has always been ready to cooperate in effectiveinitiatives for the betterment and viability of needycountries  whose peoples have every right to live in dignity with all the opportunities offered to others.The problem of drug trafficking and narcoticsconsumption continues to be a scourge of world-widedimensions. It is the Dominican Republic’s State policy todeal most severely  in keeping with our legal provisions with the trafficking  consumption and possession of narcoticdrugs. What is more  our country has offered  and willcontinue to offer  its cooperation to other nations in theapprehension  prosecution or extradition of those who havemade this criminal trade the most lucrative activity of ournew times.Although the developed countries are the mostattractive market for the sale of narcotic drugs  theunderdeveloped countries  whether or not they areproducers of narcotic drugs  have seen an increase in drugaddiction too. The entire international community mustcontinue resolutely to deal with this scourge so that drugabuse does not become the side effect of a seductivelyexcessive well-being or the amnesia-inducing product thathelps some to cope with poverty.The Dominican Republic  a nation of pacifisttraditions  will continue to support the efforts of the UnitedNations in preventing armed conflicts and in theestablishment  maintenance and consolidation ofinternational peace and the internal peace of all nations.In another field of endeavour  the Dominican Republicretains the concern voiced at last year’s session of theAssembly on the proposal made by the Secretary-Generalto merge the United Nations International Research andTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women(INSTRAW) and the United Nations Development Fund forWomen (UNIFEM). INSTRAW was conceived at the firstWorld Conference of the International Women’s Year held in Mexico City  and was created pursuant to thedecision of the Economic and Social Council.The Dominican Republic takes this occasion toreiterate its request that INSTRAW and UNIFEM not bemerged. We also request retention of the commitmentsentered into under Economic and Social Councilresolution 1998/LX  of 12 May 1976  which establishesthe permanent headquarters of INSTRAW in theDominican Republic  so that our great city in theAmericas may continue to host that important organ.We are deluding ourselves if we think that peace security and development can be pursued as separategoals at either the national level or the international level.The new order and new balance that are coming intobeing call for new ways of thinking and new priorities.They require a reappraisal of current international realitiesin the light of established norms with regard to thesovereignty of all nations and recognition of the pluralismof the world’s peoples.The new era demands that confrontation turn intodialogue and that calls for justice be replaced by sharedcommitments of peoples.The promising  peaceful future of which we allspeak in meetings and assemblies will come about if above all  we  the Governments of our region  do our bit without haggling or imposing conditions  according to ourmaterial and leadership potential."
"49",2050,"DZA",49,1994,"Sir  your election to preside over the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly is a timely tribute to youroutstanding professional and human qualities. It alsoreflects the high regard in which your sister country  Côted’Ivoire  is held due to the sagacity and level-headednesswhich it has shown in rising to the challenges of its19national destiny and in performing its role on the regionaland international levels. Your election is also a tribute toour continent  Africa  which this year sent to theinternational community a message of hope through theemergence of the united  democratic and non-racial SouthAfrica  which was solemnly welcomed to our ranks here afew months ago.Your predecessor  Ambassador Samuel Insanally added to his prestigious career an outstanding performancein discharging his mandate  effectively and authoritatively.To him we extend our best wishes in his future activities inthe service of Guyana  the Third World and theinternational community as a whole.To the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  I should like to reiterate Algeria’ssupport of his efforts to strengthen the role of ourOrganization as the crucible for international action towardpeace and development.As we move toward the end of a century which hasmade us aware of the global threats to peace  we stand inneed of a collective response  a new kind of politicalthinking and an elucidation of the stakes involved in orderfor us to better grasp the challenges that face thecommunity of nations today.Given the heterogeousness of players and thecomplexity of strategies  the present global disorder seemsto be shaping a new order of things wherein the variousstrategic  economic  political  cultural  social and ecologicalspheres tend to move closer together. This means that inthe highly fluctuating and fluid situation of the world inwhich we now live  the international order makes it moredifficult to coordinate the practices of States and is forcingimprovisation and an absence of logic on the initiatives ofthe international community. Hence the internationalorder’s penchant to find balance only in heavy-handedtendencies that shape the future of peoples and of nations.Therefore  it is urgent to remove those ambiguities thatare preventing the international community from movingtoward becoming the master of its own collective destiny.In this respect  the United Nations  the repository of humanhope and the receptacle of human fears  has a particular andimportant role to play as it represents an irreplaceableforum for dialogue and concerted action.Because it is also the vector of a vision of change thatwould bring the course of international relations into linewith the purposes and principles of the Charter  the UnitedNations must find in the convergence of wills themotivation likely to advance our collective action towardnew horizons of peace  and of universally and equitablyshared security and prosperity.The possibilities offered by the ending of the coldwar and the profound changes in the international systemhave favoured new modes of interaction. We note herethat the streamlining of international interaction and ofsocial and economic dynamics has highlighted inequalitiesand is shaping and reshaping constellations of forces thatare beyond the rules of the world system.These manifestations of ambivalence and rupture arecause for concern. They foreshadow a disturbingredefinition of the global balance through a reshaping ofthe destiny of numerous peoples and nations that arefaced with insecurity and injustice.The arduous progress of the international communitytoward building a global order whose norms offunctioning and laws of development would benefit fromuniversal acceptance clearly requires a new impetus toensure control over the changes that are taking place andto integrate them into an orderly conception of transition.Thus a security brought about by disarmament andan agreed-upon and fully assumed solidarity that givemeaning and content to the Agenda for Peace and anAgenda for Development as well as the results expectedfrom the first World Summit for Social Developmentwould carry this promise by offering a framework and araison d’être for a healthy remobilization of thecommunity of nations in tackling the next millenniumwith the guarantee of a better future.The Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 who  in their efforts  identify themselves with thepersistent quest for such a future  naturally and more thanever manifest their interest and willingness to engageresolutely in an effective and equitable partnership whichwould mobilize energies in the service of this greatendeavour. My country will spare no effort in making itscontribution.Nearly 40 years ago  on 1 November 1954  Algeriaundertook to stamp its own history with the seal of theprinciples and objectives of the United Nations through itsstruggle for liberation which it waged under the banner ofthe equality of peoples and of their right to self-determination.20As an active member of the Organization and one thathas been involved in the realization of so manyachievements which brought honour to the United Nations Algeria has continually reiterated in this forum theaspirations of its people which are the same as those of somany other peoples whose experiences and identity itshared. Whether it be a question of decolonization or ofdevelopment  of disarmament or of human rights  of thedemocratization of international relations or of the actualfunctioning of the Organization  Algeria has joined its voiceand its efforts to all those of good faith in setting its stakesconfidently on the capacity of the international communityto transcend conditions of expediency in order to harnessthe great surges of consensus and universal mutualassistance.It is this same spirit which has ceaselessly motivatedthe specific actions of my country within the framework ofthe solidarity and cooperation of Maghreb  of the Sahelian-Sahara  of Africa  and of the Arab and Muslim world aswell as in the Third World and the Mediterranean basin.In that context  Algeria is fully aware of thesignificance  the scope and the effects  in its immediate areaand beyond  of the profound work of national renewal inwhich it is currently engaged with a great deal of faith anddetermination. It is also aware of the sacrifices involved for its own sake as well as for others.As during the November Revolution  which rousedawareness and freed creative energies  today it there is aneed to break with other forms of behavior and otherburdens  in order to anchor a young and ambitious societyin progress and modernity through pluralist democracy  thevalorization of the elements inherent to the nationalcharacter and the realization of universal ideals of socialjustice and collective development.The restoration of political stability  the consolidationof a State of law and order  the relaunching of economicgrowth which generates wealth and well-being  are anecessary step in the multi-dimensional actions of theauthorities responsible for the period of transition duringwhich the inner resources of the citizens and the intangibleprinciples of the Republic must converge so that the openpolitical dialogue currently being conducted by thePresident of State  Mr. Liamine Zeroual  may culminate assoon as possible in the resumption of a pluralist  healthyelectoral process  that would express the popular will in aspirit of full sovereignty.It is in this spirit of determination and consistencythat the resolute battle of Algeria against violence andterrorism - both in their manifestations and in their causes- is inscribed. This necessary campaign derives from theState’s obligation to ensure  foremost among HumanRights  the protection of the fundamental right to life. Itimplies that we bring to bear the same vigour in ourcollective denunciation of all governments who proveguilty of inciting and supporting terrorist violence or whodisplay willingness to engage in selective steps to preventthe international community from implementing acounter-strategy.This year  Algeria has the privilege and theresponsibility of coordinating those Institutions engagedin the building of Maghreban unity. In carrying out thismandate which for Algeria represents a genuinecommitment to act in the service of all the peoples of theregion  we are engaged in consolidating gains andpromoting new initiatives while keeping in perspective given the historical juncture in which they occur  thescope of certain difficulties  both indigenous andexogenous  which impede progress toward the objectivesof the Arab-Maghreb union.Among these difficulties is the particular situation inwhich Libya has been put  namely that of being unable toplay its role in the valorization of regionalcomplementarities and in contributing to the economicand social expansion of the region.One must hope that the constructive proposals ofLibya for the implementation of the relevant resolutionsof the Security Council will enable it to quickly achievea peaceful and just solution to outstanding questions aswell as to the lifting of international sanctions which havea negative impact on the living conditions of our Libyanbrethren.Similarly  the people of the Western Sahara  whoselegitimate national aspirations it would be futile to hide await the scrupulous completion of the joint mission ofpeace of the United Nations and the Organization ofAfrican Unity. The holding of a fair and impartialreferendum for self-determination in conformity with thesettlement plan agreed upon by the two parties andendorsed by the Security Council is one of the primaryresponsibilities of the United Nations  under the Charterand under the Declaration on the Granting ofIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Noadverse factor should stand in the way of the discharge ofthat responsibility.21A just and lasting solution to the question of theWestern Sahara is also an important component of thepeace and stability of the region as a whole. It is alsoinherent to the achievement of the liberation of the Africancontinent. This is why Algeria is encouraging the UnitedNations Secretary-General to ensure credibility and theutmost probity in the implementation of the settlement planwhile increasing efforts to have the Kingdom of Moroccoand the Polisario Front create a political dynamic which canovercome all difficulties in the implementation of thereferendum process and beyond.It was thanks to such a political dynamism that SouthAfrica honoured its rendezvous with history  to thesatisfaction of all  and that the United Nations was able toplay a positive role - something that Algeria welcomes andfinds gratifying. Apart from such specific elements  thepeaceful dismantling of apartheid in South Africa is also anexample for other African nations that are being tornasunder by fratricidal strife.With the continued assistance of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  Burundi andRwanda should be able to overcome the tragiccircumstances that have beset them and to opt forharmonious coexistence among the elements of theirrespective peoples  with a view to mobilizing their energiesin the service of national unity  democracy andreconstruction.The return of peace and concord in Angola andMozambique  in line with the agreements concluded and inanswer to the popular will freely expressed  should finallyenable those two brotherly peoples to heal the wounds ofpast years and to contribute to making southern Africa aregion of prosperity.Thanks to the effective participation of the countriesof west Africa  the situation in Liberia is moving toward alasting solution  to which all parties must feel committed ifthe country is to be secured against a recurrence of violenceand instability.The conflict in Somalia continues to be cause forserious international concern. The internationalcommunity’s important presence in the field has hadsatisfactory results in terms of humanitarian assistance andof reduced tension. The time has come for all the Somalifactions to work toward facing up to the challenge ofcoexistence and national reconciliation in line with theirpeople’s legitimate aspirations.Starting with the Madrid Conference  the MiddleEast has embarked on the path of negotiation with a viewto building a comprehensive just and lasting peace in thatsensitive area of the world which has endured terriblebruising and suffering. Over the past year  importantsteps have been taken on the road to peace  through theconclusion of the Palestinian-Israeli and the Jordanian-Israeli agreements. Algeria hails the conclusion of thoseagreements and expresses the hope that these first stepswill be consolidated through effective and scrupulousimplementation of the provisions agreed upon and thatthey will quickly be followed by significant breakthroughsthat meet the legitimate expectations of both Lebanon andSyria.The edifice of peace in the Middle East has solidand positive foundations in international legality  and it isimportant that in the building of that edifice care shouldbe taken to make it a structure of permanent validity andcomprehensiveness which future generations would acceptfully. Clearly  return of all the territories occupied byIsrael in 1967  including Al-Quds al-Sharif  andimplementation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinianpeople are prerequisites which should be at the heart ofthe desired settlement.Algeria  which participates in the multilateralworking groups that emanated from the MadridConference  will continue to work with conviction formaintaining the unity of the Palestinian and Arab rankswith a view to consolidating the parameters of peace.The unity of Arab ranks  which has been affected bythe consequences of the Gulf war  is an essentialprerequisite of the peace which the internationalcommunity encourages and supports in the Middle East.From that point of view  an ultimate improvement inrelations between Kuwait and Iraq  on the basis ofinternational legality and with respect for the principles ofindependence  national sovereignty  territorial integrity the non-use of force or of the threat to use force  andnon-interference in internal affairs  is an imperative. Nowthat the geographic framework of coexistence andpeaceful neighbourliness between the two countries hasbeen internationally enshrined  our hope is that theunresolved humanitarian issues will be satisfactorilyresolved so that an atmosphere of reconciliation mayprevail and lead to concrete steps in that direction. Theeconomic sanctions that are causing such suffering to theIraqi people should be lifted  not only because the Iraqiauthorities have cooperated in implementing the SecurityCouncil’s resolutions  but also because keeping the22sanctions in place will be seen as a manifestation ofindifference toward a people in danger.In the same spirit  I should like to reiterate Algeria’ssupport for the reestablishment and preservation of thesovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over the islands ofAbou Moussa  Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb  which arestill under foreign occupation.The tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina  which isdaily becoming more serious  and which endangers the veryfoundations of the United Nations in view of what ishappening to one of its Members  is a horrific test of thecredibility of the alleged movement  in internationalrelations  toward the reign of law and justice. Welcome asthey may be  the developments in international action thathave been taking place for a year now as a result ofawareness of the horrors of ethnic cleansing and of theinhuman conditions imposed on the Muslim elements of thepopulation such developments have not put paid to theextremism of the activist Serb minority or to its irredentistambitions which threaten the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Indischarging its national responsibility for the higherinterests of its people at such a critical juncture in theirhistory  the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is assuredof the solidarity and support of Algeria.At a time when the Haitian people and theinternational community have in sight a peaceful andpositive outcome to the crisis that has beset the Republic ofHaiti for some three years now  Algeria hopes that peace stability  democracy and progress will be established in thatcountry.The twentieth century in the course of which mankindhas achieved considerable control over nature throughextraordinary scientific and technological advances will nevertheless  go down in history as the century which failedto meet the need for real and full security for the humanrace.The shortening of distances  the interdependence ofnations  and the globalization of the economy and ofcommunications  coexist with an untenable inability to wipeout hunger  poverty and numerous epidemics  while theapocalyptic power of nuclear arsenals has exceeded allrational limits.The end of the cold war has made possible theemergence of a concept of security based on general andcomplete disarmament and on economic and social levers.It is important that nuclear disarmament be relentlesslypursued and that the few notable results obtained in thereduction of nuclear arsenals by the United States and theRussian Federation be expanded and strengthened by therapid conclusion of a treaty for a complete ban on nucleartests.It is this spirit which has made Algeria work for anew vision of collective security that would be based ongeneral and complete disarmament. Hence  my country’sinsistence that questions relating to disarmament and tonon-proliferation  and therefore to international security cannot be dissociated from those which relate toeconomic and social development.It is also in this same spirit that my country adoptsa clear and committed attitude to the peaceful use of theatom. That is why it is an honour and pleasure for mesolemnly to announce from this rostrum the decision ofAlgeria to deposit  during this session of the Assembly the instruments of adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. By its adherence tothat Treaty  Algeria hopes to contribute to the collectiveenterprise of general and complete disarmament  bymeans of which the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons must be raised  during its next review to the level of an effective instrument for disarmamentand a tool for the peaceful uses of the atom in the serviceof development. Moreover  it is important that theConvention banning chemical weapons should enter intoforce and be fully effective.Such a challenge imposes itself by the full weight ofits imperatives and through awareness of the dangers thatface a world in transition and in the grip of turmoil  aworld of uncertainty and one which bears powerful seedsof fragmentation.Clearly the growing gap in development betweenNorth and South  which has been particularly exacerbatedby the lack of genuine dialogue  shows  with a renewedsense of urgency  the need for the internationalcommunity to embark on the path of concerted action totake in hand the phenomena of interdependence and  byso doing  to extract the elements of firm cooperativeaction in the service of development in a spirit ofsolidarity.In this context of accelerated globalization ofinternational economic realities  cooperation fordevelopment clearly forms the only possible answer to the23demands for new global regulation to ensure the conditionsfor lasting and shared international security.The message of the United Nations to which thepurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter are of anunprecedented nature and scope in terms of their conceptand extent has encircled the globe and has won for theOrganization a degree of participation which brings itsmembership close to a universality which is worthy of itsauthority and influence.The work of restructuring the United Nations systemand the debate on equitable representation within theSecurity Council in this respect provide a valuableopportunity for a close scrutiny of the institutionalfunctioning of the bodies of the Organization as well asa future-oriented overview that takes into considerationthe need for democratization and participation in thedecision-making process so that all the bodies of theOrganization may always enjoy full legitimacy byworking on behalf of the international community as awhole.The revitalization of the United Nations through itsliberation from the practices and legacies of the cold warpresupposes that an outstanding role be given to it interms of the conception of global strategies and policiesfor economic and social development.The year which lies ahead now before the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations could be put to gooduse to promote the control and ordered sharing by allcountries of the stakes at the end of the century. Thusthe international community can find  by acting insolidarity and through concerted action  the springs for anew dynamism of peace and cooperation. What is atstake here is our common future."
"50",2097,"ECU",49,1994,"I would like to congratulate Mr Amara Essy Foreign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire on his election asPresident of this important AssemblyI should also like to extend to Ambassador SamuelInsanally the congratulations of Ecuador on his brilliantperformance during the last session.13Equally  on behalf of the Government of Ecuador  Ishould like to extend our congratulations to the SecretaryGeneral Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his work in carrying out hisimportant duties.During these last few years  the world of internationalrelations has undergone a swift and profoundtransformation. Several problems which divided nationshave disappeared  while other have emerged  as have forcesand elements whose existence invites careful reflection.The most serious ideological differences have beenovercome and we have witnessed with satisfaction theholding of free elections in South Africa; however  in otherparts of the world  other evils have reappeared - racism xenophobia  civil wars - and problems such as hunger andpoverty have become more acute. Bosnia  Somalia  Haiti and Rwanda are just some of the names which now movemankind’s moral conscience.At the same time  the historic role of the UnitedNations has acquired a unique and far-reaching meaning and the near future of the planet appears linked to thedirectives and decisions adopted in the General Assemblyand in the Security Council.The fact that the United Nations is about to celebrate50 years of existence is truly pleasing  because it meansthat this forum of mankind has consolidated its leading rolein history. At the same time  this anniversary leads us toreflect on ways to improve the Organization. This processwill inevitably involve reconsidering some United Nationsstructures in order to adapt them to the new demands ofdevelopment which will be discussed at the social summitsoon to take place in Copenhagen. The social summit mustenable nations  taking account of the many decades duringwhich trade and financial matters have played against lessdeveloped countries  to commit themselves to more directaction to face the problems of inadequate education  illness violence and poverty.The United Nations is approaching its fiftieth year ata time when building a new international order has becomeimperative. Ecuador wants this new international order tobe marked by unconditional respect for the principles of theOrganization’s Charter  by the international economicrestructuring which for many years has been one of themain aspirations of the developing world  and by effectiveand continuing solidarity and interdependence among all thenations on our planet.The changes on the international scene have broughtabout a new and growing interest in the United Nations.The international community turns to the Organizationmore often and with more confidence when it needs helpin solving its problems. The Organization’s structuresmust be revised and strengthened so that its responses canmeet the needs that have been put to it.To carry out this endeavour  it will be necessary toaddress statements that have been made regarding the newcomposition of the Security Council and to consider theneed to revitalize the General Assembly  giving itfunctions and responsibilities in keeping with its status asthe highest forum of the Organization. An internationalorder based on and designed for the human person musthave at its disposal an adequate tool for carrying outprogrammes needed for the economic and socialdevelopment of our peoples. From that point of view  itis imperative for us to undertake a process ofstrengthening the Economic and Social Council.Furthermore  we have to create conditions that willprovide the indispensable motivation for States  given thenew circumstance of the world  to place their full trust inthe International Court of Justice.Ecuador  a country that has the deepest respect forfundamental human rights  appreciates and assumes withthe utmost responsibility the trust of the internationalcommunity  granted through this Organization  enablingit to contribute to the work of the most important forumsdevoted to the promotion and protection of all humanrights.The Government of Ecuador echoes the expressionsof support to the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights. It trusts that his difficult task will bebased on the frank understanding of the internationalcommunity. It also expresses its conviction that theAssembly will commit the necessary administrative andfinancial resources to facilitate the duties of the HighCommissioner.Human rights and social development areinseparable  indivisible. In daily reality we cannotseparate respect for human rights from fair economicrelations. As stated by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  quality of life is a subject whichcannot remain at the entire mercy of the game ofmacroeconomic statistics.We developing countries are affected in our foreigntrade by the gradual deterioration of the terms of14exchange  a phenomenon which generates serious socialconsequences and which forces us to export greatervolumes of raw  finished and semi-manufactured goods.We also face non-tariff barriers  and many other measuresthat block access by our products - such as bananas andflowers in the case of Ecuador - to the markets of thosevery developed countries where the principle of free tradeis designed and developed. This protectionist policycontradicts the goals of general welfare sought by theinternational community.The countries of Latin America  including Ecuador have launched a great effort of adjustment and economicrestructuring which must be properly understood and whichoffers a framework more conducive to internationalcooperation and to foreign investment.At this stage of history  neither the developed nor thedeveloping countries can neglect the so-called socialquestion  a product of the socio-economic inequities thatdominate the world. The solution to this problem can beachieved only by international cooperation at all levels.The development of poor nations must depend on their ownefforts  on cooperation based on smooth  effective andprofoundly human mechanisms of integration.We believe in the fundamental right to life.Therefore  we cannot and will not accept theimplementation of programmes conditioned on populationcontrol and abortion  which are what Pope John Paul II hascalled ""the culture of death"". These are the bases thatshould inspire solidarity and international cooperation.Environmental problems  and those linked to thedangerous use of nuclear weapons  have shown that wehumans are all voyaging in the same boat and that ourdestinies are intertwined. Thus  the prosperity of somecannot result from the exploitation or damage of theenvironment of others; the accumulation of weapons in onecountry is nothing but a boomerang that country is throwingat itself.I want to recall the words of the ConstitutionalPresident of Ecuador  Mr. Sixto Durán Ballén  in thisaugust forum  when he said:""I must emphasize that although the developedcountries  which are mainly responsible for thedeterioration of the environment  have a particularobligation  it is other countries that are being asked tomake the sacrifice of restricting the exercise of theirlegitimate right to use the wealth that nature has giventhem. It is necessary to seek due compensationjointly  especially in the shape of financial aid andtechnological cooperation"". (A/47/PV.12  p. 18)Inevitably  all our peoples must join forces tosafeguard and restore the environment. In the ecologicalfield  we have completed the stage of formulating rulesand international conventions. Now we must join ourresources and technical efforts to put those solutions intopractice as soon as possible. That is why it is importantto develop greater linkage between institutions such as theWorld Bank  the Inter-American Development Bank andthe International Monetary Fund on the one hand  andprogrammes of the United Nations and the GlobalEnvironment Facility on the other. Therefore  genuinetransfer of clean technologies is of great importance.It is especially worrisome that nuclear testing formilitary purposes continues to be carried out. Ecuadorcondemns these tests  which damage the environment endanger the countries of the test area and ignore theright of all the peoples to peace and security.Furthermore  Ecuador is worried by the fact that in thepost-cold-war era some countries have attractedsignificant numbers of technicians and nuclear scientistsin order to develop their military power. Resolution48/70  approved last December  opens the way towards acomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  which all Statesshould support.We believe in the need not only to extend the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  but also toimprove it and establish it forever. At the same time  wesupport the declaration of new nuclear-weapon-free zones similar to those established by the Latin American Treaty.In this regard  it is a matter of serious concern that while we are trying to limit and even eliminate nucleararsenals  there has been an increase in the manufacture ofconventional weapons and in the traffic in them.Accordingly  there is an imperative need  as the Holy Seeproposed through its Council for Justice and Peace  forthe creation of an international authority to reduce thetrade in weapons and to achieve the goal of acomprehensive ban on all kinds of weapons.Ecuador welcomes most warmly the agreementsarrived at and the progress made in the Middle East in theprocess of establishing peace and normalizing therelations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.Ecuador firmly supports this process  which is an examplefor the solution of other  perhaps less complex  problems.15We also condemn the actions of extremist groups who through terrorism  attempt to prevent the consolidation ofpeace in that important part of the world.We were particularly enthusiastic over thereinstatement of South Africa in this world Organization.With the victory over apartheid one of the United Nationslongest and most difficult struggles has now come to anend.We must however reiterate our profound concern overthe ongoing ethnic and religious clashes in the territories ofthe former Yugoslavia. Ecuador supports the actions takenby the international community in seeking a politicalsolution that would ensure an end to the tragedy in Bosniaand Herzegovina.And now my country would like to issue a plea to theinternational community to provide generous humanitarianassistance for the victims in Rwanda.Recently  there has been a proliferation of UnitedNations peace-keeping operations. Notwithstanding all itsshortcomings  the international effort in this regard ispraiseworthy  but we believe this Organization should basically  use preventive measures to deal with theunderlying causes of civil  international and inter-ethnicconflicts  and along with thIs  it should also address theproblems of injustice  inequality in economic and traderelations  and the persistence of prejudice and age-oldenmity. The road to peace lies through programmes toprovide help in practical and urgent terms  to thosecountries most affected by hunger and extreme poverty.There must be a prompt review of programmes ofcooperation. There must be a more fruitful effort on thepart of the specialized agencies of the United Nationssystem to develop a true culture of peace and the respectfor the rights of others.The fundamental obligation of the United Nations -one might even say its real raison d’être - is not only themaintenance of international peace and security but also theraising of the economic  social and cultural standards ofpeoples. This is the only solid basis for progress anddevelopment.I believe it is time for this Assembly to adoptpragmatic resolutions so that we may spend less on paperand bureaucracy and more on technical and culturalmissions and specific programmes that would reach thosepeople that face the greatest problems  areas afflicted bywar  plague and starvation.Ecuador has advocated a solution to the complexHaitian crisis that takes account of the principles of non-intervention and the peaceful settlement of disputes andthat involves the participation of all sectors of Haitiansociety  with the broadest respect for human rights andtaking account of the relevant resolutions of theOrganization of American States and of the UnitedNations.Ecuador trusts that democracy will be establishedpermanently and as soon as possible in Haiti. To thatend  it is offered all the diplomatic and political supportthat it can. At the same time  we would wish toparticipate in the humanitarian efforts to contribute to therebuilding of the Haitian economy  once constitutionalorder is restored.Ecuador would also be in favour of continuing theCuban-American dialogue in that same constructive spiritand with good will. We fervently hope that our sisternation of Cuba may be able to become fully involvedagain in hemispheric cooperation. It will be necessary tomake great strides along the road to broadening andstrengthening democracy and pluralism  and at the sametime an end must be put to the unilateral blockade towhich Cuba has been subjected for many years.In keeping with our constant desire to contribute toa climate of peace  understanding and cooperation amongpeoples  Ecuador has been seeking some means of dealingwith its age-old controversy with Peru and strengtheningits ties of friendship and cooperation between the peoplesof Ecuador and Peru. As we said earlier  Ecuadorattaches very special importance within this process  tothe intervention of His Holiness the Pope  in seeking adefinitive solution to this problem. This is in view of thehigh moral authority of His Holiness  which is recognizedby both our peoples.It is increasingly clear to our two nations that theway to development is to be found in working together inharmony.We wish to deepen and broaden our far-reachingcommon interests. This is to the mutual benefit of ourtwo countries and would enable us to become efficientpartners as we develop together.All the nations represented in this Assembly arecalled upon to build a better world  a world free from thehorrors of war  hunger and environmental destruction.May we  through our work  respond to this historicchallenge."
"51",2142,"EGY",49,1994,"Mr. President  at the outset  I should like to extend to you brother Minister Amara Essy our congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. Allowme also to extend through you our congratulations to thesisterly country Côte d’Ivoire  with which Egypt enjoysbonds of friendship and cooperation. I take this opportunityalso to commend your predecessor  Ambassador Insanally the representative of Guyana.I would be remiss if I did not pay special tribute toMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who is conducting with hiswell-known acumen and ability the work of thisOrganization amid turbulent political waves and rapidinternational changes  and in the face of rising expectationsregarding the role that the United Nations could play in theworld of today and tomorrow.As we know  earlier this month  the InternationalConference on Population and Development was held inCairo. We in Egypt are greatly satisfied that theConference concluded with a Programme of Action thatdeals with population questions from their cultural anddevelopment perspectives  on the basis of a profoundunderstanding of the various dimensions of this problem.Undoubtedly  the clamour that accompanied thatConference was justified. Quite rightly  some have calledattention to the fact that as the cultures of various nationsdiffer from each other  there is no justification whatsoeverto the imposition on any nation of a way of life it doesnot approve of  a way of thinking it does not palate orpractices which it does not accept. On top of all that there is the need to respect all religions  and to take intoaccount the virtues they preach and the guidelines theyembody for the conduct of individuals and nations.It might be important in this connection to refer tothe consecutive conferences that have been held in the1990s to deal with the social aspects of development. Webelieve that henceforth  the attention of developingcountries and of all other societies should be focused ondealing with these aspects. This is what all peoples ofthe world have aspired after throughout the long years ofinternational conflict which led to social and economicconvulsions that resulted in backwardness  misery anduntold suffering for millions of people.While we emphasize our interest in this approachthat relates to social development and its global character we also believe that the role of the United Nations thereinis highly significant. Undoubtedly  the United Nationssponsorship of international conferences to this endconsolidates its role in shaping the world of tomorrow which must be a world of equitable development collective security and social stability.I have made a point of beginning my statement byaddressing the social dimension  in order to underline anew tendency and a renewed awareness of this significantaspect of international life. I call upon all countries toaccord that aspect the high priority it has denied fordecades  during the cold war with its internationalconflicts that impacted negatively  not only on the socialagenda  but also on international action in that respect andbeclouded people’s awareness of its significance andeffects.During the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  Egypt called for a new international social17contract  to be formulated by all the world cultures andsocieties  so that it may act as a safety valve for theinternational community both now and in future.Realization of this vision will require  first and foremost the creation of an appropriate international socialenvironment  that would be inspired by the specific anddistinctive characteristics of all societies and that wouldenrich the heritage of mankind. This could be done onlythrough awareness of and respect for the integration andinteraction of cultures.Proceeding from its awareness of the movement ofhistory  Egypt was the first to sow the seeds of peace in theMiddle East. Today  Egypt is determined to continue toassist all parties to overcome the obstacles that impedenegotiations  and to lay the foundations of new  just andsecure conditions in the Middle East.You may recall that last year  on behalf of mycountry  I called on the Governments and peoples of theMiddle East to reflect on the future of our relations afterthe settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. My call wasbased on the deep-seated Egyptian conviction that the onlyguarantee of a durable and stable peace in the Middle Eastis organically linked to the extent of the parties’ success inworking out and laying the foundations of a newrelationship between the countries of the region that wouldbe based on a threefold foundation of political settlement socio-economic development  and regional security andarms control.In dealing with our vision of a new Middle East  I amgoing to deal with each of those underpinnings in a contextthat has to do with the creation of a new situation whichwould allow all the creative energies of the region to beunleashed in a climate of security  stability and confidencein the future.I speak first of political settlement. Last year  we methere a few days after the signing of the historic agreementbetween President Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin inSeptember 1993. Under that agreement  the Israeli andPalestinian parties mutually recognized each other andagreed on a Declaration of Principles regarding thearrangements of interim self-government. The wave ofoptimism that was generated at the time was tempered bythe customary caution which lasted until an agreementenforcing the Declaration of Principles was signed in Cairoon 4 May 1994. That agreement constituted a significantstep on the long road of peace towards the exercise by thePalestinian people of their legitimate national rights.The sight of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafatentering Gaza on 1 July 1994 has thus epitomized thelong history of the Palestinian people’s sacrifices andsteadfastness  with which they gained the support andsympathy of all peace- and justice-loving peopleseverywhere. President Arafat’s return was the firstdividend of the peace option that heightened internationalrespect for the Palestinian people’s responsible positionand courageous decision at this historical and crucialjuncture in their long struggle.Allow me to pay tribute from this rostrum to theadvocates of peace  on both the Palestinian and the Israelisides. At the same time  I call upon both sides tocontinue to tend the shoot of peace until it becomesstronger and more deeply rooted. Moreover  I call for theexpeditious adoption of new concrete measures that wouldassure the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bankthat the peace dividends will embrace all the Palestinianterritories occupied since 1967.One of the most important of such measures is thealleviation of the burden of occupation and mitigation ofthe daily suffering of the Palestinian people. Theorganization of Palestinian elections in all the Palestinianterritories would enable them to move from the first stepof self-government in Gaza and Jericho towards theexercise of their full political rights  in the framework ofself-determination that is the appropriate and genuineresolution of this conflict. Moreover  I appeal to bothsides  in equally strong terms  to confront all acts ofviolence and practices of terrorism firmly and persistentlyto ensure safety for all and guarantee that peace will havethe upper hand.Egypt has commended the progress achieved on theJordanian-Israeli track. The 25 July 1994 agreement toput an end to the state of war between the two countriesis a positive landmark on the road to peace. Egyptwelcomes this significant step and is confident that therising momentum will soon help achieve tangible progresson the Syrian and Lebanese tracks  based on fullwithdrawal from the occupied territories of both countries.Secondly  I wish to speak of economic development.Scrutiny of the Middle East situation makes it clear thatthere is an organic link between peace and developmentin that region  whose peace and security are pivotal to theworld’s peace and security. The laying of thegroundwork for the social and economic development ofthe countries of that region is a necessary step  withoutwhich peace will remain meaningless and pointless. At18the same time  the process of development can besuccessful only within the context of balanced and well-planned strategies that take into account the interests of allparties. In this regard  hopes are high and prospects arespacious enough. Nevertheless there is no room in all thisfor the domination by one economy of another. TheMiddle East can accommodate a comprehensive process ofthe production and marketing of all that each country of theregion can excel in.Egypt  which is undergoing at present a stage ofradical economic reform that aims at ensuring for its trade industry and private sector a significant breakthrough  isqualified to play a leading role in the economicdevelopment of the region. This should enhance the imageof the Middle East as a region that attracts increasingtourism  flourishing trade and thriving investment  side byside with an advanced productive capacity. We nominatethe Middle East to be the cradle of new economic giants.Egypt does not seek opportunities of rapid gains  butrather an advanced economic framework that wouldcontribute significantly to changing the climate of theMiddle East and reshaping the region’s ability to contributeto the interactions of the developed world economy.Thirdly  I speak of regional security and arms control.Comprehensive peace  in its wider sense  will never beupheld in the Middle East unless we change our oldperceptions. These were the products of years of wars andenmity that engendered the belief that security could beassured only through the acquisition and stockpiling ofweapons of mass destruction. This regional arms race  thatplagued the region and accelerated in a climate of mutualsuspicion and hostility  must be tamed in order that we mayadapt to the new realities prevailing in the region. Egyptbelieves that peace in the Middle East must be strengthenedby taking arms-control measures  of which the first wouldbe a reduction of the levels of armaments.The region’s experience has shown that a higher levelof quantitative or qualitative armament  in the case of anycountry has never deterred aggression nor guaranteedsecurity. If such experience is reason enough forreassessing our policies in this respect  the politicalachievements which have put us squarely on the road topeace make us question the wisdom of escalating armamentunder conditions of peace.If the first prerequisite is arms reduction  the secondis the achievement of a better security balance amongst thecountries of the region. The emergence of a new morestable Middle East will never take place unless werenounce the concepts of military superiority and agree torid the region of the weapons of mass destruction. Thepersistence of such concepts can only jeopardize theexistent possibility of creating a new and different MiddleEast. Any disruption of the security balance in theregion  is bound to generate suspicions that may cause theregion to slide once again into competition  escalation dispute  conflict and confrontation.If we are seeking normal relations between theparties  we have to ensure the co-equality of theobligations of all countries in the region. It isunacceptable that one party  to the exclusion of all others should be accorded a special exceptional status. Unlessthis is addressed  serious cracks will develop in thefoundations we are laying which may deepen and widen and undermine the whole edifice.Proceeding from this  the Egyptian initiativelaunched by President Mubarak in April 1990  in whichhe proposed that the Middle East should be declared azone free of weapons of mass destruction  wascommensurate with the concepts of the new internationalera at the regional level and came as a natural extensionof Egypt’s 1974 initiative to declare the Middle East anuclear-weapons-free zone.In this regard  Egypt strongly urges all countries ofthe region to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and accept theapplication of the safeguards regime of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency. This  if it takes place  will be amajor step towards peace and reconciliation in the MiddleEast that would safeguard against any setbacks in futureregional relations. Egypt attaches great importance toIsrael’s rapid undertaking of this step as we approach thedate of the Conference for the Review and Extension ofthe non-proliferation Treaty in 1995. Otherwise  theextension of this Treaty  which aims at halting nuclearproliferation  would lead to the consecration of an adversereality that is neither balanced nor proper and which runscounter to the principle of universality. We would findthe persistence of such an exceptional situation strangeand unacceptable.Egypt takes this opportunity to urge Israel to respondpositively to this extremely earnest call which safeguardsthe region against the evils of an unnecessary arms race.It is a step that would help strengthen regional security.In this era of peace  we should rethink our priorities andview the prerequisites of security from a different point19of view based on the new relations of peace instead of fromconsiderations which had the upper hand at a time ofregional conflicts. Israel should also conform to  ratherthan depart from  the international way of thinking thatcalls for universal adherence to the non-proliferation Treaty.We adamantly insist on this in order to avoid a race in thisdangerous field.While discussing issues of general concern to our worldand its problems  I must also refer specifically to theprevailing situations in our region that create turbulence problems  hopes and pain. Brotherly Yemen is healing itswounds after discord and strife. We are hopeful thatsufficient patience will be demonstrated to bring aboutnational reconciliation in accordance with the values of theYemeni people and in such a way as to ensure theircontinued march towards development and prosperity.In Iraq  the brotherly Iraqi people remain in the gripof the tragedy that befell them and we look forward withthem to the day when their suffering will come to an end.This would require the Government of Iraq to respond tothe demands of international legality and the unambiguousand formal recognition of the identity of Kuwait  itssovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence.While addressing the issues of the Middle East  wecall on Iran to extend good-neighbourliness to its Arabbrethren. In this regard  serious work is needed to resolvethe problem of the occupied Arab islands in the Gulf. Thiswould represent a positive indication that relations in theregion can be conducted on the basis of a positive dialoguedealing with the political tendencies that are a source ofconcern in various parts of the region.I turn now to Egypt’s closest neighbours in the region.In this connection  I may say that the people andGovernment of Libya have now the clear political will toput an end to the Libyan-Western crisis concerningLockerbie by putting the accused on trial and attempting toreach practical solutions for the implementation of therelevant Security Council resolutions. An objective view ofthe problem confirms the importance of respectinginternational legality since the trial of persons accused of aninternational crime is a necessity and the moreexpeditiously it takes place the better it is for the process ofjustice.Similarly  in addressing the issues pertaining to itsneighbours  we must also mention Sudan  with which wehave had very special ties since the dawn of history.Today  Sudan is suffering from a challenge to itssovereignty in the south as well as an impediment to thedevelopment and prosperity of its people. In bothinstances  Egypt stands firmly and clearly in support ofthe unity and territorial integrity of Sudan. We cannotaccept its fragmentation or division. With the samestrength and clarity  Egypt supports the right of theSudanese people to a tranquil and stable life that wouldafford them the opportunity to look to the future. In thisframework  Sudan has a well-known history of toleranceand cordial relations amongst its people and with all itsneighbours and brethren. There is no doubt that Sudan’simplementation of policies in this direction would ensurea change in the strained relations in that region.During Egypt’s chairmanship of the Organization ofAfrican Unity  which expired in June  the Africancontinent witnessed a number of important achievements the most important of which was the success of theorganization in creating a mechanism for the prevention management and resolution of African conflicts. This isa development that contributes to the international effortsdeployed in that area. It also complements the role of theUnited Nations within the framework of the principlesand objectives of the Charter.Over the same period  Africa has also witnessed theentry into force of the convention establishing the AfricanEconomic Community. This represents a significant stepby the African continent towards the realization ofeconomic integration  which will enable it to deal with thenew international economic realities and to face up to thepotential consequences of international economicdevelopments that may not be entirely in the interests ofthe African States. Moreover  we in Africa are currentlystudying  in all earnestness  the social and economicsituation in the continent. We are fully aware of the highpriority of this problem to Africa’s present and futuregenerations. This will be the subject of a special meetingof African foreign ministers soon to be held in Cairo.The African continent’s share of human tragedieshas been abundant enough  as demonstrated by thehorrendous events in Somalia  Burundi and Rwanda.While Africa reaffirms its principal responsibility to dealwith such sorrowful events by providing the necessarytroops to undertake peace-keeping and peace-buildingoperations  experience has shown that the humanitarian political and economic dimensions of such events requirea positive contribution by the entire internationalcommunity  primarily within the context of the UnitedNations. Such contribution has been forthcoming andrepresents a unique international and regional solidarity.20As regards Somalia  the tragedy is still unfolding despite strenuous African and international efforts toachieve national reconciliation between the warring Somalifactions. The crisis remains elusive owing to tribal rivalriesand self-centered interests. The persistence of this situationhas further frustrated the international community  to theextent that a number of States have decided to withdrawtheir troops from the peace-keeping operation or to call forthe complete termination of the United Nations Operationin Somalia.We are fully aware of the motives that have led tosuch decisions and proposals  and we emphasize that theresponsibility for putting an end to the current deterioratingsituation in Somalia and for reaching a solution to the crisisrests essentially with the leaders of the warring factions.We are of the view that it is unacceptable and unwarrantedthat the major Powers should impose a certain solution ora particular leader in Somalia. At the sametime  we cannot wash our hands of this problem. There isstill an obligation on the part of the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity and the League of ArabStates to assist in achieving a just settlement to the crisis.From Somalia we turn to Angola  in which recentdevelopments indicate a glimmer of hope that a final andpeaceful solution may be close at hand. Egypt welcomesthe official acceptance by the Government of Angola of theproposals concerning national reconciliation. We call forthe intensification of efforts to achieve peace in order thatthe Lusaka Conference may succeed and for the fullimplementation of the peace agreement  as well as SecurityCouncil resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). We alsostrongly urge UNITA to show its goodwill by negotiatingconstructively to reach a peace agreement without delay.It was our hope that a just solution to the Bosniancrisis would be found before the commencement of thissession. Unfortunately  the painful reality is that the crisisis still with us. While we accept the position of theContact Group in its proposal of the peace plan which hasbeen accepted by the Bosnian Government regardless of itsshortcomings  yet we demand the most basic level ofrationality and justice in managing this crisis. Franklyspeaking  we believe that lifting or easing the sanctionsimposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbiaand Montenegro - without deploying credible and capableinternational observers along its borders with Bosnia andHerzegovina or securing its recognition of Bosnia as asovereign State amounts to a negative development that isbound to hinder a just settlement  that bespeaksacquiescence in considerations that run counter to the normsof justice and is tantamount to surrender to the policies ofaggression and racism.A few days ago  the Security Council adopted arather hasty resolution easing the sanctions imposed onthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia andMontenegro. It would have been more useful if theCouncil had given priority to a review of the extent of theimplementation of its many previous resolutions  adoptedunder Chapter VII of the Charter. Those resolutionscontain provisions and requirements that should have beenimplemented prior to any consideration of the easing orreviewing of sanctions.The rules of international justice should not betwisted to reward the aggressor for mere promises thatlack credibility or effectiveness. Moreover  theeffectiveness of the observers currently deployed on theBosnian-Yugoslav border is highly questionable. Indeed in our view  they are ineffective and insufficient.Egypt  as a country contributing troops to the UnitedNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  reiterates thatthe purpose of the presence of these troops is to providegenuine protection for those areas until such time as theBosnian armed forces would be in a position to undertakethe task of defending their territory.The withdrawal of UNPROFOR while the powervacuum continues - an idea that is being floated - wouldbe a further step towards handing the protected areas tothe aggressors  who have the necessary power to controlthem. This would certainly have negative implications forinternational relations as a whole.We are at a unique juncture in history: ourgeneration has been afforded an opportunity to lay thefoundations of a new era. Today  as we approach thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  we feel that allnations  industrial and developing alike  must contributeto the development of a common vision of the new worldorder - a vision that will consolidate the foundations ofour common future on the principles of democracy humanity and equality  arrived at through consensus by allmembers of the international community.We wish to make it clear that any attempt tomarginalize the role of the developing countries informulating the global vision for the coming era wouldinvolve the risk of drawing new lines of confrontation inplace of those that existed during the cold war. Thosenew lines of confrontation would be ruled by economic21and developmental criteria and considerations that may ringdown a curtain thick enough to separate the North from theSouth  deepen disagreement between them  and give rise toa situation inconsistent with the interdependence andcohesion of the present era. In this connection  I refer todemands of the developing countries voiced during themeeting held in Cairo this summer under the umbrella ofthe Non-Aligned Movement.The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations coincides with the flagging of initiatives andproposals for the restructuring of the Organization’smechanisms. Such efforts will never rise to the level ofexpectations unless they are preceded by an effort to reformour thinking  to bring it into line with the changes in theinternational situation and thereby to translate the newcollective vision into a concrete programme of action thatwould be based on genuine consensus and that would affordus a real opportunity to ensure the stability of internationalrelations.In this context  it is needless to point out that such aprocess of thought reform as the one I have just referred tomust impact on our efforts as we embark on the process ofrestructuring the United Nations and  in particular  ofreforming the Security Council with its extensivecompetence.We must emphasize several points regarding theprocess of reforming the work of the Security Council.First  it must be carried out on a regional basis  not on aspecific-country basis. Secondly  the new seats - and theremay be two additional ones each for Latin America  Asiaand Africa - must be allocated on the basis of the criteriastipulated in the Charter. Thirdly  it is not essential at thisstage to specify the two States from each region that are tooccupy the additional seats. The principle of rotation couldbe applied to several States satisfying the criteria agreedupon  taking into account the specific characteristics of eachregion. Fourthly  agreement must be reachedsimultaneously on a number of issues concerning reform ofthe Council’s working methods and procedures and theneed to increase its transparency. Fifthly  the frameworkwithin which the right of veto is used should be reviewedand defined.We should not pursue our work in this regard underpressure of time or on the assumption that consideration ofthe matter must be concluded by the time designated for thecelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.Finally  it must be emphasized that rationalrestructuring is infinitely preferable to what might resultfrom a hasty decision that may please some States  upsetthe overwhelming majority of States that suffer from lackof representation in the Security Council and put theCouncil itself in a position of extreme lack of credibility.In this regard  I wish to state that a number ofcountries are eligible for membership of the SecurityCouncil in accordance with the criteria to which I havereferred. One of those countries is Egypt  which hasmade significant contributions to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security in all the political economic and social fields  and which continues tocontribute to the cause of peace and prosperity at theregional level and in the context of its various affiliations.Economic clout has become the principal tool ofcompetition and the determining factor in the distributionof power and influence on the political and economic mapof the globe. At the same time  social development hasbecome a goal which we all pursue and technologicaldevelopment has become a prerequisite of economicprogress and social advancement. It is a challenge thatmust be faced by those who aspire to progress anddevelopment.Recent international developments have highlightedthe strong link between peace  stability and development.Global stability cannot be achieved without balanced andsustainable development. The existing structuralimbalances in international economic relations willcontinue to cause the social turmoil and conflicts that turnunder our eyes to disputes which threaten internationalpeace and security.On its new journey - starting in New York  movingon to Rio de Janeiro and Vienna  passing through Cairoto be continued in Copenhagen and Beijing - the UnitedNations has proved that it remains the global umbrellaunder which different ideas and positions interact.We call on the United Nations not only to contributeto but to lead the process of formulating the new conceptsand ideas required to lay the foundations of the newinternational order and the relations between the Northand the South  particularly in the area of socialdevelopment. This requires an overall process ofrationalization  as indicated by the Secretary-General. In22his current report on the work of the Organization he refersto""the common misperception of the United Nations asan organization dedicated primarily to peace-keeping.""(A/49/1  para. 1)He states that economic and social questions should be atthe forefront of United Nations efforts. That is what shouldhappen."
"52",2166,"ERI",49,1994,"At the outset I wish to seizethis opportunity to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on hiselection as the President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. I am confident that he will guide ourdeliberations with wisdom and skill.Permit me also to rejoice with the people of SouthAfrica  who have at long last eradicated apartheid andcreated a plural society in which all citizens of SouthAfrica shall live in harmony  freedom and equality irrespective of their ethnic  religious or class backgrounds.Their victory is a victory of good over evil and a tribute tothe concept of unity in diversity  as well as a uniqueexample of the concerted  unremitting and successfulstruggle of humanity against a pernicious assault on humandignity and nobility.We are also happy to note that in the Middle East age-old adversaries have come close enough to resolve some ofthe most intractable problems of our time by negotiationsbased on understanding and the accommodation of theinterests of all parties. We welcome the agreementsreached between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO)  as well as subsequent agreementsreached between Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom ofJordan. We hope that this initial move  whosemomentum must be maintained  will augur well for acomprehensive  permanent and enduring peace in theregion as a whole.We have now entered a new era of renewed hope.As the United Nations approaches its golden jubilee  ithas become increasingly evident that the majority of thenations and peoples of the world believe that the worldOrganization is essential and are reposing renewed hopeand confidence in it. In the aftermath of the cold war  weare witnessing a transition towards a new pattern ofinternational relations. With the uncertainty of thehistorical process that is establishing a new world order the United Nations has once again become the eminentlyrelevant  perhaps even the indispensable  Organizationthat its founding fathers wished it to be.The emerging new international system and theuniversality of the membership of the United Nations  aswell as the abundant good will it has garnered  offer it theunique opportunity not only to establish new guidelines toaddress international challenges but to ensure that thecoming new world will be permeated with the values ofcollective security  peace  democracy  social justice andcooperation for mutual benefit. This is also a favourabletime for the United Nations to raise global awareness fashion a common world outlook  probe new frontiers andcreate new standards  particularly in the realms ofsustainable and equitable global development; conflictprevention  management and resolution; human anddemocratic rights; and social justice.Those great tasks  my delegation is convinced  willinevitably require commensurate changes in the structureand functional modalities of the United Nations systemitself  if it is to cope with the challenges of the newinternational order. The institutions and agencies thatreflected the exigencies of the last half-century must bemodified or yield to new ones that mirror not only theoptimism and needs of the present but also the hopes andaspirations of the future. The international system mustturn — obviously  at a gradual and measured pace —towards a fairer and more equitable representation of itsconstituencies in all the organs of the system  andespecially in the Security Council. This may indeed bethe most opportune time to review structural issues withnew vision and boldness  the ultimate purpose being toinstil and build into the system a dynamism that willenable it to respond and adjust promptly to changingglobal realities.20General Assembly 22nd meetingFurthermore  we feel that the United Nations mustplace significant emphasis on the creation of a reliable earlywarning system that would enable it to avert disasters andconflicts. An active  rather than a reactive  role on the partof the United Nations can go a long way towards reducing if not preventing  human suffering and towards mitigatingdisasters and conflicts at reduced cost to the internationalcommunity.Secondly  all available evidence on the structure of theUnited Nations emphasizes the need to restructure it on thebasis of equilibrium between the forces of centralizationand decentralization. Certain problems  such as theenvironment  population and disarmament  may necessitatecoordinated international action and centralized authority.Others  including the breakdown of political systems andregional inter-State conflicts may be better and morecorrectly understood and solved by regional actors institutions and approaches. There is thus an imperative toset in motion a dynamic arrangement balancingcentralization and decentralization to create the desiredjuridical basis for a new world order underpinned by apolitical culture of peace  justice  economic well-being anda healthy environment. Playing such a catalytic role shouldbe the major preoccupation of the United Nations. Onlysuch an environment can make the Organization aneffective actor that protects and promotes peace development and human rights.The situation in the Horn of Africa is far fromsatisfactory  although it may be improving day by day. Imust perhaps emphasize here that the impoverishment thatstalks the region as a whole is largely man-made andcannot be attributed to the vicissitudes of nature  as is oftendone. Decades of war and civil strife have sapped theenergy  productive capacity and problem-solvingmechanisms of the populations  leaving them easilysusceptible to even minor imbalances in rainfall patternsand natural calamities.Hence  international emergency assistance and  evenmore  development assistance will remain vital for years tocome in overcoming the consequences of decades of warand turmoil. We in the Government of Eritrea  along withour regional partners  realize that reliable and sustainableeconomic development will lie in effective regionalcooperation hinging on durable peace and stability. It is inthis spirit that we and our partners are prepared to pool ourresources to secure regional peace through mechanisms ofclose consultation and coordination for conflict preventionand resolution  and by broadening areas of economicinteraction and cooperation.It is against this backdrop  and within the frameworkof a regional approach  that we have attempted to addressthe quest for collective security in our region. In Somaliathe countries of the region  under the chairmanship ofPresident Melles Zenawi of Ethiopia  have done much torestore normalcy to the country by bringing the warringfactions to the negotiating table. This regional effort hascomplemented and acted as a vital linkage to internationalintervention at a number of crucial junctures.In this connection  we believe that this is anauspicious moment for the United Nations to decide tofocus in the period ahead only on the provision ofassistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of thedevastated country of Somalia. The opinion advanced bysome in the last few days that the extension of themandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM) is vital for and will enhance politicalreconciliation is  we are convinced  seriously flawed.Indeed  all evidence from the country indicates that suchaction is likely to complicate or delay the process. Onthe other hand  the Inter-Governmental Authority onDrought and Development (IGADD) should take uponitself  and be encouraged to continue  the politicalreconciliation it has facilitated in the past.In the Sudan  the countries of the region haveapplied the same regional approach and have proposeddifferent frameworks of conflict resolution to facilitate acomprehensive political settlement that takes into accountthe best interests and welfare of both sides. Here  too the international community should encourage and supportthe regional efforts undertaken under the auspices ofIGADD.Some of the major problems that have existed formany years are still with us and  indeed  there are nownew ones. Thus  the crisis in the former Yugoslavia doesnot appear to be any nearer to solution. The events inRwanda are a tragic reminder of human folly and haveetched an indelible mark on the collective conscience ofhumanity. These events no doubt reinforce the necessityfor preventive measures and perhaps the need to make afresh assessment of the conventional limitations of theUnited Nations in peace-keeping."
"53",2212,"ESP",49,1994,"Ishould like to convey to you  Sir  my warmestcongratulations on your election to the presidency of thisAssembly and to wish you great success in the performanceof your duties. With your election  the members of theGeneral Assembly recognize in your country  Côte d’Ivoire the decisive contribution of Africa to the work of theOrganization. I am confident that the General Assemblywill follow the course of consensus that was set in theprevious session  under the leadership of AmbassadorInsanally  to whom I should like to pay a warm tribute.Moreover  I wish to once again assure Mr.Boutros-Ghali  who honoured us last April with his officialvisit to my country  of the full cooperation of the Spanishauthorities in assisting him in the difficult task he faces ofmeeting the increasingly complex challenges with whichour Organization is faced.The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the FederalRepublic of Germany  in his address on behalf of theEuropean Union  has set forth our common points of viewin this general debate. These reflect the advances made onthe path to a common foreign and security policy  which isa major goal of the Union. On behalf of my delegation  Iwish now to consider some issues in more detail.The fundamental changes in the international systemthat we have witnessed in recent years have provided theUnited Nations with the great opportunity finally toestablish itself as the venue for the universal harmonizationof the efforts of the international community to fulfil thecommon purposes contained in its Charter. However they have also confronted the Organization with one ofthe greatest challenges in its history. Some have evencast doubt on the actual ability of the United Nations tocontribute effectively to the solution of the many conflictsthat have arisen or have been rekindled over the past fewyears.After the first shock  provoked by crises such asthose in the former Yugoslavia  Somalia and Angola  wehave been confronted with appalling situations such asthat in Rwanda  where the Organization’s limited meanshave unfortunately proved insufficient to redress theplight of millions of human beings.At the same time  the United Nations  with itsresources stretched to the limit  is undergoing a financialcrisis which can be addressed only with the resolutecooperation of the Member States. This should entail first of all  the timely payment of their financialcontributions  an obligation specified in the Charter. Onlythen will the Organization have the necessary means toachieve its objectives. Moreover  these means must beused in the most effective possible way.Beyond the efforts for renewal already achieved orin progress  we must undertake a process of carefulconsideration at the highest level  with a view to decidingwhether we are willing to provide the Organization withthe legal  material and financial instruments it needs tomeet successfully the growing demands made on it by theinternational community. The credibility of the UnitedNations is at stake.The reform of the Security Council is an extremelyimportant and complex matter  which will have to beaccomplished through a careful process of dialogueleading to an understanding among all Member States.Spain  which in the last two years has been anon-permanent member of the Security Council  reiteratesits position in favour of a revision  without undue haste of the composition and functioning of the SecurityCouncil  based on the criteria of representativity efficiency and transparency  with the ultimate goal ofreinforcing the legitimacy of the actions of the Council.Spain  which has taken and will continue to take anactive part in the meetings of the Ad Hoc Working Groupof this Assembly  favours a moderate increase of theCouncil’s membership. This would allow for a morefrequent presence in the Council of States with specific13weight and influence in international relations  and whichare  likewise  able and willing to contribute in a significantway to the maintenance of international peace and securityand to fulfil the other purposes of the United Nations. Theenlarged composition of the Council will also facilitateequitable geographical distribution among the differentregions of the world.Frightening events  such as those in Rwanda  make itmore necessary than ever to continue the strengthening ofthe indispensable machinery for action required to executethe increasingly broad and complex mandates given by theSecurity Council to peace-keeping operations.First of all  we must further improve the managementand control mechanisms here in New York. The Secretariathas already made a major effort to strengthen theDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations by adding aSituation Centre  enlarging the Office of the MilitaryAdviser and giving a boost to the planning unit.Secondly  in order to speed up the effective launchingof operations  the provisions relating to standbyarrangements for peace-keeping should come into effect.Spain is prepared to participate in this mechanism  whichshould be broadened to include the police components ofpeace operations  as well as transport-related equipment andlogistics in general.Thirdly  it is important to face the issues relating tothe safety of the personnel of the peace-keeping operations.Many casualties have been suffered by United Nationsforces and humanitarian-assistance personnel  among themSpanish nationals who gave their lives in the quest forpeace.The setting up of an Ad Hoc Committee on the safetyand security of United Nations and associated personnel  inparticular those involved in peace-keeping operations  hasbeen a step in the right direction  and we hope that the draftinternational convention on this matter will be adopted.Notwithstanding the continuous efforts of theinternational community and of many of the political forcesin the area  peace has not yet arrived in the Balkans. It istrue that developments have occurred that give us cause forhope. We have witnessed a new international cohesiveness which we must preserve at all costs. A rapprochement hastaken place between the Croat and Muslim communities which has led to the agreements reached on federation. Iam pleased to underscore the important role that theEuropean Union is playing in the town of Mostar as acontribution to this process. Spain is activelyparticipating in this effort; this is the area in which theSpanish contingent in the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) is carrying out its mission.We welcome the establishment of the InternationalTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible forSerious Violations of International Humanitarian LawCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia.We trust that the experience gained by this ad hoctribunal will serve as an incentive to the GeneralAssembly to give favourable consideration to theproposed statute of an international criminal court  apermanent body with universal jurisdiction  which wasdrafted by the International Law Commission  and thatthis idea - which is not new - will come to fruition verysoon.Spain welcomes the process of political andeconomic transition in which the countries of Central andEastern Europe are currently involved. Their futureaccession to the European Union and their progressiveintegration in the security mechanisms of the continentwill contribute to the stability of Europe.We are also witnessing important moves towardsdemocracy and a free-market economy in the RussianFederation and in the other States that emerged from theformer Soviet Union. Spain supports these changes  astheir success will contribute not only to strengtheningsecurity in Europe but to world peace as well.The community of Ibero-American nations hasendowed itself with a political forum of considerableimportance; this year  in Cartagena  Colombia  it onceagain voiced satisfaction at the progress made on the pathto democracy and economic modernization.Wherever internal armed conflicts are still active  asin Guatemala  we are witnessing a negotiation processpromoted by and under the auspices of the UnitedNations  with the assistance of the ""Group of Friends"".Both the Government of Guatemala and the Unidadrevolucionaria nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) are fullyengaged in this process  with the ultimate goal ofachieving national reconciliation and full respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.The delicate situation in Cuba calls for an additionaleffort to promote dialogue and cooperation to makepossible the final incorporation of both the Governmentand the people of Cuba into the democratic current that is14flowing through the continent at the present time. Dialogueis essential. Inventive solutions among Cubans  withoutexcluding anyone  should be encouraged  with a view toopening up new democratic possibilities leading to apeaceful transition  with due respect for human rights national sovereignty and fundamental freedoms. TheGovernment of Spain  which remains opposed to theembargo that has been imposed  notes with satisfaction thetalks taking place between Washington and Havana  wherethese issues can be addressed.The Government of Spain is attentively following thesituation in Haiti  with a view to the full implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940 (1994) which will involve the return of the President legitimatelyelected by the Haitian people. The international communitywill have to concentrate its efforts on the reconstruction ofthe country  so that democracy may rest on solidfoundations guaranteeing constitutional rule of law andrespect for human rights.Spain attaches particular importance to theestablishment of a new process of dialogue and cooperationin the Mediterranean that will make it possible to tackle theeconomic  demographic and cultural differences existing inthe region  and to bring peace and prosperity to theMediterranean area.My country has special ties of friendship andcooperation with the Maghreb countries and is striving tomake a practical contribution to overcoming the problemsexisting in this area  to which Spain attaches great priority.The Spanish Government considers that the solution tothe problem of the Western Sahara lies in the holding of areferendum on self-determination with all appropriateinternational guarantees. My Government again expressesits support for the Secretary-General and his SpecialRepresentative in their efforts to ensure progress inimplementing the settlement plan accepted by the partiesand  in accordance with the relevant Security Councilresolutions  creating the necessary conditions for theforthcoming holding of the referendum to which I havereferred.The Spanish Government has expressed on manyoccasions  its profound satisfaction at the progress achievedin the Middle East peace process  which started at theMadrid Conference. Thanks to the determination andcourage of the interested parties  1994 has been a year ofsignificant achievements on the path to peace andunderstanding. Spain has always supported the need for alasting and comprehensive peace  in conformity withSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).Spain urges the parties and all the States in the region  onthe basis of their clear and unanimous rejection ofviolence and the use of force  to coordinate all effortsnecessary to attain the desired goals of peace anddevelopment.This year  we have witnessed events of remarkableimportance in sub-Saharan Africa. Some have struck amarkedly hopeful note  whereas others - such as thetragedy of Rwanda and the difficulties in the peaceprocess in Somalia - have demonstrated the fragility ofthe continent’s structures.Rwanda has appalled us. We have witnessed thehorrors of civil war with a feeling of bitterness and evenof impotence. Despite the efforts of the internationalcommunity  in which my country is actively participating no solution is yet in sight to this crisis or to the problemposed by the millions of displaced people and refugees -a problem which  moreover  is having seriousrepercussions on the stability of the neighbouringcountries.Those responsible for the atrocities  includinggenocide  committed in Rwanda must be brought tojustice individually. Hence  Spain supports the work ofthe Commission of Experts established under SecurityCouncil resolution 935 (1994)  which we activelypromoted and co-sponsored  as well as the work of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the SpecialRapporteur for Rwanda. These events are extremelyserious and we must make an urgent legal response tothem through the establishment of an ad hoc jurisdictionfor Rwanda  following the model already provided by theTribunal established to deal with the former Yugoslavia.South Africa has been the other side of the coin.We are gratified at its return to the General Assembly asa full-fledged Member of the United Nations  now thatthe apartheid system has been abolished and a democraticand non-racial Government has been installed.In southern Africa  likewise  we are following withthe greatest interest  because of their importance  theprocesses aimed at peace in Angola and Mozambique.We hope that the Angolan Government and UNITA willshortly conclude a lasting peace agreement that will putan end to decades of suffering. We hope that inMozambique the coming elections will consolidatenational reconciliation. Spain will contribute to the15peaceful and democratic holding of these elections bysending observers.The decolonization of Gibraltar is a priority goal ofthe Spanish Government. The General Assembly hasclearly established the doctrine that the decolonization ofGibraltar is a case not of self-determination but of therestoration of Spain’s territorial integrity. I wish here toreiterate the Spanish Government’s firm resolve to continuethe process of negotiation with the Government of theUnited Kingdom  in a constructive spirit and on the basesof the Declaration of Brussels of 27 November 1984  takingduly into account the legitimate interests of the population.The Government of Spain expresses its profound hope thatthese negotiations will put an end to this colonialanachronism.Disarmament and arms control are fundamental factorsin the maintenance of international peace and security.Accordingly  during this year Spain has adopted a unilateralmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines  hasratified the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictionson the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which MayBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to HaveIndiscriminate Effects and was among the first States toratify the chemical weapons Convention. We also supportthe unconditional and indefinite extension of the non-proliferation Treaty and the early conclusion of a nucleartest-ban treaty.Moreover  Spain hopes that a final decision on theenlargement of the membership of the Conference onDisarmament will be adopted shortly  thereby allowing forthe full participation of countries which  like Spain  havedemonstrated for many years their full commitment to thework of the Conference.The close relationship between peace and developmentis especially well reflected in the report on agenda fordevelopment submitted last May by the Secretary-General.I wish to state my satisfaction at the publication of thisreport. We share the approach presented by theSecretary-General  which is based on the principle thatdevelopment is a fundamental right and the strongestfoundation for peace. We welcome the idea of defining thefive principal dimensions of development that are set forthin the agenda - that is  peace as the basic foundation  theeconomy as the engine of progress  the environment as abasis for sustainability  justice as a pillar of society  anddemocracy as a guarantor of good governance.We must now determine what actions are required inorder to implement the agenda and formulate specificrecommendations on the assumption that developmentcannot be reduced to a simple economic dimension  butmust  rather  be considered from its political  cultural environmental  social and humanitarian angles. Only bymeans of this comprehensive approach will we be able totackle the deep inequalities and serious problems affectingdeveloping countries.Furthermore  the financial resources devoted to thisend should be used in a more rational and efficient way.To achieve this  we must continue to restructure theeconomic and social sectors of the Organization and ofthe United Nations system  particularly by strengtheningeven further the coordinating role of the Economic andSocial Council.In activities to promote development the protectionof the environment should always be taken into account.Starting next year  Spain will participate in the work ofthe Commission on Sustainable Development  which at itslast session dealt for the first time with theimplementation of ""Agenda 21"" and of other agreementsreached at the Rio Summit.The global conferences convened by the UnitedNations play an outstanding role in the search foruniversal consensus on development. The Programme ofAction adopted in Cairo by the International Conferenceon Population and Development will pave the way for anew demographic policy  and places women at the axis ofevery population policy. The key role played by womenin development will also be highlighted during the FourthWorld Conference on Women  to be held in Beijing inSeptember 1995.The World Summit for Social Development  whichwill be convened in Copenhagen in March 1995  must likewise  direct us to a new way of facing social problemsin the world  based on the principle that human beingsshould be the core and ultimate goal of development.Nobody can doubt the importance of the protection promotion and defence of human rights as fundamentaltasks of both Member States and the United Nations.Intolerance  inequalities of all kinds and violations offundamental rights still endanger the lives  the freedomand the safety of millions of human beings. In order toeradicate these evils  we must honour the commitmentsundertaken during the Vienna World Conference onHuman Rights and redouble our efforts to put into16practice principles that  although universally acknowledged are not universally observed.The United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights  the office which was created by this Assembly lastyear  and whose first incumbent is Ambassador AyalaLasso  must be able to perform his duties properly. To thisend  it is essential to ensure that he has the adequatebudgetary means and sufficient personnel  as well as thesupport and cooperation of all Member States. Suchpersonnel and additional means should also be madeavailable to the Centre for Human Rights.In 1995 we shall commemorate the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. This will be an opportunity toreflect both on the Organization’s accomplishments - whichare not negligible - and on the challenges it will face. Welive in an increasingly complex and dynamic internationalsociety  in which it is no longer possible totally to separatenational issues from international ones  nor to divide thetasks of the Organization into watertight compartments.Mankind’s full development will be achieved only when itsmultiple aspects  which are complementary andinterdependent  are taken into account. The path to a betterworld  in which the United Nations continues to play afundamental role  must be taken together by all the peoplesof the world  as we are reminded by the motto of thefiftieth-anniversary commemoration. That is also the firmconviction of the Government and the people of Spain."
"54",2238,"EST",49,1994,"I should like to congratulateMr. Essy on his election as President of this  the forty-ninth  session of the General Assembly. The Estonianpeople wish him all the best in this post.Today is a day of national mourning in my country.Late last night  amid stormy autumn winds  the passengerand car ferry Estonia  sailing from Tallinn to Stockholm sank at high sea. Nearly 100 people have been saved  andrescue efforts are continuing. But most of the over 850people who were aboard the Estonia are presumed to bedead. I should like to thank the President and all those whohave expressed their sorrow and sent condolences.In this painful loss  we can draw some solace fromthe global teamwork we have seen in the rescue efforts.Last night demonstrated beyond a doubt that the BalticSea is a sea of cooperation. Swedish  Finnish  Danishand Estonian rescue units worked together  and we hadoffers of help from Russia  the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and countless others. On behalf ofmy Government  I thank all of those who helped us withthe rescue effort. The spirit of international cooperationsets a fine example for all of us here today.Today my country comes before this forum for thefirst time in half a century unfettered by the problem ofthe presence of foreign troops on our soil. The role theUnited Nations played in helping to remove the lastvestiges of the Second World War was not small. It istherefore a special privilege for me to speak here today.It is also not insignificant that this new era in thehistory of Estonia  Latvia and Germany coincides with theupcoming fiftieth anniversary of the founding of theUnited Nations. These two events would seem to call forsolemn reflection on the past or at least a joyouscelebration of the moment. But most of all  this new erarequires new approaches. Post-war security - be the warhot or cold - still hangs in a delicate balance. Because itis up to all of us  collectively  to decide which way thescales tip  I wish to focus on the future  on how we inEstonia are approaching this new era  and on some of theideas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations thatwe believe deserve special attention in the next few years.On 31 August  we marked the withdrawal of troops.The celebrations and commemorations of this eventsymbolized the end of one era and the beginning ofanother. The withdrawal of the troops has had atremendous effect in bringing us closer to normalizationof relations with the Russian Federation  and we sincerelyhope that the problem of officers who were demobilizedon our territory against the spirit and the letter of thetroop-withdrawal treaty will be solved. The troopwithdrawal was also a major step towards achievingsecurity in the Baltic region. But the problem of Balticsecurity has not yet been solved - far from it.One dimension of moving towards bona fide securityundoubtedly lies in trying to improve relations with theRussian Federation. The potential for good will is in theair  and it is our duty  on both sides of the 1920 TartuPeace Treaty  to seize the moment and make that peaceagain. We might call this policy towards Russia one ofpositive engagement. This would involve  among other24qualities  mutual respect for sovereignty  mutual respect fornational security interests  mutual refraining from verbaland other confrontation  and mutual respect for internationalnorms of behaviour  particularly in the area of humanrights.We are willing to expend considerable energy to repaira relationship that has been historically so complex. To doso is not only in our own interest and in that of Russia  butin the interest of regional  European and therefore globalsecurity as well. I would emphasize  however  that in orderfor this policy to be successful  it must be mutual. If  onthe other hand  our efforts are not reciprocated  then wemust be prepared to expend our energy in different ways.Lately  we have noted with great concern talk ofcreating new spheres of influence. We hear continuing useof the phrase ""the near abroad"". We observe similarattitudes in discussions about the enlargement of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. Weare already well past the initial stages of building aEuropean security structure. A viable framework  based onshared values  that includes Central and East EuropeanStates is nearly in place. It is not only late but unacceptableto ponder the plans of architects who speak of spheres ofinfluence and to consult contractors who wish to build onsand or  worse  on a slippery slope.There are some specific ways in which the UnitedNations can take advantage of the historic opportunity itfaces to encourage principled behaviour. One of them is torender peace-keeping more effective by strengtheningpeace-keeping mechanisms  including the dissemination ofbetter and more timely information to all Member States inorder to garner the support necessary for any collectiveaction. Rather than abdicating responsibility  whether dueto benign neglect  expediency or funding problems  andallowing large States to act unilaterally  it means holding allStates in all regions to the same standards. It goes withoutsaying that in lending its name to any peacekeepingoperations  the United Nations must stand by thefundamental principles of neutrality and multilateralism.The United Nations should never become a mask behindwhich one country tries to assert dominance over anotherby means of peace-keeping.Let me add that Estonia is actively developing its ownpeace-keeping force  to be put  perhaps next year  at thedisposal of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.Another area in which more effective mechanisms andmore stringent standards are needed is that of human rights as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and plan of actionof last year. I would stress the importance of the newlyestablished Office of the High Commissioner for HumanRights taking on this task. We wish High CommissionerAyala Lasso success in this most important andchallenging endeavour.We believe the High Commissioner can beinstrumental not only in improving the effectiveness ofthe United Nations human rights mechanisms  but also inholding this body to strict standards. We believe that allStates should be measured according to the same humanrights standards. I could not agree more with theobservation made by Russian Federation President BorisYeltsin two days ago in this forum that""neither a selective approach nor double standardsare permissible."" (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Forty-ninth Session  Plenary Meetings 5th meeting  p. 2)Indeed  exceptions cannot be made on the basis of thesize of a nation  its cultural heritage or the politicaldelicacy of the situation. The standards that are appliedto one country must be valid for all others - in otherwords  there should be no elastic rulers.In this regard  allow me to remind the Assembly ofan open letter - an appeal  really  to morality in foreignpolicy - which was signed by a host of politicalluminaries and published in September of last year in TheWall Street Journal. I quote from the letter  entitled""What the West Must Do In Bosnia"":""Even if  like Kuwait in August 1990  allBosnia (and not just Sarajevo) were seized  it wouldbe essential for the democracies to make clear  asthey did in the case of Kuwait  that violent borderchanges and ethnic cleansing will not stand. If theWest does not make that clear  it will have nothingpersuasive to say ..."".Sadly  the message in that letter remains applicabletoday. If the world’s democracies  led by the UnitedNations  do not speak out for morality in the area ofhuman rights  we will lose our ability to influence thecourse of events. Democracies must be willing to standby the principles upon which our States and societies arebased. It is our sincere hope that non-selectiveapplication of human rights standards will become therule  not the exception.25A third way the United Nations can take advantage ofthis moment is to consider the global changes that havetaken place since 1945. Then  in the immediate post-warperiod  the composition of the Security Council wasestablished by drawing a sharp distinction between thevictors and the vanquished. Times have changed. Wemust now take into account the positive role that someStates in particular play in the international arena. And Ihave in mind here Germany and Japan  States that havemore than demonstrated their commitment to democracyduring the last 50 years. Estonia strongly supports grantingGermany and Japan permanent-member status in theSecurity Council as a recognition of their accomplishmentsand an acknowledgement of their stabilizing role in worldaffairs.I would turn now briefly to Estonia’s vision of itsfuture role in the United Nations. Now that the issueswhich had hitherto demanded our intense attention havebeen more or less solved  we are freer to devote moreenergy to wider issues that affect all of us. I am speakinghere of global phenomena such as terrorism  organizedcrime  drug trafficking and smuggling of radioactivematerials as well as health and social issues andenvironmental problems. These are issues that know noborders  and dealing with them requires a collective efforton our part.On this  the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  we face an enormous challenge. The war- I mean the Second World War - is finally over. But thereal battle - to safeguard human and civil rights for allpersons  to strengthen security for all States  to preserve acontinent undivided - this battle has only just begun. Withintelligence  perseverance  goodwill  and a little luck  thenations gathered here can unite in the battle to make thenext 50 years more constructive than the last."
"55",2284,"ETH",49,1994,"Allow me first to extend toAmbassador Amara Essy heartfelt congratulations on hisunanimous election to preside over the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly. His election is a fitting tributeboth to him and to his country  Côte d’Ivoire. Whileexpressing our confidence in his skills and capacity to guidethis session to a successful conclusion  I wish to assure himof the full cooperation of my delegation in the discharge ofthe heavy responsibility he has assumed.I wish also to join the heads of delegations who spokebefore me in the very pleasant task of welcoming the newdemocratic South Africa into the United Nations. Therecent happy events in South Africa mark a turning point inthe history of Africa. They have opened up new vistas forfruitful economic cooperation across the African continentand have allowed the international community to bevictorious over institutional racism.It has now been a few years since the internationalcommunity entered into a new era that is relatively freeof ideological polarization. The nuclear confrontation thathad haunted the international community before the endof the cold war is now more or less behind us. Thedemise of the cold war has in this regard contributed tothe lifting of the thick veil that had hindered theappreciation of our interdependence. None of the majorproblems of the present world can be effectively dealtwith in the absence of an approach that takes seriouslythe fact that we live in an interdependent world. Thechallenges of the environment  the problems of climatechange  the unrestrained growth in population andquestions of economic growth and development  amongothers  are all issues that call for greater cooperationbetween States.It is not too early for us to assess to what extent theinternational community has taken advantage of newopportunities and  with the major obstacles to joint actionhaving now been removed  how much progress the worldhas made in addressing the critical problems facing us.Some of these ostensibly affect only part of humanity but  in fact  are directly or indirectly the problems of theinternational community as a whole.The ever-deteriorating economic and socialconditions faced by the majority of the peoples in thedeveloping world and the abject poverty in which they arecondemned to live are the most critical challenge facingthe world. The effects of this reality reverberate throughall aspects of international life  and they impinge on allissues now routinely accepted as the common challengesof the international community. Actions designed to dealwith concerns related to international peace and security to the environment  to climate change  to populationgrowth and development and to a host of otherinterrelated concerns will remain only off-target and  atbest  partial measures if most of the developing world isallowed to continue to wallow in poverty  and if  as aconsequence  despair and hopelessness continue to be thedominant mood of present and future generations in theSouth.In Africa  for instance  where a genuine fear ofmarginalization in international economic cooperation hasin recent years become the prevailing mood  much of theexplanation for the scale  intensity and duration of theconflicts must be sought in the continent’s continuingeconomic decline and in the consequent social malaiseand hopelessness generated by that sad reality. Theeconomic history of Africa over the last two decades is21one of precipitate decline. The 1980s was a lost decade but the first half of the present one is proving to be nobetter.Each African conflict may have its own unique localas well as extra-local features  but all of them  in one wayor another  grow out of the humanly impossible economicand social situations that provide societies with neither hopenor a future.From Liberia to Somalia and from Rwanda toBurundi  what Africa has been witnessing in recent years isthe virtual collapse  under the weight of unbearableeconomic and social difficulties  not only of State structuresbut also of traditional values and norms of socialorganization.It seems therefore overdue for the United Nations when it comes to addressing conflict situations such asthose in Africa  to think and to act with the clearassumption that traditional notions of preventive diplomacy peace-keeping and peace-making  although important  arenot enough to maintain the peace and to make it durable.""An Agenda for Peace"" will be far from sufficient if it doenot go side by side with  and made an integral part of  ""AnAgenda for Development"".In our part of the world  the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) took up a huge challenge when it decided toincrease its capacity by setting up a mechanism for theprevention  management and resolution of conflicts. Thisis an important step that requires the effective assistance ofthe international community  and we are appreciative of thesupport already being given to the OAU by some countries.But we have no illusions: even if the OAU had thecapacity required to carry out its mandate in preventivediplomacy  it would not necessarily be able to makesubstantial inroads in ensuring durable peace in thecontinent.Nor can the United Nations and the internationalcommunity do any better unless the challenges faced inconnection with preventive measures in the economic andsocial areas are taken up in the most serious manner andunless the economic and social decline of Africa isreversed. The bottom line is that no African country cancategorically be said to be immune from the political andsocial consequences of the immense level of economicdecline  which can be arrested only with the requisite levelof international economic cooperation and developmentpartnership. This  incidentally  could also be a way toarrest and contain all varieties of extremism.It seems to us that it is only with the foregoing inmind and with the full appreciation of the very complexnature of some of the conflict situations in Africa that theUnited Nations can be an effective factor for peace inAfrica. This approach would also allow the internationalcommunity to appreciate fully actual movement  nomatter how small  in the right direction towards theresolution of specific conflict situations in Africa. Thevalidity of this is most clearly to be seen in the prevailingsituation in Somalia.More than a few still view the situation in Somaliaas having shown no improvement and believe thatconditions in that country have in fact deteriorated. Thatview is probably the major reason for the increasing callsfor the speedy withdrawal of the United NationsOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) from Somalia. Thatview is also certainly behind the latest Security Councilresolution on Somalia.The situation in Somalia  and most particularly insome parts of that country  is clearly still far fromnormal  and there is no question that the overall situationin the country is very fluid. The internationalcommunity’s frustration at the slow pace of the national-reconciliation process and at the lack of sufficientcommitment by all sides in Somalia to their responsibilityto sort out their own problems as speedily as possible isalso understandable  and this is also our concern.But the feeling that conditions in the country havebecome hopeless and that the general trend in Somaliaholds no promise is not born of what has been takingplace there since late last year. That the situation inSomalia today  from the point of view both of the levelof armed clashes and of dialogue between Somalis of allfactions  is far better than it was a year ago  or indeed afew months ago  cannot seriously be doubted.No one can pretend to have a ready-made solutionto the problem of power-sharing in Somalia  which hasbeen one of the major hurdles preventing nationalreconciliation. The OAU and the countries of thesubregion have continued to do everything possible toassist the Somalis to meet this challenge  firmlyconvinced that the agenda for peace and nationalreconciliation in the country should be set by Somalisthemselves and that the role of extra-Somali parties including that of UNOSOM  is to assist in the process.We believe that this has been a very fruitful approach. Itis the one that has been adopted from the very beginningby President Meles Zenawi  whose OAU colleagues have22given him the responsibility of following developments inSomalia.From his station in Mogadishu  President Meles’senvoy has been maintaining very close contact with thevarious Somali factions. Our general assessment is that thetrends in Somalia are encouraging and that the Somalis aretaking the first hesitant steps to sort out their problems.Although there is no guarantee of success  the generalthrust of developments in Somalia is worthy of the supportof the international community.At this time last year UNOSOM was engaged in heavycombat with some Somali factions  and its presence inSomalia did not enjoy universal acceptance there. Today the situation has changed so dramatically that there isconsensus in the country that UNOSOM should stay  oneway or another  until national reconciliation is achieved. Itwould indeed be ironic if the international community wereto choose to ignore Somalia precisely when the situation ischanging for the better.The efforts of the countries of the Horn of Africa inthe search for solutions to situations of conflicts have notbeen limited to Somalia. It is little more than a year sincewe in the subregion deployed the initiative of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development(IGADD) with a view to assisting in the resolution of thelong-standing conflict in the Sudan - a conflict which hascreated a deep rift in Sudanese society  and whoseimplications for peace and security  as well as for the socialand economic development of our region  are very greatindeed.In the course of the negotiations  the IGADDCommittee’s major goal was to help the parties to identifyand address the central issues that have been the sources ofthe conflict in the Sudan - a country characterized byreligious  ethnic and racial diversity. Pursuant toinstructions from our Heads of State  the IGADDCommittee of Foreign Ministers attempted  in a series ofrounds of negotiation  to help the parties to narrow theirdifferences over the root causes of the conflict and to arriveat a formula for overcoming the deep crisis affecting theircountries. Because the IGADD process induced the partiesto focus on the critical issues in the conflict  positions havebecome well defined. The degree of polarity reflected inthese positions reveals the gravity of the root causes andexplains why the talks have come to deadlock. Thus  theIGADD peace process is at a crossroads in that thepositions of the parties have hardened  and the mediatorsare left to choose between abandoning their efforts anddeveloping alternative strategies in response to the crisis.Faced with this situation  the Ministerial Committeewas compelled ultimately to refer the matter back to theIGADD Committee of Heads of State  which met recentlyin Nairobi. The Heads of State  while recognizing thelogjam that has been created in the process of negotiation have none the less unanimously decided that there is noalternative to continuing with the peace effort. The majorconsideration here has been the conviction of the Headsof State that a persisting crisis in the Sudan would be notonly a cause of continuing bloodshed in that country butalso a major source of instability and lack of peace in thesubregion.In this regard  the importance of the internationalcommunity’s input towards breaking the logjam in theIGADD peace initiative in the Sudan can hardly beunderestimated. A solution to the problem can come onlythrough the continued efforts of the countries of theregion and the international community’s support forthose efforts.We in Ethiopia have had more than our share of thetragedies associated with conflicts. It is three years sincepeace was restored to the country following three decadesof civil war and internal strife. Over the past three yearsthe Transitional Government has focused its attention onthree broad concerns - the restoration of peace andstability; the democratization of the political process including the creation of conditions for enforcing the ruleof law and setting up democratic institutions; and theliberalization of the economy and the freeing of theeconomic sector from the strait-jacket of the commandeconomy imposed on our peoples by the militaryGovernment.One of the unique aspects of the democratizationprocess in Ethiopia has been the very extensivedevolution of power to all regions of the country. In acountry known for its excessive centralization of power -something that was pushed to absurdity by the previousGovernment: the major reason for the absence of peacein Ethiopia for so long - the new relationship between thecentre and the regions is becoming a promisingarrangement for genuine and meaningful participation ofthe people  at the grass-roots level  in the political processof their country. We believe that once democracybecomes relevant to the average person and at the grassroots  it will prove to be durable because the strugglebetween autocracy and democratic forms of governance23will not then be between very narrow  elite groups  whetherfrom the military or from other sectors of society.As we approach the end of the period of transition inEthiopia  we can say with full confidence that we have  byand large  achieved all the major objectives set for thatperiod. Until three years ago Ethiopia’s name wasassociated with political instability and civil war. TodayEthiopia has not only achieved peace but also become afactor for peace in its own subregion and beyond  as isvividly demonstrated by the Ethiopian peace-keepingcontingent in Rwanda.Moreover  we have been gratified by the recentsuccessful elections for a Constituent Assembly  which willbe convened very soon to prepare a constitution on thebasis of which a general election will be held to install thefirst-ever democratically elected Government in the country.In the course of the last three years  we in Ethiopiahave benefited immensely from the generous assistance ofthe international community  for which we are verygrateful. This assistance was again demonstrated during therecent drought  which affected over 7 million people.Thanks to the assistance of the international community  tothe role the Ethiopian people themselves played and to thetimely  effective measures taken by the Government  theeffects of a drought that could have caused massive loss oflife  dislocation and displacement commensurate with thoseof the 1984-1985 drought were successfully contained.Even though Ethiopia has now started to stand on itsown feet  we cannot pretend that we have even remotelybegun to address the major challenges still facing us. Thefledgling democratic process in a country with nodemocratic traditions will continue to be a major challenge.But the political will to solidify grass-roots democracy willalways be there  among other things because the survival ofcountries as diverse as Ethiopia can be ensured only on thebasis of democratic governance. However  the linchpin ofthe success of democracy in Ethiopia  as is also true for allsimilarly situated countries  is sustainable economic growthand development. Citizens who see no future forthemselves or for their offspring can hardly be counted on- and for understandable reasons - to be a bedrock forstable Governments  without which democracy will havelittle chance of flourishing.None the less  even in the economic sector we havemade some notable gains  and our cooperation with theinternational financial institutions has so far been veryencouraging. But the challenges ahead of us are immense and we will continue to count on the support of theinternational community to help us put our country firmlyon the path of sustainable growth and development.One of the major positive outcomes of the demise ofthe cold war has been the new confidence placed inmultilateral approaches to solving the major problemsfaced by our interdependent world. The United Nations as the finest expression of multilateralism  has thus beengiven a new opportunity to make a difference in theworld and to spearhead the efforts of the internationalcommunity for peace and development. In this context the democratization of the United Nations at all levels and greater transparency in the operation of the organs ofthe Organization  including that of the Security Counciland of the Secretariat  are some of the required stepswhich will guarantee that the United Nations can play tothe fullest its potential appropriate role as the foremostmultilateral organization with the full confidence ofpeoples in the North as well as in the South. For ourpart  we will continue to do our share  and do all that isnecessary to assist the United Nations in achieving itsnoble objectives and goals."
"56",2330,"FIN",49,1994,"Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at this forty-ninth session. I amconfident that with your long and intimate knowledge of theUnited Nations we shall come to a successful conclusion ofthis session.Since we met a year ago  the world has witnessed bothpositive and negative developments. The latter deserve theparticular attention of this Assembly. Nevertheless  let mebegin by referring to some of the positive ones.One major development is the progress that has beenmade toward peace in the Middle East. The seeminglyimpossible is turning into reality. The United Nations mustnow be available to the parties concerned in the search fora comprehensive settlement in the region. It must alsoassist in the process of peace building and reconstruction.The Government of Finland welcomes the return ofSouth Africa to the General Assembly  now with thecredentials of a free  democratic and non-racial MemberState. South Africa has the full potential of becoming astabilizing political and economic force in Africa. It hasalready made a positive contribution to world security byabolishing  under international verification  its nuclear-weapons programme.In the immediate vicinity of Finland  the withdrawalof Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia has put an endto one of the painful legacies of the Second World War. Iam confident that the remaining problems in the relationsbetween the Baltic States and Russia will be solved in thesame spirit as that which helped resolve the issues of troopwithdrawals.My Government also welcomes the cease-fire inNorthern Ireland declared by the Irish Republican Army.We hope that this will facilitate an early and lastingsolution acceptable to all.There are also encouraging signs in the worldeconomy  particularly regarding the multilateral tradesystem. It is now urgent to implement the results of theUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade  including the establishment of the World TradeOrganization. Other issues on the trade agenda  such astrade and environment  also need to be addressed.These positive developments to which I havereferred have one thing in common: they would not havebeen possible without courageous leadership. Theyillustrate the fact that patient and visionary leadership isnecessary in solving problems facing the internationalcommunity.Turning now to negative developments  there are stillmany conflicts that neither the parties concerned nor theinternational community have been willing or able tosolve. The abhorrent tragedies in the former Yugoslavia Rwanda and Somalia have caused suffering to millions ofinnocent people. They are frightening examples of ourinability to act when national leadership fails andintra-State conflicts threaten international peace andsecurity.The Security Council has the primary responsibilityfor the maintenance of international peace and security but it cannot - nor should it - act as a substitute for theMember States or their Governments. It is a dangerousand fallacious impression that the United Nations could orshould always step in to rectify irresponsible actions andpolicies  nor can it be expected to be present forever inconflict areas. It is also obvious that the United Nationswill never be in a position to dispose of enough resourcesto meet all demands.We must seek new ways and approaches. We mustbe able to prevent fires before they start. Too often conflicts erupt because of a lack of preventive action andmisperceived faith in the readiness and the ability of theUnited Nations to step in. It is clear that preventivemeasures should be given a greater role in theOrganization’s work on conflict resolution.In the present United Nations peace-keeping system political oversight  planning and military command andcontrol need to be improved and the budgetary systemstreamlined. Moreover  we are increasingly challenged bycomplex emergencies  which include political  militaryand humanitarian concerns. These cannot be addressedthrough traditional peace-keeping efforts alone. Theyrequire a comprehensive approach and sustained effortsby the States concerned  as well as the assistance ofregional arrangements and organizations.Today  economic  social and humanitarian problemscan be discussed without the veil of ideology. We cannow address issues such as poverty  population  socialjustice and human rights without engaging in a contest ofcompeting social systems. The linkage of world peace18with economic and social development  with the rule of lawand respect for the rights of the individual  is nowincreasingly accepted. The concept of security haswidened. It now comprises not only military and politicalfactors but also  inter alia  the human aspect and the needsof the individual as well.We have taken important decisions at Rio onenvironment  at Vienna on human rights and at Cairo onpopulation policies. Next year we shall meet atCopenhagen for the World Summit for Social Developmentand in Beijing to enhance the empowerment of women. In1996 the second Habitat Conference will convene atIstanbul. Those conferences should lead to a betterunderstanding  and ultimately acceptance  of the newconcept of sustainable human development. The Secretary-General’s Agenda for Development should complement theprocess  and outline the role of the United Nations in thelarger context of improved global governance.In this wider perspective the promotion and protectionof human rights is crucial. The results of the WorldConference on Human Rights held at Vienna must be putinto practice. I am convinced that the High Commissionerfor Human Rights will ensure that the promotion of humanrights is included as an integral part of all activities of theUnited Nations.In 1992 the Security Council  unanimously and at thehighest political level  stated that the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction constituted a threat tointernational peace and security. The Council thus affirmedthe fundamental norm first established by the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) a quarter ofa century ago. The almost universal adherence to the NPTdemonstrates that the world now shares a common interestin its continued existence. Finland believes  as do manyother States parties  that the existence of the NPT must besecured through its indefinite and unconditional extensionnext year.I have referred to the challenges to the United Nations.Perhaps the greatest concern today is the lack ofcommitment to the Organization by many of its MemberStates. Without the full commitment of all of us  theUnited Nations cannot assume its role as a centre forinternational conciliation and cooperation. This isdemonstrated by the financial situation of the Organization which is very critical. Member States - and I referparticularly to those which face no constraints on theircapacity to pay - must change their attitudes and payforthwith and in full their assessed contributions and theirarrears. Otherwise  this Organization will not be able tofunction.Finland has always paid its contributions in full andon time. So have some others  but regrettably few. Nowwe must all accept a strict budgetary and financialdiscipline. Breaches of this discipline must be sanctioned.Payment of interest on arrears should become standardpractice and should be enforced. At the same time  ofcourse  we must demand that the United Nations pursueits ongoing administrative and financial reforms.As the United Nations embarks on its secondhalf-century  the circumstances are essentially differentfrom those which prevailed for most of the first 50 years.It is therefore important to reshape our Organization tomeet the challenges of tomorrow  not those of yesterday.The work done on the reform of the SecurityCouncil during the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly was very useful. We need now to continuethat work and to arrive at conclusions acceptable to all.We need to ensure the continued efficiency of theSecurity Council  while making its composition betterreflect today’s realities  such as the increasingresponsibility  inter alia  of Germany and Japan  in worldaffairs.As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization  we should build on the solid foundation ofthe Charter. Our priorities should be to focus onprevention and peace-building in securing peace andstability  and also on sustainable human development inorder to bring about security at the individual level; andto restructure our Organization to achieve better globalgovernance.These priorities should guide our joint efforts as weapproach the next millennium - ""United for a BetterWorld""."
"57",2374,"FJI",49,1994,"On behalf of the Government andthe people of Fiji  I warmly congratulate His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.Given his vast experience and his knowledge of the UnitedNations system  I have every confidence that the currentsession of the Assembly will complete its worksuccessfully.I also wish to pay a special tribute to the outgoingPresident  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally  for theexcellent and efficient manner in which he conducted thebusiness of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.Most of the problems afflicting the world communitythat have been discussed in this Assembly in previous yearscontinue unchanged. A survey of the world scene readilydiscloses that no region of the world is free from tension;that the economic divide between the rich and the poorcontinues to widen; that political and social upheavals inmany parts of the world are getting extremely difficultand expensive to contain; and that poverty and despairremain the lot of a substantial part of the world’spopulation. There is an urgent need to address theseproblems in a comprehensive and timely manner. Thepiecemeal approach that we have adopted so far onlytends to plug the hole and does not eliminate the causes.Moreover  our efforts are invariably made after an eventhas occurred  and often when our conscience cannot bearto see the misery on our television screens. We mustdevise ways for a more preventive approach to theproblems.Political problems are often a consequence ofeconomic and social problems. The General Assembly’sdecision at its forty-seventh session to convene a WorldSummit for Social Development at Copenhagen early in1995 was very timely. While we have seen somesignificant advances in human rights and democracy inmany parts of the world  and positive developmentstowards reducing the potential for regional conflicts inother areas  the fact remains that in both developed anddeveloping countries new challenges to internationalpeace and security are manifesting themselves under abroad plethora of social development problems. We canno longer turn a blind eye to the increasing growth ofpoverty and unemployment and the attendantmarginalization of peoples.Annually  between 13 to 18 million people die fromstarvation  disease and famine. It has been estimated thatworld wide one out of every five people live below thepoverty line. While Governments  in many cases equivocate on how to solve this problem  the poorincreasingly look to the United Nations to find effective immediate and practical solutions. To ignore this realityis to deny that it constitutes a real source of politicalinstability.Indeed  the Security council has expressed the viewthat“peace and prosperity are indivisible and that lastingpeace and stability require effective internationalcooperation for the eradication of poverty and thepromotion of a better life for all in larger freedom.”(S/23500  p. 5)26These views are buttressed by the prophetic words ofthe Nobel laureate Ralph Bunche who  as long ago as 1950 said:“Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or notfighting. Peace  to have meaning for many who haveknown only suffering in both peace and war  must betranslated into bread or rice  shelter  health andeducation  as well as freedom and human dignity —a steadily better life. If peace is to be secure  long-suffering and long-starved peoples of the world  theunderprivileged and the undernourished  must begin torealize without delay the promise of a new day and anew life.”While these words were uttered in a different context I would suggest that they encapsulate the whole reason forthe social Summit. My Government will actively supportand work in cooperation with other countries to achieve theobjectives of the World Summit for Social Development.My Government looks forward to playing an activerole in the forthcoming World Conference on Women  to beheld in Beijing next September. Fiji has always recognizedthe important contribution of women to society and to thedevelopment process in general.In 1987  the Fiji Government established a Ministry ofWomen. A Department on Women and Culture  whichoperates under the purview of this Ministry  carries theresponsibility of monitoring improvements in the status ofwomen. It seeks to encourage the private and publicsectors to address the needs of women in their policies andprogrammes. It is also the Government’s policy to assign50 per cent of representation in training  appointments andpromotions at all levels of the civil service to women  onthe basis of preference and merit. The Governmentencourages the same in the private sector. I might alsomention that all three women members of the House ofRepresentatives in Fiji are Ministers in the Cabinet.My Government will continue to enhance and upliftthe status of women. It is in the process of ratifying theUnited Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Discrimination against Women. Fiji will also exploremembership of the Commission on the Status of Women in keeping with its policy of strengthening the role ofwomen in the country’s national development plans. Onthe issue of gender equity  it is my belief that in order thatthe principles enshrined in the first Article of the Charter ofthe United Nations to be achieved  the equal participationof women in the Secretariat of this Organization  on anequitable regional basis  must continue to be implementedand be given urgent priority.My country was pleased to have participated in theGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States in Barbados earlier thisyear. In short  the Conference was convened because ofa universal recognition of the problems faced by smallisland developing States in achieving sustainabledevelopment goals. While the Barbados Conference wasimportant in re-emphasizing the special environmental andeconomic circumstances of small island States  mydelegation wishes to reiterate that the Conference wasonly the beginning of a process. We must now act toimplement the Barbados Programme of Action andDeclaration.In this connection  we would urge the internationalcommunity  and particularly those countries withdeveloped and industrialized economies  to respond to theinvitation to enhance and promote human resourcedevelopment programmes in small island developingcountries. Increased technical assistance will enhance theinstitutional and administrative capacity of small islandcountries to implement the Programme of Action. One ofthe ways in which this can be brought about is by theprovision of new and additional financial resources inaccordance with Chapter 33 of Agenda 21. Unlesscreative and supportive international responses to thespecial challenges faced by small island developingcountries in planning for sustainable development areurgently stimulated  I fear that their continuingvulnerability to both physical and socio-economic forceswill increase. In this context it is opportune to remindthe global community to fulfil the commitments it madeat Rio some two years ago.We are on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of theestablishment of the United Nations. My country stronglysupports the principles contained in the Charter and Iwould like to reaffirm our support for the Organization.Over the past 50 years  the Organization has seen manychanges. Its membership has increased from 51 to thepresent 184. With the end of the cold war  it hasassumed a more central role in world affairs. There is anever-increasing demand on the limited resources of theOrganization and  in particular  on its Secretariat. Wesupport the Secretariat and commend the adjustments it ismaking in order to respond to the changing needs of theinternational community. We urge the Secretariat tocontinue to pursue the goals of efficiency andcost-effectiveness. In this regard  my Government27welcomes the creation of the Office of Internal OversightServices. We believe this to be an important innovation thatwill contribute to greater efficiency within the UnitedNations system. We fully support the continuing efforts tobring about greater transparency and accountability on thepart of the United Nations management and institutionalstructures.In the same vein  Mr. President  my Governmentsupports the view that it is now time that the currentstructure and the membership of the Security Council werereviewed. With the very large increase in the membershipof the United Nations since it was founded  with thechanges that have occurred on the global political scene inrecent years  and with the nature of problems that must beresolved by the United Nations  including the diverse facetsof economic  environmental and peace-keeping andpeace-monitoring issues  we agree that there is now a needto consider an enlarged Security Council with moreequitable representation of membership to look at theseissues more comprehensively.In this regard  we welcome the report of theOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council (A/48/47) in response to GeneralAssembly resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993  and therecommendation that the Open-Ended Working Groupshould continue its work. In the event that membership ofthe Security Council is expanded  Fiji fully supports themembership of Japan  recognizing its important role notonly as a valued neighbour in the Asia-Pacific region  butalso as a key player in the global economy.My Government has followed with close and keeninterest  meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on theElaboration of an International Convention dealing with theSafety and Security of United Nations and AssociatedPersonnel. We consider the United Nations staff andassociated personnel who participate in various missionssponsored by the United Nations as an integral and essentialpart of those missions. We have seen their courage inCambodia  Rwanda  the former Yugoslavia and other placesaround the world. If the United Nations is to continue torely on individual men and women to assist in carrying outthe mandates of its various organs  it is only fair and fittingthat we should provide them with an adequate level ofsafety and security. At its last session  the Ad HocCommittee worked very constructively and made significantprogress. However  it is important for the Ad HocCommittee to conclude its work as soon as possible and weurge that this be done. We have a very real interest in theconclusion of this convention since in as much as Fiji haslost some of its nationals in various peace-keepingoperations  and many others have been injured. For us therefore  peace-keeping has come at a high price. Itinvolves the sacrifices  not only of individuals  but also ofthe families left behind. But my Government remainsunshaken in its belief that the price we have paid and arecontinuing to pay for our involvement in United Nationspeace-keeping operations would have been worthwhile ifwe have contributed towards making the world a saferplace. We owe this to our children and to our children’schildren.At the present time  there are at least l 000 troopsfrom Fiji serving in various peace-keeping operations - inLebanon  Sinai  Iraq  Kuwait and Rwanda. Only recentlywe agreed to participate in the regional peace-keepingforce in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. This was indirect response to a request we received from theGovernment of Papua New Guinea  with the support ofthe relevant parties in Bougainville. Our participation inthe South Pacific regional peace-keeping force forBougainville is in concert with our other neighbours inthe South Pacific  namely Tonga  Vanuatu  SolomonIslands  Australia and New Zealand. Our participation isalso for a specific purpose  and that is to assist theGovernment of Papua New Guinea and the relevantparties on Bougainville in facilitating a secureenvironment in which they will be able to hold a peaceconference and  through dialogue  achieve a consensus onthe future of Bougainville. Let me say that ourcommitment to peace-keeping is a continuing affirmationof our belief that the purposes and principles set forth inthe United Nations Charter must be given practicalexpression. Fiji  as a responsible member of theinternational community  will continue to play its role inthe enhancement of global peace and security.On the subject of peace-keeping  I want at this timeto express my Government’s satisfaction at thestrengthening of the Department of Peace-keepingOperations. I believe that continued innovations in theinstitutional structure of this Department will be necessaryif it is to play a meaningful and effective role in supportof United Nations peace-keeping activities.This year marks an important milestone in thedevelopment of the international law of the sea. Fiji wasthe first State to ratify the 1982 United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea. We are thereforepleased that  12 years after its adoption  the Conventionwill enter into force on 16 November 1994. The28Convention represents a historic achievement by theinternational community. It will establish the rule of lawover more than two-thirds of the Earth’s surface  andpromote its peaceful use. Like many other States  Fiji hasalready been implementing the provisions of theConvention  through its Marine Spaces Act. Entry intoforce of the Convention would thus consolidate our claimsto the archipelagic waters  the territorial sea and theexclusive economic zone. Fiji has always supporteduniversal participation in the Convention. We thereforewelcome the conclusion of the Agreement to resolve theoutstanding issues relating to the deep seabed mining partof the Convention  part XI. As at the Conference on theLaw of the Sea  our delegation  together with otherdelegations  was pleased to play an active and constructiverole in bringing about that important agreement. We havesigned the agreement and will become a party to it. Weurge all States that have not done so to become parties tothe Convention and to the new Agreement in order toachieve the goal of universal participation.Associated with the law of the sea is the importantConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly MigratoryFish Stocks. Fish is an invaluable gift of nature to man.However  man’s unregulated and indiscriminate exploitationof this vital resource is rapidly depleting or destroying it.Fish is an important national and regional resource and it isa staple in our diet. In addition to other species  some 40per cent of the world’s tuna is to be found in the south-west Pacific region. We are therefore concerned at thelong-term impact on these resources and on the marine eco-system as a whole  if the current practice of uncontrolledfishing  especially on the high seas  continues. TheConference has been organized to address the urgentproblems facing us with regard to the conservation andmanagement of fisheries around the world. These problemsmust be addressed from the perspective of both present andfuture generations. Fiji therefore strongly supports aneffective outcome from the Conference  an outcome thatwould ensure the long-term conservation and sustainableuse of the fish resources of the seas and oceans. Ourdelegation  in cooperation with other delegations to theConference  will spare no effort in working towards thisgoal. We are grateful for the confidence shown in ourcountry by our election as Chairman of the Conference.Since the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly  we have witnessed positive and constructivedevelopments in the Middle East peace process. It isalmost a year now since the Declaration of Principles wassigned between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO). This was followed by the agreementon the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area signed at Cairo inMay this year. The recent peace accord between Israeland Jordan  which was signed at Washington last July was another very positive development. My Governmentlends its support to the Middle East peace process. Inparticular  we express the hope that the ongoing bilateralnegotiations between Israel and Jordan and between Israeland the Palestinians will continue. We are also hopefulthat the present dialogue between Syria  Lebanon andIsrael will eventually lead to further agreements.I would now like to mention a number of issues inmy own region  the South Pacific. One is NewCaledonia. While some positive developments have beentaking place in New Caledonia in relation to thecontinued implementation of the Matignon Accords  Ibelieve that there is still a need to accelerate the processof redressing social and economic imbalances in theterritory. In this connection  my Government willcontinue to observe developments in New Caledonia withkeen interest in the build-up to the referendum to be heldin 1998.Nuclear issues and transboundary movements ofhazardous and radioactive wastes are also of considerableconcern to us in the South Pacific region. Fiji has longbeen a consistent opponent of nuclear testing anywhereand in any environment. Our opposition to such testingis by no means based only on environmental concerns.For hundreds of years  the livelihood of our people hasdepended on their limited land and on the resources in themarine environment. Fundamentally  our abhorrence ofnuclear arms and nuclear testing is based on the beliefthat there is simply no place for nuclear weapons in ourregion  or indeed in any other part of the world. In thisconnection  we have been pleased to note the temporarycessation of nuclear testing in the Pacific region byFrance  and would urge the French Government to agreeto a permanent moratorium on testing in the SouthPacific.Fiji is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. We believe that the Treatyrepresents a unique achievement in the promotion ofglobal peace and security and in the reduction of thethreat of nuclear warfare. The Pacific region has longrecognized and embraced the principles enshrined in theTreaty  and these principles are now reflected in theTreaty of Rarotonga  which establishes the South Pacificas a nuclear-free zone. We would  in this regard encourage the United States  the United Kingdom andFrance to accede to the Protocols to the Treaty of29Rarotonga as a demonstration of their commitment tonuclear non-proliferation and to a ban on testing in theSouth Pacific.We are equally concerned about the transboundarymovements — and  in particular  about the sea transitthrough the region — of consignments of plutonium fromEurope to Japan. For obvious reasons  we object verystrongly to this development and earnestly hope that therewill be no more such shipments through the region.The countries of the South Pacific region are alsocurrently in the process of negotiating a regional conventionto ban the importation into the island States of the SouthPacific Forum of hazardous wastes and to control theirtransboundary movement and management within the SouthPacific region. My country fully supports this initiative andis actively engaged in the negotiation process. Theconvention is expected to be adopted in mid-1995. Thiswill further strengthen our resolve to keep the South Pacificregion free of radioactive and hazardous wastes.At the national level  the Government of Fiji hascommenced work on the review of the country’s 1990Constitution. The members of the Parliamentary SelectCommittee on the Review of the Constitution have alreadybeen announced. They have been drawn from both sides ofthe House of Representatives and from the Senate  andrepresent all the racial groups in our population. AsChairman of that Committee  the Minister for ForeignAffairs with Special Responsibilities on ConstitutionalReview  Senator Filipe N. Bole  had a fruitful meeting ofthe Committee only a few days ago. Last November  theCabinet agreed to the timetable for the review of theConstitution  following the approval  by Parliament  of theterms of reference of the Constitution Review Commission.Because of the general elections that were held in Fiji inFebruary of this year  the review process has been slightlydelayed  but it is expected that the substantive work of theCommission will begin soon after the Commission has beenappointed  which will be done shortly.Fiji has a very small  export-oriented economy thatcannot isolate itself from the vagaries of the globaleconomy. We are less able to absorb adverse trends inexternal economic conditions than are larger and morediversified economies; equally  an improvement in theglobal economy is slow to be reflected in our own smalleconomy. Like many small developing countries  we arestill in the process of gradual recovery following aprolonged downturn that afflicted the world as a whole.Like many countries  we have had to adjust our economicpolicies in such a way as to give them a moremarket-oriented approach. This has involved thefollowing fundamentals: less interference with the market;recognition that the Government cannot do everything andthat the private sector is the engine for development which the Government must complement rather thancompete with; and the encouragement of  and reward for entrepreneurship  skills  abilities and hard work. In thismanner we are proceeding with the deregulation of theeconomy to bring domestic prices more closely into linewith world prices; restraining the growth of Governmentexpenditure to ensure availability of resources for growthin the private sector; reforming the system of direct andindirect taxation to minimize market distortions andimprove incentives for risk-taking and effort;implementing wage policies that recognize the paramountimportance of maintaining international competitiveness;and mobilizing all sectors of the community in support ofeconomic expansion. These constitute a package ofmutually self-reinforcing policies.In a world that is economically interlinked and inwhich we are all economically interdependent  no country however well-intentioned its national efforts might be  cansustain itself without support and interaction from outside.This is true of large  diversified economies  and it iscertainly true for small  isolated economies such as ours.Our internal efforts to create a better economic climate if not supported by external investments  will not succeed.Nor will they succeed if we are denied or prevented fromgetting access to markets of more developed countries.Our efforts  therefore  depend considerably on investmentfrom outside and on access for our products to traditionaland new markets. In this regard  we express our gratitudeto our developed neighbouring countries for theconsideration they have given to some of our exports.We believe  however  that in the spirit of regionalcooperation and better balance in trade the presentarrangements must be further improved.In our efforts to develop our economy  we alsocount on the support and understanding of our goodfriends and partners in our neighbouring region of Asia.We value our increasing contacts and economic relations particularly with the countries of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations  Malaysia  the People’sRepublic of China  the Republic of Korea and Taiwan and we are confident that these relations will continue tobe strengthened in the future.Our Prime Minister  the Honourable Major-GeneralSitiveni Rabuka  greatly appreciated the warm welcome30that he received during his recent visit to the People’sRepublic of China and Taiwan. Fiji remains committed toits official relations with the People’s Republic of China butalso greatly values its trade and economic cooperation withTaiwan. It is our sincere hope that the People’s Republicof China and Taiwan  in continued direct talks andnegotiations  will be able to reach agreement on apracticable basis on which to strengthen and expandcooperation between them  including cooperation in theinternational arena.The establishment of the South Pacific Forum in 1971was an early initiative taken by Fiji following itsindependence  together with Australia  the Cook Islands Nauru  New Zealand  Tonga and Western Samoa. TheForum now has 15 members  and it meets at the level ofHeads of Government. The Forum originated from thedesire of our leaders to develop collective responses on awide range of regional issues  including trade  economicdevelopment  civil aviation  maritime  telecommunications energy  environmental  and political and security matters.One significant recent development is the post-Forumdialogue: immediately after a Forum meeting  the Forumisland countries meet separately with their more developedtrade and economic partners to discuss developmentpriorities and constraints in the region. The post-Forumdialogue partners include Canada  the People’s Republic ofChina  France  Japan  Taiwan  the United Kingdom and theUnited States. From our perspective as small island nationswhose economies  to remain viable  depend to a very largeextent on economic ties with these larger and morevigorous economies  we value these discussions and areconfident that they will continue.In a wider context  we of the South Pacific Forumbelieve that it is important and indeed mutually beneficialfor the Forum Secretariat to be more closely associatedwith the United Nations. For this reason  the Forummembers have decided to seek Observer status in thisOrganization for the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. Weurge the General Assembly to give favourable considerationto this request.Finally  I would like to take this opportunity toexpress  from this rostrum  the appreciation and profoundthanks of my Government and people to the Secretary-General  the staff of the United Nations and its variousorganizations and agencies for their continued support for and technical assistance to  our national development  andindeed  for the numerous development projects in ourregion as a whole. In these times  when valuable resourcesfor development purposes are becoming more and morescarce and difficult to come by  I wish to assure thedonors and agencies that my Government will manageand utilize these scarce resources carefully andeffectively."
"58",2421,"FRA",49,1994,"France is especially pleased  Mr. President  to see theGeneral Assembly meeting under your authority. At theend of a year marked by the passing of an extraordinarystatesman  President Houphouët-Boigny  your election hasgiven the international community another occasion tostop and think about the situation in the African continent which in recent months has brought us both hope andtragedy.In South Africa  a decisive evolutionary process tookconcrete form this year in the first elections there withuniversal suffrage. We can now express our joy at seeingthat country take its rightful place in the concert ofnations. The choice of the South African people  inspiredby outstanding men to whom France wishes again to paya tribute  provides an example for all those who aspire todemocracy  reconciliation and peace and gives them hope.In Rwanda  on the other hand  an unprecedentedtragedy has set the international community’sresponsibility squarely before it. The Assembly isfamiliar with the efforts made by France to respond tothat tragedy and with the support it managed to find primarily among the African States. The operation thatwas carried out enabled us to shelter more than 3 millionRwandans from the fighting. None the less  we havefound it necessary once again to say the word ""genocide"" which  almost 50 years after the birth of the UnitedNations  amounts to saying that the worst is still possible.During the darkest years of the Second World War General De Gaulle spoke of the need to establish a worldorder that could guarantee the security of all  to makerational use of all the world’s riches and to bring togetherall the people on the face of the Earth. The time hascome for us to rediscover the ideal that inspired the12generation of the founders and to ask ourselves with claritywhat means are necessary to implement it.Almost everywhere in the world we are seeing thepositive movement of nation-States into groups. Francehas made the building up of Europe one of the pillars of itsforeign policy. How could it not  then  encourage theformation of new areas of solidarity?The experience of building Europe  which began 40years ago  is a case in point. It has done more than just doaway with the age-old rivalries that had led to two worldwars. In the western part of the European continent economic integration and political cooperation have attaineda level that is unmatched in the world.Since the iron curtain ceased to exist  we have beenprimarily concerned with expanding to all parts of Europethe zone of peace and prosperity resulting from thatprocess. This explains our desire to speed up theintegration of the Central and Eastern Europeandemocracies into the European Union. It also accounts forour efforts to organize a partnership with Russia and theStates of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).The European Union  the Western European Union (WEU) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)are all coooperating in the efforts towards this end.Furthermore  it explains France’s initiative  taken up in turnby the European Union  to establish a stability pact. Thisis an ambitious exercise in preventive diplomacy  aimed atresolving issues of relations between neighbours and ofminority groups  where such issues persist in the Europeantheatre.Today Europe is a world power  as it demonstratedduring the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) negotiations  at which its efforts led  notably  tothe establishment of a World Trade Organization (WTO).This is a major success that will benefit all its membercountries by putting an end to unilateral practices andguaranteeing fair and free trade. Europe is thus assumingits international responsibilities. It is actively supportingthe peace processes in the Middle East  in southern Africaand elsewhere. It has long been involved in the struggle toachieve development  particularly through the LoméConventions. It provides substantial financing everywhere -the most in the world - for peoples mired in humanitariancrises. Its actions prove that a genuine regional power canbenefit the entire international community.New regional groups of solidarity are graduallytaking shape in all parts of the world. In Africa  Francesupports the principle of an OAU mechanism forpreventing  handling and settling conflicts. We are readyto help set up a military mechanism to enable the OAUto intervene more quickly  under United Nations control in the framework of peace-keeping operations.In South-East Asia  the countries of the Associationof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are working tostrengthen their economic ties and to establish confidence-building measures to reinforce the stability of the region.France  which through the European Union was presentat ASEAN’s regional forum on security  held recently inBangkok  takes a special interest in the beneficial effectsthis process should have on the countries of the Indo-Chinese peninsula.On the American continent  the entry into force ofthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)adds to the dynamism of existing regional organizations old and new.Thus  perhaps  there may be such a group in theMiddle East as well  where progress in the peace processallows us to envision the development of intensiveregional cooperation. The organization of all kinds of tiesamong the countries concerned will help to establishpeace in the region  as will the search for solutions to thepolitical problems that are still pending. France cantherefore only repeat that we hope to see the boycottsfinally ended. Our financial support for the peaceprocess  as well as our active participation in themultilateral negotiations  including participation in suchultra-sensitive areas as regional security  reflect this verysame conviction.Above and beyond that  France would like to seeEurope organize a forum for cooperation involving all theMediterranean States. We have  on the initiative ofEgypt  already made a contribution to the coming intobeing of the Mediterranean Forum  which recently held itsfirst meeting in Alexandria. We will make this one of themain goals of the French presidency of the EuropeanUnion in the first semester of the coming year.Everywhere  then  the progress being made inprocesses leading to integration and the establishment ofregional frameworks for cooperation reflects positivetrends. These organizations  however  have neither theright nor the capability to do everything. It is the UnitedNations that is and must remain the sole forum for13organizing peace and solidarity throughout the world. It isup to the United Nations and to that Organization alone toensure international equilibrium since  in the last resort  italone has the power to decide on enforcement measures oron the use of force. Regional organizations do contributeto peace and international stability. They may indeed fulfilmissions in preventive diplomacy  but they must then beinspired by the principles enshrined in the United Nations.As regards peace-keeping  Chapter VIII of our Charterexpressly provides that the United Nations may  in certaincircumstances  employ the means at the disposal of theregional organizations.But when conflicts become exacerbated  when a crisiscalls for a mandatory solution  the Charter requires us toturn to the Security Council  the sole authority havingpower to decide on enforcement measures or on the use offorce other than for legitimate self-defence. Thejustification for such measures may come only from thewill of the international community  and that is why theSecurity Council  in our view  must exert its authority andcontrol at all stages of operations it may decide upon:conception and approval of the mandate  the major phasesof implementation and the monitoring of implementation.The adoption of a system of mandatory sanctionsagainst States that breach international legality is also aprerogative of the Security Council. But  and we are verykeenly aware of this  this concerns serious  exceptionalmeasures whose purpose must be precisely defined to bringpressure to bear on a Government to change its attitude.That is the objective in such instances. France thereforeproposes that in future  when a resolution imposingsanctions upon a Member State is to be voted upon  threeconditions must be met. These are  that all otherdiplomatic avenues have been explored without success;that the Council resolution state explicitly what actions thetargeted State should take in order for the sanctions to belifted; and that the maintenance of the sanctions should besubject to regular review in good faith.In the realm of disarmament  our Organization is onceagain the sole forum where international commitments maybe entered into. Given this perspective  France ascribesespecial importance to the speedy ratification of theConvention banning chemical weapons - the firstmultilateral disarmament treaty - and thereby its entry intoforce in 1995. France hopes to see our Organization makeprogress towards strengthening the Convention banningbiological weapons and to see new efforts made to bananti-personnel mines. I was particularly pleased to hearPresident Clinton endorse this very concept in his recentstatement to the Assembly. Finally  the requirement fornon-proliferation  which North Korea’s attitude compelsus to take especially seriously  must lead  at the 1995Conference  to the unconditional and indefinite renewal ofthe non-proliferation Treaty. In this same vein  Francereaffirms its support for the decision taken by the GeneralAssembly last year to begin negotiations on acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty that would beinternationally and effectively verifiable.Over recent years  crisis prevention and crisismanagement have absorbed the greater part of our efforts.We have thus imperceptibly strayed somewhat from whatwas a major chapter in the history of the United Nations:the North-South dialogue  the major conferences on tradeand development. France thus proposes that the UnitedNations restore development and the struggle to achieveit to their central place in its work.It is not a question of repeating what was done inpast decades. Our approach to development has changed.The work pursued under the auspices of the UnitedNations and its agencies has helped to call attention to theinterdependence of the economic  demographic  culturaland social ramifications of the development question.That is why the main theme conferences devoted to theenvironment  to population  to social development and tothe status of women are now once again the instrumentsto be used to mobilize for development. Given thisperspective  France will organize in Paris before the endof this year the signing of the Convention on the struggleagainst desertification  as well as the Aids Summit.The United Nations alone is capable of ensuring thatall these efforts be pursued consistently. It has thenecessary legitimacy and authority  inasmuch as all themain institutions concerned  including what are known asthe Bretton Woods institutions  are part and parcel of theUnited Nations system. We therefore consider itnecessary to strengthen the links that unite all theseseparate bodies. In particular  we should ensure that thepolicies of adjustment carried out under World Bank orInternational Monetary Fund auspices take due account ofthe social requirements of development. France iscommitted to doing so in working with its partners  andhas recently agreed to a substantial effort to help the franczone countries overcome the short-term effects of thedevaluation of the CFA franc.The Economic and Social Council should be theplace for ensuring coherence and consistency within theseorganizations. France therefore proposes that the next14annual meeting of the Council in Geneva should be anopportunity for the ministers of Member States personallyto undertake a complete examination of the policiesfollowed by these various institutions with regard todevelopment  and especially to study specific ways bywhich they might work together better.The Secretary-General’s efforts for renewal andclarification through the ""Agenda for Development""naturally form part of this global approach. The EuropeanUnion  for its part  has presented recommendations in itsaide-mémoire that it believes would enhance that draft.France intends to take an active part in General Assemblydiscussions on this subject.The role of our Organization is no less critical wherehumanitarian action is involved. France intervenesregularly on the ground alongside United Nations agencies and we should like to pay a tribute to the outstanding workdone by the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  the World Food Programme and UNICEF working under tragically difficult circumstances. We wereable to appreciate in full measure their usefulness as theRwandan crisis unfolded. We have had confirmation thatthe United Nations alone is able to coordinate such difficultoperations. Naturally  there is need for further progress:in shortening the Organization’s reaction time  and in betterallocating tasks among agencies. But the reform that beganthree years ago with the establishment of the Departmentfor Humanitarian Affairs is beginning to bear fruit. We areindeed on the right track.Lastly  France would like to stress the underlyingprinciple of international law: the universality of humanrights  a principle which may not be challenged in the nameof any religious  cultural or national specificities. I am allthe more ready to say that because France is itself keen onpreserving its identity and intent on defending it. Howeverdifferent people may be  they share the same rights. Thevery existence of our Organization rests on this principle.France has consistently urged the acceleration ofprogress in the field of human rights  by seekingrecognition that certain principles must be applied to States’actions. I welcome the steps taken by the HighCommissioner for Human Rights since his designation andexpress the hope that the resources made available to himwill be commensurate with his mission.The establishment of the International Tribunal for warcrimes committed in the former Yugoslavia is a significantevent. Until very recently there had been some scepticismabout this initiative. Today  thanks to the resolve of theTribunal’s judges and prosecutor  it is in place andbeginning to examine actual cases being submitted to it.France supports these efforts and hopes that comparablecrimes of genocide that may have been committed inRwanda will also lead to the establishment of aninternational legal body.The juridical work of the United Nations extends toother areas as well. It is designed to address matters ofinternational trade with a view to making it both freer andfairer. In this regard  I have already expressed oursatisfaction at the establishment of the World TradeOrganization. The signing a few weeks ago of an act thatcompletes the monumental work done by the UnitedNations on the law of the sea is also a historic event.If our Organization is to be able to carry out themany difficult tasks which I have just described  we mustconstantly work to reform it and adjust the meansavailable to it - in the first place  by strengthening themeans available to the Secretary-General. On behalf ofFrance  I should like to pay a tribute here to theSecretary-General - and this is not a mere formality. Wehave the good fortune to have at the helm of ourOrganization a man who  thanks to his ceaseless effortsover the past two years  has made progress possible in allareas: preventive diplomacy  crisis management development  the running of the institution. We musttherefore give him the means to continue his work.This is true  too  of peace-keeping missions. Recentexperience has shown the need to make military forcesavailable to the Secretary-General on very short notice inthe implementation of Security Council resolutions. Tothat end  France wishes to develop a network of stand-byforces. On the initiative of the President of the Republic we have offered to make a standing unit of severalthousand men available to the United Nations. It is alsoessential for the Secretary-General to be able to controlthe evolution of peace-keeping missions. To that end France recommends systematic recourse to the designationof a special representative.The Secretary-General must be able to rely on theassistance of prominent and particularly competentpersons. With regard to management  last year’sestablishment of the post of Inspector General marked animportant step forward. We expect further progress to bemade this year with the establishment of a committee onbudgetary discipline  as I proposed last year from thisvery rostrum. Lastly  as our Prime Minister has15suggested  France proposes that someone be appointed ona permanent basis to the Secretary-General’s Office whowould deal with the question of the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction.Our Assembly is the most universal of internationalinstitutions. Its prestige and authority must therefore bestrengthened. To that end  France is making threeproposals.First  sessions of the Fifth Committee must be heldmore closely together in order to ensure better control overour finances  particularly with regard to peace-keepingoperations.Secondly  there must be more frequent missions of theAssembly to deal with certain crisis situations  as was donein the cases of Haiti and South Africa. The financialreform of the United Nations  which has been discussed forseveral years now  must be set in motion. Following thework of the high-level Working Group established last yearto consider the question of enlarging the Security Council France proposes that a group  led by the President of theGeneral Assembly  be set up this year to make proposalsthat could lead to the financial reform of our Organization.Thirdly  we must work to achieve the enlargement ofthe Security Council. This question has already been thefocus of in-depth discussions that have clarified thepositions at issue. For its part  France has no panacea tooffer  but it believes that the solution must answer the dualimperative of efficacy and representativeness.On the one hand  if the Security Council is to functionefficiently  given its tasks and the circumstances in whichit intervenes  its capacity to take important decisionsquickly must clearly be maintained. But the Council mustalso allow for full public debate in reaching its decisions.Hence  we are in favour of the Council’s holding officialmeetings - without of course giving up its informalconsultations - to hear Members of the Organization andtalk with them before taking positions on the importantquestions before it. We believe that this is the appropriateresponse to the demand for transparency made by manydelegations.On the other hand  the Council’s authority and thus itsefficacy also depend on its representativeness. Wetherefore favour the enlargement of the Council to includenew permanent and non-permanent members. Franceconfirms its support for the desires of Germany and Japanto accede to permanent membership. It also considers thatthe representatives of the developing world should in nocase find themselves marginalized by any future reform.The United Nations exists and acts only through thewill of its Member States. Though that is obvious itbears repeating. Any failure of our Organization is infact the failure of those same States - that is  as mycolleague from the United Kingdom stated earlier today our own failure. Its efficacy depends above all on thedegree of commitment each of us brings to it.Without the commitment of States there can be nosolution to the financial crisis of the United Nations.Each of us is aware of the gravity of our Organization’sfinancial situation. Each of us also knows that thiscritical situation is not the result solely of the sum total ofexpenditures. The real source of our crisis is well known:it is the negligence of States which do not pay theircontributions or do not pay them in full.Of course  we welcome the fact that one of the maincontributor countries has decided to pay a substantial partof its arrears  thereby bringing temporary relief to theOrganization’s financial situation. We can understandwhy some Member States are requesting that the scale ofcontributions be adjusted in order better to reflect realabilities to pay. France hopes that at the present sessionthe General Assembly will address the revision of thisscale in accordance with the principle of fairness and ina spirit of consensus.But fairness also requires swifter and moresubstantial reimbursement to States that provide the troopsnecessary to peace-keeping operations and are thereforethe primary victims of late payments. The situation inwhich some in fact pay twice while others do not pay atall must come to an end. France therefore asks onceagain that a working group be established and mandatedto propose all the measures that can encourage tardyStates to pay their arrears.And without the commitment of States there cannotbe any solution to international instability. France hasmade considerable efforts to help resolve crises that havethreatened the international order over the past few years.It has been the first and is now the second largest troopcontributor to the United Nations. It has well-knownexperience in the three areas of preventive diplomacy peace-keeping and humanitarian action. Obviously France does not wish to lecture anyone  but its owncommitment does permit it to say that the readiness of16States does not meet the demands made today upon ourOrganization.Need we cite all the circumstances in which the non-participation or temporizing of States has compromisedaction mandated by the Security Council? How manyweeks did we have to wait last year for the militaryarrangements provided for under Security Councilresolution 824 (1993) on safe areas in Bosnia were finallyin place? We all remember that  during the Rwandancrisis  the decision taken by the Security Council in mid-May to strengthen the United Nations Assistance Missionfor Rwanda had yet to be implemented two months later.Rather than dwelling on these disappointments however  France wishes to pay tribute to all those Statesthat have shown  by their commitment and sense ofinternational solidarity  that the United Nations can provethat it is effective. The African countries that chose toshare with us the risks involved in the operation in Rwanda;the United States  which is working in Haiti to effect theimplementation of Security Council resolution 940 (1994);the States whose soldiers stand with ours in the UnitedNations Protection Force: it is thanks to them that thereremains a chance for peace in the former Yugoslavia delayed only by the stubbornness of the Bosnian Serbleaders. France expects that the greatest of firmness will beused in dealing with these most recent warmongers. Butthe change in position of the other parties  and in particularthe authorities in Belgrade  makes it incumbent upon us tocontinue to seek a negotiated settlement. In this spirit  weappeal to Presidents Izetbegovic  Tudjman and Milosevic who have all accepted the peace plan for Bosnia  to resumethe direct dialogue necessary for a comprehensivesettlement. Otherwise  the international community must beprepared to propose the terms of a comprehensive  just andlasting settlement  taking into account the legitimateinterests of the various communities that made up theformer Yugoslavia and must enjoy equal rights.Bringing to trial those responsible for war crimes is amoral imperative to which France is committed. We mustabove all make the people in the former Yugoslaviaunderstand that there are prospects for the future other thanendless violence and vengeance. That is France’s message.That is the reason for the commitment of our soldiers inBosnia and  sadly  the sacrifice of several dozen of them.There is nothing pre-ordained about failure to get involved or inertia. There is a strong will at the heart of ourOrganization. Therefore France appeals to all MemberStates to mark the fiftieth anniversary with a genuinerenewal of commitment.Voices are being raised today urging ourOrganization to show greater realism in defining themissions that it has to carry out. In appealing to MemberStates to mobilize  France wishes to reaffirm itsunwavering conviction that  in the face of the challengesto the international community  realism consists not inbeing less ambitious but in ensuring that we have themeans fully to achieve our ambitions. They must not belimited to what seems possible; they must be to makepossible what is obviously necessary. It is in this spiritthat France will continue actively to play its role withinthe United Nations."
"59",2447,"FSM",49,1994,"I amhonoured to address this forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. First  I wish to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy onhis election to the presidency  and to say that hisexperience makes him an excellent choice to ably leadthis body to meet the challenges ahead. I also take thisopportunity  on behalf of my Government  to congratulatethe former President  His Excellency Mr. SamuelInsanally  and express our appreciation for hiscontributions. The same appreciation is extended to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  for his strong andeffective leadership  so instrumental in the success of thework accomplished by this Organization.We note with great sympathy the terrible volcaniceruption in Papua New Guinea. We express the hope thatthis Organization and its Members will take all possiblemeasures to assist in alleviating the suffering anddestruction caused by this disaster. We also express oursympathy to the people and the Government of theRepublic of Estonia for the recent accident and loss oflife in that country.We join the other members of this Assembly inwarmly welcoming the new South Africa here. Theirstruggle was long  arduous and painful. The people andGovernment of Micronesia share the joy of theGovernment and people of South Africa at havingachieved their objective.My Government welcomes the historic steps takentoward peace in the Middle East and expresses its supportfor the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the partiesin that region. In the light of these positive developmentsin the peace process  the General Assembly should reflectthis new reality in the course of this forty-ninth sessionand provide an environment conducive to further dialoguebetween parties.We gather at a time in our history when newgrounds of cooperation are being woven into greaterdimensions of solidarity. This is fortunate because wealso face urgent challenges to the future of our planet.From the point of view of a small developing State  wecome to this Assembly with immediate concerns on suchissues as climate change  sustainable development  nuclearwaste and natural disasters.Linked with all these concerns is the issue of humanrights. The road from Vienna  where the worldcommunity met only a few hundred miles from where""ethnic cleansing"" was taking place in Bosnia and spokeof improvements in the field of human rights  has beenmarked with new signposts leading us in the rightdirection  namely  the establishment of the post of United27Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and theelection of Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso to that post.However  the scenery along the way is not that muchdifferent from what it was for many years before this.Today  the atrocities and violations of human rights that arecontinuing in Bosnia seem to be even overshadowed bynewer outbreaks of human rights violations in such areas asRwanda  Haiti and other parts of our world. ThisAssembly must continue to devote its attention andresources to human rights.Several weeks ago at Brisbane  Australia  the Heads ofGovernment of our 15 Pacific States  including theFederated States of Micronesia  held the annual meeting ofthe South Pacific Forum. As is their practice each year  theleaders discussed matters of common concern within ourregion and expressed consensus views in a communiquéthat has already been presented and included in the recordsof this Assembly. The Federated States of Micronesiasubscribes to the views expressed in that communiqué  andwill be guided by it in many of our actions here in thecoming months.The South Pacific Forum also decided  at its recentmeeting in Brisbane  to seek observer status at the UnitedNations during this forty-ninth session. In attainingobserver status with the United Nations  the South PacificForum will address the increasing importance placed on therole of regional organizations and the contributions they canmake towards the objectives of the United Nations. Webelieve that the Forum  as an observer  can increase theeffectiveness of our region’s work on such critical issues asclimate change  conservation of biological diversity andeffective implementation of the results of the GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States.One long-standing major concern of our Government which is shared by Forum members  is the testing ofnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destructionwithin our region. We are relieved by the continuedmoratorium on nuclear testing by France and the UnitedStates  but we remain deeply concerned at the possibleconsequences that may flow from China’s insistence onproceeding with its programme. We will not breathe easyuntil a moratorium on all testing is made permanent  and tothat end we hope that rapid progress will be made towardsconcluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.Despite our outspoken concerns in numerousinternational venues during recent years  the Pacificregion’s vastness and seeming emptiness still makes it anattractive location for environmentally unfriendlyactivities. Too often  when we have attempted as islandcountries to halt movements through our waters of toxic radioactive and hazardous materials  our voices have notbeen heard. As if the dangers of such transport were notbad enough  today we confront an even more repugnantprospect  that of our region becoming a permanentdumping ground for the world’s nuclear waste. I wish toemphasize here that the Federated States of Micronesia isand will remain diametrically opposed to the use of ourregion by countries which are unwilling to store theirwaste within their own borders. As part of our dedicationto finding more effective means to prevent these outrages the Federated States of Micronesia has the honour ofchairing the ongoing negotiations within the Forum grouptowards a regional treaty banning transboundarymovement of all hazardous wastes.Through these and other appropriate actions  we aredetermined to see that the Pacific region is treated by therest of the world community with the same degree ofconcern for the long-term health and welfare of ourpeople and their environment.We welcome the Secretary-General’s new report onan Agenda for Development. My Government fullysupports the call for a re-evaluation of the role of theUnited Nations in development. As the United Nationsapproaches its fiftieth anniversary  its global agenda mustbe redefined to be more comprehensive and morefocused. The present lack of coordination between theBretton Woods institutions and the United Nations mustbe corrected to synchronize the setting of global policy ondevelopment.The end of the cold war has presented the UnitedNations with a long-overdue opportunity to turn itsattention to development. Yet the cost associated withexpanded peace-keeping operations around the world isdiverting scarce resources at a time when  for manyStates  the role of the United Nations in development isbecomingly increasingly prominent. This is a trend thatthe United Nations must examine very carefully in orderto find the proper balance among all its responsibilitiesunder the Charter.The recently concluded International Conference onPopulation and Development in Cairo is testimony to theglobal problems associated with our rapid populationgrowth. The United Nations and the internationalcommunity face a pressing urgency to redirect resourcesto address population growth and sustainable resource use.28The world’s population is growing faster than ever beforewith an estimated number of 95 million people being addedeach year. This unprecedented population growth rate willhave a profound effect on our environment. The actionplan for population and sustainable development has clearimplications for climate change. I wish to draw thedistinction that  although the rate of population growth inthe industrialized world is slower  these countries still adda disproportionate cost to the environment because residentsin industrialized countries add about four times as muchcarbon to the atmosphere each year as do their counterpartsin the developing countries. Micronesia strongly supportsthe Programme of Action on Population Control andDevelopment endorsed at Cairo and is looking forward tomeeting the goals and objectives contained therein.As an island State  my Government welcomes thesignificant breakthrough and the universal acceptance of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of Sea and itsimminent entry into force on 16 November 1994. This isthe culmination of long and arduous negotiations amongcountries for more than a decade in shaping what I considerto be a near-perfect management and conservation regimefor the high seas and the deep seabed which is the commonheritage of mankind. The Federated States of Micronesiais a party to the Convention and I am happy to inform theAssembly that my country was among the many countrieswhich signed the deep seabed mining Agreement relating tothe Implementation of Part XI of the Convention after itwas opened for signature. We look forward to closecooperation with the international community in the soundmanagement and conservation of the high seas as well asour individual territorial waters.As a developing island State whose economy isdependent on these resources  Micronesia is committed tothe promotion of responsible fishing practices - not onlywithin our exclusive economic zone and the zones of ourneighbours in the region  but also in the contiguous highseas areas adjacent to the zones. The Federated States ofMicronesia has actively participated in all of the substantivesessions of the United Nations Conference on StraddlingFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. In theFederated States of Micronesia  we are fortunate that ourislands are located in those latitudes of the Pacific Ocean inwhich 50 per cent of the world’s highest grade tunaresources are located and caught. While we appreciatehaving this resource  we remain ever mindful of the factthat the continued viability of our economy depends on therational use of the marine resources present in our watersand beyond. This principle of rational utilization ofresources forms the foundation for the concept ofsustainable development.It is not only coastal States like my own  which mustbe dedicated to rational use and responsible fishingpractices. Distant water fishing nations must alsorecognize and protect the fragile balance of nature thatexists in the oceans of the world to ensure thesustainability of the resource.During the last session of the Conference onStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks my Government’s delegation joined the 15 other Statesmembers of the Forum Fisheries Agency in supporting abinding legal document as the form of outcome for theConference. Even so  we do not support any outcomewhich would compromise the sovereign rights of coastalStates over the living marine resources occurring withintheir own extended economic zones. We do not supportany derogation from the provisions of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea that recognize thesovereign rights of coastal States.I now direct my comments to the recently concludedGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States in Barbados  which hasbeen a great success in many ways. For the first time inthe history of the United Nations  we have been able toput forward an agenda for world attention concerning thesustainable development of small island developing States.The Programme of Action that emerged from that GlobalConference is the first post-Rio de Janeiro effort toamplify the principles of Agenda 21 in a specific contextpointing towards tangible measures for implementation.While this is a milestone  it will remain little morethan a planning document without the genuinecommitment of our developing countries around theworld. We welcome the recent report of the Secretary-General on actions taken by the Organization and by thebodies of the United Nations system to implement theProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States. We cannot help but feela certain impatience to see actions taken that areaccompanied by necessary funding; nevertheless myGovernment applauds the steps being taken to ensure thatthe results of the Barbados Conference are integrated intothe programme of work of the Commission onSustainable Development. Strong partnership in thisregard should be seen not as a conflict between developedand developing countries  but rather as a shared goal andan investment for the benefit of the entire family of29nations. A notable and welcome example of such sharedeffort is the upcoming initiative by the United States towork with all countries towards the revitalization of theessential coral reefs  which are deteriorating all over theworld.The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is onesource of funding from which Small Island DevelopingStates could access financial assistance for implementationof the Programme of Action and other relatedenvironmental endeavours. The Programme of Actionadopted at the Barbados Conference specifically requestedthat  since such global environmental problems as climatechange  biological diversity and international waters are ofgreat significance and concern to small island developingStates  the restructured GEF should be seen as an importantchannel of assistance in these areas through the provisionof new and additional resources. At the meeting of Headsof State the South Pacific Forum  which recently concludedin Brisbane  Australia  welcomed the restructuring andreplenishment of the GEF and its intention to assist in theimplementation of the decisions taken at Barbados.We therefore encourage all Member States  during theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly  to givemeaning to the concept of sustainable development bysupporting the overall outcome of Barbados  including allenabling legislation. This will give the United Nationsspecialized agencies and organizations the mandate to startimplementing the Programme of Action.In the Framework Convention on Climate Change  weappealed for a more constructive approach by theinternational community  with a view to furthercommitments towards the reduction of greenhouse gases  ascalled for by the proposed protocol to the Conventiondistributed this week to the Parties by the Alliance of SmallIsland States. Recent scientific reports have confirmed withcertainty that global warming is occurring. Moreimportantly  it is also clear that the industrialized countriesmust make greater cutbacks in emissions than wereoriginally envisioned if there is to be any hope of avoidingdisastrous consequences to much of the world -consequences which cynics were scoffing at only a fewyears ago. We welcomed with hope the coming into beingof the climate-change Convention this past March and callupon all Members of the United Nations to be present asParties when the Conference of the Parties to theConvention convenes in Berlin.In keeping with its concern for the protection andsustainable use of the environment  the Federated States ofMicronesia acceded in June to the Convention onBiological Diversity and is looking forward to the firstConference of the Parties this November  in the Bahamas.In this connection  my Government wishes to add itssupport to the request made at the last session of theIntergovernmental Group in Nairobi that work on aprotocol on biosafety should begin without further delay.The question of ownership and access to ex-situ geneticresources not presently covered by the Convention mustalso be addressed as a matter of priority.The concept of giving equal priority to theenvironment and to development is now widely acceptedbut remains in many ways difficult to implement. It willremain so for many years to come  even though all ourbest thinking is to be devoted to it. Sadly  even as wespeak  the quality and stocks of our planet’s naturalresources are deteriorating at an accelerated pace due topast and current practices. If we are to succeed inconfronting this challenge  the integrated efforts of theentire international community must call upon the assetsthat all countries - large and small  developed anddeveloping - can bring to bear.For example  sustainable living  which has been theway of island peoples for centuries  involves practices andtechniques that are quite relevant to sustainabledevelopment in much of today’s world. The canoessailing across our crystal blue lagoons bring to mind ahost of traditions of our people that involve clean use ofthe environment and highly effective resource-management practices. We must approach sustainabledevelopment in a way that respects and builds on the age-old concept of sustainable living and takes full account ofthe wisdom that can be gleaned from indigenous culturesworldwide.In other words  my country believes that not only isit important to have a common vision to combat climatechange and promote sustainable development  but it isnow incumbent upon us seriously to rethink our roles andhow we can all play a vital part in restoring ourenvironment. As a front-line country in terms ofvulnerability  Micronesia recognizes that we cannot retreatinto the position of treating global environmental issuesonly to the extent to which we think we are convenientlycapable  without giving due consideration to their urgencyand magnitude. Addressing this man-made catastropherequires many more additional resources and a greatercommitment  especially on the part of the developedworld.30Our views on these issues are clear and simple: weare convinced that all our efforts are mounting up to along-term investment for the survival and viability of ourecosystem  the common heritage of mankind. In assessingwhat has transpired so far in all related activities geared tothis common objective  I cannot but say how fascinated Iam with the enormous effort that has gone into theseprocesses. The activities include the negotiations on theclimate-change Convention  the biodiversity Convention  thedesertification Convention and the Convention on the Lawof the Sea  as well as the Conference on Straddling FishStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks  the BarbadosConference  the Cairo Conference on Population andDevelopment  the Commission on Sustainable Developmentand the Global Environmental Facility. I cannot but believethat positive progress will emanate from this massivehuman energy and commitment  and that our future will besecured with this common vision. We are not onlyinhabitants of this planet  but custodians of its resources forfuture generations. I hope that the greed of mankind willnot in the end triumph over the our inherent responsibilityto leave for future generations an environment that is ashabitable as the one we find today. Sustainable utilizationof our natural resources may be the greatest gift that ourpresent civilization can contribute to future humanity."
"60",2489,"GAB",49,1994,"Allow me to begin by conveying to the President  on my own behalf and on that of the Gabonese delegation  warm and brotherly congratulations on his noteworthy election to the presidency of the Assembly. His great experience in international affairs  along with his outstanding intellectual and moral qualities  are for us a guarantee that his presidency will stamp the work of the General Assembly with renewed dynamism.We wish to express to his predecessor  Mr. Samuel Rudolph Insanally of Guyana  our satisfaction at his decisive actions in the course of the forty-eighth session.I would also like to reiterate our appreciation and support for Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose competence  rigour and effectiveness in the service of the Organization are well established.The end of East-West antagonism foreshadowed unexpected horizons of peace and a bright tomorrow. Very quickly  however  the emergence of all kinds of extremism radically changed this picture of the future.Today the international community is divided between the hope of settling age-old conflicts  concern over the persistence of contemporary conflicts  and preoccupation over the emergence in some places of civil wars born of ethnic or religious tensions. While the risks  directly or indirectly linked to the cold war  of world-wide conflict have faded  armed conflicts continue to sow death and destruction.The resolution of the Cambodian conflict  the continuation of the Middle East peace process  the favourable progress of the conflict pitting Israel against its neighbours  the settlement of the border conflict between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and  above all  the abolition of apartheid in South Africa - to cite only a few examples - give us good reason to be pleased.Gabon has followed most attentively the current positive developments in the situation in the Middle East. We encourage the parties concerned to hold on to their gains and to pursue the peace process under way until the agreements reached are fully implemented.With regard to Cambodia  we appeal to all the parties involved to work for the consolidation of national unity and democratic institutions.Finally  for the first time in several decades  apartheid is not to be found on our agenda. This historic turn of events is the result  first and foremost  of the sacrifices of the South African people themselves and  then again  of the efforts of the international community as a whole. Gabon hails the return of a united  democratic and non-racial South Africa to the concert of free nations.For the settlement of these conflicts we are indebted primarily to our world Organization  which  free of the burdens of the cold war  seems to have recovered the dynamism that inspired the San Francisco Charter.In this context  the end of the border conflict that for years turned Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya against each other is an outstanding example of the merits of settling disputes peacefully. The parties to that conflict have abided on all counts by the opinion of the International Court of Justice.My satisfaction is even greater because of President Omar Bongo's assumption of the chairmanship of the Ad Hoc Committee that was established in 1977 by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its fourteenth summit meeting and that is intended to provide a political settlement of that conflict. May this example serve to inspire the many States involved in conflicts to come into harmony with the spirit of the Charter of our Organization.These reasons for hope notwithstanding  in Africa and in Eastern Europe there are real reasons for concern with regard to the prospects for peace and stability in the world.With regard to Africa  partial and contradictory analyses aside  we must recognize that the peace and security of our continent are seriously threatened by civil wars and inter-ethnic conflicts.In Somalia there is no event or initiative that allows us to look to the future with optimism. Quite the contrary: thanks to the ruthlessness of the belligerents  the international community is becoming discouraged and the conflict is becoming entrenched. This is why the Gabonese Government urges the various factions to speed up the process of national reconciliation on the basis of the Addis Ababa Agreements.The conflict that has been tearing Liberia apart for so many years is still continuing relentlessly  showing hopes for peace to be illusory  hopes that were nurtured by the Agreements signed in Cotonou in July 1993 under the aegis of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We would venture to hope that the recent Akossombo agreement  signed in Ghana  the eleventh of its kind  will lead to a lasting settlement of the conflict.Thoughts of these zones of conflict lead me now to pay a tribute  on behalf of my country  to the Angolan Government for its determination to pursue negotiation. Gabon encourages the efforts to restore peace in Angola  in accordance with the peace Agreements concluded to date and with Security Council resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). Here we appeal to UNITA to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Lusaka talks to put an end to this war that has been casting a pall over Angola for almost 20 years now.On Rwanda  I reiterate the appeal of the Government of Gabon to all the sons and daughters of that country to adopt a spirit of tolerance  harmony and renewed peace and begin at last to work towards the same goal: the reconstruction of their battered  devastated country. In that context  Gabon has not failed to express its support for the humanitarian activities undertaken by the United Nations through the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)  by France through its Operation Turquoise  and by many non-governmental organizations. My country has also called for more effective and persistent participation by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations in the peace process aimed at putting an end to the tragedy.Having hailed the welcome initiatives of non-governmental organizations and of Gabonese citizens to ease the suffering of our brethren in Rwanda  my Government has decided  first  to make a voluntary contribution - the funds for which have been released - to the United Nations Special Fund for Rwanda. Secondly  it will provide assistance to the afflicted populations  principally in the form of food products  clothing and medicine  which my Government is committed to sending to Kigali by its own means. The ""air-bridge"" for that purpose opened on 18 September 1994  when we delivered the initial portion of this aid to the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Rwanda. Thirdly  if the need arises  we shall take in Rwandese orphans  in collaboration with international organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.In eastern Europe  the horror continues in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the negative result of the recent referendum is not likely to allow the speedy settlement of this conflict  which has gone on far too long. Here again  Gabon appeals to the parties to the conflict to bring peace to their region.These tragedies have put the Organization to a harsh test. But  despite the uncertainty of the post-cold-war period  the United Nations remains a priority forum for creating and nurturing the collective search for peace. To do this  the passivity displayed by nearly all participants in international life must be replaced by a determination to take preventive action. In that connection  the Agenda forPeace outlines the action that needs to be taken to avert  as quickly as possible  situations that could give rise to conflicts  particularly action in the framework of preventive diplomacy.For its part  Africa has not been idle in this sphere. Indeed  our major concern is reflected in the creation by the OAU of machinery for the prevention  management and settlement of conflicts. In the same spirit  the States of central Africa have established a permanent mechanism dealing with questions of security in central Africa  with a mandate to promote confidence-building measures among member States in line with the principles of the Charter.The agreement on a non-aggression pact at the September 1993 Libreville meeting  the signing ceremony for which has just taken place in Yaounde  Cameroon  attests eloquently to the dedication of our States to the values of peace and solidarity. But to be more effective operationally  and to play an active role in the decentralization of peace-keeping operations  this machinery should benefit from logistical and technical assistance from the United Nations.To take due account of the new international political landscape I have described  the desired developments must be multidimensional  dealing not only with the structure of the United Nations  but also with its activities. I am pleased to note that there have been various initiatives to that end  including the vast process of restructuring the principal organs  which was begun two years ago. This has been reflected in such things as the beginnings of a debate on the reform of the Security Council  with a view to enlarging its membership and ensuring equitable representation of Member States. Gabon is in favour of such reform.It is agreed today that international peace and security are no longer limited to political and military considerations  but that they encompass such diverse areas as the economic  social  humanitarian and environmental spheres. We think the time has come for this vision  which accords with the Charter  to be reflected in reality. To be sure  since the founding of the United Nations mankind has made major economic  scientific and technological progress. But  despite these notable advances  some parts of the world continue to live in poverty and destitution.For Africa  the United Nations has set up two successive programmes: the United Nations Programme for African Economic Recovery and Development  and the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Both were intended to contribute to the continent's sustained economic growth.While the African States have fulfilled their obligations under these programmes  we have to say that the industrialized countries have failed to honour their commitments. It is also regrettable that the Rio Summit on environment and development  which had given rise to new hope and which for the first time had incorporated the concept of sustainable development  is suffering from a glaring lack of international support. Our expectations are not being met with respect to the financing needed to implement Agenda 21.The Agenda for Development proposed by the Secretary-General should fill these gaps once the international community realizes the interdependence of our interests. I want to reaffirm Gabon's commitment to the major principles in that Agenda: peace  the foundation of development; the economy  the engine of progress; the environment  a basis for sustainability; social justice  a pillar of society; and democracy  the model of good governance. Yet beyond those principles we must study ways and means to implement the Agenda for Development  scrupulously taking into account the major concerns of the African continent.In any event  for the countries of the South  the success of existing or future machinery for cooperation will depend on the role reserved for development activities and for the reduction of inequity. Here  the new World Trade Organization  which from January 1995 will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  will have to respond to the needs arising from differences in the level of development of the rich countries and of the less-well-off countries.After 30 years of independence  we must observe that African States do not always have the means to satisfy their peoples' health  educational and cultural concerns. Numerous factors contribute to keeping our countries in the spiral of underdevelopment. The first is that our countries are unable to process the commodities they produce or set their prices. This leads to a drastic deterioration of the terms of trade  because the prices of raw materials are not indexed to those of the finished products.Moreover  the external debt and the cost of servicing it are a serious obstacle to the development of African countries  as is clear from the ratio of debt to exports of goods and services for Africa as a whole. Gabon  too  is affected by this situation  and for several years has been engaging in structural adjustment programmes. These programmes have not always yielded the expected results  especially since our economy is marked by  inter alia  excessive dependence on the outside world and by growing public and private debt.In this context  on 12 January 1994  there was a 50 per cent devaluation of the parity of the currency of the African States of the franc zone compared to that of the French franc. At the time of the devaluation all the African countries of the franc zone were given equal treatment  but today discrimination between those States is being exercised. Gabon thus remains the only country which  because of its intermediate revenues  is refused access to the loan windows in flexible conditions  on the pretext that its per capita gross national product is too high.It is true that devaluation could have some positive aspects  including a relaunching of investment  more competitive exports  a revitalization of the agricultural sector and a reduction of imports. But we believe that it is necessary  indeed urgent  to receive assistance in order to establish new machinery to help the most disadvantaged and the most vulnerable persons.Our common destiny and international solidarity should prompt us to transcend our differences and give priority only to meeting the needs and ensuring the well- being of mankind. The interdependence that flows from this dictates that the industrialized countries  with their technological know-how and financial resources  should support the efforts of the weakest and most disadvantaged to participate in the establishment of this new global economy.These days  States are confronted with trans-border scourges which individually they are incapable of stemming. That is true of the phenomenon of increasing flows of refugees and illegal immigrants  the illegal drug trade  malaria and the AIDS pandemic. Joint and coordinated international action is required to attack the roots of these evils.It is the custom today for everyone to emphasize the importance of the trilogy of democracy  development and human rights. In that respect - and specifically concerning democracy - Gabon  which was one of the very first African countries to return to political pluralism  has been making an effort for several years now to establish new institutions adapted to democratic rules and to promote the emergence of a genuine state of law. But we are aware that time is needed to achieve this.In this framework  recently  in the presence of international observers  negotiations were held between representatives of the Opposition and representatives of the Government to seek ways and means to establish democracy by consensus - the sole guarantee of peace and social cohesion.Unquestionably  the founding fathers of the United Nations wished it above all to respond positively to the questions the peoples were asking about the best way to organize international life. The statement of purposes and principles within the very first provisions of the Charter eloquently attests to this. Hence it is up to the United Nations system and Member States to ensure that at each session the General Assembly takes a decisive step towards the attainment of these purposes and principles that we hold so dear. I hope that this will be done at the forty-ninth session."
"61",2536,"GBR",49,1994,"I should like first tocongratulate you most warmly  Sir  on your election asPresident. The Assembly could not have made a wiserchoice. I wish you all good fortune and success in yourmission.In a few months we shall commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the birth of the United Nations. The UnitedNations is the fullest expression man has yet achieved ofthe age-old desire to escape from war and establish anenduring peace.When the United Nations was founded in SanFrancisco 50 years ago the threat of nuclear war betweenthe super-Powers had already begun to cast a shadowacross the world. That shadow has now lifted  and we alllive and sleep more safely as a result. Yet as we approachthe anniversary we are all more conscious of the sufferingand destruction that still disfigure parts of almost everycontinent in the world. The threats to international peaceand security are more diffuse and perhaps less serious thanthey were  but not less real and not less tragic for thosecaught up in them.To some extent  disappointment comes out ofexaggerated expectation. There is still a tendency to thinkof the United Nations as if it were some great palace ofworld order which descended splendidly from heaven 50years ago. If that were our view  then every broken paneof glass in that palace  every door  every pillar fouled ordamaged would be a disgrace and a scandal.But  of course  in reality world order does not descendfrom heaven at the moment when a Charter is signed. It isnot like that at all. World order is built painfully gradually  brick by brick. Sometimes the wind and theweather destroy what has already been built. But thebuilders cannot afford to be discouraged - and we are allbuilders. They have to repair; they have to rebuild; theyhave to hope that gradually in what they build theadvances will outnumber the retreats.There have been recent advances that have beendramatic - beyond expectation. No one who was presentat the Union Buildings in Pretoria this May could fail tobe moved at the birth of the new South Africa. Thegoodwill and the cheerful determination of all SouthAfricans on that occasion were a marvelous refutation  itseemed to me  of the cynicism that so often weakens ourwork.And we have seen the same as the peace processgathers strength in the Middle East.In part of my own country  we may - and I ferventlyhope we shall - see killings cease  see fears slowlydissolve  as a result of the process started by the Britishand Irish Governments in the Downing Street Declarationon Northern Ireland.In Europe - in Cyprus  in the former Yugoslavia  inGeorgia -the United Nations has helped at least to containif not yet to resolve deep-rooted conflicts. The world’smost intractable problems continue to be laid at yourdoor  Mr. Secretary-General  like infants laid at the doorof some medieval monastery. It is not surprising that  forall the efforts of 77 000 men and women serving inUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in the field  ourOrganization has had failures as well as successes to itsname.As is common in our society of mass media  theheadlines have been dominated by the reversals  and someof them have indeed been tragic. In Rwanda the effortsof the United Nations failed to avert genocide. InSomalia it looks as if our efforts have been effectivelyspurned by a people whose need for help seemed  andseems  self-evident.A word about Bosnia. There has in recent months mercifully  been more peace in Bosnia. It is a fragile uncertain  inconclusive  often interrupted peace  but it isstill better than what went before. We necessarily discussBosnia all the time. The debate in particular in thisbuilding about the United Nations arms embargo has attimes seemed to rage more fiercely than the fighting onthe ground. Certainly the diplomatic efforts have beenfrustrating. And I can understand those who believe thatreverting to a fight  even a fight to the death  would be5preferable to the tangle of negotiations and compromise thatsometimes seems to stretch ahead for ever.Nevertheless  I do not agree with that opinion. Weshould value  we should build on  the advances that havebeen made  we should value the lives that have been savedby the reduction in fighting on the ground. We can nowsee perhaps more clearly that the United Nations ProtectionForce (UNPROFOR) has been essential in protectingcivilians and in preventing the Bosnian Serb army frommaking further advances. Who here can believe thatGorazde  or Srebrenica or Zepa would still be in the handsof the Bosnian Government if it were not for the braveryand commitment of UNPROFOR troops?UNPROFOR can operate only if it is able to keeplines open to all the parties to the fighting. It could notcontinue if leading members of the United Nations wererearming one side; UNPROFOR would then be identifiedas a party to the war. It is not mandated or equipped forthat purpose. Our Secretary-General has endorsed thatview  and the Commander of United Nations forces inBosnia has rightly said ""We have not come here to fight awar from inside white painted vehicles"".So I welcome the decision of which we heardyesterday from the Bosnian President  the decision to acceptthat now is not the moment to lift the arms embargo. Andthat Bosnian decision allows UNPROFOR to continue itsmission. We have said before that if the Bosnian Serbs donot join the peace process and agree the map presented bythe Contact Group  then our present approach may becomeexhausted. Lifting the arms embargo may becomeunavoidable  as we said at Geneva in July  and in thosecircumstances UNPROFOR would have to withdraw. Butit would not be a good policy. Indeed  it would be a policyof despair  a policy that  as in Shakespeare’s King Lear ""Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea ""...""That things might change or cease"". (King Lear  ActIII  scene i  l. 5)A real solution to the conflict  as always  lies withthose who are doing the fighting. We from outside mustcontinue to show all the parties that the way forward ispolitical agreement and not more military action. There isa settlement plan  the settlement plan of the Contact Group on the table. Those who refuse it  those who continue thewarfare  must be isolated  must be put under sustained -indeed  increased - pressure. Those who cooperate with theinternational peace plan effectively  in deeds and not justin words  should have that cooperation recognized.I need to say a few words in response to the remarksmade yesterday by the distinguished President ofArgentina concerning the dispute over the FalklandIslands. President Menem was right - and I am glad thathe mentioned it - when he referred to the increasingcooperation between the United Kingdom and Argentinain several areas. Indeed  this cooperation nowadayscharacterizes our bilateral relationship. And we certainlyhope  sincerely hope  that the progress that we haveachieved together will not be reversed.We are quite clear about British sovereignty over theFalkland Islands and the other British dependencies in theSouth Atlantic  so we were concerned at the recentincorporation into the constitution of Argentina of thenew clause to which President Menem referred. It seemsto us that in these Falkland Islands  as in NorthernIreland  we must heed the wishes of the peopleconcerned. Indeed  any other course for us or for theUnited Nations would be inconceivable. This body hasheard those wishes of the Islanders expressed  mostrecently by their elected representatives who visited theUnited Nations for the debate in the Committee of 24 lastJuly.So we have a difference. But despite this difference we have joined a dialogue with the ArgentineGovernment on fisheries and petroleum development. Welook forward to resuming discussions in the near futurewith the Argentine authorities on a new agreement onfishing and on the development of possible hydrocarbonresources in the South Atlantic continental shelf. We arealso discussing the welcome Argentine offer to removemines from the Falklands. It seems to me that that is therational and logical path to the wider progress of whichthe President of Argentina spoke.I return to this Organization. It is often the target ofcriticism because it cannot solve every problem laid at itsdoor. We all know that there is scope for improving theperformance of the United Nations here in New Yorkand  more critically  where the United Nations and itsagencies are in action on the ground. The steps taken sofar are a beginning  but only a beginning.Machinery cannot run on thin air. The UnitedNations can only run on the fuel that we  its MemberStates  supply to it. So where it has failed  we must notpretend that the failure lies with the system. It lies with6us. The failure of the United Nations is our failure  and soit is for us to take action. For example  the sufferings ofthe Rwandan refugees will not be helped by MemberStates’ holding their heads in their hands. Their handsshould be ready to provide from their pockets what isneeded to remedy such suffering.Preventive diplomacy is the ideal. But it often willnot be enough. We have to be prepared for the demand forpeace-keepers to continue. There are practical ways inwhich we can respond better to that demand: first  byensuring that we learn the lessons from our experiences inpeace-keeping; secondly  by taking practical steps toimprove our capacity to keep the peace  especially inAfrica; and  thirdly  by reforming our financing system.I should like to say a brief word about peace-keeping.It is often impossible to predict at the outset of a missionwhat demands or dangers United Nations troops willencounter. Within limits  they must be ready to improvise.But allowing their role to drift from peace-keeping to takingsides in a war carries high risks to the troops themselves to the political process they support  and to the ability ofthe United Nations to put in peace-keepers elsewhere. Itundermines the willingness of Member States to contributetroops. So in making their decision to contribute to aUnited Nations operation countries need to be confident thattheir troops will be supporting peace and not becoming aparty to war.Rwanda put this to the test  and we were foundwanting for a response for the time being. The issue wasnot really whether the United Nations should have sent anintervention force to stop the fighting - which it clearlycould not - but whether it could find the means  the menand the equipment  for a force to protect the civilianpopulation. That  tragically  took far too long.That is the latest lesson we need to learn from. It isnot now  it seems to me  a question of will  because thereis a far greater readiness than there used to be tocontemplate intervention on the ground to mitigate orprevent humanitarian disaster. It is not so much the will the intellectual willingness; it is the resources  the know-how  the ability to respond swiftly  which are still notenough.You  Mr. Secretary-General  have pointed this out overand over again  and I should like to pay tribute to thepatience and persistence with which you have rammedhome this lesson and sought not merely to tell us the truthsabout it but to persuade us into practical action and remedy.I agree with what you have said on many occasions. Weneed to work hard and fast to overcome obstacles whichare essentially practical.We British will continue to contribute practically.We have 4 000 British men and women in blue berets from Georgia to Rwanda  something which would havebeen thought inconceivable even 10 years ago. We havethe seconded British experts at United NationsHeadquarters. The speed with which the Department ofPeace-keeping Operations has adapted to cope with ever-increasing demand has been impressive. Thedevelopment of the professional military staff at UnitedNations Headquarters has been particularly welcome. Sohas the trend to bring more seconded staff in alongsideUnited Nations personnel. But it will be vital also to helpto strengthen our ability to respond quickly in areas whereit remains weak. Africa  in the light of experience should be a priority.Africa’s need for peace-keepers is plain to see:nearly 40 per cent of all United Nations peace-keepers aredeployed in Africa. Africa needs peace. There can be nodoubt of that  because it is only in peace that Africanswill succeed in finding their own solutions to theirproblems. The remarkable events in South Africa earlierthis year showed that.The efforts of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) to develop a coherent approach to the preventionof conflict are welcome. They deserve our full support.But the OAU has warned that its resources are notenough. I believe that the United Nations must respond.By setting up a coherent structure of support systems running from early warning and preventive diplomacyright through to humanitarian and peace-keepingdeployment on the ground  we can make sure that theskills and resources can be put into action as soon as theneed arises  and not months later.What does that mean? It means  first  an earlywarning system. Not all conflicts can be foreseen. Someare triggered by assassination or a coup d’état or othersudden events. More often  surely  we can see troublebrewing: competition for land and resources  ethnic orreligious rivalry  the gradual breakdown of law and order ill-judged responses by central governments. We need amechanism to pull together information and analysis ofevents like these  to take a regular forward look atpotential troublespots and decide whether preventivediplomacy needs to be triggered.7Then  secondly  it means a capacity to react  that is tosay  to intervene diplomatically before warfare breaks out.We do not have that capacity now. Britain and France - weannounced this last year - have offered help  makingavailable experienced diplomats and offering equipment andsupport. There needs to be an institutional framework. InEurope we have the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE)  which operates to agreedprinciples and has intervened  for example  in Ukraine Moldova and the Baltic States to try to help parties toresolve disputes before there is recourse to fighting. TheOAU has its own experience of pre-emptive action  and itwould clearly need to be the focal point of an enhancedeffort in Africa. I am proposing that the United Nationsshould help the OAU and African countries to share thisexpertise and establish agreed mechanisms for preventivediplomacy in Africa.But  thirdly  that will not always be enough. Peace-keeping skills will continue to be in demand. We mustbuild up the necessary capabilities in Africa. Many Africancountries already make a major contribution to peace-keeping - Ghana  Egypt  Botswana  Zimbabwe and Zambia to mention just some. But we all know the United Nationshas not been able to deploy in Africa with the necessaryspeed and effectiveness.I therefore propose that  under the auspices of theUnited Nations  a number of military staff colleges existingin Africa should become peace-keeping skills centres; thatis to say  they should give training in doctrines anddisciplines of peace-keeping  and in mediation and conflictresolution.The physical capacity also needs to be strengthened ifintervention is to be rapid when it is needed. That requiresUnited Nations logistics basing centres  like those alreadyexisting in Europe  to store equipment and ensure that it isquickly available  with rapid mobile logistics teams earmarked by Member States  to help to maintain thatequipment in good running order and to give training andon-the-spot maintenance support. Again  the lesson ofRwanda is clear. These centres will also need headquartersstaff to identify and remedy logistic weaknesses  giveadvice on maps or communications and advise existing andpotential troop contributors.These are not proposals for enormous new machinery.We need a framework within which existing resources capability and know-how can be mobilized. We willstrongly support such an effort. It needs furtherdiscussion - above all  among and with African countries.We would welcome such discussion soon  here in NewYork  to develop these ideas  other people’s ideas andtake some practical decisions quickly.Finally  money. As you  Mr. Secretary-General remind us  as you are bound to remind us  the UnitedNations at the moment works miracles with what we donot pay it. It simply cannot keep running on exhaustedcredit. It must be able to pay its peace-keepers  forexample. We will not be able to build up the operationsof the United Nations unless we act now to put thefinances of the United Nations on a sound and sustainablefooting for the long term.No radical change in principles is needed  but we doneed a sensible updating of the way in which assessmentsare calculated. The existing system was adopted in 1973.Much has changed. No one now would propose thatStates with above average per capita incomes shouldenjoy an 80 per cent discount on their peace-keepingcontributions. No one now would suggest that discountsfor all the newly independent Member States should beabsorbed by five countries in an open-ended arrangement.But that is the system. It means that some countries arepaying too much and others too little. It means that wenow need to put these anomalies right. Moving to asystem based on relative capacity to pay  with automaticadjustment for changing circumstances  would not meanvery much change for most countries  but it would meana fair  equitable basis on which the long-term viabilityand therefore vitality of the United Nations could beassured.A word about the Security Council. Reform is onthe agenda - that is quite right - and I believe it is in theinterests of the United Nations to sort out the question ofenlargement in good time. We would like the momentumof discussion to be maintained.Next year’s fiftieth anniversary is a good milestonefor the debate. We will work hard for a good outcome both on enlargement and on transparency  where recentinformal arrangements to improve consultation on peace-keeping between the Secretariat  the Security Council andtroop contributors should be further developed.We should ensure that the Council is representative while avoiding an enlargement so great that it puts at riskthe effectiveness of the Council. If consensus can bereached  then clearly there are countries that  by virtue oftheir global interests and their contribution to international8security and United Nations operations  should be invited toaccept the responsibilities of permanent membership.I have concentrated today on how we deal with crisesand defuse tensions. But  of course  those are only some ofthe challenges that our Organization faces. Drug traffickingand associated international crime are other threats to oursecurity and well-being. We need to give new energy andencouragement to all those who are involved in developingcooperation against those threats. I mention this because Ifeel that we must give particular support to the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme. This is theprogramme that has the responsibility for leading all theworld’s efforts in this field. Once again  the UnitedNations is the best resource we have for tackling a menacethat threatens the whole world.In conclusion  we can say confidently that the UnitedNations is indispensable. It is not a perfect glass palace but it is the best building we have  even though the windsstill blow cruelly through its gaps and its defects. We all therefore  have a duty to repair  make good  build afresh.Next year we will look back rightly on theachievements  and the list of achievements is long. But itwill remind us  and we will remind ourselves  of what hasnot yet been achieved. And I hope that will stir us to showthe same vision  the same strength of purpose as thefounders of the United Nations  with  I hope  results ofequal value for the next 50 years."
"62",2560,"GEO",49,1994,"I should like to begin byextending my congratulations to Mr. Amara Essy on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. It is a fitting acknowledgement of hisconsiderable experience  as well as a tribute to his country’shigh standing in the international community.I should also like to offer greetings and special wordsof gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the attention and careful consideration hehas accorded to my country’s problems and for his selflessdevotion to the cause of securing a safer and saner worldfor future generations. The Georgian people are lookingforward with great anticipation to his forthcoming officialvisit to Georgia.First of all  I would like to convey to the Assemblythe greetings and best wishes for productive work from theHead of State and Chairman of the Parliament of theRepublic of Georgia  Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze.Just over two years have passed since the day I hadthe privilege of ushering my country into the UnitedNations as its one hundred seventy-ninth Member andaddressing the Assembly from this rostrum. It was amoment of joy and celebration for my nation.Many events have taken place in those two years  andthey certainly cannot serve as a basis for euphoria andcomplacency.My country has only recently set out on the arduousjourney of building a democratic society. It is encounteringnumerous internal  as well as external  problems in itsefforts. Despite fair and democratic elections and theforming of government structures  the country continues tolanguish in a deep economic and political crisis.The international community has extended a helpinghand to Georgia  and I should like to convey ourappreciation and gratitude to the Governments of the UnitedStates of America  the Russian Federation  Germany  otherStates members of the European Union and Turkey  toname but a few  as well as to the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies  for their invaluable assistance to mycountry in times of hardship.Granted  a large measure of the problems facingGeorgia and all those nations which have only recentlyreverted to independence and normal development havedomestic roots and must be addressed  first and foremost by the countries themselves. But let us leave the internalaspect aside for the moment and concentrate on theinternational environment  of which these nations  as wellas all other nations  are a part.With the demise of the cold war the worldunderwent profound changes. The risk of an all-outnuclear catastrophe receded  and the world thus becamea less dangerous place; but at the same time it becameless stable and less predictable. The relationship betweenStates and other actors on the international scene haschanged  too.The system of post-war international relations wastailored to the economic  political  ideological  geographicand other realities of that era. One of these realities wasa deep realization of the fact that a totalitarian regime ofthe fascist variety had been defeated. Therefore  despiteits major flaws  the post-war bipolar system generallyresponded to the demands of the times and somehowensured security and stability on our planet.Our generation witnessed the fall of anothertotalitarian regime with the downfall of communistideology and of its followers. This resulted in deepchanges in the nature of international relations. Differentdemands are being dictated by the times and differentchallenges are now facing the community of nations.This end of a whole era of human history  however  wasnot followed by the creation of a new system ofinternational relations that would correspond to therealities of the contemporary world  as happened some 50years ago. International political institutions  as well aspolitical thought in general  found themselves unpreparedfor the changes  and they continue to apply stop-gapmeasures to this very day.Today’s political leaders seem to haveunderestimated both the essence and the importance ofthese changes; hence the inability to cope with today’sproblems or with the challenges of thepost-confrontational world. The infrastructure  principles tools and mentality of international relations need to beadapted to the changed circumstances.Therein lies the external aspect of the problems thatthe newly emerging independent States  including my owncountry  are facing. They are taking their first unsuresteps on the road to a democratic society  a long anddifficult road in a world that is still reeling from thenature of the changes and that realizes neither the extentof the predicament these nations face nor the stake it hasin their existence and stable development.24Many of these nations  including my own  can unfortunately  be described as ""hot spots"": they are theunhealed wounds that cover the body of our planet. Theseopen wounds cry out for radical surgery  while thepeace-keeping activities of the international community despite its best efforts  tend in some cases to resemblecautious treatment with prescribed medication.Perhaps  as I am the Foreign Minister of Georgia  it isnot for me to complain about the deficiencies of the UnitedNations in terms of its peace-keeping activities. TheOrganization as a whole  its Security Council Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his SpecialEnvoy  Ambassador Brunner of Switzerland  have accordeda great deal of attention to the problems of my tormentedcountry. On the issue of Georgia’s Abkhazia region alone nine Security Council resolutions have been adopted numerous missions have been dispatched and the mandateof the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia(UNOMIG) has been extended. Alas  this has not provedto be sufficient. Clear decisions and bold  timely action arewhat the peoples of the world expect of the United Nationsand of the Member States that make up the Organization.In this regard  I would like to note how useful andtimely the Georgian Government found the recent visit toGeorgia of the United States Permanent Representative tothe United Nations  Ambassador Madeleine Albright. Thatvisit also demonstrates the attention President Clintonattaches to events in Georgia.While I would not want to belabour the issue of ""hotspots "" the predicament of my own country does not allowme to ignore this problem altogether. We would hate tothink that yet another experiment is perhaps beingconducted in Georgia  the result of which may well have adirect bearing on the security and sovereignty of othernations.It is hard to describe the disappointment - andsometimes apathy - which the Georgian nation is feelingwith regard to whether the international community will beable to promote a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazianconflict.These feelings have created a dangerous and volatilepolitical situation domestically. A wave of indignation isrising in Parliament and among the people at the inabilityto resolve this conflict - and the efforts to do so have beengoing on for more than a year now - and allow almost300 000 displaced persons  who escaped physicalextermination  to return to their homes and continue theirlives.At the heart of the Abkhazian conflict is an attemptby forces of aggressive separatism  bolstered by externalsupport  to wrench a piece of territory away from asovereign State and to create  in that part of Georgia  aprovincial dictatorship based on ethnic hatred  intoleranceand discrimination.We appealed to the United Nations in the hope thatit would be responsive to our desire to settle the conflictby peaceful means through a United Nationspeace-keeping operation. But our hopes were onlypartially fulfilled. Despite almost a dozen resolutions ofthe Security Council  Member States could find neitherthe financial resources  the military contingents nor thepolitical will to order a peace-keeping operation inGeorgia.Convinced of the possibility of a fair solution underthe auspices of the United Nations  the GeorgianGovernment has been negotiating with the separatists ingood faith all this time under the auspices of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  with the RussianFederation as facilitator and the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as an observer. As aresult  a number of agreements have been signed  whichare designed to promote the return of the displacedpersons to their homes and a settlement of the conflict.But the bitter memory of a string of broken promisesand unfulfilled obligations on the part of the separatistsconfirms how naive it is to expect a forthcoming positionfrom a regime that conducts ""ethnic cleansing"" andgenocide against the Georgian population. Predictably the Abkhazian separatists are using far-fetched pretexts tocontinue ignoring their commitments under theagreements that have been signed.Frustrated in its hopes for a United Nationspeace-keeping operation in Abkhazia  the Government ofthe Republic of Georgia sent a similar appeal to the headsof the States members of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS). A decision was reached and aCIS peace-keeping force was deployed in the zone ofconflict. While its presence is beneficial and provideshope for a settlement  we feel that it could be more activeand proceed beyond the stage of disengaging the partiesin conflict.25The Abkhazian conflict is not a problem for Georgiaalone. Believe me  I am not saying this in order to lay ourproblems at somebody else’s doorstep. This conflict hasdirect and dangerous implications for the entire world.There are also compelling reasons why the world should beconcerned with finding a solution to this problem.Above all  we believe that the international communitysimply cannot act as an outside observer when a blatantattempt is being made against the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of a Member State and when peace and stabilityare threatened. Allowing separatism to attain its goals inone country would set a precedent that could start a chainreaction throughout the world. And how many of usrepresented here today can safely say that their countries their peoples  are immune from this danger?And  lastly  the Caucasus is one of those areas in theworld which have a geopolitical importance and bearing onthe stability of large regions of the planet. The Caucasusis one of the world’s few crossroads where North  South East and West meet  and where continents  cultures interests and strategies encounter one another. If peace andstability cannot be maintained in the Caucasus  they cannotbe maintained anywhere.In this regard  it is tragic that our closest neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan  have been unable to resolve theirdifferences for so many years now. This conflict  too  tearsat the fabric of the Caucasus and greatly increases theinstability of the region  as well as the misery of hundredsof thousands of people.It is my Government’s firm position that theAbkhazian conflict can and should be resolved by peacefulmeans. A great deal of effort  delicate statesmanship anddeep commitment are required from all sides.The Georgian Government has to be very meticulousin elaborating a modern  workable and fair structure for itsethnically and culturally diverse population  a diversitywhich throughout the centuries has been a source offriendship  stability and pride  and never of tension orhatred. Most important  it has to create a strong economicbase for its people  one that would prevent economichardships from taking on a political and ethnic character.Georgia will never accept the loss of any part of itsterritory. Not only because its territory is not large  butalso because what it has is incontestably its own - everysquare inch of it. The leaders of the Abkhazian separatistshave to realize this. They too have to find the politicalcourage and will  the flexibility and the foresight  tonegotiate in good faith and come to a settlement thatwould be fair and lasting  so that future generations ofGeorgians and Abkhazians could forget this one darkpage in their fathers’ lives and pick up in friendship andpeace where their grandfathers left off.The Russian Federation is an active participant in theprocess designed to find a peaceful solution to theAbkhazian conflict. It has taken on a great responsibilitywith regard to this peace process. We firmly believe that despite the feelings of some political groups  the RussianFederation  as a great Power - and President Yeltsin  asthe leader of that nation - does indeed want to see astrong  stable  sovereign  united and friendly Georgia onits southern border. Any other considerations would becontrary to logic. We are gratified that in his address tothis Assembly a few days ago President Yeltsin alludedto this when he said that Russia’s relations towards otherStates members of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates are based on good will and mutual benefit. Inshort  it is a time to think not about the mistakes of thepast  but about the possibilities for the future.Georgia has only recently joined the community ofnations as a full-fledged member. And yet this period hasbeen filled with events of great intensity and emotion forus. We feel an obligation to share our experience andthoughts in a number of areas which  we believe  willcontribute to the effectiveness of our collective efforts inthe future.We live in troubled times and are witness to rapid unpredictable changes in the world. It is of paramountimportance that contemporary political thought bringexisting international institutions into conformity with theinternational political realities of today. It would seemthat even such a representative body as the UnitedNations  if it is to continue to be ahead of events andfulfil its role as the parliament of man in a new situation may have to effect some changes in its structure.The reforms - prompted by the times - which theOrganization is about to embark upon  the efforts of theSecretary-General to implement them  and the consent ofthe majority of the Member States are evidence that thetime has come for a new era in international relations.The number of Member States has more thandoubled since the creation of the United Nations. Wefully support the proposal to reflect these changes byincreasing the numerical composition of the Security26Council to 21  and we believe that the candidacies ofGermany and Japan are appropriate for inclusion as newpermanent members of the enlarged Security Council.Apart from reflecting the political and economic weight ofthese nations  this would also enable us finally to bring toa close the legacy of the Second World War and the coldwar.In considering the possibilities for increasing thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members of theCouncil  one of the main criteria  in our view  should be theinvolvement and role of member States in maintaininguniversal peace and stability. Although we see thisconsideration as a crucial one  other aspects  such asequitable geographical representation  should not beneglected either.The task of creating a modern comprehensive systemof ensuring peace and security in the world requires anincrease in the effectiveness of the International Court ofJustice  the main judicial body of the United Nations. Weshare the concern of the Secretary-General that the Court the most important instrument for the settlement ofdisputes  is not being fully utilized for this purpose. Moreefficient use of the International Court would  undoubtedly reinforce the ability of the United Nations to promote andstrengthen peace. In this regard  we fully support theinitiative of the Secretary-General to recognize the universaljurisdiction of the International Court  in accordance withArticle 36 of its Statute  and on the basis of therecommendations put forward in the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277).Efforts aimed at creating a comprehensive system ofinternational security can be effective today only if they areapplied at both the global and the regional level. In ourview  the ties between the global and regional securitysystems are inadequate for today’s needs  and aremaintained in a haphazard way. In this regard we considerit timely to raise the issue of achieving a higher level ofinteraction between global and regional security systems byconcluding a series of special ""form"" treaties that willensure more effective use  in close coordination  of theirrespective mechanisms.Without prejudice to United Nations rules andregulations and to the provisions of the Charter  or to thestatutes of the regional systems  these treaties shouldprovide  inter alia  for regional organizations to exerciseconsultative and controlling functions on behalf  and on theauthorization  of the United Nations.In various international forums we often discuss thespecific challenges of the post-confrontational world.Separatism  especially in its aggressive  extremist form  isone of the most dangerous of these challenges  and it isspreading like a cancer all over the planet. We believethat the creation of a legal basis for the containment ofaggressive separatism is imperative and long overdue sothat situations  such as the one in Georgia  will not flareup in other parts of the world in future  or if they do  theywill be localized and defused in a timely manner.We propose that clear provisions be inserted intointernational legal documents  outlawing aggressive extremist separatism from its first stirrings. It isbecoming more and more clear that the mere reiterationand confirmation of the principle of territorial integrityand the inviolability of borders is insufficient  all themore so since it is being flagrantly disregarded in manyinstances.These legal provisions should also envisage a strictembargo on military deliveries and swift  surgicaleconomic measures against separatist movements thathave turned to armed struggle and violence  as well as amechanism to use  in exceptional cases  the most decisivemeasure - military force.The military forces for these operations could be setup in one of two ways: either United Nations stand-byforces  an option which would entail considerablefinancial expense  or special well-trained units within thearmed forces of each Member State which  when needed could be put under the direct command of the UnitedNations Military Staff Committee  which itself couldbecome more active and energetic.While the second option seems more realistic atpresent  I would still like to stress the virtues of earlypreventive measures against such conflicts. Perhaps manyof them could be localized and defused at an early stage if the United Nations had relatively small  mobile forcesof rapid reaction and deployment at its disposal. Theseforces could be made up on an international voluntarybasis  thereby emphasizing their impartial and unbiasednature. They could be rapidly deployed in the conflictzone and  acting within a limited mandate  could ensurethe disengagement of the conflicting parties in order tocreate the conditions for the deployment of a UnitedNations peace-keeping force.In this regard  it would also seem indispensable to usto set up a special department within the United Nations27Secretariat the sole purpose of which would be to work toresolve conflict situations. Ten highly experienced andrespected political figures could form the nucleus of sucha department. To perform their functions they would bevested with special rights and obligations.Within such a department a special unit could be setup to coordinate the actions of the rapid deployment force.It would ensure the collection of information andintelligence data  and generally function as operationsheadquarters. The unit could also provide valuableearly-warning information on potential conflict situationsinvolving separatist tendencies.To anticipate a natural question on the financing ofsuch forces  I should say that  yes  it will undoubtedlyentail additional financial  material means and humanresources. This  however  is a case of the end clearlyjustifying the means. As we have paid a far greater pricefor being late so often in the past  the internationalcommunity can no longer afford such a luxury.A few days ago a proposal was made very forcefullyfrom this rostrum that  in order to safeguard and uphold therights of national minorities  the principles of theDeclaration on the rights of national minorities should beembodied in the legislation of all member States. Wefirmly support the principle of providing national minoritieswith wide political  economic and cultural rights  and ofensuring civil and human rights for everyone. We wouldthus like to go a step further and propose to codify allaspects of this issue.Since every right presumes a responsibility  we believethat it is imperative that international legal documents andnational legislations of Member States  along with the rightsof national minorities  also incorporate provisions on theresponsibilities of these minorities towards the country ofwhich they form a part.In view of the rapidly growing role of individualleaders and personalities in international relations today  itwould seem appropriate to us to consider also the issue ofresponsibility for an individual’s role in the violation ofhuman rights and liberties of persons  or groups of persons.Thus  we fully support the proposal to work out adeclaration on the rights and responsibilities of individuals groups and political bodies to ensure commonly acceptedfreedoms and human rights. It is precisely in this contextthat Georgia supported the creation of the post of UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.I have attempted to outline some of myGovernment’s thoughts with regard to the changes that itthinks should be made in the structure and work of theOrganization in view of the many profound changes inthe international landscape today. While these are justsome elements  a comprehensive and balanced vision ofthe needed changes is laid out by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in ""An Agenda for Peace"" andother documents. The implementation of the changeswould go a long way towards eliminating many of theproblems that we are discussing in this Hall and wouldalso represent  as Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze put it soaptly  a very timely ""blood transfusion"" for the entireinternational system.An important period is approaching in the life of theOrganization. Next year we will be commemorating thefiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.We have reached a mature age which allows us to takestock of the Organization’s many accomplishments  butalso one that obliges us to look ahead to what still needsto be done.A half century of existence and experience conferseven greater responsibility upon the Organization  as wellas upon individual Member States. It imposes granderobjectives  but also opens up wider horizons. Some ofthese objectives can be attained in our lifetime  whileothers will be left to succeeding generations. It is ourresponsibility to provide a legacy which will serve as astepping-stone for mankind to make a leap into thetwenty-first century and land softly on solid ground.Georgia is a small country  but it is a democraticcountry  and its foreign-policy objective is to have28peaceful  friendly relations with all the nations of the world.Georgia will not be a passive observer of internationalevents; it will carry its fair share of the responsibilities ofthe international community and make its contribution toachieving our common goals."
"63",2607,"GHA",49,1994,"On behalf of the Ghanadelegation  I have the honour and pleasure of conveying toyou  Sir  our congratulations on your election  byacclamation  as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. Your election is an honour not only toyou personally but also to your country  Côte d’Ivoire  withwhich Ghana shares a common destiny and  happily  enjoysvery warm  cordial and special relations. You will nodoubt be equal to the task  given your disposition and yourrecord of distinguished service to your Government andcountry and to the international community.Allow me also to place on record our appreciation ofthe effective leadership that your predecessor as President His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana  providedfor the Organization during his stewardship. His ability tonavigate the General Assembly through the difficultdiscussions on the restructuring and revitalization of theOrganization — particularly those on the reform of theSecurity Council — and the skill that he demonstratedduring the world hearings on the proposed Agenda forDevelopment are indelible marks of his stewardship.The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has continued to remain on top of his very challengingand delicate task as the chief executive of theOrganization. His abilities and skills as a thinker administrator and accomplished diplomat have been assetsto the United Nations. The dedication and commitmentof his staff have been equally noteworthy.In discharging its primary responsibility to promoteinternational peace and security the United Nations hashad successes and disappointments. Exploitation of theinherent weaknesses of the Charter  lack of good faith greed and the quest for domination characterized the eraof the cold war which  happily  appears to be coming toan end. However  conflicts that threaten internationalpeace and security exist and are multiplying; some arelegacies of the cold war and others the result of thefailure of the international community to create theeconomic and social conditions for international peaceand security. Other contributing factors include inordinatepersonal ambition  ethnicity  nationalism  religiousintolerance and political adventurism.Thanks to the end of the cold war  the politicallandscape in Europe has changed and has impactedpositively  if only with partial success  on Cambodia Mozambique and  most important of all  the Middle East.The Angolan problem appears to be nearing a solution.At long last  UNITA is getting the message that theinternational community abhors its commitment tomilitarism and appreciates the political maturity and spiritof compromise of the Angolan Government. Althoughcertain cold-war-era conflicts such as Cyprus  Korea andAfghanistan are proving difficult to solve  one must takecomfort in the fact that the Koreas are agreed on the basisof reunification of their country and that  after decades ofconflict and anxiety  South Africa is now a non-racial democratic country. We take this opportunity to welcomeits delegation into our midst. The contribution of theUnited Nations in the solution of these conflicts isimmense  but one must also recognize that no progresswould have been possible without the exemplarystatesmanship of the leaders involved in their solution.10The end of the cold war  coupled with the strains ofnation-building  have produced new threats to peace in partsof the former Soviet Union  in Yugoslavia and in Africa.Horror stories have emerged from Bosnia  Liberia  Rwandaand Somalia. Some of the problems seem to have noimmediate prospect of solution. Somalia and Liberia arecoming close to being written off as Afghanistan has been.To an increasing degree regional organizations and smallStates like Ghana are being called upon to bear the burdenof securing a peaceful world  a burden far above theirmeans. In such situations success depends largely uponsupport from the more endowed members of theinternational community  either through the United Nationsor on a direct bilateral basis.In Liberia  Ghana and a few other countries membersof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) are groaning under the burden of helping theLiberians maintain a nation. In Rwanda  in the heat ofbattle Ghana and Canada were left alone to grapple with ahorror situation without adequate material support. Evenafter the international community was shamed into action logistic support has not been particularly prompt oradequate.Ghana takes pride in its peace-keeping role. From theCongo crisis in the early 1960s up until now it hasdemonstrated the will and readiness to come to the help ofnations in distress. We are willing to continue to dischargeour responsibilities if adequate material support can beforthcoming from the international community  particularly its wealthy members. Given the unwillingness of manynations to get involved in conflicts far from their shoresand in respect of which their national interests are notmanifest to their electorate  the option for the internationalcommunity is to support countries such as Ghana andregional organizations such as ECOWAS and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to defend the idealsof the United Nations.With President Rawlings’s assumption of thechairmanship of ECOWAS Ghana is directly face to facewith the ambitions  rivalries  prejudices  misconceptions andlack of common purpose even within ECOWAS and withthe misrepresentations that have made the solution of thisproblem elusive. We must pay a tribute to our predecessorsas Chairmen of ECOWAS who have had to grapple withthe problem. We have recently gathered the warringfactions in Akosombo to push the peace process forward.We have taken note of the misconceptions and attempts toundermine this latest effort. However  with persistence patience  firmness and transparency  we hope we can makesignificant progress in the coming year. What we ask ofthe Liberians is sincerity and the spirit of compromise.From the international community  we will appreciatemoral  material and diplomatic support and anunderstanding of the complexities of the problem.Peace-keeping is crowding the international agendato such a degree that we seem to be losing our ability tofocus on the unfinished business of disarmament. Theproliferation of conflicts generates insecurity andcompounds the disarmament problem. Both problems however  must be resolved simultaneously. The processof eliminating nuclear weapons needs to be speeded up tomake the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) an attractive proposition fornon-nuclear Powers. Bilateral efforts at disarmament such as those under way between the United States ofAmerica and the Russian Federation  need to be situatedin the general context of multilateral diplomacy.It is no accident that conflicts abound in thedeveloping world and the economically backward areas ofEurope. At the root of all these conflict situations andthe threats to peace and security are economic deprivationand abject poverty. It is not necessary to restate thegruesome statistics of the conditions of the poor — thehigh mortality rates  the malnutrition  the inadequatehealth facilities  ignorance and poor housing. Theseconditions are compounded by a seriously inequitablesystem of international trade with its attendant problems including the debt burden. Unequal access to knowledge technology and resources has accentuated the alreadyunacceptable socio-economic inequalities both within andamong nations.The issue of external debt is primary in itsconstraining effects on economic growth in Africa. Thevast majority of lower-income countries which owe debtstotalling $1.3 trillion are in sub-Saharan Africa.Sub-saharan Africa alone is overburdened with debtservicing to the tune of $200 billion representing 10 percent of the total national income of the 43 countriesinvolved. It is not sheer coincidence that Africa playshost to a sizeable number of United Nationspeace-keeping operations.The scale of Africa’s debt and the effect it hasproduced in our economies requires action by theinternational community. The international accordembodied in the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa  which contains a strategy torelaunch African economies on the path of growth and11recovery  has hardly had any noticeable effect a year afterits adoption. The international community is yet todischarge its obligations under the international accord. Noagreement has been reached on the modalities for thecreation of a diversification fund for Africa as called for bythe various studies initiated by well-known bodies of theUnited Nations. This is regrettable.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateraltrade negotiations was no doubt a historic achievement. Itholds prospects of opening up possibilities of tradeliberalization and long-term growth. It is  however  equallytrue — and probably more significant — to note that tradeis possible only after production. A lot of factors constrainthe ability and capacity of developing countries  particularlyin Africa  to take advantage of international arrangementssuch as those concluded under the Uruguay Round.Because of our conviction that the underlyingsocio-economic factors of the threat to peace and securityshould be seriously addressed by the internationalcommunity  the Government of Ghana strongly supports theholding of the World Summit for Social Development inCopenhagen  Denmark  from 6-12 March 1995. However it should not be an occasion for an attempt to impose a setof social values on the international community  nor shouldit be an opportunity to malign the cultural practices of anygroup of people. It should be an occasion for mutualunderstanding to pave the way for a charter for socialprogress.Ghana also attaches great importance to theforthcoming Fourth World Conference on Women scheduled to take place in Beijing in September 1995  aspart of the process of furthering peace and security. Werecognize the increasingly evident correlation between theadvancement of women and economic development andsocial stability. We hope the Conference will helpaccelerate the removal of obstacles to women’s full andequal participation in all spheres of life and enable them toplay an active role in the global restructuring of economic political  social and cultural relations as we approach thetwenty-first century.The increased responsibilities of the United Nations inpeace-keeping  the expansion of the Organization and thedemise of the Soviet Union as a super-Power havehighlighted the need for the Organization’s restructuring.In this exercise we must keep two things in mind. Wemust not undermine the validity of the basic principles ofthe Organization  such as the sovereign equality of Statesand non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.Not even the current preoccupation with democracy andhuman rights should be allowed to erode these principlesany more than is absolutely essential. And we mustavoid allowing the Security Council to become theinstrument for the foreign policy objectives of certainPowers. We must fight neo-colonialist tendenciesexemplified in the economic blockade of Cuba and thequestionable imposition of sanctions against the GreatSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. There is nobasis in international law for these actions  which resultin misery for the ordinary people of these countries andrestrain intercourse between nations. Reasonable proposalsfor an end to these problems have been made which wehope will find general acceptance.The United Nations  particularly the SecurityCouncil  needs to be restructured in order to reduce thevulnerability of small nations to big-Power pressure andto reflect their increased roles  particularly in the area ofpeace-keeping  as well as the realities of power today.The increased role of the United Nations in peace-keepinghas called for the establishment of machinery within theSecretariat to improve efficiency. In response to theproposal contained in the Secretary-General’s report  “AnAgenda for Peace”  the General Assembly and theSecurity Council have adopted a number of measures anddecisions which should enhance the Organization’s abilityto maintain international peace and security. However  alot of work remains to be done. We hope that by itsfiftieth anniversary the United Nations will be sufficientlyreformed and revitalized to command universal respectand cooperation.In the final analysis  however  resources — financialand otherwise — will determine the effectiveness of theOrganization. The financial situation of the Organizationremains a source of concern. Members of theOrganization should redouble their efforts to ensure itssolvency so that the Secretary-General can effectivelyimplement the mandates of the legislative bodies.The Members  for their part  expect prudence anddiscipline in the application of the resources madeavailable to the Organization. The consolidation of theinternal oversight mechanisms into the Office of InternalOversight Services  together with the existing externaloversight mechanisms  should help reduce waste andensure accountability.Ghana reiterates its belief in the unity of thepurposes of the Charter and wishes to stress the need forthe Organization to address global development issues12with the same vigour as that with which it has approachedthe issues of global peace and security. It is the hope andexpectation of Ghana that this forty-ninth session will markthe beginning of the renaissance of the United Nations ready to demonstrate  more in action than in words  itsdetermination to maintain peace and promote prosperity onthe basis of justice  law and respect for the dignity andworth of the human person."
"64",2653,"GIN",49,1994," It is a pleasure for me to speak for the first time in the General Assembly and to convey to its members the warm greetings of the people and the Government of the Republic of Guinea.I should like to take this opportunity to convey to you. Sir  heartfelt congratulations on your notable election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty- ninth session. It is an honor to your country  Cote d’Ivoire  and to us the citizens of Guinea it is a fitting reflection of the trust that the international community places in the continent of Africa. I am convinced that your wisdom and your qualities as an experienced and competent diplomat will ensure the success of our work. My delegation assures you of its full support.I should also like to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana  who conducted the business of the forty-eighth session in such a masterly and intelligent manner.I want also to pay well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the tireless efforts he has made and the determination he has shown since his election to achieve the noble objectives assigned to the United Nations. His devotion to peace and the promotion of international cooperation at a time marked by many complex changes guarantees the Organization's victory over the challenges facing humanity.My Government welcomes South Africa's long- awaited return to this Organization following the dismantling of apartheid and the holding of the first multiracial  pluralist elections.The forty-ninth session is being held at a time that is very favorable for the strengthening of international relations  thanks to more constructive dialog. However  a quick look at the international scene shows that we are still far from the ideal of peace. Indeed  as soon as the bells of peace announced the end of the cold war the evil spirits were awakened. Here and there warlords are stirring up tension  bringing tragedy to innocent victims - in particular  the elderly  women and children.In Liberia  Rwanda  Somalia  Bosnia  Afghanistan and Angola - to refer to just some countries - killing  rape and destruction are going on. We are all concerned  yet we all seem to be powerless.It is regrettable that most of this tragedy is being played out in Africa  a continent already sorely tried by economic crises  natural disasters and forced migration. My delegation believes that the international community as a whole  and this Organization in particular  should act with greater firmness and unity to put an end to this tragic situation.For five years now  fratricidal conflicts have plunged Liberia into chaos and desolation. This conflict's damaging consequences for neighboring States have become unbearable. Despite the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States  the Organization of African Unity and the international community to secure the effective implementation of the many peace plans  the latest of which is the Akosombo  Ghana  plan  the crisis continues. My Government makes an urgent appeal to the international community to become more energetically involved in the quest for a final solution to this conflict.Other regions of the world too are experiencing the same difficulties that threaten international peace and security. The Government of Guinea encourages the United Nations to continue its efforts to restore peace  and urges the parties to various conflicts to demonstrate wisdom by choosing dialog.I am thinking in particular of the situations in the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula. Once again  only a proper political approach  taking account of the specific values of the parties concerned and of the political and material needs of the populations  will produce the conditions for lasting peace.I welcome the positive developments in the Middle East  exemplified by the peace agreement signed in Washington between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and also that signed between Israel and Jordan. These agreements constitute in many respectsimportant milestones in the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  and they offer hope for a lasting and comprehensive peace in that region.By the same token  the Government of Guinea encourages the two Korean States to continue their effort for the independent and peaceful reunification of their common homeland. I have every hope that the negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States will lead the two parties to continue the dialog to bring about a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula and to improve relations between the two countries.The tragic events that have shaken the political life of Haiti for three years now have captured the attention of the international community. My Government hopes that the efforts of the international community will make it possible to put an end to that crisis and to alleviate the suffering of the people of Haiti through the restoration of democracy.The remarkable progress made through the bilateral and multilateral negotiations in the field of disarmament and arms control clearly underscores the determination of Member States to shield our planet from the specter of destruction. However  many perils still hamper our efforts to bring about collective security  which would encompass the related problems of development  environment and human rights. In certain sensitive regions  the trade in conventional weapons and their frequent use in conflicts  along with the trade in nuclear materials and the desire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons  add to our Organization's responsibilities and call for stringent verification measures. Objectives in this field should include a nuclear test ban and the promotion of the establishment of denuclearized or nuclear-free zones in all parts of the world.In this brief overview of some of the major issues in the world  I wish to stress the importance of peacekeeping operations. I consider it useful to rethink the problems of such operations  whose motives and procedures for implementation seem very often to involve double standards. We believe that in order to give them the desired legitimacy and effectiveness these operations should be the subject of coordination and dialog in which all United Nations Member States take part  for collective security is the business of all nations of the world  be they large or small.Africa's keen interest in the quest for ways and means to guarantee peace  security and stability on our continent is reflected in the mechanism for the prevention  settlement and management of conflicts established by the Organization of African Unity. This instrument is already functioning; it deals with all forms of crisis that might jeopardize African peoples' efforts at economic  social and cultural development. A peace fund has been set up to give financial support to the actions undertaken by this mechanism.While appreciating the efforts of the United Nations in the economic and social fields  we note with regret the absence of any significant results in the implementation of the measures adopted. Today we are concerned to see that inequalities in international trade are worsening and that debt-servicing  which is a burden on the meager resources obtained from structural adjustment  require bold action. Furthermore  the debt burden neutralizes the mobilization of funding for commodity exports  which are constantly depreciating because of inequitable terms of trade.In my delegation's view  there can be no development if there is not an increase in income from commodities  whose prices  unfortunately  are not controlled by the developing countries. The quest for prosperity could be a danger  since it engenders a strong migratory flow from the South to the North.Despite the socio-economic changes carried out in our States to stimulate private initiative and cooperative movements and to improve living conditions  the African continent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis. To this precarious picture we must add the resurgence of social problems  such as juvenile delinquency  illicit trade in drugs and narcotics  unemployment  the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious effects of persistent drought and other natural disasters. In this context  we support the recommendations and decisions of the international Conference held in Tokyo on African development. Furthermore  my delegation urges the international community to increase official development assistance and requests the United Nations to give greater support to the laudable efforts of the African countries in their economic-recovery policies  in keeping with Article 55 of the Charter.The concept of development cannot be limited to the economic dimension alone. It must necessarily take into account social and cultural dimensions. As long as some are afraid of the progress of others  the myth of Sisyphus will prevail and part of our globe will be for ever harnessedto the yoke. Only dialog  tolerance and the elimination of poverty throughout the world will guarantee lasting peace and strengthen the unity and stability of nations.In this regard we should stress the relevance of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Development. Highlighting the many aspects of development and its connection with peace  the environment  international security and human rights  it is a reference document in our quest for solutions to the many economic difficulties facing the developing countries. It has thus enriched our discussion on sustainable development.The protection of basic human rights  the satisfaction of mankind's needs  and social justice are central to my country's concerns. My delegation welcomed the holding in Cairo of the International Conference on Population and Development  and we hope that the work of the Fourth World Conference on Women  to be held in Beijing in 1995  and that of the World Summit for Social Development  to be held in Copenhagen  will give in- depth consideration to other complex aspects of this important subject.In my country  the Republic of Guinea  we have undertaken an ambitious program of political  economic  cultural and social restructuring. The process of establishing democratic and liberal institutions will be totally completed during the last quarter of this year with the holding of legislative elections. In order to pay the price of political and socio-economic liberalization  we need  in addition to substantial financial assistance  considerable support and understanding from the entire international community.Member States are preparing to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. This important event will offer an opportunity for us all to recall the very special circumstances that gave birth to our Organization and to pay a well-deserved tribute to the work of the founding fathers.My country is making great efforts to prepare for this great event  and to this end a national organizational committee has been established.The serious international problems to which I have just referred are a measure of the gravity of the challenges facing mankind  as well as the responsibilities of the United Nations. Our Organization has gained undeniable prestige  because of its increased burdens in managing world affairs. Nevertheless  in order to becomemore effective  it needs to be restructured and revitalized. This applies to the Security Council and the other main bodies.Reforms must be based on the principle of equality of Member States  and must reflect a balance in the decision-making process between the various bodies of the system. That is what is needed for the United Nations to succeed in its mission of maintaining international peace and security and promoting a balanced world economy.The embryonic new international order  freed of all uncertainty and threats of instability  will emerge from such a development."
"65",2692,"GMB",49,1994,"My delegation welcomes theelection of Ambassador Amara Essy as President of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly with agenuine feeling of great pride and satisfaction; he is notonly our neighbour in the West African subregion  but aseasoned diplomat. He is certainly no stranger here having served his great country  Côte d’Ivoire  asPermanent Representative at the United Nations for manyyears. We in the Gambia hold him in high esteem for hisconstructive and positive contributions to problems ofcommon concern  both at the bilateral and multilaterallevels. I have no doubt that those qualities  for which heis well known  will contribute immensely to thesuccessful conclusion of our deliberations. I should13therefore like to congratulate him warmly on hisassumption of office and to assure him of the full supportof my delegation in carrying out his important mandate.Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute toAmbassador Insanally for the excellent manner in which heperformed his duties during his tenure of office last year.In the same vein  I wish to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his untiring effortsand effective leadership in ensuring the realization of theideals for which our Organization  the United Nations  wasfounded.My delegation joins many previous speakers inwholeheartedly welcoming South Africa to the Assemblyafter a 20- year absence. The advent of a non-racial democratic Government in South Africa symbolized asignificant turning point in the constitutional and colonialhistory of South Africa  in particular  and of Africa ingeneral. The resilience and resourcefulness that haveguided and inspired the people of South Africa in thecrucial years of their march to a non-racial and democraticGovernment will  I have no doubt  serve as important assetsin South Africa’s effective participation in the work of theUnited Nations.On 22 July this year there was a peaceful removal ofGovernment in the Gambia  when it was replaced by theArmed Forces Provisional Ruling Council under thechairmanship of His Excellency Lieutenant Yahya A.J.J.Jammeh. This change was caused by a series of events anddevelopments within the country that the previousGovernment had neglected and in some cases had refusedto address. The continued abuse and misuse of politicalpower and of public office  coupled with serious corruptpractices at various levels of Government departments necessitated this action.The Gambia has since independence in 1965 enjoyeda relatively long period as a democratic State and as apolitically stable country. We acknowledge thisachievement  but at the same time we also have goodreasons why the Government in power had to be removed.In the evolution of nation States a stable politicalsystem is essential in any country for peace  security stability and development. When that stability comes underincreasing strain  however  and is threatened from within bycertain important officials of Government and politiciansalike  the preservation of that stability and nationalintegrity becomes more important than anything else.There is no political system that is perfect. We takethe view that when a democratic political system is underattack by some unscrupulous individuals holding publicoffice through corrupt practices and other selfish acts  inopen violation of the moral tenets of honesty commitment  discipline and hard work  it becomesnecessary to institute corrective measures to stop andprevent that system’s decay and instability.The privilege of being the people’s representativesdoes not confer any rights that entitle thoserepresentatives to do anything other than the people’sbusiness. The restoration of public trust and confidencein government in the older democracies is aninstitutionalized process that has acquired value andstability. The mechanisms that protect the State andallow for a peaceful and acceptable mode of restorationof public trust and confidence have been tested andproved effective over time.That action is reinforced by the fact that the strengthof democratic societies lies with the people  who freelyparticipate in the political process and select or elect theirrepresentatives. The legitimacy of government derives therefore  from the expressed will of the people to havea government that will promote and protect their rights aswell as the collective interest of society.In the newer democracies  however  where there areno mechanisms or institutions that can protect andpreserve the essence of the democratic process  there hasbeen a tendency  in response to a moral imperative  totake radical measures that are intended to arrest the abuseof political power and the misuse of executive authorityin the interest of society as a whole.We wish to emphasize that the events that took placein the Gambia in July this year must be understood aspolitically necessary to allow for corrective measures tobe put in place and to usher in a new and equitabledemocratic political system. In this connection  thepresent provisional Government’s overriding objective isto set up those institutions that would provide thenecessary checks and balances and thus enhance thedemocratic process in the Gambia and the right of thepeople to elect a government of their choice.14The essence of a democratic political system is  inaddition to its inclusive character  its ability to promote thepolitical  economic  civil  social and cultural rights of theindividual and of the community as a whole. Anyunbalanced approach to the promotion of those rightsrenders the system less democratic  less responsive and thusmore suspect.Any democratically elected Government that onlypromotes the civil and political rights of its people andneglects the promotion of their social  cultural andeconomic rights  or that deliberately fails to provide equalopportunities for all its people  forfeits  in our view  itsright to govern. The challenge that faces democraticGovernments - and any Government  for that matter - ishow to promote that cluster of human rights without givingany undue attention to a few of them. In other words  thepromotion and protection of human rights requires abalanced approach as opposed to an unbalanced one.His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally - the Presidentof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session - in hisaddress to those who participated in the SecondInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies which was held in Managua  Nicaragua  in July  said:""To survive and flourish  democracy must beprovided with an infrastructure of institutions whichare conducive to the culture of a free society. Eachcitizen must be guaranteed  in addition to his or herfundamental human rights  opportunity for economicand social development. ... Basic rights such aseducation  health and housing must be provided by theState to guarantee a stable society in which democraticnorms and practices can prevail.""The Gambia subscribes fully to the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948  the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights  the InternationalCovenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  theAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and otherhuman-rights instruments. We shall continue to respect ourobligations under these international covenants. In thisregard  we shall also continue to give full support to theCommission on Human and Peoples’ Rights of theOrganization of African Unity and the African Centre forDemocracy and Human Rights Studies  which are based inBanjul.To those who  in these times of new and emergentdemocracies in Africa and elsewhere  may argue that theGambia had a genuine democratic system we wish torestate that democracy as practised in our country hadcertain fundamental weaknesses  which failed to allowchange to emerge from within the democratic process. Weaffirm our commitment to returning the country to civilianrule after addressing these inherent weaknesses.The peaceful manner in which the people of theGambia responded to the change of Governmentencourages the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Councilto move towards a timetable that would return the countryto civilian rule before long.A programme of transition and rectification willshortly be announced. This will give details of theactivities to be undertaken within a time-boundframework. As part of the programme  and in an effort toinstitutionalize transparency and accountability in oursociety  the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council issetting up four commissions of inquiry designed to shedlight on the past practices of some public servants andformer politicians suspected of corruption and theembezzlement of public funds.The Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council hasmade it abundantly clear that much as we are determinedto recover funds stolen from public coffers  there will beno witch-hunt. In pursuit of these objectives  we aremindful of the need for objectivity and impartiality. Nomilitary tribunals will be set up. All the suspects will betried in civilian courts by civilian judges.In this connection  the new regime has alreadyapproached a number of friendly countries in oursubregion that have the same legal heritage as the Gambiaand asked them to assist by providing judges with therequisite expertise in similar exercises. In this way theobjectivity  impartiality and independence of the judiciarywill be further guaranteed.At the same time  a Constitutional ReviewCommission is being established to look into certainaspects of the Constitution with a view to making it morefunctional in terms of advancing the cause of democracy.As part of this process  an independent electoralcommission will also be put in place for the same purpose- to strengthen democracy.The military take-over was not  therefore  directedagainst any country; its purpose was to redress certaininternal difficulties. As soon as that task has beencompleted the country will be returned to civilian rule.It is our intention to ensure that the democratic system15that will be put in place in the Gambia will champion  inword and in deed  the balanced promotion and protection ofall human rights and respect for those rights on the part ofall those who hold public office. We look forward to theunderstanding and support of the international communityat this critical phase of the transition process.It goes without saying that while we are engaged inthis national exercise we shall also honour all our inter-national obligations  in addition to playing an active role inthe comity of nations. I therefore take this opportunity torenew my country’s unswerving commitment to the idealsand principles of the United Nations.We have followed with interest the numerous eventsthat have taken place around the world since the lastsession of the General Assembly.The situation in Liberia has always been of majorconcern to us  and the failure to implement the CotonouAccord fully has not dampened our enthusiasm. TheAkosombo Agreement constitutes another attempt  in a longand tortuous peace process  to galvanize the principalplayers in the Liberian conflict in an effort to achieve agenuine peace leading to free and fair elections. It is thefervent hope of my delegation that the continued efforts andsacrifices being made by the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and other African friends ofLiberia  and indeed by the United Nations in the shape ofthe continued presence of the United Nations ObserverMission in Liberia (UNOMIL)  will encourage the warringfactions to agree to disarm without further delay.The Gambia has followed with keen interest recentpositive political and military developments in Rwandaleading to the cessation of hostilities and the establishmentof a Government of national reconciliation  which we hopewill be consolidated further. The assistance of theinternational community will continue to be needed inRwanda  not only to restore peace and stability and law andorder but also to ensure the smooth  safe and speedy returnof all Rwandese refugees and displaced persons to theirrespective homes.We continue to observe with concern the failure of thepeace process in Somalia. The current inability of theinternational community to broker a durable peace andreconciliation between the parties to the conflict should notdeter us; rather  it should spur us to redouble our effortsand our resolve to find a satisfactory solution to theconflict.We understand and appreciate the internationalcommunity’s frustration at the failure of the warringfactions to work towards reconciliation and reconstruction.But peace is priceless and constitutes one of the principlesunderlying the creation of this noble Organization  andthis is certainly not the time for the United Nations toconsider withdrawing the United Nations Operation inSomalia (UNISOM).It is with equal concern that my delegation views thesituation in other trouble spots around the globe - notably Bosnia and Herzegovina.On the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina  it issaddening to note that  so far  all the efforts deployed bythe international community to find a negotiated settle-ment have been persistently frustrated by the BosnianSerbs without the slightest compunction. Furthermore  theBosnian Serbs have persisted with their heinous policy of""ethnic cleansing"" and other war crimes  in total disregardof the basic norms of international behaviour.At the General Assembly’s last session mydelegation expressed the firm view that the defencelessMuslim population should be given the opportunity todefend itself in accordance with Article 51 of the UnitedNations Charter  which makes provision for the exerciseof the right of self-defence. I believe that by lifting thearms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina theinternational community would be sending strong andclear signals to the intransigent Bosnian Serbs.With regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir my delegation upholds the view that the Simla Agreementand the relevant Security Council resolutions provide asound basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict.With regard to the situation between Kuwait andIraq  my delegation would like to reiterate that the key toa durable solution lies in compliance by Iraq with all theUnited Nations resolutions on the issue - in particular those dealing with recognition of and respect for thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. However recent Iraqi military action does not augur well for aspeedy lifting of United Nations sanctions and theachievement of stability in the region.In respect of the Arab-Israeli conflict  we areencouraged by the events that have been unfolding sincethe signing of the Peace Accord between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The balance16sheet has been generally positive  and we encourage bothsides to pursue the peace process.At this juncture I should like to congratulate Jordanand Israel on the courageous and constructive step theytook recently to end the state of war between them. Such apositive development will give added credibility to theentire Middle East peace process to secure a comprehensiveand durable solution in accordance with Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).Another important and worrying factor  whichthreatens to undermine any political gains in our countries is the question of poverty and the lack of economicdevelopment. Extensive external debt and debt-servicingobligations continue to be important constraints on theadvancement of the developing countries. The situation ismost acute in Africa.The external debt of Africa as a whole has beengrowing by about 2.5 per cent yearly and for sub-SaharanAfrica the annual debt growth rate has been estimated to beas high as 7.7 per cent. This is equivalent to $199 billion while debt-servicing arrears total some $45.8 billion  whichis equivalent to over 20 per cent of the total debt stock.For sub-Saharan Africa  therefore  the ratios of debt togross national product and debt to export are almost threetimes the registered average for all developing countries making it the most impoverished region in the world.There is more than ever before an urgent need for the inter-national community to find a lasting solution to thisproblem.Against the background of such difficulties  it isregrettable to note that  in real terms  aid flows to Africa asa whole have also been on the decline in spite of thesubstantial increase by a few countries in their levels of aidto Africa. Equally noteworthy is the failure of directforeign investments to increase appreciatively enough torelieve Africa’s financial crisis and stimulate economicgrowth.Let me  en passant  recall that the Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development served as a forum toraise international public awareness and renew commitmentto Africa’s development. The successful implementation ofthe Tokyo Declaration will depend largely on the commonpolitical will of African Governments and theirdevelopment partners.From a global perspective  it is predicted that theconclusion of the Uruguay Round will link economies morestrongly through an increased flow of trade and financebased on trade liberalization and a strengthening of themultilateral trading system. While the liberalization oftrade as a result of the Uruguay Round may lead to asubstantial increase in world trade and income  the impacton developing countries could be less noticeable. ManyAfrican countries may find themselves among the least tobenefit  partly as a result of the removal of certainpreferential trade arrangements.On a different but more positive note  it is gratifyingto note that the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committeefor the elaboration of an international convention tocombat desertification in those countries experiencingserious drought and/or desertification  particularly inAfrica  has completed its mandate and that a Conventionhas been adopted. The three regional implementationAnnexes have also been concluded. The cumulativeeffects of drought and desertification on our environmentas well as on the socio-economic development of ourcountries have been amply demonstrated. But if thisConvention is to make a difference  it must be providedwith the necessary resources to ensure its effectiveimplementation.The correlation between drought and desertificationand rapid population growth is well known. That is whywe welcomed the International Conference on Populationand Development that has just ended in Cairo. Itdemonstrated the importance of population policy as anessential ingredient of social and economic development.We fully support the Programme of Action adopted bythe Conference and will continue to work closely withinternational  regional and national agencies  includingnon-governmental organizations  to implement it  takinginto account our national priority strategies on populationpolicy. Similarly  the Yokohama Strategy and Plan ofAction which issued from the World Conference onNatural Disaster Reduction constitute a clear reflection ofour collective determination to develop and strengthen ourexisting capacity for natural disaster prevention  reduction preparedness and mitigation.We very much welcome the World Summit forSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen in March1995. While the Conference will address three coreissues - enhancing social integration; alleviating andreducing poverty; and expanding productive employment -it will none the less attract a number of social anddevelopmental issues of relevance to world socialprogress and global development. For those of us in thedeveloping world  the Conference will afford the17opportunity to address once more our socio-economicdevelopment needs while drawing attention to existingsocial ills in our societies and finding solutions to theseproblems.In the same vein  the Fourth World Conference onWomen to be held in Beijing will give us the opportunityto evaluate the advancement of women in light of theobjectives of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for theAdvancement of Women to the year 2000. It will alsoprovide fresh guidelines to ensure that the targets set areachieved. Indeed  the twenty-first century holds manychallenges for mankind  but the most important andpressing will be the elimination of gender discrimination.It is now clear that the resolve to employ internationalmachinery for the promotion of the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples is gaining ground  and that  inthe process  the United Nations provides the mostappropriate forum. In order to fulfil this purposeefficiently  the ongoing consultations for restructuring andrevitalizing the United Nations system  notably that of theGeneral Assembly  should be vigorously pursued. Mydelegation will continue to lend its unwavering support tothese laudable efforts. The creation of the Office ofInternal Oversight Services confirms once more theimportance of the effective management of theOrganization’s limited resources. Urgent attention shouldalso be given to strengthening cooperation and coordinationbetween agencies of the United Nations system  the UnitedNations and the Bretton Woods institutions.Finally  I should like to reaffirm my Government’scommitment to the work of the United Nations and thepreservation of international peace and security. Gambiawill continue to give full support to the international effortto address the social  economic and environmental problemsfacing mankind. The joy we share with other nations asMembers of the United Nations is matched only by ourrespect for each Member of this commonwealth of nations."
"66",2732,"GNB",49,1994,"Allow me first of all  Sir  to congratulate youwarmly on your noteworthy election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your presence dear brother  at the head of the Assembly is clear proof ofthe commitment of your country  Côte d’Ivoire  to thedefence of international ideals and the promotion ofmultilateral diplomacy. Furthermore  your personalcompetence and the rich diplomatic experience you haveacquired over the years are a guarantee of the success ofour deliberations. My country  Guinea-Bissau  which holdsone of the vice-presidencies  wishes to assure you of itstotal availability and fullest cooperation.Our thanks and congratulations also go to yourillustrious predecessor  Mr. Samuel Insanally  for thewisdom with which he guided the work of the forty-eighthsession.We would also like to express our congratulations tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and topay him a tribute for his tireless activity in the midst ofso many dramatic events.The general debate of the forty-ninth session reflectsthe logic of the post-cold-war period  in which the burdenof blocs  ideological confrontations and threats of nuclearhas been lightened  thus creating favourable conditions fora new type of relationship between nations and peoples.The political and socio-economic changes that havetaken place on the international scene undoubtedly willhave repercussions on the structure and functioning of theUnited Nations.Created 49 years ago  the United Nations has longlived in the context of the bipolarization of blocs and ofideologies. Today more than ever  our Organization iscalled upon to face the challenges of international politicsin a different way.The positive trend emerging on the internationallevel thanks to joint efforts by many parties to preservethis trend is nonetheless being thwarted by varioushotbeds of tension and conflict in different regions of theworld.Guinea-Bissau  aware of this fact and of its harmfulconsequences  is firmly committed to the promotion of anew international conscience  based on respect for humanvalues.The United Nations  in order to better respond to therequirements of our times  must take these new challengesinto account and thus undertake the necessary reforms.The universally hailed end of bipolarization ininternational relations has brought about a rebirth of hopefor a new era of peace. Alas  the world is still the theatreof tragic and unforeseeable events.The African continent is one of the regions of theworld that is most affected. Drought and desertification which bring disorder to that continent  diminish itsproductive capacity and provoke famine  is now beingcompounded by fratricidal wars.It is no accident that in the course of recent yearsmore than half of the peace-keeping operations of theUnited Nations have taken place  unfortunately  in Africa.In Angola  the people continue to be victims ofsuffering and atrocities. Guinea-Bissau once again urgesthe parties to the conflict to fully respect the relevantSecurity Council resolutions and hopes that the Lusaka talkswill produce results.In Mozambique  significant progress has beenachieved in the efforts to establish a lasting peace. Werepeat our congratulations to the Government and to theResistência Nacional Moçambicana  and urge them topersevere along this road  which should lead to the holdingof multiparty elections in the coming days.In Liberia  the situation remains virtually unchanged despite numerous agreements concluded between the partiesconcerned. If it continues  this state of affairs may imperilthe stability of the subregion.The situation in Rwanda and in Somalia continues tobe of serious concern to my country. We urge all of theparties concerned to end hostilities in favor of dialogue forthe achievement of national reconciliation. My Governmentwelcomes the international community’s unified actions onbehalf of these two countries  in particular ""OperationTurquoise "" undertaken by France.With regard to the situation in Western Sahara  mycountry’s delegation welcomes the progress achieved andsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General.Similarly  Guinea-Bissau is of the opinion that theconflicts in the former Yugoslavia must be resolved throughpeaceful negotiations.The end of apartheid and the holding of the first freeand democratic election in South Africa have turned apage in the history of that country  which is called uponto play an important role in Africa and in the world.The peace agreement signed between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization  which provides formutual recognition by the two parties  and the agreementbetween Israel and Jordan represent important stepstoward the creation of lasting peace in the region.Concerning the question of East Timor  we supportthe continuation of all initiatives undertaken under theauspices of the Secretary-General with a view to bringingabout a just and equitable solution.Regarding Cuba  my country encourages dialoguebetween the United States and that country to find asolution to the question of the embargo  the repercussionsof which have a major impact on the population.In the case of Haiti  we are pleased to note that aftermany efforts by the United Nations and the Organizationof American States  the fundamental rights of the Haitianpeople have finally been re-established and democracyrestored with the return of the constitutionally electedPresident  Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It is appropriate hereto pay tribute to the decisive role played by the UnitedStates in the implementation of Security Councilresolution 940 (1994).Respect for human rights is a factor for peace and aguarantee of international stability. The full exercise ofindividual rights presupposes the existence of objectiveconditions of economic and social organization based onjustice and equity.The international community must promote more justand constructive cooperation between States to combat theperverse effects of poverty and improve materialconditions in the most needy countries and among themost handicapped populations.We are pleased at the results achieved by the WorldConference on Human Rights and hope that theresolutions and decisions agreed upon there willcontribute to the protection and strengthening of humanrights.Like many preceding speakers  I wish to emphasize on behalf of Guinea-Bissau  that it is our firm convictionthat the Republic of China in Taiwan should regain its2place in the United Nations  on the basis of the principlesof parallel representation of divided countries. As a full-fledged Member of the United Nations  the Republic ofChina in Taiwan  with its 20 000 000 inhabitants and itshighly advanced stage of economic and technologicaldevelopment  could play a preponderant role on theinternational scene. We hope that at its next session  whichwill coincide with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversaryof the founding of our world Organization  the GeneralAssembly will decide to put this item on its agenda.Guinea-Bissau has just carried out multipartylegislative and presidential elections  which were consideredjust and transparent by our people and by internationalobservers. These elections  which showed the goodcitizenship and maturity of the people of Guinea-Bissau took place in a climate of exemplary civilian peace. Ourcountry is firmly committed to the preservation and thedeepening of pluralistic democracy  a condition sine quanon for any type of lasting development.As emphasized by His Excellency João BernardoVieira  President of our Republic  at his inauguration on 29September this year  there were no losers in the elections inGuinea-Bissau. All the people of Guinea-Bissau and ourcountry’s national unity  stability and development werewinners.At this new stage in the history of our country we areof course counting on our people’s determination  but alsoon the international community’s support.We welcome the success of the Uruguay Round andthe prospects for international trade that were opened upwith the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization. Webelieve that the achievement of the objectives after morethan eight years of negotiations  resulting in the Declarationof Marrakesh  should have beneficial consequences for thedeveloping countries  thus enabling trade to play itsefficient role as a motor for development.We believe that it is urgent to revise the currenteconomic order  which strongly penalizes the developingcountries. Indeed  these countries  and those of Africa inparticular  are faced with the problems of the outflow ofcapital and the deterioration of the terms of trade  whichseriously compromise the economic and social developmentof the countries of the South. This extremely painfulsituation is a significant cause of the developing countries’external indebtedness.The external debt of the developing countries ingeneral and of the African countries in particular remainsan unbearable burden for their economies and a majorobstacle to their development.Guinea-Bissau  with the support of its principaleconomic partners  is continuing its efforts to find anappropriate and lasting solution to the debt problem which has serious consequences for its socio-economicdevelopment.We consider that the Organization should devotespecial attention to the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Agrica in the 1990s in order to speedup the process of the socio-economic transformation ofthe continent. Similarly  we support the rapidimplementation of the ""Agenda for Development"".The problem of desertification represents a majorconcern for the Government of Guinea-Bissau  a countrywhich  because it is located in the Sudano-Sahelianregion  is faced with persistent irregularities in rainfall  aswell as massive invasions of insects that destroyagricultural production. In this context  our countrysupports the signing of an international convention tocombat desertification in those countries experiencingserious drought and/or desertification  particularly inAfrica.The social and economic development activities ofthe United Nations are in our view aimed in particular atthe most vulnerable groups - women  children  youngpeople  the aged and the handicapped. The situation inwhich the majority of people in the developing world arenow living deserves special attention from ourOrganization.In fact  the solution of the problem lies in a betterdevelopment of North-South cooperation. If there is to beprogress in the developing countries  health and educationsystems must be upgraded  and machinery must beestablished to eradicate hunger and poverty and improveliving conditions in the world.We repeat our support for the convening of theWorld Summit for Social Development in 1995 and of theFourth World Conference on Women  as well as thePreparatory Conference in Dakar and Habitat II.The international community is capable of meetingthe challenges facing it and of resolving complexproblems. Our Organization has many  sometimes3difficult  tasks to accomplish. It is our sincere wish that theprocess of restructuring the United Nations system  sonecessary for the revitalization of the Organization  can becompleted  so that the hopes that prevailed at the foundingof the United Nations will be seen in a new light when wecelebrate the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations."
"67",2771,"GNQ",49,1994,"I would be disloyal to thefeelings of the delegation of the Republic of EquatorialGuinea if I did not from the outset join with the precedingspeakers in expressing my best wishes to you andcongratulating you on your well-deserved election to thePresidency of this General Assembly. I wish you everysuccess and assure you of the complete cooperation of mydelegation. Please convey my congratulations also to theother members of the General Committee  whose work isnot always given due recognition.We also commend the work accomplished byAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  who presidedover the last session of the General Assembly. And I wishto express special appreciation to His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our distinguished Secretary-General  for his deep commitment to the search for viablesolutions to the problems and difficulties confrontingmankind today.This forty-ninth session of the General Assembly isbeing held at a time when the international community isexpressing its concern at the bleak panorama that theworld offers us  and more than ever is proclaiming itsright to preserve peace and the socio-political andeconomic stability of the world. This session of theGeneral Assembly  therefore  must not disappoint thesepressing aspirations of the human community  which hasevery reason to continue to consider the United Nationsas the hope of mankind.It is illogical and inconceivable to the peoples of ourworld that after the fall of the ideological borders thatshaped the bipolar world  we should again be confrontedwith new burdens and contradictions. My country isdeeply concerned at the negative effect of the wave ofviolence in many parts of the world today. In recordtime  we have seen evidence of many sources of tensionand conflicts that wipe out many years of United Nationsefforts. Everywhere panic and uncertainty prevail  owingto the intolerance and arbitrariness that are real threats toworld peace. None the less  it would seem that we allwant to close our eyes and act as though we did not knowthe causes of this instability. For the Republic ofEquatorial Guinea  the causes are all interdependent:poverty  inequality in relations among nations unemployment  ignorance  and political and religiousintolerance.This forty-ninth session of our General Assemblymust therefore reflect deeply in order to find a globalsolution to these common denominators of all ourcountries. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes toreaffirm here  from this rostrum  the confidence that it hasplaced in the United Nations and our conviction that thisOrganization is the ideal framework for resolving thedifficult  delicate and complex problems confronting theinternational community.In this grim international panorama  my country  theRepublic of Equatorial Guinea  is endeavouring topreserve internal peace and political stability  and tomaintain a strict policy of good-neighbourliness andcooperation with the other countries of central Africa. Inthis framework  we have been strengthening the internalsocio-political structures that make it possible tocoordinate an integral  democratic system that guaranteesthe individual and collective freedoms of our citizens.Indeed in 1991  the Government began a transition on thebasis of established constitutional provisions and has beenestablishing the political environment conducive topolitical pluralism and a multiparty system. A number of14legal regulations now govern the exercise of pluralistdemocracy in my country. May I mention  among them:the law of political parties  the law of freedom ofassociation and expression  our trade union law  the law offreedom of the press and printed matter  the law offreedom of religion  the law of complaints and petitions and all the other laws that govern the electoral process.Therefore  the fact is that Equatorial Guinea today isa free  democratic and independent country where peaceand stability prevail. With only 400 000 inhabitants  wehave 14 political organizations that operate freely anddemocratically and constitute the pluralist expression of ourpeoples. None the less  as everyone knows  there are somewho  because of their concealed interests  have attempted and continue to attempt  to thwart the will of some of ourpolitical leaders in our democratic process. This is the rootcause of the disinformation campaign that is being wagedagainst my country.Allow me to dwell a moment on this point. Becausemy country is being subjected to a systematic internationalcampaign of disinformation through certain very well-localized media. Hence a negative image is being projectedof my country  in total disregard of the efforts that havebeen made since 1979 by His Excellency Mr. ObiangNguema Mbasogo  the President of the Republic ofEquatorial Guinea  to restore the respectability and honourof my country after 11 long  bloody years of thedictatorship of Macias Nguema  who was overthrownwithout anyone helping us. Regarding this campaign ofdisinformation  there is a saying that I would like toreiterate here: “The truth is one  but untruth is manifold”.Everything depends on the colour of the lens through whichone looks. There are some who  because of their ownunconfessed interests prefer to continue to look at usthrough a dark lens; but we ask the international communityto assess our actions in a neutral and objective way  withoutallowing itself to be influenced by third parties. We askthat you view us through a clear lens that will allow you tosee the reality.Please do not misunderstand me. We are not againstthe contribution of the international community to theefforts of the people and Government of Equatorial Guineafor democracy and the promotion of human rights andfreedoms  but we do believe that these objectives cannot beachieved by promoting and instigating ungovernability anarchy and civil disobedience in the developing countries.We see some countries now using the internationalcommunity’s demand for respect for human rights anddemocracy to mask activities that are aimed atsubjugating developing countries such as EquatorialGuinea. None the less  we would like to point out that inthe course of this year  certain donors  such as France andSpain and the United Nations Development Programme have made a positive contribution to our democraticprocess by giving moral  technical and economic supportto our efforts to consolidate democracy. They have doneexcellent work.We believe that the escalation of domestic tensionsin many African countries today has a common cause:political intolerance  fuelled and promoted by foreignintervention in a country's domestic jurisdiction.However  as the saying goes  “The master’s eye makesthe horse fat” — in other words  however they may beassessed or distorted from outside  the realities in each ofthe countries in those regions exist independently of theinterpretations placed on them.We in Equatorial Guinea believe that developmentand democracy can be promoted only in an atmosphere ofpeace. We therefore feel that the United Nations shouldput emphasis on its efforts at preventive action rather thanthose designed to restore peace or serve as a buffer.Measures such as the dispatch of evaluation or inquirymissions to individual countries can be more effective inavoiding conflicts like those currently taking place in suchfraternal and friendly countries as Angola  Rwanda Liberia  Somalia  the former Yugoslavia and so on.Interventions after the fact have been shown to havelimited effectiveness.Some peace-keeping missions and operations incertain conflict areas have also undergone a qualitativechange. It is therefore urgent to redirect the mechanismsthrough which the Organization functions and adapt themto the changes in today's world.We believe that in an increasingly complicatedworld  and with limited resources  international relationsmust be complementary. In this sphere the role of theUnited Nations has become even more decisive. It ishardly useful for some to attempt to monopolize thesolution to the world's problems if we do not all feelsincerely involved. As an earlier speaker in the generaldebate noted  there can be neither peace nor justice ifdiscrimination exists in international relations.My country hopes that the new world scene willwitness the implementation of procedures for sincereinternational cooperation on behalf of those countries that15need it most  those countries that are struggling not just tomaintain the quality of life but often for their very survival.The poverty and misery in all the countries on Earth callsfor action by others to remedy their plight.United Nations efforts in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security contrast with the limitedprogress achieved in economic and social development.The global chasm separating rich and poor is steadilywidening. We need the solidarity of the industrializedcountries  on mutually agreed terms  if we developingcountries are to find a definitive solution to our external-debt problem  the burden of which is another obstacle toprogress and greater social development.It would be most promising if agreement could bereached on the mechanisms to solve this economic financial and socio-economic problem. One suchmechanism might be a re-examination of the idea ofconverting external debt into investment and into projectswith proven social impact.The preservation of the environment and the fightagainst drug trafficking are questions that demandconsideration. The 1972 Stockholm Declaration establishedthe foundations for some universal principles for theprotection of the global environment and efforts to controlpollution and combat desertification and deforestation.Reality  however  called for new initiatives  whichculminated in the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment. We hope that the results of that Conferencewill be of benefit to all and help ensure mankind's thesustainable development and future well-being.I should  however  like to emphasize the obligation ofthe developed and industrialized countries — which bearthe greatest responsibility for the deterioration of the globalecosystem — to those countries that today are being askedto make the sacrifice of limiting their legitimate right to theuse of the riches nature has bestowed on them. Fittingcompensation must be forthcoming  particularly through thefunding of alternative projects and technologicalcooperation.Within its modest financial means  the Republic ofEquatorial Guinea has been and remains ready to takeaction to improve its national environment as itscontribution to the task of preserving nature throughout theworld. The Government of Equatorial Guinea is alsogiving its constant attention to the struggle against theAIDS pandemic  and  thanks to the deep awareness of thepeople of Equatorial Guinea and the assistance we arereceiving from international agencies  we shall spare noeffort to control it effectively. From this rostrum we areappealing to the international community to join us in ourefforts to speed and support work in these sectors.For all those reasons  we hope that the UnitedNations will continue to enjoy the full support of all of usin working to achieve a better world in the coming 50years."
"68",2817,"GRC",49,1994,"Allow me at the outset toextend to Mr. Amara Essy the warmest congratulations ofthe Greek Government on his election to the presidency ofthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We areparticularly pleased that his presence this year will providethe African States  with which Greece maintains excellentrelations  with a further opportunity to make an essentialcontribution to the successful outcome of our work. Iwould also like to thank Ambassador Insanally for theconstructive and efficient manner in which he performedhis duties as President of the General Assembly during itsforty-eighth session.I wish to take this opportunity to address sincerecongratulations to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who is striving withcourage  energy  political will  vision and perspicacity fora new world  a world in which law and ethics will prevail and for the restructuring of the Organization to enable it tomeet the challenges of our time. He has our full support inhis efforts to fulfil his mission.The Foreign Minister of Germany  in his capacity asPresident of the Council of the European Union  delivereda statement yesterday on behalf of the European Union andits member States. My Government subscribes to itscontent. However  I should like to address some issues ofparticular interest to Greece which  apart from the statementof my German colleague  Klaus Kinkel  are furtherelaborated in the European Union’s memorandum.The United Nations is facing the challenges andpreoccupations of our times. And now  more than ever  itmust become the forum to which all those who aresuffering injustice will naturally resort  knowing that justicewill be done. To this end  it is the duty of all to abide bythe principles of the Charter of the United Nations  whichthey have accepted of their own free will  and to observethe rules  to the development and establishment of whichthey have contributed. In this context  all must respectUnited Nations resolutions  particularly those of theSecurity Council  the body on which the internationalcommunity has conferred primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security. This is theonly way in which we can strengthen the moral stature ofthe United Nations and contribute to the attainment of itsgoals.Bearing this in mind  we welcome and stronglysupport the efforts of the Secretary-General in the area ofpreventive diplomacy and the maintenance and promotionof international peace and security  within a broaderframework which  in addition to the political and militaryaspects  also has an economic and social dimension particularly with respect to the protection of human rightsand fundamental freedoms.Respect for human rights constitutes one of the mostimportant factors for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and must be regarded as a prerequisitefor development in all areas and for democratic existence.The Vienna World Conference on Human Rights was animportant milestone  as was the establishment of the postof High Commissioner for Human Rights  whose mandatewe fully support  and the mission of the Centre forHuman Rights. The principles of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declarationand Programme of Action  as well as other internationalacts and instruments  should guide the actions of allMember States on a daily basis.The international community is called upon toconfront many problems among the Members of theOrganization. Fortunately  considerable progress has beenachieved during the past year with regard to some ofthem.I should like first to refer to the case of the MiddleEast. Greece  a neighbouring country and a traditionalfriend of the peoples in the region  is particularly pleasedby the continuous and promising steps taken recently tostrengthen peace and security and to arrive at satisfactoryarrangements for the Palestinian people  steps which willopen up prospects for a final  generally acceptable settlement of the long-lasting Middle East crisis.The other case I should like to mention is that of therestoration of democracy in South Africa. Who wouldnot agree that the peaceful change achieved in thatcountry by leaders such as President Mandela andVice-President De Klerk  is an example to follow? Thischange was made possible  however  only because bothmen had the will to abolish the system of apartheid andto establish a democracy based on tolerance and respectfor human rights.In both cases Greece did its utmost to contribute tothe successful outcome of the efforts pursued to achievethese results.23However  during the same period of time  mankindhas had to endure crises which have caused incalculableloss of human life and tremendous suffering.Unfortunately  there are many such examples that could bementioned in Africa  Asia  Central America and Europe.Rwanda  whose tragedy borders on genocide  is one of themost telling cases. Greece  as a member of the Europeantroika  took part in a mission of the European Union toRwanda and its neighbouring countries  in order to assist inthe task of finding solutions to this tragic political conflictand to the problem of the refugees.As a representative of a Balkan country that has aprimary interest in stability in the Balkans  and contributesdecisively to its consolidation  I will now refer specificallyto the conflict in the former Yugoslavia  which continues tobe a source of serious concern to the internationalcommunity  and to European countries in particular.In spite of the major efforts of the internationalcommunity  war is raging in the region for the fourthconsecutive year. The victims on all sides are countlessand the number of refugees is increasing dramatically.Greece actively participates in all internationalpeace-making efforts. During the first part of this yearwhen Greece held the presidency of the European Union my country undertook a series of initiatives  aimed atarriving at a political solution of the conflict throughnegotiations.The proposals of the contact group constitute arealistic basis for a settlement and must be accepted by theBosnian Serb side as well. President Milosevic’s decisivestance vis-à-vis the Bosnian Serbs strengthens thisapproach  and we hope that it will lead the Bosnian Serbsto accept the peace plan. In this context  we welcomeSecurity Council resolutions 942 (1994) and 943 (1994).The concentration of efforts aimed at ending the warin Bosnia and Herzegovina does not mean that lessattention should be paid to a solution of the problem of theKrajinas  nor that its importance should be underestimated.Greece is willing to contribute actively to therapprochement of the parties involved  so that a mutuallyacceptable settlement might be achieved.We have  however  inherited yet another problem sincethe dissolution of the former Yugoslavia  that of the FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It lies in the fact thatthe new State insists on calling itself ""Macedonia"". TheGreek people and the Greek Government cannot accept thisdenomination because  together with provisions of theConstitution of Skopje  of the Former Yugoslav Republicof Macedonia  the propaganda against our country  aswell as the appropriation of Greek national and historicalemblems on their flag  it indicates irredentist claimsagainst Greece. We hope that the good offices of Mr.Vance  on the basis of Security Council resolution 817(1993)  and the ensuing negotiating process within whichGreece has demonstrated its good will and constructiveapproach  will soon bear fruit.Another serious international and European problem which is of considerable interest to the United Nations the European Union and Greece in particular and which unfortunately  remains unsolved  is that of Cyprus. Morethan 20 years after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and 20years after this body  in this very Hall  demanded theimmediate withdrawal of all foreign occupation troops  aconsiderable part of Cyprus is still under occupation.Basic human rights are still being violated  and thetragedy of the refugees and of the missing and enclavedpersons persists. Furthermore  in spite of the relevantUnited Nations resolutions  the mass establishment ofTurkish settlers continues unabated  thus distorting thedemographic composition of the island.The Secretary-General  in his latest report to theSecurity Council  unequivocally acknowledged that it isthe lack of political will of the Turkish Cypriot side that over a number of years  has impeded any progress in thepeace process. In spite of the many face-saving effortsbeing made  the Secretary-General’s conclusion cannot bequestioned. But even if some would wish to deliberatelyhide from the truth  the recent decision of the TurkishCypriots  which rejects the very basis for a settlement -namely the Federation - that had been agreed and soughtfrom the start  as well as the unequivocal andunconditional support that this decision received fromAnkara  revealed the true Turkish sentiments andobjectives: contempt for the United Nations resolutionsand the preservation of illegally acquired territoriesfollowing the invasion and the occupation.There can be no doubt that this Turkish attitude ofprovocation is supported by the Turkish military presenceon the island  which has gone unpunished for so manyyears. That is the reason why we believe that the effortsof the international community should focus  as a matterof priority  on the withdrawal of the Turkish occupyingtroops. In this context  President Clerides’ fair andbalanced proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprusshould be duly taken into consideration.24The Secretary-General’s recent efforts are in progress and we are awaiting their results. However  mere verbalsupport by the international community for the Secretary--General’s initiative will not suffice. The time has come toassist the Secretary-General with concrete actions aimed atAnkara  which is  of course  the key factor fordevelopments in Cyprus. If  however  those efforts are notsuccessful  as has happened in other cases  the internationalcommunity will have to consider new  alternative methodsand measures that will ensure the implementation of UnitedNations resolutions calling for the restoration of thesovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of the Republicof Cyprus  together with respect for the rights and freedomsof all its citizens.The strengthening of good-neighbourly relations on thebasis of respect for international law  national sovereignty human rights and non-intervention in the internal affairs ofother States is the cornerstone of Greek foreign policy. Theimplementation of those principles bears particularimportance with regard to the relations between Greece andits neighbours. In this context  it is the sincere wish of theGreek Government that relations between Greece andTurkey be normalized.It goes without saying that such a normalization ofGreek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lastingsolution to the Cyprus problem and the restoration of therule of international law with regard to Cyprus. Moreover respect for international law and human rights  inconformity with the provisions of the Charter of the UnitedNations  the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris  isthe only possible basis for the establishment andconsolidation of a climate of mutual trust between Greeceand Turkey.Greece abides by the same principles in its foreignpolicy towards Albania. We aspire  through a dialoguewhich we have repeatedly sought  to the development ofgood-neighbourly relations and cooperation in all areas within a framework of mutual respect for territorialintegrity and national sovereignty and of the unconditionalimplementation of international instruments that safeguardrespect for human rights.Ample evidence of this policy is provided by theextensive and multifaceted economic and humanitarianassistance that my country has extended to Albania inrecent years  in support of that country’s reconstructionfollowing a long period of totalitarian rule and in supportof its economy by various means  including  inter alia  themassive flow of remittances from illegal Albanianimmigrants  hundreds of thousands of whom live andwork illegally in Greece.On the other hand  the large Greek minority inAlbania had been deprived by the previous regime of allits fundamental rights and had hoped that a change inGovernment would lead to a change in their conditions.Unfortunately  however  the new Albanian Governmenthas pursued the same policies of its predecessors.Members of the minority are persecuted  and manyinternationally recognized fundamental human andminority rights are being violated in practice and notadmitted to  in spite of the verbal assurances to thecontrary of the Albanian Government. This is the case for instance  in the field of education  with which theHigh Commissioner for National Minorities of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  Mr.Van Der Stoel  with whom the Greek Government isharmoniously cooperating  has been especially concerned.The oppressive policy of the Albanian Governmenthas culminated in the harsh sentences delivered againstfive leading members of the Greek minority  after aparody of investigation and judicial procedure  aswitnessed by unprejudiced observers from internationalorganizations. All the above justifies the impression thatthe Albanian leadership is promoting a climate ofharassment against the Greek minority  so as to force itsmembers to abandon their ancestral homes.Greece reaffirms that  as it has assured theSecretary-General  it sincerely favours the development ofgood-neighbourly relations and constructive cooperationwith Albania  and calls on the Albanian Government  inconformity with its international commitments  to respectthe human rights and the individual freedoms of theGreek minority  so as to create the conditions necessaryto ensure the development of such relations.There are many other problems on which I wouldlike to express the views of my country. However  timeis limited and I will constrain myself to addressing thosewe deem particularly important.Significant and daring steps have been taken in thearea of disarmament. In spite of the end of theconfrontation between East and West  however  armscontrol and disarmament remain issues of primaryimportance due to the appearance of new sources oftension which jeopardize our efforts towards thenon-proliferation of arms.25The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) has played an important role to this day and we believe that its unconditional and unlimitedextension at the coming Conference of 1995 will furtherstrengthen the overall legal status of non-proliferation.We also hope that negotiations for a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty will soon yield positive results.Moreover  Greece hopes to contribute to the entry intoforce of the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use of ChemicalWeapons at the earliest possible date by promoting withoutdelay the relevant ratification procedures.Furthermore  my country is deeply concerned aboutthe problem of the increasing presence of mines and otherunexploded devices and has decided to declare amoratorium  without exception  on the export  sale ortransfer of all anti-personnel land-mines. We call on allStates to adopt similar measures.It is time to accelerate and strengthen multilateralnegotiations in the area of disarmament. The internationalcommunity should prove that it is ready and willing to takethe steps which will bring about practical solutions to theproblem of disarmament and international security. Webelieve that an increase of the membership of theConference on Disarmament in Geneva would greatlycontribute to that end.In addition  special attention should be given to theAfrican continent  not only regarding the settlement ofpolitical disputes between various States but also withregard to the establishment of the necessary political economic and social conditions for the restoration of peaceand security and the improvement of the economic situationin all African countries.The United Nations rightly places special emphasis onthe economic and social fields  which are so essential topeaceful coexistence among peoples. We must allthoroughly consider the Agenda for Development andattempt to find a way for developing countries to benefitfrom the achievements of industrialized States. We mustwork together to find a new form of economic relations taking into account the difficulties with which we are allconfronted.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment which has just taken place in Cairo  theforthcoming World Summit for Social Development  inCopenhagen  in March 1995  and the Fourth WorldConference on Women  in Beijing  in September 1995  aswell as all the other meetings that took place last year oneconomic and social issues  are paving the way in theright direction.Moreover  I feel it necessary to underline theimportance that Greece attaches to the struggle against theinternational scourge of terrorism. My countryunequivocally condemns all terrorist acts and activelycontributes - working within the framework of closecooperation with third countries and competentinternational organizations - to all actions and effortsaimed at their elimination. However  I want to stress thateconomic and social development  safeguarding the ruleof law and respect for human rights and individualfreedoms are the most efficient and radical means to doaway  once and for all  with this international scourge.In concluding  I would like to express my country’sinterest in the future development of the institutionalaspects of the Organization  in particular with regard tothe Security Council  and to stress that Greece is willingto contribute actively to the consultations currently underway on these issues so as to achieve the best possibleresult for all Members of the United Nations.In the same spirit  I would like to reaffirm Greece’sfull and unwavering commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the Organization within the context ofinternational cooperation and solidarity. We undertake tocontribute with all our means to the struggles and effortsto create lasting conditions that will ensure  at the dawnof the next millennium  that all peoples fully enjoy thebenefits of freedom and development within a peaceful democratic and creative environment."

We are indeed proud of his performance.Grenada also wishes to express profound appreciationto the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisrelentless efforts in the pursuit of the purposes of thisOrganization.Grenada is pleased to welcome the new South Africato the United Nations  and we pay special tribute to HisExcellency President Nelson Mandela for his resolute willand firm determination in the fight against apartheid  whicheventually resulted in this new  democratic and non-racialSouth Africa.Grenada is pleased that in recent efforts to bring anend to the illegal seizure of power by the military in Haitiand to halt the ensuing human rights abuses therediplomacy prevailed and further bloodshed was averted.We now eagerly await the reinstatement of the dulyelected Government and its President  Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide  and the return of democracy to Haiti.We support the actions taken by the United States ofAmerica and other multinational forces in implementationof United Nations resolutions on Haiti  and we joinlike-minded nations as they move to establish thestructures in which development and democracy can besustained.Grenada is prepared to do its part to ensure a morefertile ground for the growth of democracy in Haiti  oursister Caribbean country. We are proud that  within thelimits of our resources  personnel from Grenada’s lawenforcement services are among the multinationalcontingent to help in ""Operation Uphold Democracy"".After all  it was 11 years ago this month that Grenadaitself profited from a similar multinational operation affording us the historic opportunity to restore democraticprinciples to our way of life. It is therefore only naturalthat Grenada should wish Haiti well and should beprepared to support democracy in that country as fully aswe do.Over the last several years many of the smalldeveloping countries within this Organization have beenexperiencing growing economic problems. The forcedresponse has been to take stringent corrective measuresaimed at stabilizing their economies and creating theconditions for sustainable development. Speakingspecifically of my own country  Grenada  I can inform theAssembly that in 1992 we embarked on a voluntary three-year structural adjustment programme in an effort tocorrect serious fiscal imbalances and to put the country ona path of sustained growth.This year marks the end of the programme  and I amhappy to report that some success has been achieved.The Government has significantly reduced the fiscaldeficits from 25 per cent of gross domestic product in1992 to 11 per cent in 1993 and 9 per cent to date.Moreover  Grenada’s credit rating has improved notably with its creditworthiness restored by the World Bank inJune of this year after having been forfeited in 1988.Whatever success has been recorded by that programmeis a credit to regionalism  since the programme wasinstituted with enormous regional inputs. Grenada wishespublicly to thank the regional Governments and11institutions which contributed to the effort. This particulardevelopment means that Grenada is now viewed morefavourably by the multilateral and specialized donoragencies and friendly Governments in terms of externalfinancial assistance for its development programmes.Despite the good fiscal performance  the structural-adjustment programme has not been able to achieve itstargets in terms of the growth rate of the gross domesticproduct. Thus  over the next two years much emphasis willbe placed on achieving a reasonable rate of economicgrowth. In addition  efforts to reduce the fiscal deficitsfurther will continue to be vigorously pursued.You  Mr. President  are well aware that a topic ofparticular currency in the area of international economicrelations is the issue of trade and investment. Of course over the past months new trading blocs have been created with the result that in the Western Hemisphere we nowhave several such arrangements  which include the veryimportant North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA). While all the implications of NAFTA are notyet known  we must nevertheless now seek to position oureconomies to interface with the realities of this neweconomic environment.In that context  the conclusion of the latest round ofthe negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) has very far-reaching consequences fortrade. The requirements of trade liberalization andreciprocity mean that small island developing States likeGrenada must now interact on the same playing field as themore developed countries  which  in effect  signals a rapiderosion of the preferential treatment that some of us haveenjoyed over the past two decades. The removal of accessto market arrangements traditionally favourable to fledglingindustries in our societies - the banana industry  forexample - compounds our difficulties and presents a majorthreat to the overall well-being of our small economies.Furthermore  the creation of the World Trade Organizationwould most definitely change the face of international trade and while every independent nation has the opportunity tobecome a party to that Organization and thus attempt toinfluence its operations  it is evident that  on that score equality will not necessarily ensure equity. We arecognizant of the fact that we must now seek to enhance ourproductivity and competitiveness in carefully selected areasif we are to survive in this era of trade liberalization. But more often than not  we cannot do it alone  and this is whymy delegation appeals to the developed countries to beconsiderate of our fragile economies and the need to adaptto this seemingly hostile economic environment.The recent success of the United Nations GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States  held in Barbados  and theadoption of its Programme of Action underscore theurgent need for international co-operation and assistance not only in the form of financial resources for theimplementation of the Programme of Action  but also inaccess to markets  acquisition of new technologies andinstitutional and human-resource development  so as toenable us to respond more capably to the challenges offinding new paths to sustainable development.The advances made since the United NationsConference on Environment and Development must bebuilt upon  and in this regard the importance of forgingnew global partnerships between developed anddeveloping countries ought to be given priority. Theprotection of the global climate and biological diversity the sustainable use and conservation of all marineresources and the protection of our oceans and high seasrequire urgent international assistance and cooperation.My delegation therefore looks forward to thefulfilment of the obligations of the developed countriesthat have pledged their commitment to assist developingcountries and  in particular  small island developingStates  in the implementation of the decisions andrecommendations of Agenda 21  the conventions onclimate change and biodiversity and all the follow-upconferences of the Rio Conference.For several years Grenada has expressed its concernat the apparent unbalanced resource commitment tosecurity issues versus development. Consequently  mydelegation commends recently expanded efforts aimed atgiving greater prominence to the development needsconfronting the world  particularly in the developingcountries. We applaud the Secretary-General’s report ""AnAgenda for Development"" and we applaud the formerPresident of the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr.Samuel Insanally  for his visionary initiative in organizingthe World Hearings on Development in June of this year.We urge that the momentum gained therefrom bemaintained  and we wish to place on record our supportfor Brazil’s call for a global conference on developmentin the year 1996.The question of population and development is avery sensitive issue  one that demands continuousconscientious global effort. Grenada is encouraged by theconsensus which emerged from the recently concludedInternational Conference on Population and Development12at Cairo  and we are hopeful that increasingly balanceddevelopment will be viewed as the essential basis on whichto treat the issue of population.We are also confident that the Conference on Womento be held at Beijing in 1995 will address one of the long-standing issues critical to development  that is  the issue ofwomen in development.In March of 1995 world leaders will gather inCopenhagen to address one of the most pressing questionsof our time  the question of social development. We willbe asked to rule on the debilitating issues of poverty meaningful employment and social inclusion. We will beasked to rule particularly in the interest of youth  the aged the disabled and all those outside the mainstream of socialintegration.Grenada is confident that the World Summit for SocialDevelopment and all the other follow-ups to the RioConference are replacing despair with hope worldwide. Atthe same time  we are concerned about the different spinsthat may be put on the interpretation of those agreements.For example  we are concerned that environmental causesshould not be used as barriers to access for goods producedin developing countries to the markets of those with moreprosperous economies. We hope that  on the contrary  thedeveloped countries will appreciate the need to assist thepoorer countries to gain access to the technologies andtechnological know-how necessary to the promotion ofmore-balanced development on a global scale.Stability within and between States is a prerequisitefor international peace and security. Grenada is encouragedby certain developments  beginning almost a year ago withthe signing of the historic peace treaty between Israel andthe Palestine Liberation Organization. We believe that theemergence of self-rule in Jericho and Gaza is of greatsignificance. We look forward to further positivedevelopments in the Middle East peace process and wish allthe countries in that region the peace and stability uponwhich lasting prosperity will be built.Grenada is encouraged by the diplomatic efforts in thesearch for a permanent solution to the crisis in Bosnia andHerzegovina. We commend the United Nations for itsresolve and determination in this regard. We fully supportthe establishment of the International Tribunal to tryallegations of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. By thesame token  Grenada fully supports similar initiatives inresponse to situations in other parts of the world  wherethese are deemed appropriate.In the light of the unfortunate circumstances inRwanda that resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousandsof lives  and bearing in mind other situations of humandevastation  Grenada wishes to express its satisfactionwith the responses from those members of theinternational community that have gone to the aid ofpeople in various sorry situations. We also wish toconvey our appreciation to the relief agencies and otherswhose tireless efforts have saved lives  restored health tothe sick and hungry and brought comfort to countlessvictims - particularly women and children.My delegation wishes to underscore the importanceof human rights  freedom and good governance as vitalpreconditions to domestic quietude  international harmonyand the creation of the climate necessary for theachievement of progress within societies. In this regard the promotion and protection of the rights of children isan issue that cries out for greater attention. Thewell-being of children cannot wait for the unpromptedevolution of societies. Deliberate efforts must beexpedited at various levels  global and national  to ensurethe promotion and protection of children’s rights.Likewise  in this the International Year of the Family andbeyond  emphasis should continue to be placed on thepivotal role of the family in national and globaldevelopment.The end of the cold-war era presents opportunitiesfor a shift from political and ideological divide tocooperation in the areas of economic and socialdevelopment. New economic Powers on the world sceneseek to occupy positions that were once the prerogative ofthe traditional super-Powers. Grenada believes that thestructure of the organs of the United Nations shouldreflect these new developments and  at the same time make provision for geographical representation that isconsistent with today’s global  political and economicrealities. Reforms currently being undertaken in theUnited Nations system provide an opportunity to examinethe question of expanding the Security Council and thequestion of the veto power in the light of these newrealities.Grenada supports the principle of universality andencourages the General Assembly to give renewedconsideration to the wish of the Republic of China - afounding Member of the United Nations - to participatein the Organization and its specialized agencies as a fullMember. We believe that this appeal from the 21 millionpeople of the Republic of China in Taiwan for a voiceand proper representation in the international community13is both moral and legitimate. The inclusion of the Republicof China in Taiwan in the United Nations would furthercontribute to global cooperation in trade  economicdevelopment and environmental and ecological protection.In addition  it would assist in the promotion of internationaldevelopment assistance to developing countries. Grenadabelieves that a committee should be set up to examine theexceptional nature of the situation of the Republic of Chinain the present international context.So long as drug traffickers and international armsdealers continue to ply their trade  and so long asmercenaries  terrorists and other adventurists exist  theprotection and security of small States will remainparticularly vulnerable to acts of aggression  from withoutas well as from within.While the United Nations Charter recognizes the rightof States to take measures in self-defence  the reality is thatoften small States faced with serious threats lack the meansto do so. Small States invariably look to the provisions ofthe United Nations Charter to secure respect for andpreservation of their sovereignty. It is therefore necessarythat the protection and security of small States remain avery pertinent issue among the concerns of the UnitedNations.The tasks of the organs and bodies of the UnitedNations are by no means easy. Old tensions have givenway to new tensions and concerns  which demandimaginative approaches if solutions are to be found. As weembark upon preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations in 1995  let us train our sights on thefactors that brought the United Nations into being in thefirst instance and on what gives the Organization its specialworthiness.The challenge is to attain and maintain long-termglobal peace and stability and to enhance the prospects forsolving global problems of an economic  social  cultural orhumanitarian nature. To this end  we as a community ofnations must rededicate ourselves to working everrelentlessly and concertedly towards the goal of making ourplanet a safer  better and happier place in which to live."
"70",2905,"GTM",49,1994,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth regular session and to offeryou the fullest cooperation of the Guatemalan delegationin the important tasks before you. I also wish to expressdeserved appreciation to Ambassador Samuel Insanallyfor the manner in which he discharged his duties asPresident during the last session. The Latin Americanand Caribbean region is justifiably proud of hisperformance.I wish also to convey our appreciation to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his skilfulhelmsmanship of the activities of the Organization. Weagain offer him our support in his endeavours.In the light of the great changes that have takenplace in recent years  we come to this Assembly full ofhope and expectation. In some regions of the worldevents make it possible for us to look ahead withoptimism to a future of peaceful coexistence betweennations. At the same time  in other regions we look withconcern on the inflammation of new hotbeds of tensionthat lead to a weakening of the power of the State as thecatalyst among various social sectors. This situationseriously threatens the social fabric and the very normsthat make it possible for human beings to live together inpeace.As far as Guatemala is concerned  internationalrelations must be grounded in profound respect for theprinciples and norms of international law. Peacefulcoexistence can be achieved only by means of absoluterespect for the sovereignty  independence and legalequality of States.19Multilateralism has been given new impetus in thenew international context and constitutes a more intense more comprehensive contribution to the search for solutionsto problems old and new. To the extent that we place ourfaith in multilateral action and are able to define it properlyand efficiently  we will be able to move forward indeveloping a stable international order that enables us tofoster peace and well-being for mankind. Within thisinternational landscape  which has also transformed theconcept of global security  we face the challenge ofunderstanding and coping with the new risks looming overmankind.Guatemala is at a moment of special importance in itshistory. Still fresh are the historic and unprecedentedevents in which the people of Guatemala organized andmobilized and demonstrated its profound democraticconvictions  making it possible to restore constitutionalorder  which had broken down  and carrying the formerhuman rights prosecutor to the presidency.The background of our President Leon Carpio is wellknown and constitutes the best guarantee of thecommitment and determination of the Government ofGuatemala to struggle for the full enjoyment of humanrights and the search for peace through dialogue andnegotiation. The Government has amply demonstrated itspolitical will through concrete actions aimed at resolving avery broad and complex range of problems. It has done soby pursuing an economic  social and cultural policy thattakes into account the multicultural nature of our country including proposals from civilian society  which naturallyinclude those emanating from the indigenous population ofGuatemala.Our commitment to human rights has also beenunquestionably strengthened by the important progressmade in the peace negotiations with the UnidadRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) with aview to ending one of the lengthiest armed conflicts inLatin America. Among the elements of progress made inthe negotiations  the Comprehensive Agreement on HumanRights  with international validity and verification  is ofparticular importance.In the process of negotiations  the followingagreements have been signed this year: the FrameworkAgreement for the Resumption of the Negotiating Process signed in Mexico on 10 January 1994  which provides forall agreements to include national and internationalverification mechanisms and that the United Nations beresponsible for the international ones; the Agreement ona Timetable for the Negotiation of a Firm and LastingPeace; the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rightssigned in Mexico on 29 March 1994; the Agreementconcerning the resettlement of displaced persons  signedin Oslo on 17 July 1994; the Agreement on theCommission of Inquiry  signed in Oslo on 23 June 1994.All Guatemalans and the international communityare fully aware of the firm resolve of the Government tonegotiate responsibly and with determination to achievepeace agreements within the agreed timetable. Thepatience and flexibility of the Government of Guatemalaare well known and have made it possible to reachagreement despite many difficulties. The representativesof the countries in the Group of Friends - Mexico Colombia  Spain  Norway  the United States andVenezuela - can testify to this.The Framework Agreement and the Timetableestablish the parametres for negotiations  limiting bothparties to a certain format and time-frame. Themoderator convenes meetings in accordance with theTimetable and the parties attend and negotiate inconformity with the established procedures. These are theagreed rules and no party can capriciously change them much less try to usurp the function of verifyingcompliance with the Comprehensive Agreement onHuman Rights. Full compliance with that Agreement isto be verified by a machinery requested of the UnitedNations by both parties. On this basis  the mandate of themission known as the United Nations Human RightsVerification Mission in Guatemala was established byGeneral Assembly resolution. My country would like tothank the international community  the Group of Friendsand the United Nations for their assistance in the questfor peace.It is clear that fundamental rights and freedoms political democracy and the right to development areindivisible and interdependent. Those countries like oursthat have experienced the tragedy of armed conflict knowfrom experience that there are other  broader connotationsto the right to development and that it is not possible tohave development and social evolution without peace. Atthe same time  the full enjoyment of human rights is notpossible without development or peace. The internationalcommunity has been firm and decisive in its politicalsupport for democratic processes. We have to believethat it will pursue this course in seeking to strengthen and20refine them. Regrettably  however  the processes involvedin national reconciliation have not been understood  andsupport for the processes of development has beeninsignificant; worse yet  development has been blocked thus impeding access to sources of finance and tointernational markets.If the development model and reconciliation areallowed to fail  democracy will fail too and we shall neverachieve secure and lasting peace  because if the populationloses faith in the democratic system we shall inevitablyreturn to authoritarianism. The international community hasthe responsibility to support economic and socialdevelopment and to foster the processes of reconciliation ifit would have all the nations of the world living underdemocracy. International condemnation and pressure mightbe effective in fostering democracy  but they are notsufficient in and of themselves to establish it on a solid andlasting footing.The Government of Guatemala reiterates its policy ofwide-ranging cooperation with the United Nations systemin the field of human rights. It has also demonstrated tothe international community its readiness to negotiate peaceagreements within the scheduled timetable. It hopes that in the face of a refusal by the URNG to return to thenegotiating table or to disarm and demobilize itself after itsnon-binding signature  that party’s sources of finance willbe closed off to prevent armed action that would be totallyunwarranted. The people of Guatemala has shown itself tobe a champion of democracy and dedicated to itsimprovement. We urge the other party to recognize that itsintegration into legitimacy by means of negotiation is theonly feasible course that would allow it to participate in thebuilding of a new Guatemala.Guatemalans believe that the authority of the Stateshould be based on the mandate of its people  that anyGovernment must act with the consent of the majority ofthe governed  and that the voice of the people must beheard in the formulation and implementation of governmentpolicy. As far as we are concerned  these are vital andfundamental components of democracy. We understandthat there may be differences of opinion as to the form ofthe people’s expression of this mandate and its participationin the various political forums of the State. We alsobelieve that no State has the right to impose its politicalsystem on any other.For us  the fundamental characteristics of the systemshould be the legitimacy of the people’s mandate  theauthenticity of its consent to be governed and theeffectiveness of its participation. Similarly  democracybetween States requires strict and meticulous respect forthe United Nations Charter.Guatemala participates with the Central Americancountries in a process of regional integration that hasundergone institutional renewal. We consider integrationto be a process deeply rooted in our common history andculture and an instrument of momentous importance forthe development of our peoples.For this reason  together with the other countries ofthe region  we are pursuing important initiatives such asthe Alliance for Sustainable Development  whoseprinciples are based on improving the quality of life ofour peoples  respect for and development of the diversepotential and vitality of the Earth in a sustainable manner the promotion of peace and democracy as basic forms ofhuman coexistence and respect for human rights and themulticultural and multi-ethnic nature of our region.Furthermore  Guatemala is active in other regionalinitiatives  such as the forthcoming ecological Summit inNicaragua and the International Conference on Peace andDevelopment  which will take place in Honduras. Bothof these events are part of the region’s endeavours topromote economic and social development in CentralAmerica.In connection with the territorial dispute over Belize the Government of Guatemala will now be assisted by acouncil made up of distinguished citizens  whose advicewill make it possible to define and give impetus to theprocedure for solving this dispute in the framework of theposition  well-known to the international community  thatis set forth in document A/49/94 of 14 March this year.The Government of Guatemala reiterates itsreadiness to continue direct discussions with theGovernments of Belize and the United Kingdom  inconformity with the norms established for the peacefulsettlement of disputes  in order to arrive at a definitivesolution to the territorial dispute that exists between ourStates  a position that Guatemala has unswervingly andconstantly upheld.Guatemala wishes to reiterate its support for andsolidarity with the people of Haiti  reaffirming itscommitment to democracy and consequently to thelegitimately elected Government. In addition  it urges theinternational community to seek a lasting solution to theHaitian crisis that would set out not merely to restore21democracy but also to meet the basic needs of thepopulation.My country feels bound to express its wish to see inCuba a peaceful transition to a democratic and pluralisticregime. At the same time  we wish to express ourgratification at the new possibilities for dialogue that havebeen developed in connection with the situation in thatcountry.We also wish to mention our satisfaction with theagreements reached between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization and between Israel and Jordan.These represent a momentous step forward in the quest fora solution to one of the most complex regional conflicts.Such agreements are unquestionably proof that peacefulcoexistence and understanding among States and nations ispossible  even in certain parts of the world where walls ofhostility and mistrust have been built up over the years.We hail all the peoples of that region and call on them tocontinue in their efforts to build peace.Alongside these positive actions  we feel duty-boundto voice our profound concern at the events that have takenplace in Rwanda. International cooperation must begenerously channelled to that country. It should beregarded as part of an integrated effort to assist itsGovernment in the difficult process of rebuilding the Statewith a view to ensuring that it is effective in tackling theserious problems still persisting in the country.We also share the concerns about the situation inBosnia and Herzegovina. The international communitymust continue in its efforts to convince the parties to theconflict of the imperative need to find an appropriatesolution that will put an end to this irrational conflict. Thisconflict cannot be allowed to become a permanent situation.Guatemala is a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country and it views with great satisfaction the internationalinstruments that are being developed with a view tointegrating indigenous peoples into development.Consistent with the precepts of our Magna Carta  theGovernment is pursuing policies designed to recognize respect and encourage their lifestyles  customs  traditions social organization  languages and dialects  while alsoproviding protection to indigenous agricultural lands andcooperatives.With respect to the question of women  I shouldunderscore that the policy of the Government has been tocooperate with other sectors of Guatemalan society in orderto pursue measures designed to expand the scope forparticipation by women in the productive process and indecision-making. Within the structure of the State itself there is an ever-growing number of women holding highpositions  at the same time bearing a share in majorresponsibilities relating to the building of a prosperousfuture for our society. At the same time  Governmentaction is designed to strengthen mechanisms designed toprotect women  mechanisms which are in conformity withthe resolutions adopted by this Organization designed toadvance the rights of women.Turning now to attention given to children  theGovernment is fostering joint activities with non-governmental organizations in the private sector with aview to combating drug addiction  illiteracy  malnutrition abandonment and other problems of children.The World Summit for Social Development offers usan opportunity to tackle development as a priority of theinternational community and to redress the inequities thatare increasingly widening between developed anddeveloping countries. The progress that has beenachieved in the course of the work of the PreparatoryCommittee must be further pursued  achieving theconsensus needed for the adoption of the draft declarationand the programme of action.The common interests of the developing world mustfind reflection in the agendas of international forums andagencies. To this end  mutual cooperation is the propervehicle  and the coordination endeavours of thedeveloping countries among themselves should be steppedup.Guatemala has acceded to the internationalinstruments designed to eradicate drug trafficking. Thepresent Government attaches priority to combating thisscourge. It goes without saying that we need solidarityand international cooperation in order to eradicate it.The economies of the developing world have had tomake great efforts to adapt and open up to world markets efforts which  in most cases  have had a high social cost.Guatemala takes the view that trading relations amongStates need to be based on the free exchange of goodsand services. We all need trade  and this makes it vitalto break down the barriers placed in its way  inaccordance with the spirit and principles of the WorldTrade Organization.22As a consequence of the changes taking place in theinternational arena  the United Nations has undertaken aprocess of restructuring in an attempt to respond to the newrequirements of international relations. Guatemala believesthere is a need to reform the world Organization  and inthis respect we support the revitalization of the Economicand Social Council  which would enable it to function inkeeping with present requirements. We are also in favourof establishing a better balance between the GeneralAssembly  the Security Council and the Secretariat thatwould allow the Assembly to play a more decisive role asa forum for deliberation  negotiation and decision-makingon all global problems.In this connection  Guatemala believes that thequestion of equitable representation on and increase in themembership of the Security Council holds pride of place inthe process of reforming this Organization. During thisprocess structures that emanated from and operated withina world of confrontation should be reformed. The SecurityCouncil should be restructured with a view to achievingrepresentation that is proper and equitable and reflects thecurrent international situation.Guatemala notes with satisfaction the measures takenby the Secretary-General to adapt the Organization to thenew international environment and to equip it with themeans to fulfil the objectives of the Charter. In thisrespect  Guatemala has offered to participate in theformation of the stand-by forces.Peace-keeping operations are multiplying daily.No one can deny that the role played by these forces indealing with a very large number of conflicts has preventedthem from worsening and has allowed latitude for dialogueand negotiation. For this reason  they need to be given theappropriate means for carrying out their activities  whichshould always be based on the consent of the partiesconcerned so as to safeguard the sovereignty of States andrespect for their domestic jurisdiction. They should act onthe basis of clearly defined mandates and well-delineatedfields of action.The promotion of world peace should be one of thecentral issues addressed by this Organization. In thiscontext  the limitation of arms production continues to benecessary. All the resources used in weapons research anddevelopment should be released and used to promote thewell-being of our peoples. Nuclear disarmament shouldalso be one of the major objectives on the agenda of theinternational community in the coming years.For this reason  and because of our peace-lovingtradition  we shall continue to strive to ensure that at themeeting of States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be held in 1995 theTreaty’s validity should be extended indefinitely.The ultimate aim of the contribution of each andevery one of our nations to this Organization is theoverall development of the human being. All nationswish to see all their citizens enjoying the benefits ofcomprehensive development. To achieve this there mustbe cooperation between all the nations of the Earth.My Government therefore is very pleased toassociate itself with the cordial welcome extended by theOrganization to South Africa on the occasion of itsreintegration into the United Nations  as well as to thenew Observers  especially the Sovereign Military Orderof Malta  whose humanitarian impact on the world hasbeen of great importance.This gives full validity to the principle ofuniversality  which should prevail in the United Nations.And this belief prompts us to touch on the question of acountry which is capable of making a significantcontribution to the search for solutions to the problemsthat the nations of the world must face. The entry of theRepublic of China  Taiwan  into the United Nationswould strengthen the Organization  permitting andencouraging it to deal properly with topics with globalimplications.Guatemala reaffirms its firm and resolutedetermination to meet the commitments andresponsibilities it has undertaken in relation to its ownpeople and the international community  in order to assistin building a fairer  more peaceful and developedworld."
"71",2948,"GUY",49,1994,"Permit me first of all tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I amconfident that under your skilful guidance the Assemblywill move forward in responding to the many complexissues on our agenda. You are equally assured of the fulland unstinting support of Guyana in the discharge of yourresponsibilities in the period ahead.Guyana was very honoured to have held thepresidency of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. On behalf of the Government and the peopleof Guyana  I would like to express our gratitude andappreciation for the confidence and support given toAmbassador Insanally during his tenure of office.I have every confidence too that the work of theOrganization will benefit much from the dynamicleadership of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghaliand his dedicated staff. They deserve our admiration andencouragement in the performance of their praiseworthybut often difficult tasks.The forty-ninth session of the General Assemblytakes place at a momentous time. There have beenchanges  many of which have had a significant impact onglobal relations. World events now testify to the need foran Organization which is equipped to meet everychallenge posed to it.The world is observing the United Nations and willnot fail to pass judgement on its activities. While muchhas been accomplished  there are still considerablechallenges ahead of us. An overview of the UnitedNations and its achievements has pointed to a greaterawareness of its role in the world. Increasingly  theOrganization is being called upon to respond to andresolve critical situations confronting our globalcommunity. Our responses  while effective in manycases  are still inadequate. It is now imperative that wemove beyond merely responding to individual crises toaddress the fundamental causes of conflict and threats toglobal stability.In the year ahead  Guyana will work with theAssembly to make the United Nations more responsive tothe altered situation we face in the post-cold-war era. Weshall strive with others to make the Security Council moreequitable and effective  so that it may better discharge thefunctions allocated to it under the Charter. As a priority we shall seek to promote the work of the Organization inthe formulation and implementation of an agenda fordevelopment  which should complement “An Agenda forPeace”. Equally important  we will press for therevitalization of this Assembly in order that  as the mostrepresentative body of the United Nations  it mayharmonize our efforts to promote global peace anddevelopment.Efforts to achieve peace and security in the face ofoverwhelming odds reflect the desire of Member States todwell in harmony  however difficult such an aim may be.They also reflect the increasing importance of peacefulnegotiations to settle conflicts and to solve economic  socialand human problems.The eruption of conflicts  primarily within States  andthe ever-present threat of eruption in other States hasstymied the hope of a new international order that wouldaddress these issues and hopefully proffer solutions. In thiscontext I wish to refer to the proposals of President CheddiJagan on a new global humanitarian order  in response toGeneral Assembly resolution 47/106 of 16 December 1992.In his work  President Jagan has stressed thedebilitating effects of poverty and hunger and the urgentneed for concerted action to alleviate their effects. Butapart from these classic humanitarian concerns  he hassought to broaden the tableau to include the entire spectrumof human development and related issues. Thus  hepromotes the principles of international interdependence andcooperation which will recognize the primacy of humandevelopment as a sine qua non for a peaceful and orderlyexistence.He has emphasized the need for good governance andpopular participation in decision-making as the cornerstonefor a new type of development  which will take intoconsideration the satisfaction of basic human needs inhealth  education  housing and the right to productiveemployment for all.My Government has recognized that the question ofbasic human needs cannot be ignored. It is a prerequisitefor good order and stability  which would in turn producea stable political environment. Governments cannot affordto allow the growth of social discontent that isengendered by the vicious circle of debt  poverty andeconomic deprivation.There are many countries  not least my own  whichsuffer  not from open and violent conflict  but from theresidue of a crushing external debt and the debilitatingeffects of an ongoing structural adjustment programme.In spite of all this  my Government is committed toproviding for its people the basic necessities of health housing  education and an economic and a socialenvironment for both men and women to achieve theirfull potential. Some of the factors that inhibit advancestowards a new economic and social order are attributed tothe prevailing inequitable terms of trade and the persistentreduction in commodity earnings of exporters of primaryproducts.However  social and economic problems are now notconfined to developing countries. In this era of greaterinterdependence among nations and increasingglobalization  issues and problems of economic growthand development  poverty  population growth andenvironmental destruction have become global. It istherefore necessary to first of all address the root causesof these problems before any tangible and lastingsolutions are achieved.President Jagan’s proposals for a New GlobalHumanitarian Order have therefore taken into account theglobalization of these pressing issues. His proposalsdirectly relate to the work of the General Assembly on“An Agenda for Development”; the Rio de JaneiroConference of 1992; the Conference of Small IslandDeveloping States; the recently concluded WorldConference on Population and Development; theforthcoming World Summit on Social Development; andthe Fourth World Conference on Women. It is thereforemy Government’s fervent hope that this forty-ninthsession will result in positive measures being taken toaddress the economic  social and humanitarian problemsprevailing in the world today. We have shown thecapacity to resolve supposedly intractable problems. Imay refer here to the end of the iniquitous system ofapartheid  when we all felt a sense of pride andaccomplishment at the readmission of South Africa to theUnited Nations on 23 June 1994.I may also refer to the Middle East where we haveseen a marvellous example of what can be achievedthrough patient diplomacy and dialogue  by the recentsigning of a Peace Accord between Israel and Jordan.2The earlier signature of the Declaration of Principles together with the current self-rule in Gaza  point to thestatesmanship of the leaders of Israel  the Palestinian peopleand the other parties to a conflict which has dragged on forfar too long.We have seen the convening of a World Conferenceon Human Rights and the appointment of a HighCommissioner for Human Rights  events which point to theincreasing concern of the United Nations for the protectionof human rights and for the improvement of the economicand social conditions of mankind.In my own region  we see the possibility of therestoration of democracy in Haiti. The multinationaloperation now under way  of which Guyana is a part  offersthe hope that  notwithstanding its inherent difficulties  theillegal government will finally abandon power. Guyana ispledged to participate in the process leading to the promptreturn of peace and stability in Haiti. The internationalcommunity must now work together to assist in therebuilding of that country’s institutions  as well as itseconomy  as a safeguard to its future welfare.We are happy that the United States and Cuba wereable to meet here in New York and come to a positiveagreement on the migration issue. We hope that thematurity displayed in those negotiations will spill over to acorrelative issue  the economic embargo  and that Cuba willbe allowed to pursue its economic rehabilitation for thebenefit of its people.A peaceful resolution of the Cyprus problem  whichhas seemed to be elusive  continues to be our great desire.Guyana remains hopeful that the efforts of the Secretary-General and the goodwill of the parties involved will leadto a satisfactory solution.I am convinced that this Organisation can and willachieve greater success for a better world. I wouldtherefore urge serious consideration of the “New GlobalHumanitarian Order”  which is aimed at fusing variousaspects of past and future undertakings by this Assembly.This new order will effectively bridge the gap betweenrhetoric and implementation  and will succeed in dealingdirectly with the common problems which face us all.As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  I appeal to those present here today to reflect onthe spirit of solidarity which inspired the Charter of theUnited Nations. Let us therefore work together to enhancethe role of this august body. Let us also  through mutualrespect and tolerance  work to promote better relationsbetween all nations and peoples."
"72",2994,"HND",49,1994,"First of all  I am happy to express to you  Sir my personal congratulations on your unanimous election tothe responsible post of President of the General Assembly.We are all the more pleased because your human qualitiesand professional skills are certain to make a valuablecontribution to the success of this session of the GeneralAssembly and because you represent Côte d’Ivoire andAfrica  a brother continent of Latin America  whose hopesand aspirations we share. Our thanks go as well to yourdistinguished predecessor  the representative of Guyana Samuel Insanally  who so skilfully presided over theGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session.From this rostrum  the rostrum of world peace which has seen a succession of the most notablerepresentatives of all the nations  I address the peoples ofthe globe on behalf of 5.5 million Hondurans.Honduras has emerged from the remarkable cultureof the Mayas  who  in centuries past  invented the zeroand developed mathematics  cultivated architecture predicted eclipses  and produced an extraordinarilyaccurate calendar.The ruins of Copán bear eloquent and beautifultestimony to the greatness of a civilization that strove tokeep a written record of all that it did. Today  on the eveof the twenty-first century  we can barely decipher thewisdom contained in their petroglyphs. I am speaking then  on behalf of a people whose roots go deep downinto history  a people that after some centuries broughtforth such world-class Central Americanists andpan-Americanists as Francisco Morazán and José Ceciliodel Valle.Like the Maya  the people of Honduras are deeplypeace-loving  and their democratic calling has evolvedunblemished. In the midst of the Central American war Honduras remained at peace. None the less  it was notspared the harsh consequences of the great CentralAmerican crisis that devastated the region during the lasttwo decades and from whose aftermath we still suffer.Notwithstanding the many virtues of the Honduranpeople  we are still afflicted by economic  social  culturaland health problems that hamper development  obstruct thefull exercise of human rights and immerse many families indire poverty.Exactly eight months ago today  I took on theleadership of the destiny of Honduras through the freelyexpressed will of our people. We are preparing the countryfor the titanic struggle against corruption  the hard battleagainst poverty and the fight against illiteracy  forstabilization of the economy and for conservation of theenvironment.Peace and development require  above all  shelter sustenance  land and jobs for all. They require universaljustice  hope for everyone and promising prospects forevery woman  man  girl and boy.In the face of all the challenges of the present  wehave opted to implement a moral revolution capable ofstraightening out the administration of the State and oftransforming the country peacefully and democratically.The driving principles and values behind that moralrevolution are larger than my people and Honduras’sgeographical dimensions. The moral revolution  behindwhich I throw myself wholeheartedly  permeates our linkswith other States and the international legal community.The moral revolution means good government economic growth with equity  transparency in theadministration of the State and decency in the taking ofimportant decisions and in daily work; it is politicaldemocracy  national identity  lush forests and healthychildren; it is economics with a human face  the theory andpractice of integration with the fraternal countries ofCentral America  international solidarity and support for thepeaceful settlement of conflicts; it is  in short  a clear andresolute step towards mankind’s next millennium.On the global level we are witnessing the last rites ofthe cold war. We have seen the last of the after-effects ofthe Second World War  effects that lingered on into thisdecade. We are witnessing the globalization of markets andthe resurgence of ethnic groups crying out for their ownidentity. We are seeing the unilateral actions of someStates give way to multilateral operations framed by thelegislation of this great world gathering. We see thatcolonialism has come crashing down like  in the words ofour national anthem  a black-feathered bird  and thatcooperation among free  sovereign and independent nationsis growing day by day.We are participants in the historic transformation ofdemocracy from a national value into a universal one from something practised intermittently in certaincountries into a standard form of behaviour for States.All this heralds a new dawn for mankind. But allthese triumphs  however grand  are still not enough.The differences between North and South necessitatea far-reaching dialogue in order that mankind may not betorn asunder yet again. International cooperation forpeaceful development must take place soon and to agreater degree than that seen during times of war orconflict.Central America is emerging  still licking itswounds  from the savage blows of two decades of deepcrisis and bloodshed. A quarter of a million dead is thehuge and tragic price that Central Americans paid for thecold war. Billions of dollars were poured into destructionand military confrontation between brothers. Now unfortunately  only scant resources are being invested inbuilding new democracies and new economies.This is a challenge for Central Americans and theinternational community alike. Our region is replacingthe agenda of war with that of peace and sustainabledevelopment. Our region - and in this respect my countryis a trail-blazer - is bringing down the curtain on an eraof confrontation and bringing it back up on one of unityand solidarity. In the era just past we had a lot of help;but for the one that is opening up we can see very little.Although our own efforts are the engine of ourdevelopment  international cooperation can strengthen usand speed up our progress. For this reason we call theattention of the international community to the fact thatall those who contributed to our destruction have a moralobligation to cooperate in our reconstruction and to helpundo the reversals the region suffered because of the twodecades of crisis.My Government and people view with profoundoptimism the positive turn of events that has taken placein the conduct of Governments. Louis XIV consideredhimself the State: ""L’état  c’est moi."" Hegel envisagedthe State as God’s path towards the Earth  perfect reasonwhich never errs. That led to the doctrine of raisond’état as the motivating force behind the conduct ofGovernments. Now  in the post-cold-war period  a newmotivating force is emerging: humanitarian reason. Thischange is symbolized by our passage not only from one2century to the next  but  indeed  from one millennium to thenext. It is  in effect  a thousand-year leap: fromgovernmental policy based on the interests of the State tointernational relations inspired by humanitarian concerns.In this period of radical transition for mankind  thereare lights at the end of the tunnel: the collapse of variousbarriers  the weakening of racial segregation  the casting offof shackles that had kept different nationalities artificiallybound together  the worldwide spread of democracy  andthe emergence of détente as a feature of inter-Staterelations. These trends augur well for the building of anew world order based on peace  mutual support and broadtolerance. The growing realization that reason must prevailover force should prompt our national leaders to convertthose rays of hope into great beacons for the maintenanceof peace  security  democracy and  hence  sustainabledevelopment.My country and people regard the development of thenew international economic order with stoicism as theworld becomes divided into blocs based on economic andstrategic interests. The nation-State is suffering a crisis ofidentity and threats to its sovereignty. We are witnessingnew geopolitical formations in which power is beingtransnationalized and the struggle for hegemony is passinginto another dimension. The new structure of the worldeconomy is marked by the supranational nature of decision-making in the field of finance and international trade.If this emerging new international economic order isnot managed prudently  if we do not infuse it withhumanism and morality  we run the risk that in the shortterm the already-existing rift in the world between poornations and rich nations - what we used to call the Northand the South - will widen further. The following words ofa Honduran poet speak eloquently to this: ""The poor are somany that it is hard to forget them - so many that theycould be the pallbearers of a celestial body.""It is vital to have a more equitable new internationalorder. Now more than ever  justice in the South is aprerequisite for peace in the North. The industrializedStates need to demonstrate their readiness to respond to theeconomic proposals of the developing countries  whichrepresent two thirds of the Earth’s people.These thoughts should serve merely to stimulate ourimagination in the quest for solutions to prevent thedeterioration of our political  economic and social systems.In the process of globalization  under the banner ofdemocracy in the political field and the market economy inthe economic field  we have been making intense effortsat the regional and subregional levels to reduce politicaland economic differences among countries and regions onthe basis of the norms and institutions that should guideour collective life towards a basic model  one fashionedin accordance with the principles that underpin this worldOrganization.The United Nations must therefore pursue theanalysis and discussion of the major issues that call forthorough reflection in this process of political  economicand social globalization. Indeed  there has been a markedincrease in recourse to the United Nations as aninstrument to prevent  avert or halt international conflicts and in order to legitimize the right of intervention in thecase of conflict between a State and its population or aState and the international community - but always insearch of peace  freedom and democracy.The manifest resolve of the States Members of thisOrganization to work in concert towards this objective hasbeen remarkable and vigorous  but it should be borne inmind that good intentions are of little use unlesssupported by the political will to take the difficultdecisions required by situations such as this. Let theapologists of violence and those who are nostalgic forpower have no doubt that our political will to avertregional conflicts is unswerving  and that our politicalaction is designed to promote stability  legitimacy and thedevelopment of effective democracies.We share the concern and the distress at the eventsoccurring in the sister country of Haiti. There is apressing need to put an end to this grave situation  whichis an affront to human dignity and to the self-determination of peoples. My Government supports apeaceful settlement of the problem and is ready  within itslimitations  to take part in a United Nations peace-keepingmission once democracy is restored to that fraternalcountry.Just as we felt great satisfaction at the signing  lastyear  of the historic mutual recognition agreementbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO)  we are gratified by the decision ofthe State of Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan to sign theWashington Declaration of 25 July 1994. It reflects theaspirations of the two peoples and Governments and seeksto find formulas for mutual understanding that will put anend to their substantial differences.3My Government was particularly pleased to see ableak chapter of human history in South Africa end withthe coming to office of a new Government led by PresidentNelson Mandela. Today we look forward to seeing theaspirations to freedom  peace  democracy and developmentwhose fulfilment that great leader desires for his peoplebecome a reality.Similarly  though with a sadness that I cannot conceal I must say that events in Bosnia and Herzegovina and thetragedy of Rwanda cause us considerable distress andanguish. These fratricidal conflicts should impel us to acturgently to eliminate armed aggression  genocide and thepractice of ""ethnic cleansing"" once and for all. We cannotcontinue to waver in implementing Security Councilresolutions. Although this Organization has never playedas big a leadership role as it is playing now  it is also truethat compliance with its resolutions in the framework ofoperations to maintain international peace and security hasbeen put into question.My Government deeply regrets the resulting tragicevents that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives andcaused a massive exodus of refugees. We therefore urgeparties in conflict to act in a spirit of reconciliation  certainthat the international community will continue to extendhumanitarian assistance to them.In the case of Cuba  the Government of Hondurasagrees with the overall objective of restoring democracy tothat country  in the framework of the inter-Americansystem. However  we believe that the policy pursued bythe Government of the United States of America is notconsistent with the need to remedy the critical political economic and social conditions prevailing in that brotherlycountry  and we sincerely hope that dialogue between theparties will prevail in this dispute.The countries of the Central American region havecontinued to pursue policies based on resolutions adoptedat presidential Summits  with a view to creating a neweconomic  social and political structure for the benefit ofCentral Americans. In this regard  at the recent fifteenthmeeting of Central American Presidents  held in thebrotherly Republic of Costa Rica  new circumstancesprompted us to adopt an integral strategy for sustainabledevelopment in the region  a national and regional strategywhich we call the ""Alliance for Sustainable Development"".This is a Central American initiative in the political  moral economic  social and ecological fields  whose agenda willbe further enriched with the holding of the environmentalSummit in Managua  Nicaragua  on 12 and 13 October  andthe International Conference for Peace and Developmentin Central America  to be held on 24 and 25 October thisyear in Tegucigalpa  Honduras. The InternationalConference will be a good opportunity for theinternational community  as it did a decade ago in themidst of a tragic confrontation  to express its solidaritywith a region that has turned war into reconciliation conflict into human progress and totalitarianism intodemocracy. It would be terrible indeed if the world thatextended its hand to us in those difficult times were tofail now to help us enjoy the dividends of peace.We participated with similar enthusiasm andoptimism in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Headsof State and Government in Cartagena de Indias  Republicof Colombia. As everyone present knows  there wasbroad discussion there of aspects of trade and integrationas elements in Ibero-American development. Weattended that important meeting with the political resolveto tackle the problems that are besetting our countries andcausing dangerous economic and social imbalances  thusrequiring a search for concerted responses that will enableus to develop machinery to tackle the challenges of thefuture more effectively.In accordance with this commitment  myGovernment believes that  although dialogue has beenstrengthened  it is even more important to pursue thepolicies adopted at that forum. In this context  wereaffirm our fullest support for the joint initiatives  whichare based on the principles of representative democracy the defence and promotion of human rights  respect forsovereignty and the principles of non-intervention and theself-determination of peoples.On a different tack  I should like to inform thisworld forum that the degradation of the environment is amatter of constant concern to us. In this regard  myGovernment attaches the highest priority to the search fora solution to this problem. Mechanisms have beenestablished to implement the resolutions adopted at theEarth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  in June1992.We reaffirm our commitment to promoting abalanced and integrated approach to sustainabledevelopment  as set forth in the Rio Declaration onEnvironment and Development. It is important that theAssembly expand on that idea and build an awareness ofthe world’s environmental unity so that a new relationshipbetween mankind and nature can emerge  allowing us towork together for its conservation and survival.4Regarding this sensitive matter  our National Congressis currently seized with the Conventions on BiologicalDiversity and on Climate Change  with a view to translatingour words into deeds through their speedy debate andadoption.My Government wishes to raise one other issue today with a sense of full responsibility and an awareness of thegravity of the effects of the crisis faced by developingcountries and the risks involved for the stability of theworld economy. We must acknowledge the importance ofthe signing of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  as well as theagreement creating the World Trade Organization  with aview to strengthening the multilateral trade system. Wetrust that these instruments will help to ensure theliberalization and expansion of international trade for thebenefit of the developing countries.But if in pursuing this goal the industrialized nationsdo not act in accordance with the changes taking place ininternational economic relations  efforts within theframework of South-South cooperation will have to bestepped up. This is becoming not merely an alternative  buta fundamental challenge to our capacity to act in thesenegotiations  which can stem only from the coordinationand support that impart resolution  continuity andeffectiveness to the actions of the group of developingcountries.In the context of what the United Nations means to allof us  my Government has attached the greatest importanceto and has followed with great interest the process ofreform of the Charter of the United Nations  particularlywith respect to the Security Council.In the prevailing international circumstances and giventhe role the Security Council has been called upon to playin the maintenance of international peace and security  thereforms that the membership is calling for  in accordancewith the purposes and principles of the Organization  shouldbe studied thoroughly and adopted with meticulous care.Any reform in the membership of the Security Councilneeds to take into account the criteria established in therelevant Articles of the Charter. It is essential to respectthe principle of equitable geographical representation  whichwould permit us to increase the number of permanent andnon-permanent members democratically and to considerwhether or not it would be desirable to create a new category -that of semi-permanent member - as has been suggested inthe open-ended working group on the restructuring of theSecurity Council established by the Secretary-General.In this process of change  in addition to theprinciples that I have outlined we need to consider whatbasic indicators would enable us to set the number ofmembers at the right level. This is also true of the studyon the veto right  currently enjoyed by the five permanentmembers; my Government feels that this right should notbe granted to any category  whether permanent or semi-permanent. Thus  Honduras is not opposed to theestablishment of new categories provided this is done inaccordance with the principle of the sovereign equality ofStates and equitable geographical distribution.With faith in God  in truth and in justice  I shall nowreturn to my country to continue building the society wehave chosen and contributing to the attainment of the kindof world to which we all aspire. May everything work tothe good of mankind."
"73",3018,"HRV",49,1994,"It is myparticular privilege and pleasure to address the General4Assembly of the United Nations at the beginning of itsforty-ninth session.I believe we all agree that the appearance of anystatesman before the General Assembly is a great momentfor moral and political reconsideration of one’s ownreflections and responsibilities towards the internationalpublic. This applies equally to the representatives of theesteemed founder States and to us who represent youngdemocracies. This is an opportunity to present our viewson the problems affecting our countries  but also on allother issues of importance for the global Organization.This is also an opportunity to compare  with the utmostseriousness  the lofty ideals incorporated in the UnitedNations Charter with the difficulties and intricacies of dailyachieving political agreement for their realization.The noble fundamental principles of the UnitedNations governing the rights and obligations of individuals nations and States generally agree with the basic principlesunderlying all world religions and philosophies  as well asthe fundamental laws of individual States. Yet we are stillpainstakingly seeking a consensus on a new and justinternational order that would unite and harmonize the loftygoals of the United Nations Charter and the humanisticWeltänschauung with the visions of the new global orderand with the specific ideals and interests of individualStates. Unfortunately  many countries  such as my own Croatia  which labours under difficulties owing to thedisintegration of one regional international order and theestablishment of another new order  are paying the highesthuman  material and political price for the imperfection ofthe world in which we live.In addressing the General Assembly as Head of theCroatian State and the highest representative of the Croatianpeople  I can note with satisfaction that the internationalposition of Croatia has been strengthened and furthered inspite of all the problems affecting the actions of theinternational community. In only a few years since itsindependence and international recognition  Croatia hasbecome a fully fledged and equal international citizen having reinforced its position in the internationalcommunity and expanded its network of bilateral relationswith almost all States and international agencies.Moreover  Croatia has become a key factor in theestablishment of the new regional order in South-easternEurope and a recognized and important partner of thesuper-Powers and of the international community as awhole in the resolution of the intricate crisis  currently themost severe international crisis in this part of the world  inBosnia and Herzegovina.The adverse experience of the Croatian peoplethroughout their history  and particularly over the past fewyears of the renewal of Croatian statehood  has taught usthat no sublime principle recorded in the United NationsCharter and in international law is automaticallyattainable - even less is it guaranteed - if the peopleconcerned are not determined to attain it; if they are notprepared to offer to make a high degree of sacrifice in theachievement of their right to life and freedom; and if theydo not succeed  by virtue of their strength and decisions in bringing their national interests into line with theessential interests of the international community.Despite the inalienable right of the Croatian people -one of the oldest European peoples - to self--determination and to the renewal of their own State despite the blatant barbaric aggression aimed at territorialconquest  the genocidal expulsion of the population andthe destruction of the most precious cultural heritage ofthe Croatian people  such as Vukovar and Dubrovnik  theCroats would never have won the right toself-determination  to their State  to freedom andindependence  had they not been prepared to make humanand material sacrifices  had they not shown a firmnation-building will  with which they have resolutelyasserted themselves as a member of the internationalcommunity  while manifesting their readiness to be aconstructive force in the development of the newinternational order to replace the unviable and failed oldsystem.It is the duty of all of us - and especially of this  thehighest global authority - to take more determined andmore effective steps in the quest for means to break thisvicious circle of suffering by individuals and peopleswrought by war. As the highest representatives of ourStates and peoples  we are morally and politically obligedto create an international order  with appropriatemechanisms  capable of efficiently defending the rights ofeach nation or group  and especially of small and youngStates. What we need are such mechanisms of thehighest global Organization that can resolutely prevent orpunish any violation of the fundamental principles ofinternational law.Obviously  this also implies safeguarding theachievement of such rights and of generally acceptedprinciples in a democratic way  so that each and everyright does not have to be won the hardest way  with theblood of innocent lives  because such a way burdens thecollective memory with covert hatreds  bias and5vengefulness  stirring up new divisions and even moredestructive internal and regional crises.This applies to crises in the areas of the formerYugoslavia  just as it does to those in Rwanda  Somalia  theCaucasus  the Middle East  South Asia  Africa or America.It is precisely the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that hasshown the immense evil that can be done by petty politicalexploitation of historical myths about collective guilt orhistorical injustice  about a conspiracy of the whole worldagainst a single people  and by the emphasizing of themessianic role of a people to justify their conquest-mindedpolicy  causing a great deal of harm not only to thosethreatened by such imperialistic policies  but also to thepeople themselves  who fall victim to their own fallaciesand motives  which are unacceptable and detrimental to theinternational community.After the collapse of the bloc division of the worldand the disintegration of many multinational States  we arefaced with the task of building a new international order.All past experience suggests that the task is very difficult.To be successful  we need first and foremost a mechanismfor diplomatic and political negotiation  for buildingconfidence and for patiently overcoming real problemsstemming from objectively differing interests. In caseswhere political efforts are obviously futile  the UnitedNations must have a more efficient mechanism to achieveand even impose solutions serving the interests ofinternational peace and stability. However  for reasons ofrealpolitik and of the balance of interests and forces  inneither case should this contradict the fundamentalprinciples of this Organization. It should be borne in mindthat the mechanism for establishing and defending the newinternational order should not merely serve the coordinationof the interests of the super-Powers  but must reflect theirhighest responsibility in dealing with regional crises  whilebeing designed and structured to strengthen the security andprogress of small or jeopardized members of theinternational community  which account for the greater partof mankind. The United Nations must be qualified toguarantee  within the international order  equal conditionsin terms of freedom  progress and equality for all themembers of the international community.The collapse of communism and of the bipolardivision of the world has increased hopes for a world ofgreater justice and security for all. However  we must beaware of the fact that the collapse of the communist blocand of multinational States has inevitably producedtemporarily destabilizing effects in the international order.In this context  it should be noted that the proclamation ofsovereign national States has mainly created positiveconditions for the new international order  although insome cases  where nationalism has degenerated intochauvinist-extremist trends  or even into conquest-mindedaggression  the effect has been negative. However  theessential point of these historical vicissitudes is theawareness of the fact that the endeavour of small peoplesto attain statehood - meaning their political  cultural andeconomic identity and their personality within theinternational order - has made the greatest contribution tothe collapse of communist totalitarianism and to thedemocratization of many countries. The fulldemocratization of international relations is not possiblewithout such democratization of internal political systems.The security of new small States has become todaythe key to stability in every region and it should providethe groundwork for new collective security systems.Only their complete security and equality can make themequal factors of civilizational and functional integration inspecific areas and within the global order as a whole.The peoples of small countries will eagerly acceptcivilizational integration if it is not to the detriment of theindividual quality of their State  culture and economy.Only such safeguarding of national individuality withincivilizational integration can produce sound foundationsfor functional multilateralism in the new internationalorder. Otherwise  the myths and prejudices of the pastwill continue to provide grounds for new conflicts andeven clashes between civilizations. The disturbing scalewhich differences between civilizations can assume isclearly manifested in the former Yugoslavia  where localaggression threatens to expand even into a conflictinvolving three civilizational religious blocs unless thecrisis  the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina  is resolutelybrought to an end. Croatia has always supported apolitical solution by accepting the normalization ofrelations with all neighbours  even those of whoseaggression we were victims  in order not only to create on an equal footing  the prerequisites for a newinternational order but also to bring about a productiveblending of the different civilizations facing one anotherin this part of the world.In view of the current state of affairs worldwide  wesupport a thorough organizational reform of the UnitedNations in order to improve both its responsibility and itsefficiency in dealing with the pressing problems ofhumankind. Problems such as uneven development population growth  the ecological balance of the planet human and collective rights  functional global integration and particularly crisis points and military hot spots  call6for a more effective organization of the highestinternational agency. We need an Organization whichcould have a more efficient bearing on establishing equalstandards and obligations for all countries  and which wouldbe entitled  in crises or on key issues affecting thedevelopment of humankind and life on our planet  ""toencroach""  on behalf of the global community  uponinternal affairs of States. The international communityshould have  within the United Nations  multilateralmechanisms capable of dealing more efficiently withpressing crises  and developmental  environmental andtechnological challenges now facing humankind.In this context careful consideration is required of therole of the General Assembly. Its activity must be credible but it nevertheless cannot assume the role of a globalparliament to the detriment of the sovereignty of MemberStates. Experience suggests that a clearer division ofresponsibility among the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council is required.Regional conflicts have become the chief problem nowconfronting the international community - not only becauseof the threat posed to international peace but also becausethey can cause terrible human disasters such as those inRwanda  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia and Somalia.And  of course  they also block regional developmentalprocesses  and result in scarcely reparable ecologicaldamage and destruction of the natural and cultural heritageof entire areas.Such a state of affairs requires first a reform of theSecurity Council.The new global order can no longer be based only onthe coalition of the victors in the Second World War  or onthe nuclear club of the great Powers. It must reflect newdemocratic  economic and regional realities whichnecessarily lead to permanent Security Council membershipand enhanced regional responsibility for countries such asGermany or Japan  and also some regional representativesof the so-called third world. On the other hand  the reformof the Security Council ought to avoid solutions whichwould  because of the increased number of members  makedecision-making more difficult and the Council inefficient.The efficiency and credibility of the Security Councilshould be substantially strengthened in order to resolve themain problems related to international security  especiallyin conflicts causing military conflagration  first of all byreducing the gap between the content of the enactedresolutions and the possibility of their enforcement. AllStates of the world  and particularly the great Powers whichhave an enhanced responsibility within such a system should in good faith make adequate economic andmilitary instruments continuously available to the SecurityCouncil so that its decisions can be implemented. Thepeacemaking mediation of the global Organization mustevolve from a static freezing of the conflict and curbingits expansion  into a mechanism capable of preventing thedevelopment of the crisis in a timely manner and ofeliminating the consequences that are already present.In some cases the very decisions of the SecurityCouncil will suffice to stop and resolve the crisis  butsometimes a demonstration of firmness will be required.The international community must develop moresystematic mechanisms to punish those States that do notaccept or that violate Security Council decisions. Theenforcement of international political or economicisolation of the aggressor  with concurrent compensationfor neighbouring States which are indirect victims of suchisolation  should be made even more effective. Sanctionsare becoming an instrument used at an ever increasingrate when there is no political consensus  or will to resortto more energetic means  but they can produce the wantedeffect only if implemented consistently within the scopeof systematic pressure.The democratization of the international order entailsa greater focus on the protection of human rights including also punishment for violations of humanitarianlaw and the law of war. Croatia has endorsed theestablishment of the War Crimes Tribunal in the area ofthe former Yugoslavia. Croatia likewise supports theestablishment of a permanent international institutionwhich would deal with the most severe violations ofhumanitarian law  whether in Rwanda  Somalia  Bosniaand Herzegovina  Croatia or Haiti. However  theinternational community should also devise ways andmeans to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes from thoseaggressor countries which refuse to cooperate with theTribunal.Croatia proposes the provision of a permanent peace-keeping task force for the intervention requirements of theSecurity Council  involving special military units madeavailable  through agreement with a specific number ofcountries for Security Council requirements. We believethat this could forestall the flaring up of many regionalcrises  or contribute to their rapid prevention. Suchinternational forces should have a broader mandate interms of the use of force  not only for their ownprotection but also for the energetic implementation of all7Security Council resolutions - from humanitarianobjectives to disarmament and demilitarization. The peace-keeping force should be set up so that the nationalcontingents within it implement the decisions of theSecurity Council and not the specific policies of theircountries.The proliferation of regional crises confronts theUnited Nations with ever-increasing tasks which theSecurity Council cannot fulfil successfully with its limitedresources. This suggests the need for the Security Councilto assign the implementation of its decisions to regionalorganizations as well. This in turn requires the redefinitionand strengthening of the role of regional organizationswithin the collective security system. Each crisis pointshould be dealt with by appreciating all specific featuresand by realistically evaluating the possible scope of regionalsystems in the implementation of Security Councildecisions.The solutions at which we aim in the regional crisisaffecting the area of the former Yugoslavia  as well aselsewhere  must proceed from the fundamental tenets ofinternational law in order to arrive at a just and lastingsolution which  in order to be acceptable  also impliescompromise in terms of detail  but not in terms of theessential issues.Croatia is very encouraged by the increasinglysuccessful peace developments in the Middle East  whichdemonstrate the patience and wisdom of both the Israeliand the Arab sides. We firmly believe that similar positiveendeavours are also possible in South-Eastern Europe andthe Balkans if they win the necessary united support anddetermination of the great Powers.Croatia welcomes the peaceful transfer of power to themajority people in South Africa after decades of internaland regional instability. South Africa is the best proof thatthere is no alternative to the equality of all citizens of aState.We also welcome the involvement of the internationalcommunity in Rwanda  which  although it has not unfortunately  prevented a human disaster on a scalebeyond description  has at least stopped the spiral of deathand lawlessness. We continue to support the current effortsto stabilize Rwanda and to prevent the revival andexpansion of the conflict.The agreement of the international community tofinally stop the agony of Haiti and establish a democraticorder there is also encouraging. We similarly welcomethe successful processes of democratization andstabilization throughout Latin and Central America. Wehave been following attentively the development offunctional regional integration in North America  and thestronger integration trends in Europe  differencesnotwithstanding  as well as the rapprochement betweenthe two largest countries in the European and Asianregions: Russia and China. We also welcome theconstructive role of Japan in the Pacific area and the FarEast.Within the scope of such global developments  withthe major world Powers aiming not at reciprocaldestruction but at positive competition and cooperation Croatia  as a small country  sees its place  first of all  inWest European civilization and in its economic andsecurity system in order to have a guarantee for itsindependence  security and progress. Croatia sees itswelfare and stability in the achievement of fullmembership in European integrative organizations.Croatia is prepared to responsibly assume its share of theburden in the development of the new international orderand to constitute a strong link in the integration chain ofa new Europe.In the very short time since it gained independence Croatia has become a mature and responsible member ofthe international community. It is already a pillar offuture stability and cooperation in that part ofsouthwestern Europe which is linked to the traditionallyagitated Balkans. Croatia has in good faith acceptedinternational mediation and United Nations peace-keepingforces in its territory in order to stop the war and reach apolitical solution that will simultaneously safeguard itsterritorial integrity and the rights of national minoritieswithin its borders. Croatia has accepted thewell-intentioned advice given it concerning theconstitutional position of the Serbian ethnic community inline with the highest standards of internationalconventions on the rights of national minorities  and hasincorporated them into its constitutional law.Croatia has borne the heaviest brunt of the Bosniancrisis and of the human catastrophe wrought by war inthat country. Croatia has provided a home or provisionalaccommodation to hundreds of thousands of refugeesfrom Bosnia and Herzegovina. We sustained this efforteven during the Croatian-Muslim conflicts that occurredas a result of Serbian aggression  as the victims of thataggression sought space for their survival. We haveprompted proposals on a mutual agreement on a8federation between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosniaand Herzegovina  and their confederal alliance with Croatia which eventually resulted in the signing of the WashingtonAgreements. We have spared no effort to end the senselesswar and renew cooperation between the Muslims and theCroats  who  owing to the indecision of the internationalcommunity  have been brought to the point of a desperatefight for the remnants of Bosnian living space left after thebarbarous Serbian aggression.In circumstances affected by its intricate ethnic andhistorical heritage  Croatia has shown the highest degree ofcooperation in the search for a peaceful political solution tothe crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia  believing in spite of all of its negative experiences  in the finalvictory of the principles of international law and in thenecessity to normalize relations between the newly emergedStates.However  this readiness to cooperate and this patiencehave certain limits. Split into two parts by the occupationof one-fourth of its territory  threatened continuously byoutlaw terrorism  burdened by the social pressure posed bydisplaced persons and the war-exhausted economy  Croatiacannot endlessly agree to fruitless compromise  because thecontinuation of the crisis threatens the existence of the Stateand the lives of its citizens  and prevents the reconstructionof the economy destroyed by war. We believe that itwould also be in the interest of the international communityto give Croatia more determined and more consistentassistance so that it can successfully play its constructivepart in the solution of the crisis.Croatia already is  and wants to remain  a mainstay ofthe new international order and a bridge of cooperationbetween the newly emerged States on the basis of mutualrecognition. The indecision and aimless manoeuvring ofthe international community in circumstances distinguishedby the presence of militancy in certain circles of the partiesin conflict threaten to push Croatia into a new militaryconflict which could be even worse than the previous onein terms of scope  depth and consequences. Theinternational community should not leave Croatia withouta choice  in a position where it would be forced to resort onits own to all means necessary to defend its sovereignty territorial integrity and the right of its citizens - displacedpersons - to return to the occupied areas.We have always been aware that no crisis  particularlyone as intricate as this  can be solved without consensus bythe international community without a division ofresponsibility and an agreed approach of the great Powers.Accordingly  we are the first  as with previous peaceendeavours  to welcome the efforts of the Contact Groupto find an acceptable solution.Croatia is prepared to continue its high degree ofcooperation and partnership with the internationalcommunity if solutions for Bosnia and Herzegovina andfor the occupied Croatian areas are not sought at itsexpense. Both crises - the one in Croatia and the other inBosnia and Herzegovina - have the same source: Serbianaggression. Because of this  and in view of theincreasingly stronger cooperation between Croatia andBosnia and Herzegovina  a package solution should besought. Since the sanctions imposed by the internationalcommunity have forced Belgrade to accept the proposalto end the war and the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs who oppose it  Belgrade should also be made to desistfrom supporting the Croatian Serbs  who refuse to agreeto the reintegration of occupied Croatian areas andbrazenly oppose the implementation of all SecurityCouncil resolutions.In terms of its actual consequences  the 1991 armsembargo was aimed first and foremost at the victims ofSerbian aggression. It was accepted at a time when thosewho formulated global policy mistakenly deceivedthemselves into thinking that that policy could saveYugoslavia  failing to see that the post-Tito crisis haddeveloped because of the attempt to impose Serbianhegemony over all non-Serbian peoples in that artificialand Communist State formation. Our conditional restraintwith regard to the lifting of the embargo is motivated atpresent exclusively by an endeavour focused onachieving  after all  a peaceful solution over the next fewweeks or months. Croatia does not want to be drawn intoa new war against its will  but it will be forced to acceptit  in cooperation with the other victims of Serbianaggression  if the international community fails to achievea peaceful solution that would not only put an end to thewar in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also bring about thereintegration of occupied Croatian areas.Croatia welcomes Belgrade’s announced readiness toisolate the Bosnian Serbs  with their suicidal war option but expects Belgrade to do the same with regard to theinsurgent Serbs in Croatia. Croatia demands that thelifting of sanctions against Serbia (Yugoslavia) be linkedalso to the cessation of the occupation of Croatian areas that is  to their reintegration into Croatia’s constitutionaland legal system. Moreover  the lifting of sanctions canbe considered only after we have seen whether the9announced isolation is truly enforced and after this has beenverified by credible control mechanisms.In order to promote positive trends  we alsounderstand up to a point the partial symbolic suspension ofsanctions in order to encourage in Serbia those currentlyexpressing their commitment to peace. Nevertheless Croatia will continue to insist that the lifting of certainsanctions against Belgrade  particularly those related to itsbeing fully released from international economic and allother isolation  be linked to the solution of the problem ofthe occupied Croatian areas.Croatia has shown a great deal of patience in itsdialogue with insurgent Serbs  but now  after three years ofoccupation  it demands from the international community aredefinition of the UNPROFOR mandate that will providefor the implementation of Security Council resolutions 769(1992) and 871 (1993)  and force the Croatian Serbs toaccept gradual normalization and reintegration pursuant tothe adopted peace plan.We realize that both sides  after any conflict  have toinvest much time and effort into restoring and strengtheningmutual confidence. We are also quite aware that nolong-term stability and progress is possible in Croatiawithout guaranteed human and ethnic rights to the Serbianand other minority groups. We have indeed guaranteedsuch rights by a special constitutional law enacted threeyears ago  but we urge the international community tocreate conditions for the implementation of this law inaccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.We have also recently taken the decision to speed up theestablishment of the human rights tribunal  and are preparedto accept international supervision of compliance withhuman and ethnic rights. However  the leaders of theSerbian insurgents  and their patrons in Belgrade  shouldforget their idea of a Greater Serbia and accept thereintegration of occupied Croatian areas on suchfoundations  to their own benefit and to the benefit of theentire community. We are prepared to accept gradualreintegration through the opening of communications  thereturn of populations  the reconstruction of destroyed townsand villages  and provisions for social welfare and legalprotection. The democratic Government of Croatia isprepared - while urging the resolution of the fundamentalpolitical issue: the restoration of the sovereignty of theCroatian State over occupied areas - to genuinely complywith all guarantees related to the rights of the Serbianethnic community.In keeping with its peaceful policy  Croatia is alsoprepared to normalize relations between Belgrade andZagreb. To this end we shall accept any meeting leadingto the recognition of the Republic of Croatia by Belgrade within its internationally recognized borders  which wouldmake the message to the insurgent Serbs regarding thenecessity of gradual reintegration quite unambiguous.For this reason we have also raised the problemregarding the parts of the Republic of Croatia occupied bythe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the GeneralAssembly  because there is indisputable evidence as to thecomprehensive integration - in military  judicial  customsand monetary terms - of occupied Croatian areas into theeconomic and legal system of Serbia  or the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia. We would like to thank the vastmajority of States in the General Assembly that havealready given us their support in this matter. If Belgradeshould express its readiness to recognize the CroatianState in the meantime  and to genuinely supportreintegration and normalization  we would be pleased tospare the General Assembly the task of dealing with thisproblem any further.We would also like to thank the General Assemblyfor its support for the post-war rebuilding of Croatia  andwe expect members’ continued understanding in thismatter.In particular  we would like to emphasize that anynormalization of relations - diplomatic  political oreconomic - on equal footing between the Republic ofCroatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will notaffect partnership and cooperation between the Croats andthe Muslims in the realization of the WashingtonAgreements on the Croat-Muslim Federation in Bosniaand Herzegovina  and its confederation with Croatia.No peace in the Balkans is possible without theestablishment of a balance of forces  nor does the futureof any people lie in endless reciprocal military exhaustionor in blocking development throughout the region. Wetherefore genuinely endorse the normalization ofCroat-Serbian relations  but also the implementation ofthe Washington Agreements  which are in our view notonly a tactical manoeuvre by the victims of Serbianaggression but also a development creating thepreconditions for ensuring full equality to the Croats as anumerically smaller constituent people in Bosnia andHerzegovina. We see in this a pledge of future regionalstability and balance of forces. The confederal linkbetween the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and10the Republic of Croatia provides the foundations forsustaining the sound political and economic relationssuggested by history  the geographical link and geopoliticalrealities. By agreeing to a confederal relationship  Croatiais also prepared  with the assistance of primarily Westerncountries  to assume its share of the responsibility forcurbing the smoldering  extreme national and religioustrends on all sides  the spread of which could jeopardizestability not only in this part of South-Eastern Europe butalso in the greater area.Croatia also attaches importance to the strengtheningand realization of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovinaand its confederation with Croatia  the progress of whichdepends both on mutual relations and on the action takenby the international community in the coming months  forthis establishes a political and economic bridge with theIslamic world. Along these lines we have alreadyestablished close cooperation with Islamic countriesfostering identical aspirations  such as Turkey  Jordan andothers.Decisive weeks and months  in which we muststruggle for a peaceful resolution to the grave crisis in thearea of the former Yugoslavia  lie ahead of us. Not onlythe parties in conflict  but first and foremost the principalactors of the international community  bear a hugeresponsibility at this moment. This involves not only thedecision on the fate of the United Nations Protection Forcemandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also whether theContact Group will succeed in sustaining a unitedoperational basis for a solution or allow the situation tofounder into a new military nightmare. The efforts of theinternational community focused on building a newinternational order are now being put to the test  morestrikingly than anywhere else  on reversing theconsequences of the aggression against Bosnia andHerzegovina and Croatia. We can ultimately resolve thiscrisis if each of us assumes his share of the responsibility.Hatred must give way to happy children’s faces inreconstructed Croatian Vukovar  to the restored splendourof medieval Dubrovnik  to peaceful coexistence in long--suffering and destroyed Sarajevo and Mostar.In order to achieve this  we must overcome thedisastrous war and political crisis by joint efforts and by awell-devised vision of a new international order in this partof the world  in the interest of the entire global order andof the United Nations."
"74",3063,"HTI",49,1994," It gives me great pleasure to greet all of you here  on behalf of the Haitian people and  with a sense of joy  to address the most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Amara Essy  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cote d’Ivoire  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Mr. President  as I wish you every measure of success  I wish to make a point of assuring you of the fullest cooperation of the delegation of Haiti.To Ambassador Samuel Insanally  I address my compliments for having so masterfully guided the work of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.Our congratulations and appreciation also go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I thank him with all my heart for the ties of solidarity he has woven with the Haitian people.To all my dear friends throughout the international community  I address my heartfelt thanks for the support they have given the Haitian people throughout these last three years.Allow me to address a word of special appreciation to President Bill Clinton  to our special friends the United States  Canada  France  Venezuela  Argentina and to all the States  especially those of the Caribbean Community and common market (CARICOM)  that have contributed to the implementation of Security Council resolution 940 (1994) and of the Governors Island Agreement. How happy I am to salute all of you and to thank you lavalassly.In 11 days I shall be in Haiti - at last. Thanks to the heroic courage of the Haitian people and thanks to your solidarity  we will soon be back. Your eyes and our own will contemplate the opening of the flowers of democracy. In eleven days I shall invite you to celebrate this festival of reconciliation  of democracy and of peace at home  in Haiti.Even now  with the peaceful launching of the operation ""Uphold Democracy"" on 19 September last  a tropical smile has shed light upon the faces of those who espouse and love peace. Together  President Clinton and we have managed to open up a channel of hope after so much suffering.My hat is off to the Haitian people.Honor and respect to the 5 000 victims among us. Father Jean-Marie Vincent died so that Haiti could live.The resistance of the Haitian people has its roots in a historical past where the beacon of liberty has shone day and night. As he was being put on a ship for France  Toussaint Louverture declared quite rightly ""In overthrowing me  you have only cut down the trunk of the tree of liberty. Its roots will grow back  for they are many and deep.""On the threshold of the bicentennial of our independence  these roots nourish us with the sap of democracy. The Haitian people will never cease in its struggle to guarantee its inalienable and imprescriptible rights to life  liberty and happiness. We will never cease in the struggle to establish a socially just  economically free and politically independent Haitian nation.Thus  the first black republic of the world  today tom asunder by the coup d’etat of 30 September 1991  is marching resolutely and definitively towards the establishment of a democratic society.Through diplomacy We attain democracy.In the face of this grim tragedy that has meant three years of suffering  thorns of pain pierce our hearts. None the less  our people excels at coloring the landscape with hope.The brave live in hope and the cowardly in fear.Better late than never: ""By following the river you reach the sea""  said Plautus as long ago as the second century B.C. To this end  despite the democratic structures set up by Solon and Pittacus in the sixth century B.C.  it was necessary to wait for Ephialtes  Cleisthenes and Pericles to achieve the democratization of political life in Athens.Hope gives life.We have no fear of the Haiti of the year 2004.Despite the dreadful spectacle of the last three years  we march towards the year 2004 with optimism. The path that leads there necessarily passes through the historic crossroads where the elections of 16 December 1990 and our return to Haiti meet.Eleven days from now I shall be there  thanks to the determination of the Haitian people and to your solidarity. This is a history worthy of attention  and there is no history worthy of attention other than that of free peoples. The history of peoples subjugated to despotism is no more than a collection of anecdotes.Eleven days from now we shall be there. A brilliant light  that of reconciliation  will dazzle us. Between violence and vengeance  reconciliation steps in. Between impunity and iniquity  justice steps in. In other words  we the President of the Republic of Haiti clearly and firmly say.Yes to reconciliation!No to violence!No to vengeance!No to impunity!Yes to justice!We shall brew a coffee of reconciliation through the filter of justice so that no trace of violence  no vengeance will be found. With reconciliation  all hearts - rich and poor  civilian and soldier - must be embraced by enthusiasm. With reconciliation  our proud eyes must no longer be flooded with tears.You  parents and friends of our 5 000 victims you who endure this crushing yoke all of you  rich and poor  soldier and civilian:soon a stream of light will floodthe deepest wells of your heart.Surely it is the light of reconciliation.Otherwise  how can we dispel the gloom of subhuman abjectness? How can we pass from wretchedness to poverty in dignity?A study of the countries of the third world shows us that 20 per cent of the population in developing countries know hunger every day  25 per cent are deprived of the essential means of survival  33 per cent languish in abject poverty. The World Summit for Social Development  to be held in Copenhagen in 1995  must offer new possibilities for alleviating the distress of more than a billion human beings preyed upon by hunger  disease and utter helplessness.In Haiti in 1994 750 000 children attend school; more than 1 250 000 stay at home or work plots of land. Yet our Constitution stipulates that education is a right of all citizens. It is a duty the State cannot shirk. In these circumstances  10 years from now we will have to attend to 3 000 000 school-aged children  which will mean increasing the number of teachers from 35 000 to 100 000 and the number of schools from 8 000 to 20 000.On our return we shall undertake a literacy campaign making it possible to attain a significantly low rate of illiteracy: 5 to 10 per cent. Reconciliation among all is of course imperative. Everywhere and always  reconciliation and peace are intertwined.The dissolution of the Soviet bloc has favorfavored the opening of a new era after decades of bipolarization. Yet we have the responsibility of protecting peace within our own States. Between 1989 and 1992 there were 82 armed conflicts  only three of which were between States.In our country  institutionalized violence did not unleash a civil war but  rather  a genocide. Even today  despite the presence of the multinational force  acts of violence against our population continue. The disarming of paramilitary groups  notably FRAPH and its attaches  is indispensable if peace is to reign throughout our country.This operation is proceeding to the complete satisfaction of the Haitian people. Obviously  the restoration of democracy will bring reconciliation for all  peace to all of us and respect and justice to every single citizen.Lavalas brings a message of peace.The guns must fall silent if we are to have peace.The professionalization of a 1 500-strong army and the creation of a police force that is separate from the army fall within this peace process. Peace must be protected and guaranteed for the sake of the happiness of all Haitian men and women.Article 265 of our Constitution stipulates:	""TheArmed Forces of Haiti are apolitical"". Article 264 says: ""They are set up to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of the Republic"".Article 269-1 says:""The Police must ensure the maintenance of public order and the protection of the lives and the property of the citizenry"".It is time to create a stable environment that will make national reconciliation possible in our land. We shall no longer have an army of 7 000 absorbing 40 per cent of the national budget. Globally speaking  military expenditures have declined considerably over the last six years  at an average rate of 3.6 per cent per annum. Why  then  do we have one soldier for every 1 000 Haitians and 1.8 physicians for every 10 000 inhabitants  while the industrial countries average one physician for every 400 inhabitants?Once back home  we shall set in motion our program to correct the current health situation wherethere are 1 000 physicians for 7 million inhabitants  one nurse for every 2 200 inhabitants  and one hospital bed for every 1 300 inhabitants. Our goal is to care for 8 million Haitians with 2 000 physicians and 8 000 nurses and to increase the number of hospital beds to one for every 400 inhabitants by the year 2004. We will have to open a health center in every district; we shall then have 52. Each municipal area will have its own dispensary. The measures to be adopted will allow us to reduce the infant mortality rate from 135 to 40 per 1 000. The average life expectancy of our population will rise from 54 to 65 years.Reconciliation and reconstruction are intimately intertwined:We shall prepare the coffee of reconciliation in the filter of justice so that we shall no longer find any trace of violence or vengeance.Above and beyond our national boundaries  the tragedies of Rwanda  Burundi and Bosnia-Herzegovina have confronted us day after day. The suffering of one man is the suffering of mankind. Every person represents humanity. Since the end of the Second World War  over 23 million people have been killed in armed conflict. How can one remain indifferent when confronted by the tempests of violence that have scourged so many countries with which we enjoy fraternal ties  such as Liberia  Somalia  Georgia  the Sudan and Armenia  to cite just a few?Fortunately  certain conflicts have taken a turn towards peace in the course of the last two years. We hail with hope the peace between Israel and Palestine that has begun to emerge in the Middle East  and we likewise salute South Africa  where the first non-racial  free elections have been held.Neither racial barriers nor barriers of class must exist. On the threshold of the year 2004  the Haitian diaspora - our tenth Department  as it were - is our focus par excellence for celebration of the reconciliation between Haitians and Haiti.Bravo for our tenth Department. Haiti is the Haitians' greatest wealth. Haiti always will be our ""chez nous""  our home. Come back home. We can make our homeland as beautiful as a rainbow.At the present time 17.4 per cent - 740 kilometers - of our roads are paved; the remaining 2 960 kilometers are mud roads. Ten years hence  a network of some 2 500 kilometers of paved roads will link all of our major and secondary cities and towns. Some 3 000 kilometers of local roads will be laid down.In 1994  only 1.3 per cent of our forest cover remains. At this rate there will be no forests in Haiti by 1998. With the major reforestation drive that we are going to set up  over 6 million trees will be planted each year. By the year 2004  one-third of our territory will be reforested.It goes without saying that a climate of political stability will allow us to promote economic growth. In 1991  the economic policy and fiscal discipline adopted by the Lavalas government brought in $500 200 000 in customs revenue  domestic revenue and transfers from public enterprises. It was a historic performance for our country. By the year 2004  at a growth rate of 10 per cent per annum  the same revenue would bring in $1.26 billion.In monetary terms  the results were just as satisfactory: an increase in foreign exchange reserves of $20 million dollars; a decrease in the devaluation of our gourde  the national currency  from 58.8 to 47.6 per cent; inflation reduced from 20 to 12 per cent.But what remains of these achievements after three years of plunder? The debt ceiling has been raised twice. Inflation is estimated at 60 per cent. Our national currency  the gourde  has been devalued by 300 per cent relative to the dollar. Public finances are in bankruptcy and the public treasury has recorded a $100 million loss for the fiscal years 1992-1994.This is why there is an absolute need for this reconciliation between Haitians and Haiti  which is a sine qua non for creating a modem State by rebuilding the economy. We have to open up the economy to attract foreign investment and to provide goods at better prices to Haitian consumers. Synergistic relationships between the private sector and the State are indispensable. At the level of developing countries  foreign debt has multiplied fifteen-fold in two decades. From $100 billion in 1970  it rose to $650 billion in 1980 and to more than $1.5 trillion in 1992. This debt is an enormous brake on the development of third-world countries. In 1992 these countries had to shoulder debt servicing of $160 billion: more than twice the amount of official development assistance. However  one can see signs of a turn around. In Haiti  back home  payments arrears rose to $42 million in September 1993 and will surpass $81 million in December of this year. After I return  $13 million will be freed up as the government's contribution to the reduction of these arrears.Setting up a State based on the rule of law also implies reconciliation between Haitians and Haitians: citizens of a country where every man and every woman is a human being  equal before the law. The administration of real justice will free us from the vicious circle of violence and vengeance. Today  the people of Haiti have no access to a system of justice. For our 565 municipal areas  there are only 170 courts and 300 attorneys. However  the rule of law remains an indispensable tool for building the kind of world we aspire to by the year 2004. Between now and then  each and every one of our communal areas will have to get its own court. The number of attorneys will double to 600. A reformed judicial system  backed by an independent  national  civilian police force 10 000 strong  will restore confidence to our citizens. Thus  the restoration of democracy will bring about respect and justice for everyone.In the year 2004  after 10 years of sound democratic management  we shall have achieved a structured civil society where the bread of tolerance will be shared among political parties  the parliament  elected local officials  trade unions  socio-professional organizations  women on the farms  grassroots organizations  religious and ecclesiastical groups and communities - Protestants  Catholics and practitioners of voodoo alike - cooperatives  nongovernmental organizations  and so forth.On the threshold of the third millennium  the principle of ""One man  one vote"" can only accelerate the form and movement of democracy globally. From one-half to three- quarters of the world's population lives under relatively pluralistic and democratic systems of government. In 1993  elections were organized in 45 different countries  sometimes for the very first time.In Haiti in 2004  we shall already have held four municipal elections  six legislative elections and threepresidential ones. Public administration will already have been strengthened by the modernization of ministries and public institutions. Political life will be more active at the local level because most of the major decisions will be taken at the level of the 565 municipal areas and the 135 municipalities.Mr. President  distinguished diplomats and dear friends in the international community  thanks to your support and the determination of the Haitian people  we shall soon see that brighter tomorrow.Created to spare the world from the scourge of a new world war  the United Nations has  over the years  seen its role expand and its responsibilities take on ever increasing importance in a totally changed international setting. As we gather here for this forty-ninth session  on the eve of the commemoration of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary  I would voice the hope that the Organization may always respond effectively to the new challenges the world will proffer.To the people of Haiti  the children of Haiti  the source of our pride and our dignity  I say ""To save our beloved Haiti  let us all be united beneath that spreading palm  topped with the crown of freedom  the shadow of whose fronds protects those words inscribed in golden letters: ’Unity is strength.Our universe is expanding. The hundred billion galaxies of which it is composed are speeding farther and farther apart while we Haitians  men and women  are moving closer and closer together. Our slogan is: ""Reconciliation of one and all and justice for all.""In its elliptical orbit around the Sun the Earth moves at 30 kilometers a second. May the land of Haiti revolve around the sun of justice at like speed.We are all present at this rendezvous of reconciliation  setting forth together towards the year 2004  the bicentenary of our independence. I say:""Spread the word among you  without violence or vengeance. Let us triumph through gentle democracy. I count on you  and you can count on me. For now  farewell - soon we will meet again.""Alone  we are weak. Together  we are strong. United we are Lavalas."""
"75",3109,"HUN",49,1994,"Allow me to extend to Mr.Amara Essy my delegation’s warmest congratulationsupon his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session. He may rest assuredthat the Hungarian delegation stands ready to assist himin carrying out his responsible tasks. Sincere words ofrecognition should also go to Ambassador Insanally  theoutgoing President  for the outstanding andforward-looking manner in which he conducted the workof the previous session of the Assembly.As a representative of the newly elected coalitionGovernment of the Republic of Hungary  may I bepermitted first to assure this Assembly of nations that inits foreign policy Hungary will continue to serve thecause of international peace and stability  with specialregard to the Central European region. We are committedto further developing our political and economictransformation in order to consolidate democracy andstabilize the market economy in Hungary.Our foreign policy rests on three closely interrelatedmain pillars  which we treat on an equal footing. First we are determined to promote the full integration ofHungary into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. Secondly  weseek genuine good-neighbourly relations with all thecountries in our region  especially with countriesbordering ours. And  thirdly  we advocate respect forhuman rights  with particular emphasis on the minorityrights of the millions of Hungarians who live beyond ourborders. All in all  we intend to conduct our foreignpolicy in a most pragmatic and realistic manner and willact accordingly in our bilateral relations and inmultilateral forums as well.10On the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  and in the present post-cold-war era mankind is facing enormous challenges. The euphoria wefelt and the great expectations we entertained onlyyesterday  when a new and promising world seemed to beemerging  have now taken on a bitter quality.As the bipolar world was falling apart and freedomand democracy were sweeping across the globe we had torecognize some negative aspects of those fundamentalchanges  such as the outbreak of violent nationalism andethnic hatred fed by economic and social tensions. Theinternational community  and notably the United Nations has proved sometimes unable - and on a number ofoccasions its Member States unwilling - to meet thedramatic challenges of our times.New and violent manifestations of intolerance  whichcaught the world unprepared  aggressive wars and bloodyethnic conflicts accompanied by crimes against humanityand the abhorrent practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" are todayunanimously considered issues that ought to have beentackled in a timely and resolute way. It is with deep regretthat we note that the United Nations  together with otherrelevant international organizations  instead of preventingthe outbreak of crises in a number of areas of the world has  rather  been trying to react to them  either without thenecessary determination or by belated action. Indisputably the means available to the Organization for coming to gripswith the many international problems were stretched farbeyond existing capacities. We believe  however  that thetime has come to take a good hard look at the role theUnited Nations is called upon to play and to devise newways and means by which it can fulfil its raison d’être inour troubled contemporary world.We therefore reinforce our support for the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Peace and continue to regard it as aforward-oriented plan of action for the years to come. Inthis regard  we consider that special efforts should be madeto resolve the problems facing United Nationspeace-keeping operations  with a view to improving theirefficiency and capability.In the event we are unable to find adequate answers toour failures and missed opportunities  we may well be onthe verge of losing the precious benefits we have gainedand the potential prospects that opened up at the end of thecold war for the international community  including theUnited Nations  to create a qualitatively new  cooperativeworld order.As has often been stated  we live in a time of greatcontrasts that are also reflected at the United Nations.We welcome the momentous results and encouragingprogress in South Africa just outlined by His ExcellencyPresident Nelson Mandela  as well as those in the MiddleEast. The assumption of office by the first democraticallyelected President and Government of South Africa and itsnormalization of relations with its neighbours  the signingof the Declaration of Principles by Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of itsimplementation  the breakthrough in relations betweenJordan and Israel and the hopeful evolution of talksbetween Syria and Israel  are all truly historicachievements and bode well for the future.The forthcoming 1995 Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponswill be an event of cardinal importance which can furtherenhance the aforesaid positive tendencies. Hungary iskeenly interested in ensuring the indefinite andunconditional extension of the Treaty and is ready tocontribute to achieving this important goal. Recent eventshave once again reinforced our conviction with regard tothe critical significance of such an act.If the United Nations wants to live up to thepromising processes  it must  first of all  adjust itself tothe new realities. It would  therefore  do well to get ridof outdated  anachronistic resolutions which have nothingmore to do with present-day developments.It must  however  be admitted that attempts to tacklecrises in the former Yugoslavia  in Somalia  in Rwandaand elsewhere have not yielded conclusive evidence ofthe ability of the United Nations to find the right answersto major hotbeds of tension.Because of its geographical proximity  Hungary hasfollowed with particularly grave concern the devastationand suffering across its southern borders  first andforemost in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia. Wehave supported to the best of our abilities the efforts ofthe international community aimed at finding a justsolution to that human drama. The basis for the solutionof this unprecedented crisis in the heart of Europe exists.The principles of the United Nations Charter and thoseadopted by the International Conference on Yugoslaviaare there. They include respect for the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of countries  the inadmissibility ofacquisition of territory by force  the elimination of theconsequences of ""ethnic cleansing""  the return of refugeesand displaced persons and the protection of human rights 11including the rights of minorities. These principles shouldnever be ignored if we are to reach a just and lastingsettlement in Bosnia  Croatia and elsewhere.Hungary has a vital stake in the restoration of peaceand international legality in the former Yugoslavia. Thevolatile situation of the sizeable Hungarian ethniccommunity in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbiaand Montenegro)  the interruption of traditionally closeeconomic ties with our southern neighbours  the seriouslosses we have suffered as a consequence of the sanctionsregime imposed by the Security Council on the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia  all inspire us towards an activeinvolvement in the search for a durable and equitablesettlement in those tortured lands. In achieving that goalwe expect the international community to uphold theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and toenforce the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.We also expect that appropriate ways will be found in thecourse of post-conflict peace-building there to alleviate theburden of losses incurred as a result of the sanctions regimeby the countries most directly affected  such as Hungary.Hungary is following with keen interest theencouraging process of the revitalization of the UnitedNations. In this respect  I wish to reaffirm that we attachparticular importance to the question of the reform of theSecurity Council with a view to ensuring its transparency representative character and effective functioning  in orderto better reflect the realities of our contemporary world. Inthis context we fully concur with others in supportingpermanent membership in the Security Council forGermany and Japan.Hungary welcomes the ever-growing recognition thatin maintaining international peace and security regionalorganizations should be given a more decisive role. In ourview  the time has come to work out the necessaryarrangements whereby regional organizations can effectivelycontribute to conflict resolution  namely  preventivediplomacy  peace-keeping  peacemaking and post-conflictpeace-building. We endorse the proposition that byinvolving the regional organizations under the umbrella ofthe United Nations  and in particular of the SecurityCouncil  in the safeguarding or restoration of internationalpeace and security  our world can indeed be made a muchsafer place. We  for our part  are prepared to share inefforts at securing wider participatory action.This autumn Hungary is honoured to act as host inBudapest of the next Review Conference and summitmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE). We expect the Conference and thesummit meeting not only to contribute to the betterfunctioning of this important regional arrangement butalso to serve as a useful vehicle in the efforts towards ademocratic and integrated Europe where rationalism mayprevail over nationalism. Furthermore  we are convincedthat success within the CSCE is not only beneficial to thepeoples living in the CSCE region but that it can alsounderpin efforts at conflict prevention and crisisresolution in other parts of the world. In this context webelieve that the realization of the Dutch-German proposalto establish a genuine and practical division ofresponsibilities between the CSCE and the United Nationsin the settlement of conflicts within the CSCE region while upholding the principles and provisions embodiedin the relevant chapters of the United Nations Charter could well be a major step forward.Following the Budapest Summit  when Hungary isto take over for a year the duties of thechairmanship-in-office of the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE)  I personally intend to payparticular attention to the consolidation of mutuallyadvantageous cooperation between the CSCE and theUnited Nations which is so promisingly unfolding.Promotion and protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms are a high priority of Hungary’sforeign policy. In this connection  I would like to recallthat in the Vienna Declaration of the World Conferenceon Human Rights it was solemnly stated that thepromotion and protection of all human rights is alegitimate concern of the international community.Consequently  we find it indispensable that  in this spirit the United Nations should act in the defence of humanrights  irrespective of where violations of those rightsoccur.In our world of interdependence and growinginteraction  Hungary calls for the development by theUnited Nations of an integrated response-capacity tocombat the repeated waves of human rights violations.We view with serious concern the alarming increases inthe reported cases of gross violations of human rights  aswell as the frequent occurrence of such violations insituations of internal armed conflicts or ethnic strife.These developments have serious repercussions affectingpeace  security and stability in the given region andbeyond. In this regard  we should be mindful of therequirements laid down in the Vienna Declaration for allGovernments to promote and protect human rights in theirown countries  regardless of their political  economic and12cultural structures. On the one hand  an open and activedialogue  simultaneously constructive and critical  needs tobe established and sustained in order to promote theprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Onthe other hand  a stronger commitment to economic andsocial development in various areas of the world wouldconsiderably facilitate the observance of these universalvalues.By the same token  we believe that the United Nationshas not yet exhausted the means available for theinternational protection of human rights. We urge theinternational community to seek new and innovative meansand methods to safeguard the rights and freedoms of ourfellow human beings  wherever they may live. We wish tosee the United Nations embark in a timely manner - withinthe framework of preventive diplomacy - upon the road ofinternational protection of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms. Rather than responding only to reported humanrights violations  the United Nations should build effectivepreventive mechanisms into its activities whenever the needarises. The notion of preventive protection should alsoinclude adequate international monitoring.Following decisions of the competent organs of theUnited Nations  such as the Security Council or theCommission on Human Rights  civilian human rightsmonitors could be deployed if in any part of the world thehuman rights situation so warranted. Hungary  for its part is prepared to participate with monitors in joint actions ofthe international community in this field.In these endeavours  we also count on the effectiveparticipation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.The High Commissioner has had our full support ever sincehe assumed his office  and we pledge our cooperation in thecarrying out of all aspects of his mandate. We would liketo reiterate that adequate financing of the human rightsactivities of the United Nations should be ensured throughthe regular budget.I cannot conclude without mentioning the issue ofsustainable development  with its many aspects coveringindustrial and agricultural development  trade  humanresources  regional cooperation  protection of theenvironment  and so forth. Clearly  what is at stake here isour ability to tackle these global issues without delay. Thegrowing sensitivity with regard to these questions cannotbut be welcome. We consider the work of the UnitedNations Conference on Population and Development  heldrecently in Cairo  to be an important step in that directionat a time when contrasts between requirements of humandevelopment and limited resources are becoming moreand more evident.In conclusion  I would like to reaffirm that Hungarycontinues to be a strong supporter of multilateralism.Nations are looking to this Organization for protectionand assistance. We must not let them down in thesecritical times. In spite of failures  we should keep faithwith the United Nations and meet the challenges which in the final analysis  will determine mankind’s destiny inthe new millennium."
"76",3156,"IDN",49,1994,"It gives me great pleasure toextend to you  also on behalf of the Indonesian delegation our congratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We aregratified that the stewardship of this session is entrusted toa seasoned diplomat and statesman  representing a fraternalAfrican country with which Indonesia has traditionallyenjoyed close relations of friendship and cooperation.May I also express our deep appreciation to yourdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency AmbassadorInsanally of Guyana  for so capably guiding our workduring a most eventful year.I join other members in paying tribute to theSecretary-General for his determined efforts to resolvevarious conflict situations across the globe and hisendeavours to make the United Nations a more efficientand effective instrument of global governance in thesechallenging times.We meet at a time of pervasive change and transition a time in which global problems appear less susceptible toeasy solutions  earlier concepts and approaches less relevantand existing institutions less effective. It is also a time ofcontradictions and paradoxes in which resurgent hopes arenurtured amidst deepening anxieties and bright newopportunities are overcast by unprecedented challenges ina world that is coalescing and fragmenting at the sametime.The euphoria which permeated the internationalcommunity at the end of the cold war has dissipated and isbeing replaced by a growing sense of uncertainty  disquietand disillusionment. With the sobering experience of theGulf war and the horrendous incidence of ""ethniccleansing"" and violence in the former Yugoslavia  Somaliaand Rwanda  there is far less certainty now on how best torespond to the demands and vicissitudes of a world ofdeepening interdependence among countries and theglobalization of ever more intricate and inter-linkedproblems of peace  security and development. Our greatestchallenge  therefore  is how collectively to fashion a moreeffective system of global governance to manage themassive changes that are transforming the shape andsubstance of international relations in the decades ahead.If the pursuit of this basic objective is to succeed there can be no doubt that it should be based on therecognition of the United Nations as its centre-piece andprincipal mechanism. The United Nations is the onlyuniversal institution we have today  and any system ofglobal governance  to be viable and to achieve commonacceptance by the world community as a whole  must befirmly rooted in the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations Charter and organized on the precepts ofsovereign equality  common interest and benefit  equitablyshared responsibility and joint commitment to globalcooperation.It is therefore vitally important that the effectivenessand dynamism of our Organization be ensured andmaintained. Since the United Nations was foundedalmost five decades ago  the world has changed almostbeyond recognition  and international problems havebecome immensely more complex. The United Nationstoday bears a heavier load of responsibilities than it hasever borne. Ironically  at this time it is also saddled witha deepening financial crisis. This paradoxical situation in which the United Nations is expected to deal with amultitude of problems while woefully strapped for funds cannot continue without adverse consequences for theworld community.Just as important is the need to ensure that theUnited Nations system remains faithful to the democraticprinciples on which it was founded and attuned to therealities of the times. We therefore believe that theprocess of reforming the United Nations system should gobeyond merely improving its procedures and practices andshould  inter alia  take into account such essential aspectsas the representation of Member States at all levels of thesystem and their effective participation in decision-makingprocesses. The General Assembly should play a centralrole in shaping that process at the same time as its workis being continually rationalized.On the question of an increase in the membership ofthe Security Council  my delegation has clearly defined itsposition on various occasions in the past. The last reviewof the Council’s composition was undertaken nearly threedecades ago. Since then there has been a tremendousincrease in the number of United Nations Members  thusrendering the enlargement of the Council a matter ofurgency. Such an increase should take into account theprinciple of equitable geographic representation andaccommodate the interests and concerns of the developingcountries  which comprise the overwhelming majority inthe Organization. Furthermore  my delegation supportsthe proposal to increase the number of permanentmembers of the Security Council. In this respect  it isour view that  while the principle of geographicrepresentation is important  it should not be the onlycriterion to determine eligibility for new permanent19members. We believe that other objective criteria areequally important: political  economic and demographicrealities; a country’s capability and record of contributingto the promotion of peace  security and economicdevelopment  both regionally and globally; and thecommitment of States to assume the responsibilitiesinherent in such a status. In these endeavours our goalsmust remain the promotion of transparency  legitimacy accountability and efficiency.In the economic and social fields  as well as indevelopment cooperation  it has been said that the UnitedNations system operates without sufficient coordination andcoherence. However  in addressing this concern  we do notsee the particular merit of a proposal for the establishmentof an economic security council at this time. Rather  theEconomic and Social Council should be furtherstrengthened and should be allowed to assert its full role asenvisioned in the United Nations Charter. In this regard  Ithink it would be productive to invite the Ministersresponsible for finance and development planning  or otherrelevant Ministers  to participate in the deliberations onimportant development issues at the Economic and SocialCouncil’s high-level segment meetings. The UnitedNations should also continue to strengthen its coordinationwith the Bretton Woods institutions so as to achieveincreased policy coherence and to enhance developmentcooperation.Although the demise of the cold war has reduced thethreat of nuclear war  it has not eliminated the danger posedby nuclear weapons. Nuclear disarmament remains animperative. It is hoped that with further success in thecritical area of limiting and reducing armaments  thequantitative growth of nuclear weapons will soon becurbed. Recent encouraging developments include asignificant reduction of the world’s two largest nucleararsenals as a result of the successful conclusion of theTreaty on the Reduction and Limitation of StrategicOffensive Arms (START II) and of the fact that amoratorium on nuclear tests continues to be observed bymost of the nuclear-weapon States.In this context  the importance of a comprehensivetest-ban treaty as a major step towards nuclear disarmamentand as an urgent measure to protect the environment cannotbe overemphasized. For this reason  the Conference onDisarmament has been given a clear and explicit mandateto negotiate a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing.Unfortunately  lack of political will on the part of somenuclear-weapon States has created obstacles to progress inthis vital work. It is essential that serious and concertedefforts be undertaken in the Conference on Disarmamentin conjunction with the broader multilateral endeavours inthe Amendment Conference on the partial test-ban Treatyto ensure the conclusion of a universal and effectivelyverifiable treaty within a fixed time-frame. Such a treaty we believe  would serve as a truly credible instrument ofa nuclear non-proliferation regime.The convening of the 1995 review and extensionConference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)provides a unique opportunity to make a sober assessmentof its implementation. It is beyond doubt that thequestion of the extension of the NPT is linked to suchcritical issues as nuclear disarmament  the disseminationof nuclear know-how for peaceful purposes  securityassurances to non-nuclear States and the establishment ofnuclear-weapon-free zones. Hence  the issues we facenext year should not be oversimplified to a mere choicebetween limited and unlimited duration or betweenconditional and unconditional extension of the NPT. Thelongevity of the Treaty will ultimately depend upon theresolution of these multifarious issues and the sincerity ofthe nuclear-weapon States in fulfilling their obligations.Regional and subregional organizations continue tomake substantial contributions to the cause ofdisarmament and peace. In the Asia-Pacific region  theRegional Forum of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) was launched last July in Bangkok reflecting the desire of the countries of the region toensure a peaceful and stable political and securityenvironment for their peoples. This forum is uniquebecause it was not established in response to a crisis but rather  as an exercise in preventive diplomacy to managestrategic change in such a way that a stable relationshipamong the major Powers as well as among the regionalPowers will evolve gradually and peacefully over the nextdecade. At the same time ASEAN is intensifying itsefforts to realize its blueprint for a zone of peace freedom and neutrality with a South-East Asian nuclearweapon-free zone as its component part. Its realizationwould be a major step towards stable peace in the regionand a significant regional contribution to globaldisarmament and non-proliferation.Although the Asia-Pacific region now enjoys relativepeace  it is by no means free of tension and the anxietyof potential conflict. Among the actual and potentialproblems that the region must face is the persistence ofinter-State disputes  especially territorial disputes andoverlapping claims of sovereignty which could intensifyif their potential for conflict were not effectively20managed. That was why in its Manila Declaration of 1992 ASEAN stressed that its Treaty of Amity and Cooperationshould serve as a basis for the establishment of a code ofinternational conduct in the area and thus called for thepeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use of force.The positive response of the major Powers and of thecountries of the region towards the Treaty serving as sucha code of conduct at the first meeting of the ASEANRegional Forum makes it even more necessary to promotecooperative efforts among countries that have overlappingclaims of sovereignty in the South China Sea in order toensure the peaceful development of the area.As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula the agreement reached last August between theGovernments of the United States and the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea was a major step towards aresolution of this problem. We continue to believe that thiscomplex issue can be resolved only through the exercise ofmutual restraint and through sincere and sustained dialogueand negotiations.In the Middle East  the pursuit of peace continues togather momentum and promises to herald a new era. Thehistoric Declaration of Principles signed between thePalestine Liberation Organization and the Government ofIsrael over a year ago has been followed by the Accordsigned in Cairo last March  which laid down the modalitiesfor transition to Palestinian self-government in the GazaStrip and Jericho and thus paved the way for the triumphantreturn of President Yasser Arafat to these areas. Yetanother breakthrough is the signing of the WashingtonDeclaration between Jordan and Israel which ended thestate of war between them and opens the way for theconclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.While my delegation welcomes these positivedevelopments  we are also acutely conscious of theformidable challenges that still lie ahead. Palestinianautonomy should now be widened to include the economic social and cultural aspects of national life  and Palestinianself-rule should now be extended throughout occupiedPalestinian territories. Furthermore  the internationalcommunity should expedite its promised assistance to thePalestinian Authority in rebuilding the necessaryinfrastructures. It is also self-evident that progress on theother tracks of Arab-Israeli negotiations is a sine qua nonfor a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East questionon the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)338 (1973) and 425 (1978). The ultimate guarantee forpeace is Israel’s withdrawal from all occupied territories including the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  the atrocities  senselesskillings of civilians and ""ethnic cleansing"" perpetrated bythe Bosnian Serbs have continued unabated. The pleas ofthe Bosnian Government for effective internationalintervention or at least the lifting of the ill-conceivedarms embargo have gone unheeded. The savagery of theconflict has few historical precedents and the ambivalenceof the international community has contributed to itsperpetuation and the ever-present threat of a spill-over.By rejecting the latest peace plan proposed by the ContactGroup  the Bosnian Serbs have dealt a serious set-back tointernational efforts to end the conflict.The carnage cannot just go on. It is incumbent uponthe Security Council to unequivocally pronounce itself onthe non-applicability of resolution 713 (1991) concerningthe imposition of an arms embargo on Bosnia andHerzegovina. Furthermore  in the face of the continuedintransigence of the Bosnian Serbs  the Security Councilmust take strong and determined measures in order toensure the realization of the peace plan. Concurrently the international community should consider devising amechanism for negotiations  including the convening ofan appropriately structured international conference  todeal with the wider aspects of the conflict in and aroundthe former Yugoslavia  leading ultimately to acomprehensive solution that would enable the people inthat region to live securely in peace  free from aggression domination and external interference.Earlier this year  the people of South Africa finallyput an end to apartheid by holding the first-evernon-racial elections and by subsequently installing thefirst  democratically elected government under PresidentNelson Mandela. We have all joyously welcomed thishistoric event as well as South Africa’s resumption of itsrightful place in the community of nations. Indonesialooks forward to developing close and mutually beneficialcooperation with the new Government and the people ofSouth Africa.Elsewhere in Africa  however  we were deeplyanguished to witness in Rwanda the rampage of violencewhich has triggered an exodus of refugees toneighbouring countries and has brought about ahumanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions. With theend of fighting and bloodshed and the establishment ofthe new government in Kigali  we hope that the partiesconcerned will resume the process of national21reconciliation based on the Arusha Agreement  whichindeed provides an appropriate framework for the purpose.The situation in Somalia continues to be marked byrecurrent outbreaks of violence and a deterioration of thesecurity situation. We remain convinced that a solution tothe civil strife in that country can only be achieved throughsustained dialogue among all the parties  under the auspicesof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU). In this context  we hope for the earlyconvening of the national reconciliation conference inaccordance with the Declaration of last March by theleaders of Somalia.The entry into force of the United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea next month represents theculmination of efforts begun over two decades ago to createa new order for the oceans. The Convention  whichIndonesia ratified in 1985  will make a significantcontribution in promoting the peaceful uses of the seas andin ensuring their equitable utilization.I do agree with the report of the Secretary-Generalentitled ""An Agenda for Development"" (A/48/935) when itcites the economy as being the engine of progress and ofdevelopment as a whole. If I may carry the metaphor alittle further  it may be appropriate to say that at present theworld economy is a flawed engine that has stalled but isbeginning to warm up again. It is flawed by theimbalances and inequities that have distorted one of itsmost important parts  the relationship between thedeveloped and the developing economies. It has brokendown in a long and devastating recession  but in recenttimes it has shown signs of recovery.However  the aggregate statistics of world economicgrowth often conceal as much as they reveal. As aptly putby the 1994 World Economic and Social Survey  the worldeconomy remains a complex mosaic of sharp contrasts  inwhich most developing countries are often too weak andtoo vulnerable to be able to compete successfully in theworld market  thus risking their further marginalization anddecline into extreme poverty. Hence  apart from the needto sustain non-inflationary  global economic growth  theurgent imperative continues to be the eradication of povertyand the acceleration of the socio-economic development ofthe developing countries on a sustained and sustainablebasis.If the engine for global progress and development isto carry mankind to a brighter future in the next century then its parts must be brought into a more balanced synergistic relationship and its functioning be made moreeffective and efficient. We have no alternative but toforge a new partnership for development involving allnations  developed and developing. It is therefore crucialthat we bring to full realization General Assemblyresolution 48/165 on the ""Renewal of the dialogue onstrengthening international economic cooperation fordevelopment through partnership"". By adopting thisresolution  the international community has acknowledgedthe indispensability of the principles of genuineinterdependence  of mutual interest and benefit  and ofequitably shared responsibility  in a new spirit of globalpartnership.As a necessary corollary to this North-Southpartnership  South-South cooperation has become evenmore compelling  for the developing countries are calledupon to shoulder an increasing share of the responsibilityfor world growth and development. We look forward tothe report of the Secretary-General on this issue and alsoto the deliberations leading to the adoption of ""AnAgenda for Development"".As many advocated during the World Hearings onDevelopment in June this year  as well as at the High-Level Segment Meeting of the Economic and SocialCouncil  the Agenda should be action-oriented and shouldpresent an overall policy and priority framework for abalanced and comprehensive approach to development.It should reflect universal recognition and acceptance ofthe United Nations as the only Organization capable ofdealing with issues of development as well as with issuesof peace and security. It will also be necessary for theagencies  bodies and programmes of the United Nationsto be organized in such a way as to enable them toimplement the Agenda in an effective  efficient andcoordinated manner  without necessarily creating a newbody for this purpose. Obviously  there will be the needto generate the required political will in support of theAgenda. We look forward to seeing ""An Agenda forDevelopment"" serve as a fitting complement to ""AnAgenda for Peace"".One of the most important recent developments inthe international economic sphere is the completion of theUruguay Round with the signing of its Final Act inMarrakesh and the agreement to establish the WorldTrade Organization (WTO). Indonesia and the otherdeveloping countries have accepted the Uruguay Roundpackage  in spite of the heavy obligations and challengesthat it entails  because they anticipate that considerableopportunities for increased market access and indeed for22world economic growth and prosperity will now beforthcoming. They also expect that the Uruguay Roundpackage will provide the long-sought assurance of arule-based and non-discriminatory multilateral tradingsystem  free from the arbitrariness of unilateral action. Yet we must confess to being concerned at the possibility of atardy and long-drawn-out process of implementing the FinalAct. Such an eventuality will negate much of its originalintent and rob it of its positive impact  as was  regrettably the experience with the Tokyo Round. Furthermore  theattempts to overload the WTO work programme with socialclauses in our view represent protectionism in a thin guiseand tend to nullify the few remaining comparativeadvantages of developing countries. For this reason we feelstrongly that the process of ratification and implementationof the Uruguay Round agreements should not be linked tonew issues that have little or no relevance to thedevelopment of a new international trading regime. Allnations are called upon to marshal their political will and toaccept inevitable shifts in comparative advantage withouttransferring the burden of adjustment to weaker economies.Had relationships between developed and developingcountries been more equitable  we would not today be facedwith the problem of developing countries staggering undertheir external debt burden. While aggregate debt indicatorshave undoubtedly improved  mainly in response to variousdebt-relief measures  the external debt crisis still persistsespecially in the least developed countries where debt ratioshave significantly worsened and continue to hamper theprospects for economic growth and development. Adurable solution to the perennial debt question can only besecured through a development-oriented strategy formulatedwithin the framework of shared responsibility and genuinepartnership. Thus  rather than taking a one-sided view ofthe causes of external debt  there is an urgent need for allsides involved to adopt a coordinated approach.As Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement Indonesia has given the highest priority to resolving thiscrisis. President Soeharto took the initiative of conveyinga memorandum on the debt of developing countries to theChairman of the Group of Seven on the eve of their TokyoSummit last year  inviting the G-7 to engage in dialogue onthis issue. We are encouraged that the G-7 respondedpositively to the Non-Aligned Movement on this issue inTokyo and then again last July in Naples  where  inter alia it urged the Paris Club to pursue its efforts to improve thedebt treatment of the poorest and most indebted countriesand  where appropriate  to reduce the stock of debt as wellas to increase concessionality for those countries facingspecial difficulties. Moreover  Indonesia has also recentlyhosted a ministerial meeting of non-aligned countries ondebt and development  involving the most heavilyindebted least developed countries. The meeting calledupon the international community  particularly donors andinternational financial institutions  inter alia  to adopt acommon set of principles for future debt negotiations which include a once-and-for-all arrangement for settlingall outstanding debts  and the application of debtreduction to all categories of debt  including multilateraldebts. A report of the meeting has been submitted to theSecretary-General for possible consideration at thissession of the General Assembly.As a firm believer in the rights of peoples todevelopment  including social development  Indonesia isdeeply committed to participating actively in the WorldSummit for Social Development. The World Conferenceon Women in 1995 equally deserves total support fromthe international community. Indonesia is committed tothe adoption of a conference declaration calling for defacto as well as de jure equality between men andwomen  the integration of gender concerns intosustainable development  and a programme of action toachieve those goals.As we prepare ourselves to commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization next year  I sense thatdespite the frustration of our hopes after the end of thecold war  we are about to open a window on a future thattruly does not belong to the nations of the North or theSouth  the West or the East  but to undivided humanity.Perhaps the advent of wisdom is always a gradualprocess. First we came to the realization that the humanrace could not survive in a state of cold war against itself;that our problems are global and systemic in nature  andthus that truly effective solutions to these problems shouldbe integral and so comprehensive they must be carried outby a global partnership.Without that partnership  we should now realize  ourbright hopes are unattainable. As we work to complete""An Agenda for Development"" so as to match it with ""AnAgenda for Peace""  we are actually etching the finedetails of our common vision of a better and more unifiedworld. It is said that the future belongs to those whohave a clear vision of it. That may be so  but only if weare faithful to that vision  persevere in its pursuit  andthereby prove ourselves worthy of it."
"77",3203,"IND",49,1994,"I congratulate Mr.Amara Essy on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at the forty-ninth session. We are particularlygratified that an eminent son of Africa is leading theAssembly’s deliberations this year.We offer our thanks to his predecessor  AmbassadorInsanally  who presided over a year of considerableactivity in the General Assembly with great aplomb andfinesse. The Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  will be completing three years in office.We wish him well as he continues to lead the UnitedNations.We have already welcomed the new South Africa tothe United Nations. South Africa today is a reminder ofthe triumph of the principle of equality of man - atriumph in which the United Nations played a major role.The world community must commit itself to ensuring thatthis principle is implemented for all time to come. Allefforts should be made for the development of SouthAfrica.Forty-nine years ago a world tired of war declaredthat at this foundry of the United Nations it would beat itsswords into ploughshares. Instead  we have onlyproduced words  while the swords have not disappeared.The words may be important  but unfortunately they haveremained mere words. We seem to be stepping into anew world order in a gaping moral void  with no crediblepromise of peace nor of a nonviolent world. And we areapproaching 1995: the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations; the fortieth anniversary of Panchsheel - the FivePrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence; the Year of Tolerance which is being celebrated by the United Nations; and theone hundred and twenty-fifth birthday of the apostle of13peace and moral force  Mahatma Gandhi  whose messageonly gains in relevance year after year.Global security today demands a holistic approachinvolving the promotion of economic and socialdevelopment; the protection of human rights; the promotionof harmony and social cohesion in multi-racial andmulti-ethnic societies; the combating of terrorism drug-trafficking and clandestine traffic in armaments; andthe enhancing of the capacity of the United Nations  withinthe framework of its Charter  to prevent conflicts  preservepeace and alleviate suffering. The new agenda of theUnited Nations must be shaped on the basis of thisapproach  giving peace and development equal priority andtreatment. The General Assembly  with its universalparticipation and comprehensive mandate  should projectsuch a holistic vision and revitalize that vision into action.The Secretary-General’s Agendas have reminded usof what we should focus on  namely  disarmament development and peace. I put them in that order becausetrue peace can only follow disarmament and development.The cold war was not war  yet certainly not peace. In itswake  we have seen how  most frighteningly  poverty disease and a host of miseries affect the cause of peace.They had been there all the time  but were not seen by thejaundiced eye of the cold war. In the new post-cold-warcontext  therefore  the nexus of disarmament anddevelopment with peace becomes crystal clear - indeedinescapably clear.We have to start with disarmament. The slaughter inRwanda has taken place during the forty-ninth anniversaryof the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For almost50 years  we have lived in fear of general and completeextinction instead of global and complete disarmament.Those who had biological and chemical weapons havegiven them up under universally binding commitments. Wemust now go one logical step further and exorcise thegreatest evil of all  namely  the weapons of massdestruction.We have had global discussions on nucleardisarmament before  but now that the cold war  whichspawned these weapons  is over  and the previousadversaries have been drawn into a partnership for peace this is surely the time to agree - in regimes which areglobal  comprehensive  verifiable and non-discriminatory -on steps to make the world a safer place. Anotheropportunity will arise when the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) comes up forreview next April. We hope that States Parties will use thatoccasion to refashion the Treaty into a real instrument forglobal disarmament. Quite apart from the NPT  it isessential that we examine a detailed implementationprocess of total and global disarmament  which has beenaccepted in principle  though in words only thus far.Last June in Cairo  the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries  at India’s suggestion  proposed that afourth special session on disarmament be convened. Wethink the time and the circumstances are right for theGeneral Assembly to plan for this special session for nextyear  or as soon as possible.But disarmament alone will be inadequate. We arerushing towards another precipice  where the disparitiesin wealth between nations would trigger violent revolutionwithin States. A global convulsion will come if wecontinue to disregard the development imperative. Theproblems of development are global problems and mustbe addressed by all of us. We must set a substantiveagenda for development  commit ourselves to it andimplement it.The World Trade Organization  which should sooncome into being  must promote what we expected but didnot quite achieve so far in the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) - non-discrimination consensus and transparency in the international traderegime. We hope that the multilateral trade negotiationswill stimulate economic growth in our countries and inthe world economy. It will not if the carefully negotiatedconsensus  to which we committed ourselves atMarrakesh  is destroyed by the introduction of newconditionalities. Faith in the multilateral system will beshaken if countries use their trading strength and bilateralpressures to weaken and distort agreements to which theyhave just become parties.The themes of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment focus on the critical issues of povertyeradication together with social integration and the needto increase avenues for productive employment  withoutwhich we will not have the broad-based  self-sustainingsocial and economic development that is the onlyguarantor of peace and security. If the Summit is tosucceed  we must agree upon the commitments foradditional resources dedicated to national programmesaround the world. We should not be sidetracked fromthis goal by new concepts which do not commandconsensus  and do not address the fundamental needs ofdevelopment.14The United Nations must also re-order its priorities soas to counter several disturbing centrifugal trends which wesee emerging. What the world needs is support for thenation-State system on which the United Nations was built.In June this year  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao andPresident Yeltsin  representing two of the largest pluralisticnations in the world  issued the Moscow Declaration on theProtection of the Interests of Pluralistic States. In thisDeclaration  which has been circulated as a document of theGeneral Assembly  Russia and India have put forwardprinciples which  if acted upon  will  we think  promotegreater harmony in the world.Against this background  there are a few questions forthe Assembly to consider. For the 45 years of the coldwar  the Security Council was forced into immobility  butwhen the cold war ended  it found itself shouldering astupendous task. As if to make up for years of inactivity it has rushed into many areas. We must ponder theconsequences of the decisions taken over the last few years which have on occasion sent United Nations peace-keepersin pursuit of objectives whose nexus with peace is rathertenuous.New doctrines justify armed United Nationsintervention under circumstances that are not quite defined -not yet at any rate. These initiatives are well meaning butthey do not seem to address the problems from the rightend. The ultimate human right is the right to live - theright to food and shelter without which life is impossible.The poverty of many nations makes this a problem towhich there are no easy answers. If there arecircumstances which justify armed multilateral intervention by the same logic should not the United Nations have theright to enforce the equitable sharing of resources amongnations?The Non-aligned Movement  at the meeting of itsForeign Ministers in Cairo this year  suggested someguiding principles for peace-keeping operations of enduringsignificance. All means for the peaceful settlement ofdisputes chosen by the conflicting parties should beexhausted before coercive measures are considered.Peace-keeping operations should strictly adhere to theprinciples of the Charter  in particular the principles of fullrespect for the sovereignty of States  their territorialintegrity and non-intervention in their internal affairs.Peace-keeping operations should be considered only at therequest of the Member States involved. The resources forpeace-keeping activities should not be at the expense ofresources for development activities of the United Nations.There should be no hesitation in ending those operationswhich have been overtaken by events or becomeinconsistent with their mandates. It is also important toensure that the distinction between peace-keepingoperations and other activities of the United Nations including humanitarian assistance  is maintained at alltimes. While coordination between these activities at thefield level is important  their integration could irreversiblyalter the basic purposes of these distinct activities anddetract from their effectiveness.Prudence must be exercised in the use of regionalorganizations in peace-keeping operations. It is thecapacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping thatmust be strengthened.We have responded positively to the Secretary-General’s appeal for the strengthening of the UnitedNations capacity for peace-keeping by designating abrigade for the stand-by arrangements that are being putin place.It is true that the work of the Security Council andits role in the United Nations are of the greatestimportance. There is therefore all the more reason thatthe Council should be representative of the internationalcommunity and have maximum legitimacy. The UnitedNations needs a Council that is effective  but it cannot beeffective if the impression grows that it representsentrenched privileges and that its agenda could vary fromthose of the general membership. The democracy andgood governance which are urged upon all States cannotstop at the gates of the United Nations.The present-day composition of the Security Councilreflects the power balance of the immediate post-warperiod. Since then  the membership of the world bodyhas increased many times over. There is also a greaterdiffusion of power. To give the Council’s actions greaterlegitimacy  moral authority and political effectiveness  itis imperative to expand the membership of the Council.Developing countries must be included in the category ofpermanent members to reflect the universal character ofthe world body. The number of non-permanent seatsmust also be increased to give Member States greateropportunity for participation in the work of the Council.A selective  piecemeal expansion of the number ofpermanent members would not be prudent. The SecurityCouncil is not a corporate board  where equity sharesdetermine the voting power  nor can it be likened to theBretton Woods institutions  which reflect the wealth ofnations. The United Nations is based on the principle of15the sovereign equality of nations. Its primary objectiveremains the maintenance of international peace and security.These elements must find expression in the composition ofthe Council  which must be able to address the challengesof the twenty-first century.Durability and resilience  rather than expediency should determine the time frame of any expansion. On thebasis of any criteria - population  size of economy contribution to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity and to peace-keeping or future potential - Indiadeserves to be a permanent member of the SecurityCouncil.The working methods of the Security Council must bereformed to enhance transparency and to express thedemocratic aspirations of the vast majority of MemberStates. We hope that the Open-ended Working Group onthe question of increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil will duly reflect on these issues in its deliberationsnext year.Human rights are the new vogue. The profoundlyhumanistic traditions of the Indian civilization  with itsemphasis on tolerance  harmony  non-violence and theinviolability of the individual  are in-built in our ethos.Several centuries back  an Indian thinker wrote:""Man is above everything else. Man is the highesttruth. There is nothing above man.""All human rights are sacrosanct in India  guaranteedby a secular Constitution  an independent judiciary  a freepress  and public opinion vigorously expressed. India’scommitment to the promotion and protection of humanrights has now received another institutional impetus withthe establishment of our National Human RightsCommission  which has begun to function effectively  withits findings published in its annual report. In keeping withour policy of transparency we maintain a sustained dialoguewith important non-governmental organizations  whichincludes affording greater access to them. We have alsoinvited the United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights to visit India.It is true that much remains to be done on aworldwide basis to further international cooperation topromote and protect human rights. But the problem mustbe seen in perspective. In India  for instance  we grapplewith the problems of development for 900 million people;in the north-west and in the north-east we face brutalterrorist movements  often supported from abroad  whichhave killed thousands of innocents  made refugees ofhundreds of thousands within India  and threatened oursovereignty and territorial integrity. We will face theseproblems and defeat them. We welcome the support andadvice of friends abroad  but we cannot accept theposition that all human rights are a privilege of theterrorists. The rights of innocent and unarmed citizensmust be protected. We urge that the question of humanrights should not be made into a politically motivatedslogan insensitive to the rights of those citizens.Since the toxin of terrorism is deliberately beingspread by some countries - and none of us is immune -the international community must come together to defenditself. Terrorism is fast becoming a means  if not aweapon  of mass destruction. Many countries havesuffered and many more could be affected. Terroristshave killed far more people in the last decades than thechemical and biological weapons which we have agreedto ban and destroy. Just as the international communitydecided that a convention was needed to outlaw thoseweapons  so it must urgently negotiate a convention tocounter and eradicate terrorism. We urge the GeneralAssembly to initiate serious thinking on this subject. Theinternational community must also provide the necessarysuccour to the victims of terrorism  whose numbers areswelling by the day.The closing years of the twentieth century will seehuman society poised at a critical juncture as regards thefuture. Will the end of the cold war mark the beginningsof a new  more stable global order  of freedom andwell-being growing on the soil of cooperation  consensusand mutual respect  or will the world instead revert bit bybit to the mind-set which breeds anarchy and a return tocentrifugalism and destruction  to end up once again inthe tyranny of imposition and domination? Should weregress to the system of spheres of influence which hasled to so many wars over the last two hundred years?These questions have still not been adequately answered.Many years ago the father of our nation  MahatmaGandhi  had asked what test should guide humanendeavour. His conclusion  after long years of strugglingon behalf of India’s many dispossessed millions  was asfollows:""I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are indoubt  or when the self becomes too much with you apply the following test: Recall the face of thepoorest and the weakest man whom you may haveseen  and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is16going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anythingby it? Will it restore him to a control over his ownlife and destiny?""If the protection afforded to its weak  its mostdispossessed  people is the measure of community’s worth as indeed it must be  then the millions of refugees  and theconflict  poverty  hunger and deprivation that afflict somany regions of the world today bear stark testimony to theloss of some vital ethical underpinning. If the world todayis to redeem a future that seems increasingly mortgaged togreed and hatred  we must recall once again that it is thenobility of our means  and the ends we pursue  thatdetermine our rewards. Our welfare will be determinedonly in accordance with the values and principles we abideby.As Mahatma Gandhi and sages before have taught andpractised  truthfulness  charity  compassion  non-violenceand treating others as we would wish ourselves to betreated are the values that really stand the test of time.These are the values to be inculcated in our great globalOrganization  the United Nations  to which we are allcommitted."
"78",3249,"IRL",49,1994,"I warmly congratulate you Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. You take office at anhistoric moment for the United Nations on the eve of itsfiftieth anniversary.The past year has been one of progress and greathope for many peoples and States represented in thisAssembly. In South Africa  the elections have given birthto a democratic  non-racial society which offers a modelof tolerance and reconciliation for others on that torturedcontinent. In the Middle East  the establishment of aPalestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho paves theway for a comprehensive settlement in a region thatseveral times in living memory has threatened globalconfrontation. In Germany and in the Baltic States  thewithdrawal of foreign troops marks the end of thedivision of our continent and heralds a Europe free and atpeace. And on my own island - the island of Ireland -the declaration by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) of acomplete cessation of military operations has opened theprospect of a peaceful resolution which has not existedfor a generation.14For many years it has been customary for IrishForeign Ministers to report to this Assembly ondevelopments in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland.Too often they have spoken of killing and destruction  thefailure of political initiatives and controversies on humanrights. It seemed that the Northern Ireland conflictbelonged to the category of truly intractable problemsdestined to outlive all change of circumstance and to defyall attempts at a solution.I begin my address this year on this question  becausemy message is now one of hope. The past 12 months havesignificantly enhanced the prospects for lasting peace andstability on the island of Ireland. It is true that the edificeof a solution still remains to be constructed  but I believevery solid foundations have now been laid.At the origin of the Northern Ireland conflict lies adifference of view as to whether the partition of Irelandearlier this century was or was not a denial of the right ofthe Irish people to self-determination. This difference waspassionately and violently acted out by two communities inNorthern Ireland  who were and remain deeply polarized bytheir division on fundamental constitutional issues. Thisconflict has been costly for all the people of NorthernIreland and for the British and Irish peoples generally. Todeal with it is one of the most urgent and important tasksfacing both Governments. Experience has shown that theability of the two Governments to do so will be directlyproportionate to the degree of agreement between us.It is in the inherited gaps between our positions thatterrorism on both sides has taken root. For that reason cooperation and agreement between the two Governmentsis vital for any solution. Last December  the Irish andBritish Governments published a Joint Declaration whichsignificantly consolidated the common ground between usand offered all the parties to the conflict a compellingpolitical alternative to the endless cycle of bloodshed andretribution.In the Joint Declaration  the British Governmentrecognizes that it is for the people of Ireland alone  byagreement between the two parts respectively and withoutexternal impediment  to exercise their right ofself-determination on the basis of consent  freely andconcurrently given  North and South  to bring about aunited Ireland if that is their wish. The Irish Governmentaccepts that the right to self-determination of the people ofIreland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and subject to  the agreement and consent of a majorityof the people of Northern Ireland.The Declaration seeks to deal with the issue ofself-determination in a way which banishes the spectre ofcoercion. Instead  political consent is now clearly set asthe necessary goal and touchstone for any stablearrangement in Ireland  whatever the framework. TheDeclaration makes clear that the British Government isnot the enemy of the Irish nationalist tradition and thatthe Irish Government is not the enemy of the unionisttradition. A crucial aspect of the Declaration is theacknowledgement that future arrangements in Ireland arefor decision and agreement between the Irish peoplethemselves  North and South  and its formal commitmentthat the role of the British Government will be to promotesuch agreement.The Declaration thus marks a decisive break withany notion which has had such dark resonances in Irishhistory that arrangements in Ireland might be decided asa function of British rights over Ireland. This opens theway  in turn  for a new and more developedacknowledgement by the nationalist tradition of theunquestionable rights of the unionist community  derivedfrom its position as a distinct tradition in Ireland. Aconsiderable section of the Joint Declaration is devoted tothis issue.At the end of August  following a protracted internaldebate  the IRA decided in favour of a complete cessationof military operations. That decision has been confirmedby other statements in the interval. Much moreimportant  it has been sustained on the ground. This is adevelopment of very great significance.It is first and foremost welcome because it saveslives. Secondly  it opens the prospect of comprehensivenegotiations  governed by democratic principles  takingplace against a background of peace and embracing theentire spectrum of all those involved in the conflict. Suchnegotiations have the greatest potential for success.Moreover  their outcome is likely to be more authoritativethan a less general agreement  which would have had tobe enforced against a background of continuing violenceand repression.We still await the end of the campaign of violencecarried out by loyalist paramilitaries. I remain hopefulthat they  in turn  will come to realize that their violenceis repugnant to their own community as well as to others and counterproductive to their cause. We hope that15responsible political leaders in the unionist community willmake their voices strongly heard on this issue  as manyhave done already  and that a complete cessation ofviolence will ensue on the loyalist side also.We have now an unparalleled opportunity to create thebasis for lasting agreement among our different politicaltraditions in Ireland. We can do so  no longer prisoners ofthe past  but rather learning form our past mistakes on allsides.Perhaps the greatest such mistake  shared at one timeas an unquestioned assumption on both sides  was that thisconflict  concentrated in the narrow ground of NorthernIreland  could only end in victory and defeat for onetradition or the other. Compromise was seen as the firststep on the road to defeat. We have all learned  through acostly process of trial and error  that in the Northern Irelandsituation notions of victory and defeat are an illusion. Eachcommunity had the critical mass to thwart the other  butneither can prevail alone. General political consent istherefore a simple practical necessity  as well as an ideal.The challenge now for the British and IrishGovernments is to seize on the momentum for peace.Together with all the political parties in Northern Ireland we need to build new structures  reflecting the lessons ofour experience and building on the principles of the JointDeclaration.Experience has taught us that a majority ""winner-takes-all"" system is profoundly unsuited to a society suchas Northern Ireland  where divisions are predominantlycommunal and unchanging - rather than social or economic and therefore changeable. Let us apply that lesson  makingagreement and consensus the kernel of all newarrangements.Northern Ireland is characterized by a profound lackof consensus on the constitutional issue of whether thelegitimate frame of reference is Northern Ireland or theisland as a whole. Let us anchor new arrangements in anAgreement acknowledging and reconciling the validity ofboth.The political division of Ireland has inhibited many ofthe constructive political  economic and social interactionswhich can contribute to the welfare of both parts of theisland. Let us set that to rights in effective new structuresbetween North and South.The choice of sovereignty has hitherto been a kindof symbolic shorthand for the victory or defeat of onecommunity or the other. Let us divorce this notion as faras possible from all partisan or tribal connotations  andagree that the exercise of sovereignty  by whicheverGovernment  will at all times  now and in the future  bequalified by scrupulously equal treatment of the twoNorthern communities and of their rights  identities andallegiances.New arrangements on these lines would  I believe divest the conflict over sovereignty of much of its currentconfrontation and passion. Under new arrangements onthese lines  buttressed and guaranteed by formalagreement between the two Governments  conflict overthe choice of sovereignty might cease to become thedestabilizing issue it now is. Instead  it might be handledunder agreed political ground-rules  scrupulously even andfair to both aspirations  as a question of mutualpersuasion and comparative benefit. Northern Irelandcould become a place specially dedicated to the protectionof the rights of both communities. Then  for the firsttime  both communities there could be truly themselves and perhaps find common purpose in many areas whereat present there is only division.The Irish Government will pursue progress towardsa lasting accommodation on a number of different levels.We are establishing a Forum for Peace andReconciliation  to enable all democratic parties in Irelandthat are so minded to make recommendations on ways inwhich agreement and trust between the two traditions inIreland can be promoted and established. This will not bea negotiating forum  although we are hopeful that its workwill contribute positively to the climate in whichnegotiations take place  and that many of itsrecommendations can be translated into practice.Simultaneously  the Irish and British Governmentsare working on a joint framework document setting outtheir own views on where a balanced accommodation ofthe problem may be found. It is our hope that thisdocument  which we will commend to the other parties but cannot of course impose on them  will give freshimpetus to the process of comprehensive negotiation.The developments I have outlined have forged aunique opportunity to achieve a comprehensive  just andpeaceful resolution of the Northern Ireland problem. It isvital that their potential should be realized through earlynegotiations and agreement on new political structures.A new beginning for all our relationships in Ireland is16within our reach if we have the collective courage andimagination to avail ourselves of the opportunity. Thedesire for a lasting peace and a political accommodationhas never been stronger across the entire population of theisland.If in many parts of the world the message is one ofhope  we know that in other places old enmities and ethnicanimosities have surfaced  with vicious and indeed deadlyconsequences.The conflicts in Somalia  in the former Yugoslavia  inRwanda; the gross abuses of human rights in Haiti and EastTimor; the suffering of millions who are denied their basicrights to food  water or shelter; these remind us that wecannot let up in the struggle to create a peaceful world andto uphold human dignity.A characteristic feature of many contemporary crisesis that they are essentially conflicts within States  ratherthan between them.And this  I believe  is the central question facing theUnited Nations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary: canthe United Nations  which was born out of the greatestinter-State conflict the world has ever seen  and which isdesigned specifically to prevent and resolve such conflicts -can this Organization deal adequately with internal crisesand civil strife?I know that there are some who argue that the UnitedNations has no place in such matters  that many internalconflicts are not amenable to outside intervention. I canunderstand such arguments and the cautious desire not toget involved in other people’s internal quarrels.But can we let a crisis such as that in the formerYugoslavia escalate to the point where it threatens a widerBalkan conflict?Can we stand aside while millions are slaughtered bytheir compatriots in Rwanda?By what calculus do we divine that death in civil strifecounts less than death in inter-State warfare  that thosethreatened by their own countrymen are less deserving ofour efforts than those who are threatened by theirneighbours?I can find no moral justification for such distinctions.The appalling escalation of terror and violence inRwanda demonstrates the truth of this. To the names thathave come to be associated in recent years with humansuffering - Sarajevo  Gorazde  Mogadishu  Baidoa - wecan now add Goma  Bukavu and Ngara.The tragedy of Rwanda has gripped the hearts andminds of the Irish people. Today there are over 100 Irishaid workers in the area. More than 70 Irish publicservants and military personnel are working with theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) and the aid agencies.And our President  Mary Robinson  hopes shortly tovisit Rwanda to show solidarity with the people of thattroubled land and to emphasize the need for internationalaction.In its response to the crises in Rwanda and Somalia the international community has shown a generouswillingness to help. Much human suffering has beenalleviated. But we have not come near to achievingdurable solutions. Nor are we any nearer to constructinga system to prevent similar horrors in the future.We must ask how the United Nations could haveplayed a more active mediating role in Rwanda.Could it have prevented the outbreak of genocidalwarfare when political unrest rapidly deteriorated intocivil strife?Could it have responded more coherently whengenocide was followed by a mass exodus?How can it now assist in the resolution of theconflict?I believe that unless we equip the United Nations todeal with these kinds of problems - the most characteristicand pressing of our time - the credibility and relevance ofour Organization will increasingly be called into question.The roots of civil disorder and internal strife areoften complex and deep - deeper and more complex indeed  than the causes of inter-State war. Recentexperience has shown that recourse to Chapter VII actionalone is inadequate and that outside involvement  unlesscarefully prepared and sensitively executed  can add to rather than diminish  the crisis. We must learn thelessons of this and realize that building a United Nations17capable of meeting the challenges of the new era willrequire coordinated action in many areas.I will mention seven points on which I believe thereshould be priority action:We must reform the Security Council to make it morerepresentative of the United Nations greatly expandedmembership and to reflect the great changes ininternational relations of the past 50 years.We must develop the Organization’s capacity for earlywarning and mediation and for timely intervention indisputes before they escalate out of control.We must enhance the United Nations peace-keepingcapabilities to make them more flexible andresponsive when crises erupt.We must develop the United Nations operationalcapacity in the area of human rights. In particular  weneed a more developed system of human rightsmonitors.We must act to establish a permanent internationalcriminal court. We must intensify our efforts toeliminate the root causes of many conflicts -inequality  social injustice  and poverty - by acting onthe Secretary-General’s agenda for development.We must restrict the international flow of theinstruments of war and oppression by adopting a codeof conduct for conventional arms transfers.There is now widespread agreement on the need forthe Security Council to be more representative and moreresponsive to the needs of the general membership of theUnited Nations. I believe that early decisions to increasethe overall membership of the Council are needed  and thatan increase in the permanent membership should reflect thechanges in international life over the past 50 years.Our discussions have shown that concrete decisionswill not be easy  but we must avoid getting bogged downin narrow considerations of optimal numbers and thecompeting claims of regional Powers. One way of handlingthis would be to build into our decision a commitment toreview again the membership of the Security Council at aspecific date in the future. In this way we could work fora result that reflects current geopolitical realities  thatacknowledges that these realities can change over time andthat recognizes that all Member States have the potentialto contribute to international peace and security.Measures already taken to improve transparency arewelcome  but more must be done to facilitate interactionbetween the Security Council and the generalmembership. And surely the time has also come whenwe can delete from the Charter references to enemies thatno longer exist.The terrible crises in Rwanda and Somalia haveshown that we need to look urgently and more closely atthe role and capacity of the United Nations in preventingand defusing conflicts. And we need to consider ways ofstrengthening the capability of regional organizations toengage in conflict resolution. We must be prepared toavail ourselves in full of the functions bestowed by theCharter on the General Assembly  the Secretary-Generaland the Economic and Social Council  as well as on theSecurity Council.We must ensure that information on economic andsocial conditions likely to result in a threat to security orstability is brought quickly to the attention of theOrganization  and in particular to the Security Council.We have the instrument for this in the Economic andSocial Council. We should now act on theSecretary-General’s proposal that a reformed Economicand Social Council provide reports to the SecurityCouncil on those economic and social developments thatmay threaten peace and security.Beyond this  we must strengthen the United Nationscapacity for mediation. The Security Council and theGeneral Assembly  despite their undoubted authorityunder the Charter  are not always the most suitableinstruments for the direct mediation of conflict. Inpractice  the Secretary-General has on many occasionsappointed a representative to mediate in particular crises often with considerable success. I believe that the timehas come to put these arrangements on a more organizedbasis. This could be done by constituting a mediationbody to which the Security Council or the Assemblycould refer difficult issues. Acting in consultation withthe Secretary-General  this body would be distinct fromthe International Court of Justice  in that it would havethe role of political mediation rather than that ofpronouncing a verdict in terms of international law. Ibelieve that such a body  drawing on the pool ofpersonnel skilled in mediation  backed by effective staffand properly resourced  could rapidly acquire an expertise18and authority that would significantly enhance thepeacemaking capabilities of the United Nations.The United Nations is now conducting more peace-keeping operations and has more personnel in the field thanat any time in its history. Ireland is participating in manyof these operations and devotes a significant proportion ofits defence forces  and of its defence expenditure  to UnitedNations peace-keeping. That is one reason why myGovernment is particularly concerned at the under-fundingof peace-keeping operations and at the failure of certainMember States to pay their assessed contributions.But there is a deeper and more important reason. TheSecretary-General has pointed to the difficulty in findingpersonnel for the many new demands on United Nationspeace-keeping. Recent experience has shown that aSecurity Council mandate no longer ensures that anoperation will soon take place. I can think of nothing moreserious or more damaging than the failure of theOrganization quickly to mount an operation at the outbreakof a crisis. The crisis itself escalates out of control  thecredibility of the United Nations is called into question andthe authority of the Security Council is undermined.We must act to ensure that operations are properlyresourced  that troop contributors can take decisions onparticipation  secure in the knowledge that they will beadequately funded  and that there is greater consultationbetween the Council and troop contributions.The cost of peacekeeping will always be less than thecost of war. There could be no better way to mark thefiftieth anniversary than to address once and for all thismost critical constraint on peacekeeping operations.As our understanding of civil strife develops  we arecoming to see the vital role that action in the area of humanrights can play in helping to prevent and resolve conflict.The value of integrating peace-keeping and human rightshas proved its worth in Cambodia  in El Salvador andelsewhere  but our approach has been piecemeal andtentative. Even in Rwanda we still await an adequatedeployment of human rights monitors. Resources will haveto be found for this activity. For its part  Ireland intends tocontribute to the voluntary fund for Rwanda established bythe High Commissioner for Human Rights.There is a clear need to put in place an effectivesystem of monitoring and adjudicating human rightsviolations. One important step would be to develop astanding team of human rights monitors reporting to theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. This would makeit easier to integrate human rights action into peace-keeping operations  and the mandate for peace-keepingoperations could include a human rights dimension withclearly established reporting and verification procedures.In addition  we should move now on theestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.The United Nations must demonstrate that it has the willto bring to justice those responsible for crimes againsthumanity  summary executions  torture  rape andmutilation. If we fail to do this  we will have failed tolearn the lessons of Yugoslavia and Rwanda  and we will of course  risk their repetition.Our efforts to deal with war and civil strife cannotignore what the ""Agenda for Peace"" has described as theroot causes of conflict: economic despair  social injusticeand political oppression. Maintaining the peace isimpossible in an unequal world. Conversely development is the most secure basis for peace.It can be no coincidence that Rwanda and Somaliaare among the least developed countries of the world.Thus  when the Secretary-General himself tells us thatdevelopment is in crisis  we are compelled to listen  andwe are compelled to agree with him that an alternative tothe United Nations in development simply does not exist.The truth is that the agenda for development and the""Agenda for Peace"" are complementary. They aredifferent sides of the same coin  and we must makeprogress on both if we are to reach our common goals ofpeace and prosperity.What has been called a ""culture of development""must extend beyond the provision of financial assistanceto embrace economic progress  the environment  socialjustice  democracy and good governance. At next year’sWorld Social Summit and at the Conference on Womenwe can build on the progress already made in theConferences on Environment and on Population.The tragedy of war and civil strife underlines theneed to address more seriously the question ofdisarmament. The easy availability of arms contributes not just to the scale of the carnage and suffering inconflict  but to the outbreak of conflict itself.At the global level  the volume of trade in majorconventional weapons has declined in recent years. But19in some regions large stockpiles have accumulated. Inothers the arms trade continues to grow.There is a need for States to exercise greaterresponsibility and restraint in their arms transfers. Alreadythe United Nations Register of Conventional Arms has ledto greater transparency. But I believe that we should nowgo further. That is why Ireland has proposed that theUnited Nations elaborate a code of conduct for conventionalarms transfers which would set out common principles tobe observed in this area. It is my hope that the GeneralAssembly will now decide that work on such a code shouldbe put in hand.The lives of millions of people have been put at riskand large areas rendered unsafe as a result of theindiscriminate use of land-mines. Since last year manyGovernments have introduced moratoriums on the export ofanti-personnel mines. I welcome President Clinton’s callfor an agreement to reduce the number and availability ofthese mines.I welcome also the very considerable progress madein the reduction of nuclear arsenals and towards acomprehensive test-ban treaty. The threat of nuclearconflict between the major Powers no longer overshadowsour daily lives. But there is disturbing evidence that someStates still want to acquire a nuclear-weapon capability.Their ability to do so is helped by the growth in the world’sstocks of fissile materials and in personnel with therequisite technological skills.Next year’s Conference to review and extend theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsprovides an opportunity to address these issues. Irelandwants to see an indefinite extension of the Treaty. Wewant to see the principles on which the Treaty is foundedmaintained; the non-proliferation regime strengthened; allStates becoming members; and progress made towards thecomplete elimination of nuclear weapons  as envisaged inthe Treaty.The agenda for United Nations reform is formidable -for the Organization itself and for the States that make upthis Assembly. But whatever the difficulties  reform is avital and urgent necessity. I am convinced that unless weact in a broad and imaginative way  bringing together thepolitical  peace-keeping  development and human-rightsinstruments of the United Nations  we will prove inadequateto the great contemporary challenges.We now have an opportunity such as has not existedfor a generation. I urge all of us to grasp it."
"79",3296,"IRN",49,1994,"May I atthe outset congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. Allow me to emphasizemy delegation’s complete readiness to cooperate with himand other delegations during this session. I also wish toexpress my satisfaction at the presence of the delegation ofthe democratic Government of South Africa at this session.On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  this session of the General Assembly presents uswith the opportunity to envisage a better world based on theprinciples of the Charter and the shared values andaspirations of its members. The only path to theachievement of this vital goal is the examination of pastperformance  a sober analysis of present circumstances andthe formulation of a renewed vision of the future ofinternational relations in accordance with the Charter.In the past 50 years the United Nations has succeededin some areas  including decolonization. Yet the rivalriesbetween the two super-Powers did not allow theOrganization to accomplish its mission in full. In the areaof disarmament  the United Nations was not able to play asignificant role  and substantive negotiations wereconducted outside the United Nations system. By the sametoken  the role played by the Organization in economicdevelopment was heavily influenced by similar rivalriesbetween East and West  resulting in economic relationsdevoid of justice and parity. In addition  the cold war wasa factor in shaping the structural make-up of theOrganization  and so the United Nations was deprived ofthe opportunity to be a true agent of change.During the past 50 years of its existence the UnitedNations has had its share of challenges. Yet never beforehas the Organization faced such a historic and seriouschallenge in self-renewal as it does at present  when wehave reached a crossroads in the history of internationalrelations. Naturally  to meet the challenge of today’snumerous rapid changes  the Organization must rid itselfof the very constraints imposed upon it by the era ofrivalry between the super-Powers.But  alas  a few self-proclaimed victors of the coldwar feel entitled to dictate the new criteria that determineinternational relations and guide the United Nations and more specifically  the Security Council  arrogating tothemselves the right to impose their own vision andself-serving interpretations on the rest of humanity. Thetransformation of the Security Council into an instrumentfor justification or enforcement of policies of a number ofpermanent members is not at all compatible with the spiritof the Charter and contradicts the very letter of Article24  according to which the Council acts on behalf of theentire membership of the Organization. Contrary to theassumptions of a few  the Security Council is no one’sprivate domain and should not be abused to revive thegunboat diplomacy of some Powers. A body chargedwith the grave responsibility of maintaining internationalpeace and security must not be influenced andmanipulated by those Powers that have historically soughtto serve their own self-interest at the expense ofinternational peace.The failure of the Security Council to adopt abalanced approach in dealing with various crises and itspersistent application of double standards  due tomanipulation by some permanent members  have in effectprevented the Council from discharging its primaryresponsibility in accordance with the Charter. The mostvivid illustration has been the silence of the SecurityCouncil and its failure to adopt resolute measures in theface of repeated acts of aggression committed by Israelagainst the people of Palestine  Lebanon  and Syria. Howcan the Security Council supporters of the regimeoccupying Palestine allow this expansionist regime tocontinue its aggression against neighbours  while repeatedresolutions of the Council demand an end to occupation?What motives underlie the silence of the Security Councilin the face of overt official terrorist acts by Israel in theoccupied territories and in South Lebanon? The massacreof Muslims in the Al-Khalil Mosque  the bombing ofresidential areas in South Lebanon  the kidnapping ofLebanese citizens  and other such incidents portray thebitter reality that Israel has come to believe that  with thesupport of a number of powerful States  it can continuesuch behaviour with impunity.Israel’s real and ultimate objective has been tocontinue its occupation. Today  under the disguise of thepeace process  this very policy is being pursued through37the repression of Muslims and all opponents of the illegaland aggressive Israeli occupation. Therefore  in our view the current process lacks realism  fails to adhere touniversal principles and therefore will not lead to realpeace. The comprehensive and just solution to thePalestinian issue lies in the full realization of all the rightsof the people of Palestine  including the return of allPalestinian refugees to their own land  enabling them toexercise their inalienable right to self-determination  and theliberation of all occupied territories.The unprincipled approach of the Security Councilvis-à-vis different crises and aggressions is alsodemonstrated by its questionable handling of the aggressionagainst the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For morethan two and a half years  the defenceless Muslims ofBosnia have been resisting foreign aggression  ""ethniccleansing""  massacre and the gradual annihilation of theirnation. Despite the adoption of countless resolutions andstatements  and in fact because of the lack of political willto deal with the roots of the crisis  the Security Council hasnot only failed to implement its own resolutions  but in facthas empowered the aggressors to continue their atrocitiesand has prevented a State Member of the United Nationsfrom exercising its inherent right of self-defence through itsresistance to the appeal of the international community tolift the unjustifiable arms embargo against the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina.From the very beginning of the crisis  the Governmentof Bosnia has participated in all negotiations in good faith even though most of the peace plans proposed by mediatorshave been unjust. The Government of Bosnia has amplydemonstrated its sincere desire for peace. On the otherhand  the aggressors and their supporters have  through apolicy of procrastination  created an impasse in thenegotiations by mocking all the decisions of the Counciland all proposals for peace. However  regrettably and inspite of previous commitments  no measure to encouragecompliance and punish intransigence and non-compliancehas been adopted by the Council. It was a source of deepanguish and astonishment to witness a few days ago theSecurity Council prematurely rushing to reward Serbia fornothing more than a tactical move  while months after theacceptance of the latest peace plan by the Government ofBosnia and its rejection by the Serbs  no decision has beenmade to fulfil the commitment of the five-nation ContactGroup  including the lifting of the unjustified arms embargoagainst Bosnia.In their recent gathering in Islamabad  Islamiccountries expressed their determination to contributeindividually and collectively to the legitimate defence ofthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At thisjuncture  a decisive majority among United NationsMember States are of the view that the implementation ofthe arms embargo against Bosnia is illegal. Many ofthese countries  in tandem with public opinion  considerany further waiting for a final pronouncement by theCouncil as unjustifiable in the present circumstances.Thus  we believe that in the interest of its own credibility the Council must take action without further ado andshow its respect for the views of an undisputed majoritywithin the international community.These examples and the debates of the past year onrestructuring the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil have clearly shown that the procedures andmethodology of the Security Council must be re-evaluatedand changed in order to enable it to address transparentlyand in a just and serious manner issues affectinginternational peace and security. Many also agree that theauthority of the General Assembly in attending to mattersof peace and security  as asserted by the Charter  and theneed for greater accountability of the Security Council tothe Assembly must be translated from mere words intoreality. The Council must scrupulously fulfil itsobligations towards the membership of the Organizationat large  on whose behalf the Council operates.The United Nations will be able to deal with worldissues effectively only when and if all its Members areallowed to participate equally in decision-making. Mostcontemporary international developments cannot be fullyappreciated if looked at in the perspective of 50 yearsago. If we are sincere in our belief that the world is sochanged that we must eliminate all references to ""enemyStates"" from the Charter  then why not also acknowledgethat there is no further justification for holding on toprivileges granted to the war victors of that time?Another fundamental issue which must be carefullyconsidered in our assessment of the first 50 years of theUnited Nations activities pertains to the role of the UnitedNations in all matters concerning disarmament  includingmultilateral efforts to effect total  comprehensive andnon-discriminatory disarmament in the world. Today  oneof the main preoccupations of the internationalcommunity is the future of arms control  particularly thatof weapons of mass destruction  which have nojustification in the post-cold-war era. The internationalcommunity must identify the hazards attached tostockpiling and horizontal and vertical proliferation ofthese weapons. It must then move to establish38comprehensive  universal and non-discriminatoryinternational treaties to ensure the elimination anddestruction of these weapons in the shortest possible time.Shortly after the suspension of the current session States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons will gather to review the effectiveness ofthis Treaty over the past 25 years and to decide upon theextent and conditions of its renewal. To reach a rationaland practical decision  one must answer the questionwhether the international community is prepared to accept as it has done for the past 25 years  that the nuclearPowers  on the one hand  be for ever equipped with theseweapons of destruction and that  on the other  the majorityof the signatories to the non-proliferation Treaty remaindeprived of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy.Iran was one of the first signatories to this Treaty andhas remained faithfully committed to it. But at the sametime  it is one of the many developing countries deprivedof the possibilities of progress and development offered bythe peaceful use of nuclear energy as recognized in theTreaty. We believe that the unconditional and indefiniterenewal of the non-proliferation Treaty will only lead to thepossession of these destructive and anti-human weapons bya handful of nuclear Powers and that the rest of theinternational community will be forced to live in fear in thedark shadow of these weapons. The founding of a newworld order on the encouragement and institutionalizationof discriminatory and vague norms  including the conferringof permanent status such treaties and the proliferation ofdiscriminatory  selective and non-universal regimes such asthe Australia Group or the London Club  does not augurwell for the future of the international community and theemerging world order.The Islamic Republic of Iran  as a victim of weaponsof mass destruction  has under no circumstances attempted nor will it ever attempt  to develop or possess theseanti-human weapons. It thus attaches great value to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons despite that instrument’s many inherent shortcomings.However  in our view a limited renewal of the Treaty canserve the objective of nuclear disarmament only if carefulattention is paid to the following considerations: first nuclear Powers should abandon the doctrine of nucleardeterrence and commit themselves to a target date for thecomplete elimination of nuclear weapons; secondly  thecomprehensive test-ban treaty should be finalized andunconditionally signed; thirdly  the production development  stockpiling of and trade in all fissile materialsfor nuclear-weapons purposes must be permanently banned;fourthly  the security of non-nuclear States must beguaranteed against the threat of the use of these weaponsby others  which will be possible through an effectiveinternational treaty; and  lastly  access by Governments tonuclear technology for peaceful purposes should beguaranteed.The future of the nuclear-proliferation Treaty alsorequires serious consideration of the critical situation inthe Middle East and the nuclear threat posed by Israel.Israel’s nuclear programme has exacerbated the arms racein the region and has forced others within the area to turnto more advanced conventional weaponry. Some Statesin the region have made their accession to a number ofdisarmament treaties conditional upon Israel’s acceptanceof international regimes established to prevent theproliferation of nuclear weapons. Israel’s refusal to doso  which regrettably enjoys the support of a number ofdeveloped nuclear-weapon States  will affect theperspective of States in the Middle East on the future ofthe non-proliferation Treaty after 1995.In addition to Israel’s continuous threats  interferenceby foreign Governments in the affairs of regional Stateshas led to negative perceptions and perspectives withinthe region that have impeded serious dialogue andconsideration of constructive suggestions for creatingpeace stability and security in the Middle East and thePersian Gulf.The Islamic Republic of Iran  which possesses thelongest shoreline along the Persian Gulf and the Sea ofOman  has been well aware of its role and responsibilitiesin promoting and maintaining peace and security in thearea and has spared no effort in this regard. Today  thelargest portion of Iran’s national budget is devoted toeconomic and social development and to reconstruction.Many of our military industries have been transformedinto non-military units. Despite the volatile nature of ourregion and our own bitter experience as a victim ofaggression  only an average of 1.6 per cent of Iran’s grossdomestic product is allocated to national defence  whilesome neighbouring countries continue their purchase ofhuge stockpiles of weapons.We firmly believe in the imperative of developingregional security arrangements that ensure theparticipation of all Persian Gulf countries. Sucharrangements would diminish the arms race and guaranteethe free flow of oil and economic development andprosperity in the area. The religious  cultural  historicaland commercial commonalities of the countries of the39region make it incumbent upon us to effect and expandtrust and cooperation through bilateral and multilateralinitiatives. We propose here the creation of a forum  withthe participation of the Persian Gulf countries  to reviewand develop confidence-building measures compatible withthe requirements of the region. The maintenance ofsecurity in the Persian Gulf is the responsibility of thecountries surrounding this strategic waterway. ForeignGovernments  which have often been the source ofinstability and insecurity in the region  should supportcollective regional initiatives for cooperation and refrainfrom sowing discord and tension and from other divisivepolicies to which they have historically resorted in order topreserve their interests and justify their presence.The efforts of the Islamic Republic of Iran to reducetension in Afghanistan  Tajikistan  Kashmir and Karabakhand its consistent affirmation of the principle of respect forinternationally recognized borders  territorial integrity andnon-interference in the internal affairs of others are in linewith its overall policy geared toward the maintenance andstrengthening of stability  security and economicdevelopment in the region.Our policy concerning Afghanistan has focused onefforts to prevent war and fratricide and on attempts topersuade warring factions to negotiate and reachunderstanding. In attaining these objectives we have hadcomprehensive and constructive cooperation with the UnitedNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.Meanwhile  we have continued our humanitarian assistanceto Afghanistan and now act as host to about 1.5 millionAfghan refugees remaining in our country.In efforts to settle the crisis in Tajikistan  whilecooperating with the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and organizing the second round of inter-Tajik talksin Tehran  we have continued our high-level contacts withthe warring parties and others concerned. Last week following an extensive mediation effort by Iran  it waspossible to arrange serious meetings and negotiation inTehran between the two parties  represented at the highestlevel. As a result  an agreement to halt hostilities and torelease prisoners and war captives was signed by both sidesin Tehran in the presence of representatives of theSecretary-General and the Russian Federation.In all these peace-making efforts we have welcomedconsultation and cooperation with all interested States andinternational organizations to contain these crises andprevent or mitigate their disastrous humanitarianconsequences.In Central Asia and the Caucasus  expansion andstrengthening of relations in all spheres  particularly thoseof economic and cultural cooperation with neighbouringcountries  are being vigorously pursued to facilitate andensure sustainable development in the region  build anatmosphere of mutual understanding and consolidatestability. As a founding member of the EconomicCooperation Organization (ECO)  the Islamic Republic ofIran is actively engaged in promoting free trade and jointventures among the States members of this organization.Iran is hopeful that ECO’s observer status at the UnitedNations attained last year will help enhance collaborationbetween ECO and various United Nations organs andagencies.The Islamic Republic of Iran has also endeavouredto establish a Caspian Sea cooperation council that wouldensure and monitor environmental protection and properutilization of its resources by littoral States. Theseregional efforts have laid the groundwork for multilateralcooperation between Iran  Central Asian States andindustrialized countries.Another major problem in the United Nations duringthe past decades has been the selective recourse to - and indeed  manipulation and exploitation of - humanconcerns and anxieties to meet questionable politicalagendas. In this body a minority  whose past records arefar from impeccable  have arrogated to themselves suchconcepts as human rights and democracy andsystematically used them as instruments of politicalpressure without any basis in reality or any justification.Such an approach makes human rights subservient topolitical interest and is designed and is being followedsolely to further political ambitions and impose the valuesof a specific group over the historical  political  economic social  religious  and cultural values of others.At the World Conference on Human Rights inVienna and the recent International Conference onPopulation and Development in Cairo  the failed attemptsof a minority discontented with divine moral values toimpose their ideas and ways on the religious majorityillustrated the undisputed imperative for developing aclear and precise appreciation of and respect for divineteachings and values and religious beliefs. These twoConferences showed that a good number of States particularly Islamic countries  cherish their religiousvalues enough to attribute more priority to defending theirdivine values and Islamic teachings  which guarantee themoral and material health of our societies  than topolitical considerations; they resisted  in a united front 40any attempt to disregard  undermine or desecrate thesevalues.For Muslims  the remarks made by the leader of theNorwegian delegation at the Cairo Conference wereespecially intolerable  insulting and simply erroneous. Werepeat our call to the Norwegian authorities to take thenecessary remedial measures  to refrain from repeating suchstatements manifesting religious intolerance and to begin torecognize and respect the rights of the majority ofhumanity  who believe in divine religions.By the same token  the dangerous phenomenon of lackof respect and tolerance for the values and beliefs of othersis  regrettably  gaining momentum in Western countriesagainst Muslim communities. This has resulted in theviolation of their most fundamental human rights and intheir being forcibly deprived of their basic right to maintainand practise the values and teachings of Islam. Wetherefore believe that greater efforts should be made tofoster and promote understanding of  and respect for  thediverse values of different peoples and nations through inter alia  constructive dialogue and the implementation ofa strengthened system of consultation.A similar problem is manifested in the approach of theinternational community vis-à-vis the threat of internationalterrorism in all its forms. Political considerations andreluctance to prevent terrorist activities by groups whosepositions correspond with the policies of certain hegemonicPowers have indisputably impeded international efforts witha view to eradicating international terrorism and are thusunjustifiable. How can the supporters of the overt officialterrorism of Israel declare themselves champions of thestruggle against terrorism and yet have the audacityarbitrarily to accuse others of supporting terrorism? Whydo these countries prevent any meaningful action againstthe Zionist terrorist atrocities in the Ibrahimi mosque inAl-Khalil? How do they remain totally indifferent to  andindeed acquiesce in  the recent terrorist explosion that killedand wounded many innocent pilgrims in the holiest shrinein our country? In our view  the only way to combatterrorism is through a comprehensive  uniform and across-the-board campaign. We need to work together at theinternational level to eliminate this anti-human phenomenonin all corners of the world  regardless of the race  religion ideology or political affiliations of the victims or of theculprits.Another important challenge facing the United Nationsis the need for political realism and serious consideration ofcurrent and future socio-economic circumstances and theirdirect correlation with social stability and peace.Increasing social complications are directly linked tochronic economic conditions and the ever-worseninginequitable international economic relations at the expenseof developing countries. Unless this correlation isacknowledged realistically and addressed responsibly inthe decisions of international forums  and unless effectiveremedial measures are implemented with the necessaryinternational support and cooperation  further exacerbationof international economic and social crises will continueto pose a grave and alarming threat to us all. It is thusimperative to utilize every opportunity to translateunderstandings into action-oriented programmes in orderto bring about the needed improvement in the worldsocial situation on the eve of the twenty-first century.Yet one must not forget that what prevents today’sUnited Nations from carrying out its economic anddevelopmental responsibilities is not the absence oflegislation or plans of action. Indeed  the main obstacleto the implementation of significant existing decisions isthe glaring absence of political will and financial andtechnical resources. Therefore  the Agenda forDevelopment should envisage explicit and practicalmechanisms for the effective and expeditiousimplementation of these international agreements.The experience of the past five decades hasdemonstrated that because of the primacy of politicalconsiderations over humanitarian values and the principlesof the United Nations Charter  it has not been possible toutilize properly the varied and unique potential of theOrganization as a formidable instrument for enhancinginternational cooperation  strengthening understanding andtrust  preventing and resolving crises and upheavals facilitating economic development  battling social andinternational ills such as terrorism and drugs  reinforcingrespect for the exalted dignity  worth and rights of humanbeings  and ensuring the common good.Preparations and planning for the secondhalf-century of the existence of the United Nations shouldbe conducted in full cognizance of this shortcoming  andwith a view to enhancing the effectiveness of theOrganization in carrying out those agreed tasks that are ofinterest and importance to the international community inits entirety. Old methods that have lost their credibilitymust be abandoned. New ways that are compatible withthe purposes and principles of the Charter whilecorresponding to the changing international environmentmust be developed. The delegation of the IslamicRepublic of Iran reiterates its full readiness to offer41unreserved cooperation to Mr. Amara-Essy and to otherdelegations to achieve these goals."
"80",3343,"IRQ",49,1994," Ishould like to convey to Mr. Essy of Côte d’Ivoire oursincere congratulations on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I amcertain that his experience will be a positive factor inensuring the success of the session’s deliberations.Iraq is one of the founding Members of the UnitedNations. Over the past five decades it has taken an activepart in all the Organization’s activities  has cooperatedeffectively with its various organs and has contributedgenerously when it was able to do so. Iraq has alsoadhered to the decisions of the Organization inaccordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter.At the international level  Iraq has participatedactively and responsibly in the Movement of Non-alignedCountries  the Organization of the Islamic Conference andthe League of Arab States. During the 1970s it providedassistance and soft loans amounting to about $10 billionto developing countries in Africa  Asia and Latin and15General Assembly 22nd meetingCentral America. Iraq has called for justice in political andeconomic relations and has affirmed the need to respectinternational law. These positions of Iraq are known to all.What now concerns my country is the nature of thecurrent stage of the relationship between Iraq and theSecurity Council  which is based on the Council’sresolution 687 (1991)  adopted in April of that year. Thatresolution  which imposed a number of obligations on Iraq has no precedent among United Nations resolutionsthroughout the history of the Organization. This is how itis seen today in international circles  both legal andpolitical. However  despite its cruel and extraordinarynature  Iraq informed the Security Council that it was readyto comply with it within the requirements laid down by theCharter’s provisions regarding resolutions adopted underChapter VII.Since that date  despite the harsh conditions obtainingin our country as a result of the total war waged by themost powerful States of the world — a war in which morethan 100 000 tons of explosives were dumped on civilianutilities throughout the country — and despite the effects ofthe comprehensive and harsh embargo  Iraq has striven toimplement the resolution.In March 1992 — less than a year after the adoptionof the resolution — and in November of the same year wecame to the Security Council to explain the substantial andserious steps that had been taken by Iraq in the process ofimplementing its provisions. On both occasions  werequested that positive and fair consideration be given towhat had been achieved and that steps be taken towardseasing the comprehensive blockade imposed upon Iraq inaccordance with the terms of the resolution and specifically  the unbearable suffering of the 20 millionpeople of Iraq. However  our requests were not heeded.In the middle of 1993 Iraq’s relationship with theSpecial Commission and with the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) saw a breakthrough in the field ofpositive and constructive cooperation with a view tocompleting the implementation of part C of SecurityCouncil resolution 687 (1991) — the provisions relating toproscribed weapons  which the resolution legally ties to thelifting of the embargo on oil exports.In the process of this cooperation — on26 November 1993 — we presented our official letterconcerning compliance with Security Council resolution 715(l991). The letter dealt with the monitoring of weapons.This was done after we had been assured that Iraq’s officialacknowledgment of compliance represented the mostexpeditious means of securing the application ofparagraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991). This clear andcategorical assurance is referred to in the report issued asdocument S/26571 on 12 October 1993. However  whatwe were told would be done has not been done.During the past 11 months we have witnessedtransparent tactics to delay and obstruct. These havetaken various forms. Their purpose is to delayindefinitely the lifting of the embargo. In spite of theofficial acknowledgment by the Special Commission andthe IAEA of the relevant Iraqi authorities’ continuingcooperation  as well as the notable achievements ofcompletion of the work required by those bodies over aperiod of more than a year  we still confront deliberateambiguity with regard to the Security Council’s dischargeits obligations under paragraph 22  which permits theexport of Iraqi products and commodities  including oil.The blockade imposed on Iraq represents the mostcomprehensive regime ever imposed by the SecurityCouncil in all its history. With the exception of food andmedicine  it includes everything and affects all aspects oflife. As a result of the freezing of Iraqi assets in foreignbanks  Iraq is denied all the financial resources that wouldenable it to pay for the food and medicines its peopleneed. This has rendered practically redundant theexceptions relating to food and medicines.In addition  the Sanctions Committee  which theSecurity Council entrusted with the task of authorizing theimportation of material to Iraq  agreed on the consensusmethod of making decisions. However  the reality isexactly the opposite: decisions are required to beunanimous.It is sufficient for the objection of one member tofrustrate any request for imports. It is worth noting thatonly three of the members of the Committee have beenthe source of constant objections on the vast majority ofthe import requests relating to the provision ofhumanitarian civilian needs. What has made the situationin the Sanctions Committee even worse is that it proceedson the basis of procedures which do not recognizeprecedents and deals with each case individually. Thishas led to confusion  disorder and ambiguity in the workof the Committee in regard to what is permitted  both inrelation to quantity and quality. It is not difficult to see therefore  the harmful negative consequences of thismethod of work by the Committee on the flow of16General Assembly 22nd meetinghumanitarian goods  which are of a limited quantityanyway.Let me refer to some glaring examples. The SanctionsCommittee refused on numerous occasions to permit theimportation of shrouds  pencils  cloth of all kinds includingthe type used for hospital bed sheets  threads of all kinds paper for printing school books  leather  car tires includingused tires  nails; the list is long and it is well documentedin the records of the Committee.This situation makes it incumbent upon theinternational community to reflect upon the philosophy ofthe sanctions regime of within the Charter of the UnitedNations. Is that regime a means to an end or is it an endin itself? Further  what is the nature of that regime? Is itpunitive  or is it a series of procedures designed to achievethe purposes of the Charter irrespective of the unilateralgoals and whims of foreign policies of Member States? Itis well known to all that the sanctions regime under theCharter is nothing but a series of procedures adopted toachieve certain results that lead in turn to the achievementof the purposes and principles of the United Nations  andthat such procedures should end with the cessation of theircauses. What then is the state of correct application ofthese procedures following all the cooperation and progressachieved in complying with the resolutions of the SecurityCouncil by Iraq? What is clear to us is that the applicationof sanctions and the embargo in the manner describedagainst Iraq is a process of vengeance  a process aimed atdepriving the people of Iraq  a nation of with great history a nation which has contributed immensely to humancivilization  depriving it of the simplest requirements ofhuman life.The reports of the relevant specialized agenciesindicate the continuing deterioration of living conditions ofthe Iraqi citizens. The Iraqi Government makes availableto every citizen a limited rations of flour  rice  tea  cookingoil  soap  baby formula and whatever other items might beavailable. This share is however to meet the basicnutritional needs of human beings. Of late  we have beenforced to reduce this ration due to the lack of financialresources and as well as poor agricultural output resultingfrom the embargo. Consequently  the largest number ofcitizens cannot buy what they lack of these and other itemsbecause of the high prices  especially for protein items  andthey are therefore suffering from malnutrition. Thissituation has affected the physical wellbeing of theindividual citizen in Iraq.Despite the efforts of the Government to support anddevelop the agricultural sector  great difficulties continueto be faced due to the embargo. For example  the lack ofpesticides  insecticides  agricultural machinery andequipment  water pumps and fertilizers. We do not havethe financial means to offset these shortages; and whenwe do have some financial resources  the SanctionsCommittee promptly obstructs their importation.The Joint Mission of the Food and AgriculturalOrganization and the World Food Programme  whichvisited Iraq in June 1993  did indicate in its Special AlertNo. 237 (1993) the magnitude of the danger resultingfrom the blockade on the agricultural capabilities of Iraq which caused the loss of food-security and generatedpersistent deprivation  chronic hunger and endemicmalnutrition among the vast majority of the population.The third FAO Special Report of May 1994 dealt with thegrave problems of providing food and crops in Iraq dueto the shortages of agricultural requirements. The sameReport noted that these problems cannot be solved by theprovision of food aid and that the permanent solution tothe present food crisis lies in reviving the Iraqi economywhich cannot be achieved without resuming the activityof international trade. It is also indicated that therationing system used by the Iraqi Government  thoughvery successful  provides only about one-half of theaverage caloric intake which used to be available to thecitizens of Iraq before the imposition of the sanctions.In the public health sector  health services havedeteriorated  after they had been amongst the relativelyadvanced in the world. Due to shortages of medicine andthe deterioration of medical equipment  cases of deathhave reached 384 022 cases from August 1990 to March1994. The cases of death among infants have alsoincreased and now reach 126 cases per l00 000 live birthswhereas it had been only 32 per thousand in the period1985 to 1990.There are those who claim that the Government ofIraq is the party responsible for not making availablefood  medicine and essential civilian needs to the peoplebecause it has refused to accept Security Councilresolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Such allegationsare mere falsifications.Fair and objective consideration of the full picture ofthe arrangements adopted in these two resolutions wouldlead one to the conclusion that they do represent17General Assembly 22nd meetinga political programme aimed at violating the sovereignty ofIraq  interfering in its internal affairs and dividing its peoplealong ethnic and sectarian lines  rather than ensuring thesatisfying of humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq.Through five rounds of talks with the Secretariat in Viennaand New York in 1992 and 1993 we have sought to reachacceptable modalities through sound arrangements in orderto ensure the satisfaction of the humanitarian civilian needsof our people. However  despite the sustained efforts thathave been made  such efforts have failed to reach anappropriate solution  a solution free of the objectives of thebiased political programme through the pressures broughtto bear by the United States. One of the major ironiesduring those talks was that the oil and banking experts whowere part of the United Nations delegation did acknowledgethat the arrangements adopted in the two said resolutionswere not at all customary in the oil and banking fields.Could it be deemed reasonable by anyone involved inthe oil industry that the signing of an oil-export contractshould require no less than 30 procedural steps? DoMembers realize that the banking arrangements stipulatedby the two resolutions totally ignore the existence of adeveloped banking sector in Iraq? Do Members realize thata simple contract for the importation of food or medicinerequires no fewer than 20 bureaucratic steps in order forthose goods to reach Iraq  and that even after their arrivalthey are subject to monitoring by hundreds of UnitedNations monitors from the time they leave the Iraqi borderuntil they reach the consumer? This is the true story ofresolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Those tworesolutions were never intended to meet the humanitarianneeds of the people of Iraq.In the course of the Security Council’s periodicreviews  which take place every 60 days and the latest ofwhich took place on 14 September last  the United Statesfalsely accused Iraq on various counts in order to justify itsposition of delaying the lifting of sanctions indefinitely.We find it useful to refer to some examples of theseaccusations so that the General Assembly may see thepicture clearly.The United States charges that Iraq’s cooperation withthe Security Council has been sporadic  selective andopportunistic. This is a baseless accusation. It is wellknown that Iraq agreed to comply with the relevantresolutions of the Security Council and sought persistentlyto implement their provisions correctly and legally. Webelieve that the majority of the members of the SecurityCouncil do not join the United States in its accusation.The United States also charges that Iraq’s recordwith respect to the implementation of its obligations inthe area of proscribed weapons was a partial and grudgingacquiescence to United Nations demands. The facts however  prove otherwise. This is made clear in thereports of the Special Commission and the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency  especially those issued since July1993. The latest of those reports  circulated in documentS/1994/860  states “The Special Commission and the IAEA notedwith appreciation the constructive cooperationreceived from Iraq and the efforts made by thecompetent Iraqi authorities in the conduct of theirtasks.” (S/1994/860  para. 6)Another accusation is that the Government of Iraq cut offelectricity from certain areas in the northern IraqiGovernorates. Those who make this accusation ignore thefact that the comprehensive embargo imposed upon Iraqdoes not make sufficient financial resources available tothe Government to import spare parts and equipment forensuring the maintenance of electrical service in thecountry. Moreover  the accusers are the very ones whoconstantly object in the sanctions Committee to Iraqirequests for importing material with which to maintain theelectricity grid  in the event we have some resourcesavailable to that end.The United States also accuses the Government ofIraq of draining the marshes in the southern part of thecountry in pursuit of a political programme aimed againstthe population of the area. According to the allegation this action destroys their cultural heritage and causesharm to the environment. I say that this accusation  likethe others  is baseless. It is utterly at odds with the senseof objectivity expected of a permanent member of theSecurity Council.The truth is that the Government of Iraq carried outextensive irrigation projects in the southern part of thecountry  including the area of the marshes  in order toreduce salinity in the water and soil  which is a problemin central and southern Iraq  thereby increasing theamount of arable land. The planning for these projectsgoes back to the days of the Rehabilitation Board in thefifties. American  British  French  German  Dutch Russian and Canadian companies and consultantsparticipated in drawing up and revising the plans and  inpart  in their implementation.18General Assembly 22nd meetingAfter the imposition of the comprehensive blockadethe competent Iraqi authorities completed the projects bythemselves. One of the ironies of the situation is that theprincipal proponent of draining the marshes of southernIraq in the fifties was an American expert working for theIraqi Board. It is also ironic that one of the rivers in thearea is still called the Dutch River because a Dutchcompany carried out a project there.I have been prompted to mention some of theaccusations levelled at Iraq in order to shed light on thereal situation and the fabrications and falsifications used aspretexts to prolong the iniquitous blockade against us. Butit is even more important to refer to some glaring examplesof the conduct of those who accuse us  to wit  the UnitedStates of America.The United States  the State that is so concerned withrespect for Security Council resolutions  imposes two no-flyzones in the north and the south of Iraq without anyauthorization from the Security Council or any legitimatejustification under international law. The United StatesAdministration  which pretends to be so concerned over therights of the Kurds in Iraq  was the very party thatprevented the leaders of the Kurds from honouring anagreement that  after four months of dialogue  was freelyentered into with the Government of Iraq in 1991. TheUnited States Administration stated openly that thatagreement would have strengthened the authority of thepresent national Government in Iraq  which was contrary tothe United States objective of changing that Government.Is this attitude in harmony with the Security Councilresolutions that provide for respect of sovereignty and theachievement of international peace and security and stabilityin the region? Is it acceptable  under the resolutions of theSecurity Council  for that Administration to obstruct theoperation of flights transporting pilgrims from a friendlyMuslim State to Iraq’s sacred religious shrines under thepretext that a number of politicians from that State wereamong the pilgrims? That very Administration alsoobstructed  under flimsy pretexts  the aerial shipment ofmeat from the Sudan to Iraq.Lastly in this connection  I should like to affirm thatIraq expressed  in the words of its leader  President SaddamHussein  its sincere desire to turn a new leaf with itsneighbouring Arab countries in order to establish relationsbased on the Charter of the League of Arab States  theCharter of the United Nations and on the basis of mutualrespect for one another’s sovereignty and regard for eachother’s interests. However  it is well known to all that theUnited States Administration is the party that obstructsthose efforts and brings pressure to bear on the States ofthe region to prevent dialogue with Iraq. The article byUnited States Secretary of State Warren Christopherpublished in The New York Times last April is  webelieve  the most telling evidence in that respect.Despite the harshness of the Security Council’sresolutions concerning Iraq  we have implemented manyof their provisions fully. We are legally and correctlycontinuing with the implementation of whateverprovisions remain in the relevant resolutions. Within thisprocess  we are also prepared to satisfy and allay theconcerns of the members of the Security Council ofwhich we have become aware in our contacts  althoughsome of them have been introduced in legally irrelevantcontexts.In the meantime  however  we wonder: is it the dutyof the State in question under the Charter to implementthe provisions of the Security Council resolutions adoptedunder Chapter VII  without expecting any counter-obligations from the Council to implement the sameprovisions? The just  legal view is that resolutions of theCouncil adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter arebinding upon the State in question and all other States particularly the members of the Security Council  andeven more particularly the Permanent Members of theSecurity Council. This  undoubtedly  is the rule of theCharter. It is therefore a foregone conclusion that themembers of the Security Council  and especially itsPermanent Members  should be keener than any other toabide by the resolutions they themselves adopt. However the facts of the situation now are that one PermanentMember  namely the United States of America  ispersistently obstructing any steps towards the correct legalapplication of the resolutions of the Council  particularlythose provisions relating to the lifting of sanctions fromIraq  and is conducting itself on the basis of biasedpolitical motives that bear no relation to either theresolutions of the Council or the Charter.The General Assembly is the general organ entrustedwith deliberating on the world Organization as a wholeunder the Charter. Under the Charter  Member Stateshave conferred on the Security Council the primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peaceand security  and have agreed that in carrying out itsduties under this responsibility  the Security Council actson their behalf  in accordance with the Purposes andPrinciples of the United Nations Charter. Consequently under the Charter  the members of the Security Council 19General Assembly 22nd meetingboth individually and collectively  bear the jointresponsibility of the membership of the Organization. Thecollectivity of membership  as represented by the GeneralAssembly  does not  on the basis of the delegation ofpower  lose the right to seek  through all available means the correction of any failure that might arise in performingthat responsibility.Proceeding from this  we request that the members ofthe Security Council  the General Assembly and theinternational community as a whole look into the iniquitousand illegitimate situation in which one or two PermanentMembers obstruct the correct legal application of theresolutions of the Security Council and consequentlycontinue to impose upon the Iraqi people  a nation ofancient history  cruel suffering afflicting all aspects ofhuman life.It is within Iraq’s right to demand strongly that thisiniquitous and illegitimate situation be changed as soon aspossible and to seek full clarification of the position of theSecurity Council on its just demands."
"81",3390,"ISL",49,1994,"May I congratulate ForeignMinister Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. I am confident that he will steer our work to asuccessful conclusion  and I pledge him the full support ofmy delegation.I wish also to take this opportunity to express myGovernment’s satisfaction that South Africa  which nowtakes its place as a full and respected member of thecommunity of nations  has been reinstated in the GeneralAssembly.It is a much-vaunted truth that the end of the cold warhas released the United Nations from the bondage of aworld obsessed with military security. But there is anotherchange at work - perhaps less abrupt but equallyepoch-making - in the international system which has far-reaching implications for our world Organization. I referto the progressive intertwining of the destinies of thedifferent peoples of the world  the globalization of theworld economy  the communications revolution and theincreasingly transnational nature of the issues of humansurvival  be they environmental problems  poverty refugees or population pressures  and the eroding capacityof the nation-State to address them single-handedly.Global interdependence is causing greater demandsto be made on the United Nations than at any previoustime. The will to cooperate is gradually replacing thespirit of confrontation throughout the world. At the sametime  it is not clear that we have created an organizationequal to the task of meeting the host of new demands.Though adept at analysing their sources  we are stillinclined to deal with conflicts only after they arise insteadof preventing them. The dangers we face may be novel but the structures we draw on to cope with them derivefrom a world that has largely vanished from view. Lastbut not least  we saddle the United Nations with newresponsibilities without providing adequate resources totackle them. In this way  a discrepancy has come aboutbetween our expectations of the United Nations and theability to deliver on them.While our main challenge should be to seek totransform the United Nations into a more effectiveinstrument for dealing with issues that truly are beyondthe compass of the nation-State  we should also bear inmind that the United Nations was not designed to be asubstitute for national Governments. Wherever possiblethe United Nations should work with its Member Statesin areas where they are competent and draw to themaximum extent possible on regional organizations. Inso doing  we reduce the burden on the United Nations andfacilitate the setting of priorities.Looked at in this perspective  a number ofdevelopments over the past 12 months give the UnitedNations reason for encouragement. Democracy and theprinciples of the free market are making new inroads  andthe protection of human rights is gaining momentum inmany parts of the world. In Eastern Europe the processof democratic change is now irreversible. The negotiatedwithdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States hasremoved from the European continent one of the lastvestiges of the cold war. In Northern Ireland there is forthe first time since early this century a realistic chance oflasting peace and stability. In the Middle East thebreakthrough achieved last year has been consolidatedwith the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and a peace accordbetween Israel and Jordan  hopefully paving the way fora comprehensive peace settlement in the entire region.18In South Africa  the spirit of dialogue has finallytriumphed over the forces of hatred and racism  offering amodel of tolerance for other countries on the troubledAfrican continent. In Western Sahara  there are brighteningprospects  provided that all the relevant parties do their partin creating the necessary climate of confidence to enablethe people of Western Sahara to decide their own destinyin a democratic election.But there have also been setbacks. Gross violations ofhuman rights have continued in places as far apart as Haitiand East Timor. The tragic injustice in the formerYugoslavia  the chaos in Somalia  as well as the terriblecarnage inflicted on the people of Rwanda by their owncompatriots  demonstrate the intractable nature of many ofthe conflicts that our Organization is being called upon todeal with. Unlike the inter-State conflicts whichtraditionally have preoccupied the United Nations  these areconflicts taking place within the confines of the nation-State  where legitimate authority has either collapsed orbeen emaciated by civil strife. As the Organization adaptsitself to the new demands of the post-cold-war era  waysmust be found to address such internal crises in fullconformity with the United Nations Charter.To heed this call  greater attention must now beconcentrated on the preventive dimension. Much effort hasin recent years been devoted to peace-keeping  which nowextends to non-military operations  including electoralassistance  the provision of humanitarian relief and humanrights monitoring. This is as it should be  and countriescontributing substantially to such peace-keeping operationscertainly deserve both our gratitude and respect. At thesame time  we must make sure that the necessary resourcesare also allocated to development.One of the lessons we have learned in recent years isthat we must focus more intently on the link between peaceand development. Increasingly  we have come tounderstand that peace and security require solutions tosocial and economic problems  that without developmentthere can be no peace. In this connection  I wish to payspecial tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  whose agenda for development  submittedtwo years after his pathbreaking Agenda for Peace  hassharpened our awareness of the need for creating aninfrastructure of peace.For there to be a stable and lasting infrastructure ofpeace  a number of elements must be in place: acommitment to democracy and respect for human rights  asound social fabric  a growing economy and a sustainablenatural environment.As a representative of one of the world’s oldestdemocracies — one which celebrates the fiftiethanniversary of its second republic this year — I cannot beaccused of underrating the redeeming virtues ofdemocracy  which  as was pointed out earlier in thisdebate  fosters the greatest force behind social andeconomic progress: individual creativity. Democracies as a rule  also tend to honour human rights. Bypromoting tolerance and respect for the dignity of theindividual  we contribute to preventing cultural  ethnicand territorial conflicts. For good reason  human rightsare therefore increasingly being considered as an integralpart of the notion of extended security. It is thus to beregretted that the efforts of the United Nations in thisimportant field continue to be strained due to lack offinancial resources.The effective implementation and monitoring ofhuman rights standards  not least with respect tovulnerable groups  should be a matter of priority for theUnited Nations. The plight of children in some parts ofthe world gives cause for grave concern. Four years ago the largest gathering of world political leaders assembledhere in this Hall of the General Assembly and endorsedthe principle that children should have the first call on theresources of society essential to their survival  protectionand development. Next year we will assess how far wehave come in honouring the commitments undertaken bythe Summit for Children. At the same time we will becelebrating the half-centenary of the United Nations. Inthe view of my Government  this milestone event shouldbe used to give new impetus to efforts to ensure thatchildren are given the best social conditions the worldcommunity can offer.As it happens  the fiftieth anniversary celebrationswill coincide with the Beijing Conference on the status ofwomen. The timing is significant as the goals ofachieving equality  empowerment and security for womenare key to the social agenda of the United Nations as itmakes the transition into its second half-century.Improving the status of women is of paramountimportance for the well-being of the family  and haspositive multiplier effects on overall levels of education health and population growth in society as a whole.Conversely  where society has broken down or socialsafety-nets are inadequate  women assume the largestburden. There is therefore a direct link between the19Fourth World Conference on Women  the recentInternational Conference on Population and Developmentheld in Cairo and the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  to be held in Copenhagen next spring. TheCopenhagen summit will afford us a much neededopportunity to focus attention on the social ills thatcompromise the ability of nations to develop their fullpotential  be they poverty or disease  homelessness orhunger  joblessness or social exclusion  crime or violence.Fifty years after the United Nations avowed in its Charterto promote social progress and better standards of living ingreater freedom  the time has come to put sustainablehuman development at the top of the Organization’sagenda.In relieving the plight of the most underprivilegedsegments of the world’s population  the role of economicgrowth can hardly be overstated. The abolition of tradebarriers is the single most important factor for worldeconomic growth. Just as a rising tide lifts the boats  so anincrease in world trade will create new jobs and raiseincomes around the world. My Government thereforestrongly welcomes the establishment of the World TradeOrganization and urges other signatory States to ratify theUruguay-Round Agreement without undue delay.Focusing on economic progress must not  however blind us to the need to keep an eye on other areas  which if neglected  might strip us of the harvest of increasedprosperity. One such area is the environment. Over thepast few years the United Nations has made significantheadway in its efforts to promote sustainable developmentworldwide. The results of the Rio Conference onEnvironment and development provide a sound basis forfurther work. As we now assume the momentous task ofdevelopment  measures must also be taken to protect theenvironment from detrimental patterns of production andconsumption.While recognizing the need to take a balanced view ofthe ecosystem as a whole  Iceland remains particularlyconcerned over the deteriorating condition of the world’soceans. It is a hopeful sign that the internationalcommunity has shown increasing awareness of theimportance of the sustainable utilization of the livingresources of the sea. It has been estimated that the pooresttwo-thirds of the world’s population get about 40 percent oftheir protein from fish  and that food production must morethan double just to keep pace with the growth in demand inthe decades ahead. To meet this growth  it will benecessary to rely not only on agriculture but also - and toan increasing extent - on the sustainable utilization of theliving resources of the sea.Such considerations notwithstanding  the ecosystemof the sea is now in greater danger than ever before frompollution and overfishing. Protecting the oceans againstthe repercussions of economic and industrial expansionwill pose a major challenge to the internationalcommunity in the years ahead. Although much has beenaccomplished  existing conventions aimed at containingthe pollution of the marine environment cover only a partof the problem  as no global scheme addressing pollutionfrom land-based activities is in place. For this reason Iceland attaches great importance to the Conference onthe Protection of the Marine Environment fromLand-based Activities  to be convened in Washington nextyear under the auspices of the United NationsEnvironment Programme. We urge all States and relevantinternational agencies to participate actively in thepreparatory process  commencing officially in Reykjavikin March next year.The responsible use of fisheries resources is however  no less important than combatting the threat ofmarine pollution. The universal acceptance of thesovereignty of the coastal State over its adjacent waterswas a necessary precondition of the effective managementby the world community of the living resources of thesea. The application of the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea  which extended the rule of law toover two thirds of the Earth’s surface  has contributedmore than any single undertaking to the furtherance ofthat goal. Against this background  Iceland particularlywelcomes the fact that this Convention  a crowningachievement in the progressive development ofinternational law under the auspices of the UnitedNations  will come into force in only a few weeks’ time.My country remains strongly committed to theestablishment of an international regime governing allaspects of the utilization of living marine resources including the high seas. For this reason  Iceland hasactively supported the drafting of a legally binding andcomprehensive instrument that would ensure the effectivemanagement and conservation of fisheries outside theeconomic zone of the coastal State. In Iceland’s view this goal could best be achieved by establishing regionalfisheries management organizations or arrangements opento States with legitimate interests in the relevant fisheries.Such provisions should not  however  be understood asimplying approval of existing forms of cooperation based in some instances  on unilateral decisions by a few States20aimed at excluding other neighbouring States notwithstanding the latter’s overwhelming dependence onand proximity to the fisheries in question. Indeed unjustified discrimination would defeat the very aim ofestablishing a new high seas fisheries regime for the benefitof all nations.The global challenge of development calls for boldnew thinking  backed by the solid commitment of theinternational community to the goals enshrined in theUnited Nations Charter. It also demands that we try toestablish consensus on the restructuring and reform of ourOrganization in the near future. Efforts must be made toimprove the representational capacity and efficiency of theSecurity Council and at the same time preserve theconstitutional balance between the various organs of theOrganization  not least between the Council and the GeneralAssembly.We find ourselves on the threshold of a new era. Yet we are far from having rid ourselves completely of thelegacy of the cold war  which includes immense quantitiesof armaments and the technology for producing them. Itwould certainly be disastrous if the recent transformation ofthe international security environment were to beundermined by the growing proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction.In this connection  my Government deems it of theutmost importance that the Convention on chemicalweapons enter into force next year and that the Conventionon Biological Weapons be further reinforced. In addition the indefinite and unconditional extension of thenon-proliferation Treaty would be the single mostsignificant measure against the proliferation of nuclearweapons. This should be followed up by universaladherence to the nuclear-test moratorium and the conclusionof a comprehensive test-ban treaty.As we inaugurate the second half-century of theUnited Nations  what better gift could the community ofnations bestow on itself? And in what better way could wemake a clean break with the cold war era?"
"82",3437,"ISR",49,1994,"I should like to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. We are pleased that the representative of Côted’Ivoire - a nation for which Israel has high regard - hasbeen elected to this distinguished post. I should like toexpress to the Secretary General our deepest appreciation13for his contribution to world peace in general  and to peacein the Middle East in particular.A year ago  I offered a concept for a new MiddleEast. Many applauded; more remained sceptical. What atthat time seemed lofty is today a reality. I feel I cansubmit today an invitation to a further journey in the newMiddle East.Last year was a year of remarkable events. ThePalestinian people  as a result of our agreement  gainedauthority in Gaza and Jericho; Jordan and Israel agreed  inthe Washington Declaration  to end the state of war andmove towards an agreement of full peace; voices ofpromise are exchanged between Damascus and Jerusalem;multilateral meetings produced a network of regionalcooperation; Morocco and Israel established formalrelations; and an agenda for a new Middle East will emergefrom an unprecedented economic conference in Casablancanext month.The desire for peace is rooted in the millenniums ofJewish existence. Generations prayed for it  and now ayoung generation in Israel is today engaged in making it.The search for peace is shared by young people all over theMiddle East  Arabs and Israelis alike. We have to fulfiltheir hope.I am addressing this Assembly for the first time  notas a party to a controversy  but as a representative of acountry that has shown a capacity to solve conflicts thatseemed insoluble.The United Nations should play an increasing rolefacing the changing times. It can define new destinies. Itcan adopt new means.As the United Nations celebrates its fiftiethanniversary  it may adopt models for new endeavours bymobilizing builders to construct peace  not just bydeploying troops to keep it. Economic structures will offermore than military deployment.Gaza  as an example  has a new authority. It needs anew economy. The United Nations can provide an answer.The 7 000 years of Gaza are mainly a history of suffering.Its population density today is among the highest in theworld.There is a role for the United Nations in Gaza  and ithas played one. It began by stationing troops - which wererecalled  unfortunately  on the eve of the Six-Day War.Then UNRWA came and supplied food  health andeducation to the refugees. Then UNDP contributedgreatly to the construction of an infrastructure in the GazaStrip.The United Nations can help Gaza today becomefree from want. It can introduce there the necessaryeconomic and proper social institutions. An enlargedallocation for Gaza  with the existing United Nationsadministration  will produce immediate results and maymake Gaza a new model of United Nations endeavours.The world is moving from military might to socialpriorities. It is time to turn from political confrontationto economic cooperation. In the Middle East  economicgrowth can compensate for political compromises.We no longer live in a closed world. The intensiveflow of information has opened the eyes of many people.No longer can tyranny blind their perceptions. Ironcurtains can no longer bar the spread of the true story.Knowledge has finally overcome propaganda.This current is profound and lasting. The sources ofstrength and wealth are today universal rather thannational  intellectual rather than material. The size of theterritory  the number of its people  the wealth of its rawmaterials  no longer decide the fate of a nation. It is thescope of education  the level of science  appliedtechnology and up-to-date information that make all thedifference.Intellectual sources are no longer partitioned bytraditional divides. Science has no territorial limits.Technology has no national flags. Information can travelwithout visas. Armies cannot conquer wisdom. Borderscannot protect knowledge. The talent of creation isreplacing the strategies of destruction. Computers  notrifles  mark the difference. The hunting season in historyis disappearing.This does not mean an end to agonies. Starvation disease  terrorism  desertification  nuclear weapons ecological damage and dangerous drugs overflow theboundaries of land and the boundaries of reason.Violence employs new tactics: it has notdisappeared. Confrontations in the future may notnecessarily be wars of conquest  but bloodshed of protest.14The strong know that they will not be strengthened bydominating the poor  or by owning their deserts. The poorcannot  and will not  comply with their conditions  toleratedby the indifference of the well-off.Existing institutions were initiated in a different time.They are based today on memories rather than on needs.Ministries of foreign affairs and defence were structured toconfront enemies. Now we face dangers more thanenemies  but without our being organized to handle them.We are not answering the need. Diplomacy and strategyshould be mobilized to face the undefined dangers. Diseasewill not be overcome by traditional diplomatic démarches.Starvation cannot be eliminated by guns. Deserts will notbloom beneath air raids. Remedies will not arrive of theirown accord: they should be invented and introduced.Israel is on the side of this tendency. We arecommitted to ending the conflicts. We are determined touproot their causes. We do not intend to stop thismomentum or allow its interruption.For the last five decades the mere existence of Israelhas served as a temptation to try and destroy it. For half acentury we had to give security top priority. To this veryday  we shed tears on the tombs of our children  who paidwith their young lives to overcome the menace. Whenwars became futile  suspicion succeeded fighting. Theallegation was that Israel was trying to expand territoriallyand was unwilling to compromise geographically. Realityended this allegation as well.Egypt  first to negotiate peace  found an Israel willingto exchange land for peace. The Palestinians  next in line gained jurisdiction over territories they had never controlledbefore. With Jordan  we agreed to delineate a permanentborder without one side encroaching on the land of theother. Syria was told at the outset of negotiations that thenature of peace would affect the depth of the withdrawal.Lebanon was told that Israel had no demands on itsterritory and no intention of compromising its integrity.Negotiations have not been easy. With thePalestinians  we negotiated on uncharted ground. Neverhad the Palestinian people experienced self-rule. Todaythey possess a territorial address and an administrativeauthority. For the first time in their history  their children’seducation is solely in Palestinian hands. In the coming daysIsrael will hand over additional responsibilities to thePalestinian Authority. The Declaration of Principles will befully implemented in the spirit and letter. We shall supporta Palestinian readiness to hold democratic elections.Israel  as well as the Palestinians  may discover thatPalestinian democracy and Israeli security arecomplementary. We have demonstrated that we are truein our moral choice not to govern the destiny of anotherpeople.We shall continue to negotiate with Syria. We arenegotiating out of conviction  not weakness  and we hopeto conclude the negotiations with a settlement that willrespect the interests of both sides  without harming Syriandignity or compromising Israeli security. Syria insists ona narrow path for the negotiations  postponing meetingsbetween the leaders and thus slowing the pace ofnegotiations. Israel is ready for accelerated negotiations.We address the Syrians by saying: ""Let us talk face toface. Let us negotiate  as proclaimed in Damascus  withcourage to attain a peace of honour. By ending suspicion introducing creativity and allowing flexibility  we cantransform a promising climate into a solid terrain."" Syriadeclared its strategy for peace. We appreciate it.Military threats and territorial positions should betransformed by security arrangements  diplomatic rapport full peace and economic endeavours. That will erode themotivation for conflict. Without peaceful relations balances of power are meaningless. The range ofunderstanding can serve as the only answer to the rangeof ballistic missiles.President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopherare relentlessly pushing for peace. European  Russian andmany other leaders are genuinely supportive. ImportantMiddle Eastern leaders are actively engaged in the samedirection. Still  much depends on direct negotiations.Yesterday’s enemies  tomorrow’s partners  should becometoday’s interlocutors.A peace treaty between Israel and Syria mayproduce a historic result greater than just an agreementbetween two countries. It may well become the crowningof a comprehensive peace. It may become an opportunityfor the leaders of the region - Kings  Presidents  PrimeMinisters  supported by the most prominent leaders of ourtime - to gather and announce the end of the conflict andto proclaim full peace throughout the region.Peace can hardly emerge from stinginess. Bydefinition  it calls for generosity. Peace is more than amere ceremony. It requires ongoing maintenance; itawaits a passionate cultivation of new relations. We hopethat our neighbours  from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon  fromDjibouti to Algeria  will become constructive partners in15it. Dark clouds are still hanging over the horizon - theshadows of missed opportunities.We have to build a coalition to prevent subversiveturbulence from undermining legitimate Governments andharassing the stability needed for the inflow of investment.All countries of the Middle East face a choice: to remainpolitically divided and economically stagnant or to becomeeconomically advanced and politically just.A high standard of living for the people - all people -is the best promise for stability in our midst. Israel iswilling to participate in achieving it. There are sceptics  weknow  who do not believe that the Middle East is ripe fora common market similar to the European one. They forgetthat Europe did not do it in one leap. It started with aCommunity of coal and steel. We can start with acommunity of water and tourism.Nor do they believe that the Middle East is ready fora free trade zone like the one in North America. Yet theNorth American Free Trade Agreement emerged in a shortwhile as a success by linking geographic proximity witheconomic growth. Those sceptics claim that generations areneeded to cement a new market in the Middle East. Well they can see what in 10 short years happened to Asiancountries  which attained unpredicted prosperity. Theyachieved it by adopting a market economy.The profile of a market economy is clear. It is madeof comprehensive education  open borders  free movement science-based industries and competitive trade. A marketeconomy is a fabric woven from political silk and durablethreads of welfare. The time is ripe for its rendezvous withthe Middle East.At the end of October  under the presidency of KingHassan II  we shall take the first step to implement aregional design. We shall try to establish instruments fordevelopment: a regional bank  channels for privateinvestment and a framework for regional planning. Thewealth of the Middle East should be convinced to remainat home. Over the last decade it has invested the betterpart of its fortunes abroad. Homebound wealth will attractforeign investment as well.We should cut the enormous expense - $70 billionannually - of the arms race. The savings can be directed todevelopment. The arms race can be reduced only byregional consent. No single country will do it alone.To transform the region and make it a stable andattractive place we need the emergence of the region asa whole  committed to a new future. Nature  and notonly politics  calls for it. The waters  the winds  theenvironment call for regional responsibility andcooperation  for desalinization plants  energy stations highways  railways  runways  piers  telecommunicationnetworks  high-tech industries  tourism infrastructure banking systems  computer terminals and ecologicalconsiderations - a landscape that will meet the future willcreate a state of prosperity  and it is a regional challenge.The Middle East was the cradle of civilization andhas a capacity to contribute. It experienced golden ages economically and culturally. It should be our collectiveambition to make it happen again and to make it happensoon. Today  shortages can be bridged rapidly.Computers can carry children not only from grade tograde but from age to age. The software of knowledgewill better replace the hardware of weapons.I have served my country since its birth. I havelearned that complex problems call for unconventionalsolutions. I feel that over the past year we have won alicence to build a new Middle East  to make it part of theglobe in its new age  free of wars  free of enemies  freeof terrorism; a Middle East which will be nuclear-free missile-free  hunger-free  discrimination-free  tyranny-free;a constituency of peace  a domain of freedom  a land ofprosperity. There is a morning awaiting us after a longnight  calling us to direct our energies and our aims andour prayers towards that great opportunity."
"83",3484,"ITA",49,1994,"Mr. President  I am delightedto begin by congratulating you and your country  Côted’Ivoire  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at this session. I also wish to thank yourdistinguished predecessor  Ambassador Insanally.Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate theSovereign Military Order of Malta on its admission toObserver status in the General Assembly.My statement fully endorses and follows on that ofthe German Foreign Minister  who spoke in his capacityas Chairman of the European Council.6From the very beginning of its membership in theUnited Nations Italy’s foreign policy has been guided by itsactive support for the Organization’s principles andfunctions. Our contributions to United Nationsdeliberations  peace-keeping operations and aid throughmultilateral channels are tangible proof of Italy’s faith inthe project drawn up at San Francisco almost 50 years ago.Our newly elected Government will remain steadfastin this approach to supporting the United Nations andbuilding upon the historic opportunities offered by the newinternational situation. Let me emphasize that  now morethan ever  Italy is firmly committed to fostering personal political  and economic freedom  protecting individual rightsand liberties and enforcing the rule of law. These are thepreconditions for peace and prosperity and the reasons whyItaly is presenting its candidature to the Security Councilfor the period 1995-1996.Unfortunately  the hopes that were kindled by the endof the cold war  with its promises of peace and stability have not been met in international reality. At the sametime  there is little doubt that today we are facing fewerglobal risks  despite local conflicts  intolerance and racialand ethnic strife. It is thus our task to embark on a newage of cooperation  democracy and development  in whichthe United Nations must play a central role. Today  theGeneral Assembly can become the link betweenexpectations and commitment.Italy will continue to play its part in peace-keeping  asit is already doing in eight different missions  includinglogistical support for the operation in former Yugoslaviaand training centres and permanent bases for peace-keepingforces on its territory. The new United Nations base inBrindisi is particularly significant in this regard.However  we cannot ignore the high costs of theproliferation of primarily internal conflicts. The budget forpeace-keeping operations currently amounts toapproximately $3 billion  three times the regular budget ofthe Organization. The Presidency of the European Unionhas noted this particular aspect of peace-keeping operations.We must strengthen preventive diplomacy in order to avoidover-extending our capabilities  becoming ineffective andrisking financial collapse.In the wake of the crisis in Rwanda  my Governmentis promoting the establishment of a task force for rapidintervention in humanitarian emergencies. This matter isnow being considered in the appropriate forums and theresults will be presented to the United Nations. I welcomethe support expressed for an emergency humanitarianinstrument by the Presidents of the United States  theRussian Federation and Argentina  and believe that ourideas and proposals follow the same orientation.Entrusting peace-keeping functions to regionalorganizations is another option for crisis management.My Government has moved consistently in this directionat the national level and in its capacity asChairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE).Italy attaches particular importance to an effectiveand efficient functioning of the Security Council. Thematter of equitable representation on the Security Counciland of increasing its membership requires thoroughexamination. To this end  Italy has submitted one of themost realistic and comprehensive proposals to the Ad HocWorking Group. We hope that the General Assemblywill reach a consensus on the methods and timetable fora truly equitable reform.Many members question whether the pre-eminencethe Organization has given to peace-keeping in recentyears has not drained the other fundamental objectives ofthe United Nations - namely  economic and socialdevelopment - of initiative and resources. TheSecretary-General has wisely acknowledged theseconcerns in his recent agenda for development.Mr. Seniloli (Fiji)  Vice-President  took the Chair.As that document states  peace is only one of thedimensions of development. The others are the economy the environment  justice and democracy. To the extentthat democracy protects and promotes personal liberty andeconomic freedom  it has a decisive impact ondevelopment by encouraging the strongest force behindeconomic growth and personal development - individualcreativity. A prosperous democracy will be free of theinternal tensions that have caused so many of today’sconflicts. The United Nations will foster a more peacefulworld by promoting freedom and justice in addition tocontinuing its peace-keeping functions.In today’s world  the issue of trade is of paramountimportance. As I like to say  trade unites us; politicsdivides us. At the Naples Summit  Italy  in its presentcapacity as Chairman of the G-7  strongly advocated thefurther dismantling of barriers to world trade in order tofoster the creation of wealth. We are convinced that theleaders of the free world must avoid squandering theunique opportunity for world peace and prosperity offered7by current historic developments. They must resist thepressure of interest groups and be ready to serve thegeneral interests of their nations and the nations of theworld  which today more than ever require the opening ofmarkets and the liberalization of trade. This will be therole of the World Trade Organization.In this spirit  we endorse the principles of the agendafor development and are ready to help establish theguidelines for their implementation. The fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations Charter will provide anopportunity for fostering such a process.I should now like to address the United NationsGeneral Assembly in my capacity as Chairman-in-Office ofthe CSCE. We are actively promoting peaceful solutionsto several regional crises. In the former Yugoslavia we areengaged in restoring long-term missions  appointingOmbudsmen for the Bosnian Federation  instituting a CSCEmission in Sarajevo and admitting The Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia to the CSCE.We have lent our good offices to Ukraine  where aCSCE mission will be instituted  and to Georgia for thecrises in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The CSCEPresidency has also worked towards facilitating thewithdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States andfinding a solution to the problems of citizenship and statusof non-citizens in that area. Through the local CSCEmissions  the CSCE Presidency is also attempting to fostera political solution to the Moldova-Trans-Dniester andTajikistan crises  while it actively supports the efforts of theChairman of the Conference on Nagorny Karabakh Ambassador Eliasson.At the 1992 Helsinki Summit the CSCE declared itselfto be a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of theUnited Nations Charter and adopted specific guidelines onpeace-keeping. The ministerial meetings in Stockholm andRome led to the United Nations-CSCE FrameworkAgreement in March 1993 and to the CSCE’s being grantedobserver status at the United Nations. My recent letter tothe Secretary-General on developing and strengtheningcooperation between the CSCE and the United Nations wasa follow-up to these decisions  as was the establishment ofrelations between the CSCE and numerous United Nationsagencies working in areas of common concern. Onespecific proposal is to attribute primary responsibility to theCSCE for issues concerning stability and security in itsarea  without impinging on the statutory powers of theSecurity Council.Peace-keeping is an area that requires closercooperation. The two Organizations should adopt astandard set of principles for the peace-keeping activitiesundertaken by individual States or third parties.I should like to address the European Presidency’sstatement and memorandum on our current internationalpolicies  limiting myself to those issues which moreclosely concern Italy for historical and geographicalreasons.Italy warmly welcomes the acceptance by theCroatian-Muslim federation and the Serbian-Montenegranfederation of the peace plan submitted to them on 6 July.That plan provides a realistic solution to territorialdisputes and constitutional issues and ensures that Bosniaand Herzegovina will retain its international identity.Unfortunately  the repeated rejection of the plan by theBosnian Serb leadership is a source of deepdisappointment. This has made tougher sanctions againstPale inevitable in order to force it to reconsider itsposition.The partial lifting of sanctions against Belgrade which we have advocated from the beginning  willencourage the Serbian Government to pursue its new more constructive policy. This includes the agreement toallow international monitors to ensure the effectivesealing of the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In ourongoing commitment to find a solution to the intractablecrisis in Bosnia  we have been trying to involve otherimportant international forums  starting with the G-7 enlarged to include Russia  in joint efforts to foster apolitical solution.With regard to the Middle East  Italy welcomed thesigning of the Cairo Accords  concluded on 4 May  whichauthorized the start of self-government in Gaza andJericho. We also salute the subsequent transfer to thePalestinian authorities of jurisdiction over the issuescovered in the Washington Agreements. Italy is pleasedto have contributed to the resumption of negotiations thatled to the Cairo Accords  through our participation in theinternational temporary presence in Hebron to implementSecurity Council resolution 904 (1994). Italy reaffirms itscommitment to contributing politically and economicallyto the reconstruction of the Palestinian territories. TheIsraeli-Jordan Accords of 25 July represent a milestone inthe construction of a new Middle East on the basis ofpeace and cooperation. We hope that all thesedevelopments will stimulate progress in other negotiationsbetween Israel and its neighbours.8In the Mediterranean basin  serious instabilities andtensions are spreading. Italy intends to make its efforts toensure that this region sets an example of tolerance economic cooperation and democracy.As one of the main architects of the peace process inMozambique  Italy is pleased with the progress achieved inrecent months. Elections are now set for 27 and 28October this year. We will continue to collaborate with theUnited Nations and other donor countries in thereconstruction of Mozambique. We also hope that regionalcooperation in southern Africa will help improve economicconditions in Mozambique  thereby strengthening theprocess of peace and democratization. We hope thatMozambique will become another United Nations successstory  like the peace-keeping operations in Namibia Cambodia  El Salvador  Guatemala and elsewhere.We would also like to encourage the trends towardsre-establishing peace in Angola on the basis of the PeaceAccords and the pertinent Security Council resolutions.An area that has seen great progress in recent years isthe further strengthening of disarmament and non-proliferation. The implementation of existing agreementsis a difficult task for our diplomacies  but the drive towardsmore advanced forms of disarmament and arms control isrelentless. We look forward confidently to negotiations toban nuclear testing and to halt the production of fissionablematerial. Progress in this field should also contribute to theindefinite and unconditional extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.With regard to conventional weapons  I wish to takethis opportunity formally to announce the terms of Italy’smoratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines. Themoratorium will apply to all transfers and be applied untilnew international regulations become effective. Thiscommitment imposes an economic cost  but one that mycountry is willing to pay. We urge all Member States toadopt similar national moratoriums until the internationalregime has been finalized.But let us not forget that conflicts  especially internalones  are also created through the violation of fundamentalhuman rights. That is why we are in favour ofstrengthening the mechanisms to monitor and protect thoserights by fully implementing the High Commissioner’smandate and strengthening the Centre for Human Rights.When these rights are seriously violated  despite allefforts  we are in favour of recourse to a fair judicialprocess. In the same spirit with which we welcomed andcontributed to the International Tribunal on crimescommitted in the former Yugoslavia  we support thecreation of an international criminal court for theadjudication of all violations of human rights  whereverthey may occur. This court must be allowed to inflict theappropriate punishment  with the exception of the deathpenalty  which Italy has consistently opposed. We areparticularly pleased that  after years of hard work  theInternational Law Commission has completed a draftstatute for the court  and look forward to contributing tothe Assembly’s debate on the matter.The strengthening of international security is closelyrelated to the fight against terrorism and organized crime.From 21 to 23 November this year  Italy will be hostingin Naples the ministerial World Conference on OrganizedTransnational Crime  under the auspices of the CrimePrevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the UnitedNations.Italy is also actively participating in the preparationof the World Summit for Social Development  to be heldin Copenhagen in March 1995  by contributing itsexperience in the three crucial issues on the agenda:combating poverty  unemployment and discrimination.We live in an exciting but complex world. Few ofus would disagree with the comment of Alfonso the Wise King of Castile  a medieval patron of astronomy  who isquoted as saying  in effect  ""If the Lord Almighty hadconsulted me before embarking on the Creation  I wouldhave recommended something simpler.""While rereading the first address Italy delivered tothis Assembly at the eleventh session  I was deeplymoved  and not only because it was given by my father.Rereading it  it made poignantly clear the far-reachingchanges since 1956  both on the international scene -from decolonization to the end of the cold war - and onthe Italian domestic political scene. In that address  hedefined the United Nations as""the most complete expression of that education ofthe human race  acquired  as Lessing said  throughsuffering and error"". (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Eleventh Session  PlenaryMeetings  588th meeting  para. 94)And today  so many years later  it is an honour forme to reaffirm the same profound conviction and topledge to this Assembly the total dedication of Italy andits Government to the ideals embodied in the UnitedNations Charter."
"84",3530,"JAM",49,1994,"May I  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Jamaica  convey warmestcongratulations to Mr. Amara Essy on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.I wish to assure him of the full support and cooperation ofthe Jamaican delegation in the deliberations on the manyimportant issues before the Assembly.Let me also take this opportunity to congratulateAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on the skilful andinnovative manner in which he presided over the forty-eighth session. We in the Caribbean are justifiably proudof his contributions to the Assembly’s deliberations.Last year I emphasized that the internationalcommunity was at a crossroads where we were faced notonly with matters of economic progress but also with anenvironment full of conflicts and strife. My outlook was and still is  one of optimism  an optimism rooted in therecognition that the old political and military order haspassed and that history has  for the second time in lessthan two generations  provided us with the opportunity toembark on a process of international consensus-building.This is an exciting and daunting task  particularly for asmall island State like Jamaica  whose faith andcommitment to multilateralism and the United Nationsremain unwavering.Our most pressing collective challenge is to makethis Organization a more effective instrument for peaceand development. The United Nations is being calledupon to respond to a host of new challenges  includingemergency humanitarian assistance  peace-keeping peacemaking  development and post-conflict rebuilding.The past year has seen human misery and dislocation offearful proportions in Haiti  on the high seas of theCaribbean  in Rwanda  in the refugee camps of Zaire andTanzania  in Bosnia and in Afghanistan. Their underlyingcauses are political  social and economic. The UnitedNations can and should bring to these and other situationsa broadly encompassing view of the indivisibility ofpolitical  economic and social processes.The Organization and its resources and the will andvision of its Members must be mobilized to address theimperatives of social and economic development. Wemust seek to promote a new era of internationalcooperation for global human security.The global nature of this challenge is inescapable.It has become evident that no State by itself can controlthe spread of environmental degradation and pollution transnational migrations and diseases such the AIDSepidemic. Economic globalization and the accompanyingliberalization of trade and financial flows  now linkdeveloped and developing economies  North and South East and West. Global solutions and coordinatedstrategies must consequently form the basis of ouractions.10General Assembly 22nd meetingGlobalization brings new opportunities  but it alsobrings new dangers. Despite the general trend towardsimproved economic management  economic disparities arewidening. Developing countries are being marginalizedfrom the growth trends in the international economy. Thisis a matter of concern to Jamaica as we  like a largenumber of other developing countries  have placed highdevelopmental priority on export-led growth and onattracting investment flows. Structural adjustmentprogrammes have also been undertaken at great social cost.The contributions of the United Nations and its specializedagencies in areas such as institution-building  povertyalleviation  productivity enhancement  small enterprisedevelopment and financing  and the strengthening of humanresources  continue to be vital elements in enhancing theproductive potential of developing countries. This will  inturn  enable our countries to benefit more fully from and toparticipate more effectively in a liberal and increasinglyorganic global economy.The United Nations must now work vigorouslytowards the implementation of an agenda for development.A meaningful agenda for development must set priorities inprogrammes and resources that respond to the challengesposed by the international environment for developingcountries. These priorities must address all issues to whichadequate multilateral solutions have yet to be found. Theseinclude the burden of debt; inadequate flows of officialdevelopment assistance; the debilitating brain drain; thereverse transfer of resources to multilateral financialinstitutions; the social costs of structural adjustment and thenon-transparent trade barriers and protectionist measuresthat remain in place in industrialized countries against theproducts of developing countries even as the general trendtowards liberalization and trade in goods and services isaccelerating. The agenda must strengthen the role of theUnited Nations in the area of international economic policy-making and coordination. It must seek to enhance therelationship of the United Nations with the Bretton Woodsinstitutions.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the International Monetary Fund and theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development  thetwo Bretton Woods institutions established under theumbrella of the United Nations. I wish to emphasize thatwe should continue to examine the roles and policies ofthese institutions. We must make the changes that fivedecades of experience indicate are necessary so as toimprove the prospects for growth and development ofdeveloping countries — change which can be carried outwithout undermining the health and vitality of theinternational economy or the fiscal integrity of theseinstitutions. Major developed countries should re-examinetheir opposition to the sound proposals for change thathave been put forward repeatedly by developingcountries — proposals that range from increasinginternational liquidity to longer adjustment periods. Overthe years  the International Monetary Fund has movedfrom the supervision of a fixed exchange rate system toassisting developing countries through financial crises while the World Bank has made the transition from post-war reconstruction to funding development in the thirdworld. Now is an opportune time to reassess theirrespective roles  given new global dynamics and changingpatterns of trade and investment. The Fund and the Bankneed to quickly adapt to the current global economicsystem if they are to remain relevant to contemporaryrealities.Two important conferences were held this yearwhich offered opportunities for international attention andaction. In Barbados  the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates adopted a programme of action which now requiresthe support and assistance of the United Nations systemand the donor community for its speedy and effectiveimplementation. The recently concluded InternationalConference on Population and Development in Cairoproduced a landmark document highlighting theinextricable linkage between population  sustainedeconomic growth and sustained development. Next yearin Copenhagen  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment will endeavour to adopt a global approachto the eradication of poverty  the generation of productiveemployment and the enhancement of social integration.We will also meet in Beijing at the Fourth WorldConference on Women to continue to put in placemeasures which will create an enabling environment forwomen. Jamaica will actively participate in theseimportant processes.I have chosen to focus at the outset on what Jamaicasees as the development imperative and priorities of theUnited Nations because we are convinced that the path todevelopment and the path to peace are one and the same.Jamaica fully supports an open  non-discriminatorytrading system governed by transparent rules and with aneffective mechanism for settling disputes. We thereforeawait the implementation of the conclusions of theUruguay Round and the establishment of the World TradeOrganization. We will work actively within the neworganization to ensure the promotion of developmentthrough trade  placing special importance on those11General Assembly 22nd meetingprovisions in the conclusions of the Uruguay Round whichseek to ensure a regime of fairness and equity in the overallcontext of a programme of free trade.The international community and its institutions aredynamic. The choice is whether we actively shape thechange that inevitably comes with the passing of time andwith new circumstances  or whether we merely react toevents. The World Trade Organization is an example ofpurposeful design by the international community. Yetanother — a truly historic one — is the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea. As is widely known the Convention  which establishes a regulatory mechanismfor the oceans  the seas and their resources  will enter intoforce on 16 November of this year. The inaugural meetingof the International Seabed Authority will be held inKingston on that date. This will be both an end and abeginning. The event will mark the end of a process thatbegan nearly twenty years ago and the opening of a newand historic chapter in international juridical and economicrelations.The inaugural meeting will see the establishment ofthe International Seabed Authority. We are extremelyproud that Jamaica will host this important organization which has responsibility for regulating and exploiting theworld’s vastest resource base. It must be emphasized however  that the success of the Authority will require thecooperation of all parties concerned  in order to ensure thatthe goal of universality is achieved. It is important that theAuthority receive the necessary resources to enable it tooperate effectively  in a way consistent with principles andpractices applied to institutions within the United Nationssystem.I wish again to pay tribute to those who havecontributed to the United Nations Convention on the Lawof the Sea  to its ratification and to the establishment of theInternational Seabed Authority.We invite all States to join in the momentous firstmeeting of the Authority in Kingston from 16 to 18November. We look forward to welcoming the Secretary-General of this Organization  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  who has graciously accepted the invitationof the Government of Jamaica to be at the inauguralmeeting.Since I spoke to this body last year  the Republic ofSouth Africa has resumed its seat in the General Assembly.The installation of a majority government in that country under the leadership of President Nelson Mandela  is ahistoric development of which the entire internationalcommunity is justifiably proud. The dismantling ofapartheid was a consequence of the long and valiantstruggle waged by the South African people. It was alsoa victory for multilateralism and an important reminder ofthe critical role that multilateral organizations such as theUnited Nations can play in resolving difficult internationalissues. The Government and the people of Jamaicawelcome a non-racial  democratic South Africa into theinternational community of nations.In our own region  the situation in Haiti has been ofgreat concern to Jamaica and our Caribbean Community(CARICOM) partners. The wanton abuse of humanrights that led to the death of Haitians within Haiti and ofmany of those who fled in unsafe vessels simply had tostop.We welcome the most recent developments in Haitiand the reaffirmation by the international community ofits commitment to the Governors Island Accord. Therecan be no deviation from the critical elements to whichwe subscribed. The recent Security Council resolutionsends a strong signal to the military authorities that theinternational community will accept no less than theprompt return of the legitimately elected President  therestoration of the constitutional authority of theGovernment of Haiti  the reform of the army and thepolice force  and the building of lasting democraticinstitutions. Jamaica  along with several of ourCARICOM partners  is playing its part in this process byparticipating in the multinational force and in the UnitedNations Mission in Haiti.Developments in Haiti have underscored the wisdomof the philosophy of the countries of the Caribbean thatmaintaining peace and stability  within the context ofdemocratic institutions and practices  must be thefundamental basis for the development of our region.Within the wider Latin American and Caribbean region we are actively strengthening and widening cooperationamong our countries. The establishment of theAssociation of Caribbean States (ACS) in July of thisyear was a historic development that provides for evenstronger collaboration and cooperation.We hope that in the interest of the entire region  aprocess of sustained dialogue and accommodationbetween Cuba and the United States can be initiated  andthat this will lead to conditions that permit the eventualfull reintegration of Cuba into the region and into thehemispheric community. Jamaica welcomes the call12General Assembly 22nd meetingmade by the Rio Group at its recent Eighth Summitmeeting for the lifting of the trade embargo against Cuba.The trade and economic prospects of countries in theregion can be strengthened only by the priority now beingaccorded to regional and hemispheric relations and by thegrowing role  actual wand envisioned  for regional andsubregional organizations  such as CARICOM and thenewly established ACS  as well as by arrangements such asthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Inthe case of NAFTA  which we support strongly  Jamaicaand other participants in the Caribbean Basin Initiative(CBI) programme continue to press for the adoption  by theUnited States Congress of the Interim Trade programme which would significantly offset adverse consequences onexisting conditions of access under the CBI.I feel compelled to return in these final comments tothe mission of this Organization — peace and development.There can be little cause for comfort when  since 1945  20million people have died in wars and other conflicts. It isdisturbing and instructive to learn that some 80 millionpersons now live in foreign lands  and that a millionpersons immigrate permanently each year  while anothermillion seek political asylum as they flee both poverty andinternal strife. The increasing flows of refugees anddisplaced persons worldwide threaten peace and stabilityand exacerbate tensions and conflicts between countries andin entire regions. We must strengthen internationalcooperation in this area and streamline national andinternational procedures for dealing with this graveproblem.To be true to its mission  the United Nations must bean Organization that reduces both want and war. This iswhy I underscored earlier my delegation’s strong belief thatthis Organization must become increasingly active in thepromotion of long-term development  which is thenecessary underpinning of a genuine and lasting peace.The United Nations must not shrink from this aspect of itsmission.The military and ideological realignment of recentyears has created new opportunities for peace. But theseunprecedented developments must be supported byinstitutional reforms and by new approaches on our part.These institutional reforms must inevitably include thereform of the Security Council  the principal organ chargedwith the maintenance of international peace and security.In this regard  Jamaica fully supports the call for itsenlargement. We believe that the Security Council must betruly representative in order to be fully effective.Expenditure on armaments continues to consumeresources and to divert spending away from humandevelopment needs in both developed and developingcountries. Military downsizing  particularly bydeveloping countries  has yet to gather the momentumthat was expected at the end of the cold war. The UnitedNations has a legitimate role to play in providingtechnical and other assistance to help developing andother countries shift human and material resources frommilitary to civilian use. We note that the permanentmembers of the Security Council are also the world’sleading exporters of conventional weapons. This is anissue that should be addressed both in terms of reducingarms exports  as well as in terms of converting theresources to the requirements of peace and development.It would be remiss of me if I concluded mycontribution to this debate without referring to the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  to be celebrated nextyear. As we all prepare for this historic occasion  wemust reflect on the fact that this achievement is in itselfa vindication of the principles on which the Organizationwas founded. If we are to survive beyond that milestonewe must remain steadfast to these principles."
"85",3576,"JOR",49,1994,"It is my pleasure  atthe outset  to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection and to wish you and the members of the Bureauevery success in the discharge of your duties. Yourelection is a mark of the confidence and high regard inwhich both you and your country are held by theinternational community. Your wisdom and yourforbearance will be crucial to the successful outcome ofthe current session.I should like to express deep appreciation for theexemplary manner in which your predecessor conductedthe work of the Assembly during his tenure last year. Ialso wish to express my gratitude to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  for his tirelessefforts to enhance the Organization’s ability to meet thechallenges of a rapidly evolving world.It is gratifying to observe that the membership of theUnited Nations now encompasses several recentlyindependent States. We share bonds of religious andcultural affinity with some; we share friendships andmutual respect with all. We hope that the principle ofuniversality  which has always been the cornerstone of theUnited Nations  will soon encompass the remaining15peoples and regions  so that this Organization can trulyrepresent the collective conscience of mankind.It is  I believe  fitting to extend heartfeltcongratulations to President Nelson Mandela  toVice-President Frederik De Klerk  and to the people ofSouth Africa. They have together established a new orderin their country  one founded on justice and equality. Theworld rejoices at the return of South Africa to the fold ofthe international community of nations. The South Africanpeople have proved that peace is always possible  so longas all are given the chance to participate in its building.This is a theme that bears consideration.As we approach a landmark in the history of theUnited Nations - the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation -it is appropriate to look forward rather than back; to takestock of things to come rather than things past. It isappropriate to consider the shape that our global order istaking.South Africa offers a new paradigm  a fresh vision fora changing world. It shows us that a new order must haveroom for everyone. We must be able to listen to all voices:to the weak and the powerful alike. A new order must beinclusive and must actively encourage participation at everylevel: for in our ever- more interdependent world  thefuture of one is the future of all. This  I believe  goes to thevery heart of global peace.We are called upon  then  to articulate a newapproach. We must protect the rule of law  but we must gofurther  and ensure that democracy  pluralism and respectfor human rights come to govern the life of nations. Wemust evolve new procedures of cooperation  communicationand accommodation. We must promote socialresponsibility  national commitment and internationalobligation. Nations must learn to coexist with theirneighbours; but more than this  they must learn to workwillingly together as partners in the enterprise of peace.Such a transformation is taking place in the MiddleEast. My region has been synonymous with conflict andwar for decades. At last we have an historic opportunity toresolve the Arab-Israeli conflict  and to fashion in its placea new commonwealth of peace  hope and participation forall.The question of Palestine has been Jordan’s mainconcern. Family ties  geographic contiguity  and sharedhistory and traditions ensure that this is so. Over the years Jordan has extended support and encouragement to ourPalestinian brethren. Our contributions and sacrifices tothe Palestinian cause from 1948 onwards have beenwidely acknowledged. My country has receivedsuccessive waves of refugees and returnees  at a huge costto our economy  imposing an impossible burden on ourlimited resources. Yet we remain committed to ourdemocratization process  to the protection of civil libertiesand human rights  and to the provision of decent livingconditions and services for all our citizens. Underlyingthis commitment is our belief that broad-based popularinvolvement in civil society is fundamental to its health.This is why Jordan has been able to weather the ravagesof war  to survive the long years of turmoil in our region.If Jordan has been on the front line of war  so toohas it been on the front line of peace. In those well-known words of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) which my country helped to draft  Jordan has alwaysworked steadfastly for a just  lasting and comprehensivepeace in the Middle East. We promoted the genesis ofthe current process with the Madrid Conference of 1991.When the Israeli Government of the day refused tonegotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO)  Jordan stepped into the breach  helping thePalestinians to assume their proper role by providing anumbrella for their participation.Now the PLO  the sole legitimate representative ofthe Palestinian people  is negotiating directly with Israel.They are installed in Gaza and Jericho  and conduct theiraffairs as they see fit: their destiny is at last in their ownhands. Jordan welcomes these developments  and willcontinue to do everything in its power to ensure thesuccess of Palestinian autonomy arrangements.On the Jordanian-Israeli track  our common agendahas paved the way for us to agree upon modalities inareas such as water  the environment  energy  territory borders and regional security. These agreements resultedin the meeting between His Majesty King Hussein andPrime Minister Rabin of Israel  on 25 July 1994  at whichthey signed the Washington Declaration. This historicdocument ended the state of war between Jordan andIsrael. I myself have just held constructive talks withPresident Clinton and Foreign Minister Peres  the goal ofwhich is to build a framework of trilateral development aswell as an economic equilibrium in the region  and tomaintain the momentum towards peace.Jordan and Israel are engaged in substantive talks seeking just and mutually agreeable solutions to theoutstanding issues listed in our common agenda. Our aim16is to conclude a treaty of peace based on solid grounds thatcan withstand the winds of change. Such a treaty  webelieve  will delineate our rights and duties underconditions of peace. It will open the door to cooperation atthe regional level  so that the benefits of peace may beenjoyed by our peoples. It has always been Jordan’s visionthat the Middle East  cradle of civilization and birthplace ofthe three great monotheistic religions  should be a region ofcultural tolerance and mutual interdependence.Important as our bilateral talks with Israel may be  weare keenly aware that no two nations stand alone. Our aimremains a comprehensive peace. Many of the issues we arecurrently addressing defy the confines of bilateralism andrequire regional and international participation.One such issue concerns the spiritual significance ofthe city of Jerusalem. For believers in the three greatmonotheistic faiths  Jerusalem must be the ultimate symbolof peace and its glorious manifestation. A final settlementon the political and administrative status of the city however  will occur in negotiations between Palestiniansand Israelis. Any arrangement reached must serve theneeds of the millions of followers of Islam  Christianity andJudaism.The economic dimension of peace is likewise atransnational concern. The economies of the Middle Easthave been shattered by the conflict. They must be revivedif peace is to take root on the ground. Access to moreequitable opportunities for economic growth will be vital.International debt relief and write-off strategies should beplanned  encompassing improved concessionary terms bythe Clubs of Paris and London.But the States of the region must also play their part.Restrictions on trade should be relaxed. We must developa non-discriminatory approach to sustainable developmentand economic well-being. We hope that the MiddleEast-North Africa Economic Summit at Casablanca willbuild on the achievements of the Regional EconomicDevelopment Working Group and prove a useful forum toexplore the potential partnership between Governments private businesses and international financial institutions -for this partnership surely holds the key to the economicfuture of the region.International changes wrought by the end of the coldwar have affected the political situation in the Middle Eastas elsewhere. The transformation of world power politicshas been accompanied by a shift in attitude  modifying thecost benefit calculus of regional States. National strategicobjectives can no longer be sought at the cost of others ina supposedly ""zero sum game"". In the context of aregional security regime  the size  the role and thefunction of the armed forces in individual States of theregion are likely to undergo radical changes. These willfavour peace-keeping functions  allowing scarce resourcesto be released for development needs.ln this context  Jordan fully supports the fivedimensions of world peace and security outlined by theSecretary-General. I would like to add that Jordansupports the ongoing effort to streamline the UnitedNations  and fully endorses the attempt to increase thenumber of permanent members on the Security Council.We also support the American proposal thatpeace-keeping operations be strengthened by additionalpersonnel  more effective field capabilities  greatercooperation between the United Nations and participatingcountries and a more united approach to training.Here again  Jordan is at the forefront of change.Our armed forces as peace-keepers under the UnitedNations command as far afield as Georgia  Angola andthe former Yugoslavia value the opportunity to take partin these missions  for in a very real sense  they allow usto participate in the unfolding world order. Jordan isproud to be involved in shaping global securityarrangements.As the peace process develops  it will be necessaryto promote a common regional identity and a sharedregional vision. All the Middle East must contribute tothe articulation of this vision. The key  again  isparticipation. If the countries and peoples of the regionhave a say in shaping its future  they will have a stake inits success. And success will accordingly be all the morelikely; for the diversity of our region is a positive assetthat we must learn to use creatively. We will inevitablydiffer on certain issues  just as we will agree on others.But we must be able to discuss our views in theknowledge that they will be heard  for honestcommunication is the basis of genuine involvement in anyjoint enterprise.In this spirit  Jordan feels honour-bound to registerits concern over threats to the process of globalreconciliation. Inertia must not be allowed to dominatethe conduct of world affairs. Deep-seated conflicts willnot disappear by themselves. We urge the internationalcommunity of States to take swift action to facilitate theirresolution.17One glaring example is the ongoing situation in BosniaHerzegovina. The appalling practices of ""ethnic cleansing""and genocide continue even as we speak. My countryabhors these atrocities. Jordan supports all the internationalcommunity’s efforts to end this tragic and wasteful conflict and we have taken positive steps to alleviate the hardshipit has caused. Jordan has joined the Non-AlignedMovement’s task force on Bosnia. Our soldiers  who formthe second largest contingent of the United Nationspeace-keeping effort in the Balkans  are engaged in bothhumanitarian relief and peace-keeping duties. Jordan hassupported the Vienna and Washington Agreements toestablish a federation between the Muslims and Croats ofBosnia  and has welcomed the peace plan advanced by theContact Group  supported by the G-7 summit in Naples.The Serbian challenge to the plan  in the face of Muslimand Croat acceptance  is cause for deep disappointment.I turn now to the situation in the Gulf. Theimportance of stability and security cannot be overstated.International norms must be observed; the territorialintegrity of all States must be preserved. Their sovereigntyand political independence must be upheld on the basis ofnon-interference in their internal affairs. My country alsowishes to reiterate its serious concern for the plight of thepeople of Iraq  where living conditions are deterioratingrapidly. We intend to do our utmost to alleviate thesuffering of the Iraqi people  so far as is consistent with theprovisions of United Nations resolutions.The distorted image of Islam remains a cause forgrave concern. The attention of this body should be turnedto the spreading of Islamophobia  or hate for Muslims.This phenomenon occurs in all manner of ways  from thepurely verbal to the bluntly physical. Its proponents dealin inflammatory rhetoric. They preach the inevitability ofcultural apocalypse  tarring all Muslims with the brush offanatical extremism. They ignore the fact that Islam is abroad and adaptable concept and institution. One billionMuslims now live on this earth. Thus  Islam encompassesall shades of political opinion  different patterns oftheological thought  and countless varieties of humanexperience.Jordan urges Member States to join forces in bringingabout a better understanding of Islam as a religion  aculture and a civilization. The expression of anti-Muslimsentiment  and other manifestations of Islamophobia  shouldbe monitored and combated by educational campaigns cultural exchanges and similar endeavours. We havealways advocated an interfaith dialogue as the surest wayto combat bigotry and stereotyping.More than a decade ago now  I stood before thisAssembly and called  on behalf of my country  for a newinternational humanitarian order. That led to theestablishment of the Independent Commission onInternational Humanitarian Issues. The Commission wascharged with investigating a wide range of pressinghumanitarian issues. It performed its duties well producing a series of reports that made clear the scale ofthe impending global humanitarian disaster.It would be comforting to stand before thisAssembly today and tell it that its work has made asignificant difference. It would be comforting  but itwould not be true. A new international humanitarianorder has not come into being. The powerless remainpowerless. The dispossessed have not recovered theirbirthrights. There are more refugees  more streetchildren  more innocent victims of conflict than everbefore. What is worse  these issues are still addressed ina piecemeal fashion. It is often said that one should nottry to treat a mass of symptoms  but to seek out rootcauses. Remarkably  it sometimes seems that far fromseeking causes we are doing our best to ignore thesymptoms.Today  I have tried to address causes. I have spokenof the fundamental need for participation at all levels. Ihave put before the Assembly a vision of a global ordercharacterized by partnership and communication  toleranceand trust. In some places this vision is on the road torealization; in others  it has seldom been more remote.The alternatives are very clear  and the choice is ours.I pledge my country’s full support to thisOrganization  for as we move towards the twenty-firstcentury  and as the Organization moves towards itsfiftieth anniversary  the ideal that inspired the Charter ofthe United Nations has never been more important."
"86",3623,"JPN",49,1994,"Allow me to begin myaddress by offering my congratulations to Mr. AmaraEssy on the assumption of his new office. I should alsolike to express my respect for the excellent diplomaticskills demonstrated by his predecessor  AmbassadorInsanally  during a period of momentous change. I amalso pleased to convey my sincere congratulations to theRepublic of South Africa  which  having renouncedapartheid  was reinstated as a full Member of the UnitedNations at the previous session of the General Assembly.The United Nations is now expected to play agreater role than ever before. Recalling the blessingsbestowed upon Japan by the international community atthe time of its admission into this Organization  I intendto conduct a proactive foreign policy that will enableJapan to contribute  on a level commensurate with itspolitical and economic status  to the future well-being ofhumankind.At the outset  I should like to discuss Japan’s basicphilosophy regarding its international contributions. Japanis engaged in economic assistance and various otherefforts in order to eradicate poverty and achieve economicdevelopment  as well as to prevent conflicts and removedestabilizing factors.Reflecting with remorse upon the Second WorldWar  Japan has never wavered from its commitment tocontribute to world peace and prosperity. Japan does not nor will it  resort to the use of force  prohibited by itsConstitution. Japan will remain resolutely a nation ofpeace. Neither possessing nuclear arms nor exportingweapons  Japan continues to be actively engaged indisarmament and non-proliferation efforts. In accordancewith what I have just stated  Japan has dispatchedmembers of its Self-Defence Forces  as well as civilianpersonnel  to several countries  including Cambodia andMozambique  in response to requests by the UnitedNations. Japan intends to continue to cooperate activelyin such United Nations peace-keeping operations.12At the same time  Japan is determined to enhance itscontributions to efforts on global issues in economic andsocial areas. These issues  whose importance is nowwidely recognized  include development  the environment human rights  refugees  population  AIDS and narcotics.Today  the first area on which the United Nationsshould focus its efforts is the maintenance of internationalpeace and security; the second is the resolution of economicand social problems. And if it is to carry out these twovery important tasks effectively  it must undertake a third:the promotion of United Nations reform. I should like onthis occasion to outline my views as to the kind ofcontributions Japan wishes to make in these areas.In the maintenance of international peace and security which is the first area of concern to the United Nations Japan places great emphasis on disarmament andnon-proliferation  diplomatic efforts for the resolution ofconflicts  and peace-keeping operations.As the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack and adhering firmly to its three non-nuclear principles Japan strives to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating allnuclear weapons. Toward this end  it urges allnuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts to reducetheir nuclear arsenals. Further  Japan supports theindefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and calls on all States that have not yet acceded to theTreaty to do so at the earliest opportunity.At the same time  I would urge  in particular  allnuclear-weapon States to engage more actively in thenegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and tostrive to bring them to an early and successful conclusion.I wish to propose that  once the negotiations on the treatyare concluded  a ceremony for its signing by Heads of Stateor Government be held in Japan  for example in the city ofHiroshima  and that it be made a new starting-point for theelimination of nuclear weapons once and for all.In this connection  Japan strongly calls upon NorthKorea to engage seriously in efforts to resolve the issue ofits development of nuclear weapons through internationaldialogue  including its talks with the United States.The unfettered transfer and excessive accumulation ofconventional weapons is another destabilizing factor inmany regions of the world today. In the civil wars we havewitnessed in certain regions of Africa and elsewhere  forexample  it has resulted in the escalation of combat and inenormous loss of life. It is my belief that the internationalcommunity must seriously consider concrete measures tosolve this problem.In this regard  the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms  designed to improve the transparencyof arms transfers  has grown increasingly important as aneffective measure for building confidence at the globallevel. More than 80 countries participate in the Registerat present  and we strongly hope that many more willjoin. Japan will work together with other Member Statesto amplify and strengthen the Register by  for example also including arms stockpiles in it.The prevention and settlement of regional conflictsrequires a comprehensive approach which combinesdiplomatic efforts  United Nations peace-keepingoperations  humanitarian aid  assistance for building socialinstitutions  and aid for peace-building  such asrehabilitation and reconstruction assistance.Convinced of the importance of taking measuresbefore conflicts become intractable  I am a strongadvocate of the vigorous promotion of preventivediplomacy. From this viewpoint  I believe we should  incooperation with the countries concerned  activelyconsider extending assistance for the stabilization ofsocial and political conditions in regions or countrieswhere there are elements of instability.United Nations peace-keeping operations haveproved successful in Cambodia and many other regions and they are expected to play an increasingly importantrole. Further improvement of the effectiveness ofpeace-keeping operations will require closer examinationof  inter alia  their mandates  duration  scale of activitiesand cost  as well as full consideration of the safety ofpersonnel. Strengthening the financial base of UnitedNations peace-keeping operations is an urgent task. It isnecessary  in particular  that Member States that are inarrears pay their assessed contributions. It is alsoimperative that ways be sought to put peace-keepingoperations on a sounder financial basis.Japan  for its part  will enhance its support fordemocratization with a view to helping peace take rootafter the fighting has ceased. It places particularimportance on assisting efforts to hold free and fairelections.Responding to the unspeakably tragic situation of theRwandan refugees  Japan has provided both financialassistance and material support through the United13Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the UnitedNations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. The Governmentof Japan has decided to dispatch more than 400 membersof its self-defence forces to the region to provide assistancein such areas as medical treatment  water supply and airtransport. Some of these activities have alreadycommenced. Working together with the internationalcommunity - particularly with the countries of Africa -Japan is determined to continue its efforts toward a solutionof the Rwandan issue.With regard to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia Japan continues to support the efforts of the internationalcommunity to restore peace. It calls upon all the disputingparties concerned to accept the peace plan for Bosnia andHerzegovina devised by the Contact Group and to cooperatewith the activities of the United Nations there.The second task of the United Nations is the solutionof problems in economic and social areas  including thoseregarding development  the environment and human rights.With the changing international circumstances  theissue of development is now re-emerging as a globalconcern; a new strategy for development is thus called for.It is from this viewpoint that Japan has been advocating adevelopment strategy that entails a comprehensiveapproach  combining assistance  trade  investment  and thetransfer of technology  as well as a differentiated approach tailored to the needs of developing countries according totheir respective stages of development.The International Conference on African Development held in Tokyo last year  proved to be a worthwhile forumfor the discussion of how such a development strategymight be realized. In an effort to build upon the results ofthat Conference  an Asia-Africa seminar will be convenedin Indonesia this December.In today’s world  South-South cooperation  wheremore advanced developing countries share their experienceand technology with other developing countries  is ofincreasing significance. Japan intends to suggest concreteplans for the promotion of South-South cooperation aroundthe globe.Moreover  as the world’s largest donor country  Japancontinues its efforts to expand its official developmentassistance. In extending such assistance  it gives fullconsideration to such factors as trends in the recipientcountry’s military expenditures and in its development andproduction of weapons of mass destruction  as well as itsefforts to promote democracy and to introduce amarket-oriented economy.It is my hope that meaningful discussions of anAgenda for Development will take place at the currentsession of the General Assembly and that the points Ihave just mentioned will be taken into account.At this time of increasing global interdependence  allhumankind is confronted with new challenges  such asenvironmental and population problems  which can beovercome only through close cooperative efforts betweenindustrialized and developing countries.Japan  for its part  is actively engaged inenvironmental- protection efforts. For example  it isworking to strengthen the international framework forsuch efforts  to transfer relevant technologies todeveloping countries  and to expand and strengthen itsofficial development assistance in environmental areas.With regard to population and AIDS  in February of thisyear Japan launched its Global Issues Initiative  underwhich it is greatly expanding assistance to developingcountries to address these problems. At the InternationalConference on Population and Development  recentlyconvened in Cairo  I stressed the importance of finding asolution to issues relating to population.Japan is profoundly aware that human-resourcesdevelopment and the further advancement of the status ofwomen  achieved through international cooperation  haveimportant implications for social stability. We thereforeeagerly anticipate the successful outcome of the WorldSummit for Social Development and the Fourth WorldConference on Women  which will be convened nextyear. By the same token  Japan actively participates inthe Women-in-Development programmes and other social-development activities administered by the various UnitedNations agencies.Economic development and human rights may belikened to the front and rear wheels of a vehicle: theymust work in tandem to advance the development ofdemocratic societies. In order to encourage respect forhuman rights as universal values and to improveeffectively the human rights situation in every country  itis important to make continuous efforts to establish legalsystems and to raise awareness of human rights  inaddition to promoting political  economic and socialstability. Toward this end  Japan will cooperate in everyway possible to assist the work of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.14If it is to carry out effectively its two major tasks -maintaining international peace and security and resolvingeconomic and social problems - the United Nations mustmake a serious effort to adapt to the new era byundertaking structural reform as well as administrative andbudgetary reform.As the United Nations seeks to strengthen its activitiesthrough reform  the restructuring of the Security Council isof particular importance. Today the activities of theSecurity Council span a wide range of issues relating toworld peace and stability. While the membership of theUnited Nations has grown from 51 countries in 1945 to 184countries at the present time  the composition of theCouncil  which was intended to reflect the world situationas it existed when the United Nations was established  hasremained virtually unchanged. In the interim  we havewitnessed the emergence of countries that are capable ofshouldering greater international responsibilities. It istherefore necessary to restructure and strengthen theSecurity Council  while ensuring its efficiency  so that itmay reflect world realities.In keeping with Japan’s basic philosophy regardinginternational contributions  which I outlined earlier  I wishto state that Japan is prepared  with the endorsement ofmany countries  to discharge its responsibilities as apermanent member of the Security Council. It is my hopethat United Nations Member States will accelerate thedeliberations on this subject during the current session andthat an agreement will be reached on a reform plan in timefor the commemorative fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly next year.The Security Council is not the only organ requiringreform. The General Assembly  in which 184 Statesparticipate  also needs to be reinvigorated  and it mustcoordinate its activities more closely with those of otherUnited Nations agencies. Recently  efforts have begun tofine-tune United Nations activities in economic and socialfields  such as development  the environment and humanrights  and to establish clear priorities among them. Inaddressing these issues  which have profound implicationsfor the future of humankind  it is necessary to continue towork towards the functional and organizationalstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council. TheTrusteeship Council  by contrast  has completed its historicmission  and it is my view that it would be appropriate  inthe context of the reform of the United Nations as a whole to consider its abolishment. Building on the creation of theOffice of Internal Oversight Services at the last session ofthe General Assembly  we must redouble our efforts topromote administrative and budgetary reform.The passage of a half century since the signing ofthe United Nations Charter has rendered the so-called""former enemy clauses"" meaningless. Japan continues toseek their deletion from the text of the Charter.I have focused my remarks today on the threechallenges facing the United Nations: the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  the resolution ofeconomic and social issues and the need for the reform ofthe Organization. If the United Nations pursues reformto meet the changing needs of the times and supports andexpands cooperation among its Member States  I haveevery confidence that it will enhance its legitimacy as auniversal organization and develop a capacity to respondto new challenges even more effectively.In closing  I would like to call upon all MemberStates to cooperate to ensure that this will be rememberedas the historic session of the General Assembly thatushered in a new era for the United Nations."
"87",3648,"KAZ",49,1994,"On behalf of the Kazakhstan delegation  firstof all  I should like to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy onhis election to the office of President of the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly and express ourconfidence that his competence and experience willcontribute to the fruitful work of the session.I should also like to thank his predecessor Ambassador Insanally  for the able stewardship  efficiencyand tact he demonstrated during the forty-eighth session.May I also express our special gratitude to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for histireless efforts to consolidate peace and stability and tostrengthen the role of the United Nations in the life of theinternational community.19Our world  multifaceted and contradictory  is rapidlyapproaching the end of the second millennium. I hope thatthe confrontation by force which existed throughout thedecades of the cold war and its underlying concept thathistory is an evolving process of struggle between thecompeting systems are now definitely a part of the past.The end of the bipolar era triggered the release ofenormous political energy  which earlier had been directedtowards ideological competition. Today  the world issearching for new institutional structures  non-confrontational approaches to the solution of globalproblems and a more efficient utilization of human  materialand technical resources.Looking into the future  full of hope  we should notrule out the possibility of meeting new challenges. Indeed a common set of global problems that existed before hasbeen replaced by numerous other problems no less complexor immense.In our opinion  the United Nations has neverexperienced such an important period in its nearly halfcentury-old history. The beginning of the 1990s and thefiftieth anniversary of the Organization can and shouldbecome a truly historic milestone that will determine thenew tasks of the United Nations and considerablystrengthen its role in the life of the succeeding generations.Each important turning-point in the history of thiscentury has manifested itself in social and political changesin the life of States. Today the transition from one era ofinternational life to another is related to the disintegrationof the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) the revolutionary transformations in the countries of EasternEurope and the entry into the family of nations of a numberof newly independent States  among them my native Kazakhstan.For us  three years of freedom have been three yearsof achieving real political and economic independence. TheRepublic  having become a Member of the United Nationsand other international organizations  having signed theHelsinki Final Act  the Charter of Paris and a number ofother international instruments  has de jure completed itsentry into the world community. From the very first day our country has striven to ensure the actual implementationof its commitments to deal with common global issues such as respect for human rights  the strengthening ofdemocracy and the rule of law  economic freedom andsocial justice  the development of a market economy andthe strengthening of international security.Kazakhstan accords priority to the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In December 1993  theParliament of our Republic ratified the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear State. At the coming 1995 NPT ReviewConference  we intend to join the position of those Statesthat favour an unconditional extension of the NPT for anunlimited period of time. From this rostrum I declare thatthe Republic of Kazakhstan  deeply committed to thestrengthening of its national sovereignty and security andthe process of political and economic reforms in society is genuinely interested in international stability and thedevelopment of cooperation with all States. That is ourconsistent policy  not subject to any changes dictated byshort-term experience. I should like to emphasize inparticular that we intend to achieve our objectives whiletaking existing realities into account and effectively usingthe geopolitical location of Kazakhstan as a kind of linkbetween Europe and Asia  between East and West.In this context  we think that the initiative of thePresident of Kazakhstan  Mr. N.A. Nazarbaev  to convenea Conference on Interaction and Confidence-BuildingMeasures in Asia  put forward for the first time from thisrostrum two years ago at the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly  has a special significance. Its purposeis to develop fundamental principles and areas ofcooperation in the context of strengthening peace andstability and promoting the economic prosperity of AsianStates.Today the idea of this Conference is being put intopractice. Thus  representatives of more than 20 countriesof the region  as well as representatives of the UnitedNations  the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE)  the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC) and the League of Arab States tookpart in the two meetings of experts convened byKazakhstan in Almaty last year to discuss this initiative.As a follow-up to the Almaty meetings on thisConference  the Permanent Representatives of 25 UnitedNations Member States  as well as the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General andrepresentatives of a number of international organizations met twice in New York. A third meeting at the level ofsenior officials is to be held in Almaty at the end ofOctober.Confidence in the possibility of the step-by-stepestablishment of this new international structure isconfirmed by the fact that the creation in Asia of differentpolitical and economic unions  associations and groups 20closely interrelated and influencing one another  isdependent on a common interest in the strengthening ofpeace and stability  without which the economic prosperityof Asian countries is impossible. The deep-rootedprocesses of economic integration on the Asian continentshould logically and inevitably lead to the formation of anAsian common market  on the one hand  and politicalcoordination and integration  on the other. Therefore  wethink that the political will of the States of the regiontowards the purposeful and careful management of theseprocesses should speed up the creation of global economicand political structures  similar to those in Europe.This confidence has prompted the President of ourcountry to put forward a new proposal to establish theEuro-Asian Union (EAU) as a catalyst of integrationprocesses and as an instrument for the prevention ofconflicts in the post-Soviet era. The opportunities toovercome the economic and social crisis  and inter-ethnicand inter-State conflicts  and to ensure external and internalsecurity and stability through the proposed mechanism ofunification have been received with understanding bypoliticians and leaders of different States.Since the creation of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS)  stability and security as the basisof economic and social reforms have come to the forefront.As for economic aspects  they are in fact a dominant partof the EAU integration processes. The first step is thecreation of a common economic space by the Central AsianStates — Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan —supported by the appropriate agreements. Appropriateinter-State bodies  such as the Central Asian Bank  havealready begun to function. The proposed union is open toall States.During the transition period  the proposed EAU mostadequately reflects the interests of the States of the region regardless of their size  population  economic and otherindicators. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate theirwillingness to cooperate on an equal basis  as well as theircommitment to reforms in the interests of all the nations ofthe region.In putting forward these initiatives  Kazakhstanassumes that the problems they seek to resolve are pressingfor all countries of the world  and for such an authoritativeOrganization as the United Nations. Our certainty is alsostrengthened by the fact that the Kazakhstan initiatives areharmonious with the principles of the United NationsCharter and with key provisions of the broadly supportedreport of the Secretary-General “An Agenda for Peace”  andparticularly with his idea of the need to strengthenpreventive diplomacy and the peacemaking activities ofthe United Nations and deepening cooperation in theseareas between the United Nations and regionalorganizations. The foreign-policy approaches ofKazakhstan were the basis for our decision to join the“Partnership for Peace” programme of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO).Kazakhstan  as a member of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS)  strives to implement its foreignpolicy initiatives in practical terms and  accordingly  takesinto account and respects the legal rights and interests ofother CIS States. The true interests of the multi-ethnicpopulation of Kazakhstan lie not only in the maintenancebut also in the expansion of common economic  political military and strategic partnership and interaction withinthe CIS. Our Republic maintains special relations withthe Russian Federation  all the Republics of CentralAsia — Kyrgyzstan  Uzbekistan  Tajikistan Turkmenistan  and other CIS States. Certainly  the mostimportant direction for Central Asian interaction is ourcommon interest in strengthening peace  stability andsecurity  both in regional and global dimensions.In a situation threatening peace in the region or onthe Euro-Asian continent  Kazakhstan  together with thecountries of Central Asia and Russia  is ready to put intooperation an established machinery of joint consultationsaimed at coordinating its positions and undertakingmeasures for the elimination of the threat.A vivid example of this is our joint endeavours tosettle the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. Thus  atthe meeting of the Presidents  Prime Ministers andMinisters of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstanand Uzbekistan held at Almaty last July the situation onthe Tajik-Afghan border was discussed and a jointstatement was adopted. Guided by the need to maintainpeace and ensure a favourable environment for successfuleconomic and political reforms and greater independenceof their countries  the Foreign Ministers of the threeStates appealed to the conflicting parties to stop hostileactivities and settle existing problems by political meansthrough negotiations. The participants in the meetingpointed to a close interrelation between the stabilizationof the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and internalpolitical developments in Tajikistan  and they supportedefforts to deepen the inter-Tajik dialogue and the activerole of the United Nations and the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe.21Kazakhstan’s efforts towards integration at the regionaland interregional level need the support of internationalorganizations and the leading countries of the world. Theprerequisites for such support exist and are being created.They include commitments on a bilateral and multilateralbasis and the resolutions of the United Nations GeneralAssembly on assistance to countries with economies intransition  as well as our participation in cooperation withthe CSCE based on one of the components of the conceptof global security  namely  the economic dimension.Kazakhstan attaches great importance to the expansionof United Nations activities in social and economic fieldsand supports vital initiatives relating to reforms in this areathat are being undertaken within the United Nations and  inparticular  in the Economic and Social Council.The report of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations “An Agenda for Development” is to play the keyrole in these issues. We support the fundamental ideas ofthe report  and we believe that the discussion of thisdocument at the current session of the General Assemblyshould be marked by our common aspiration to increase theefficiency of United Nations activities in the social andeconomic fields to ensure proper coordination of efforts ofthe related United Nations agencies and to set new prioritiesin accordance with today’s global  political and socio-economic realities. The main purpose of these endeavours we believe  should be to preserve and develop the spirit ofglobal partnership born at Rio two years ago and to ensurethe environmentally safe  sustainable development of thewhole world.As a young State endeavouring to resolve difficulttasks of socio-economic and democratic reform and toensure its efficient participation in the international divisionof labour  Kazakhstan welcomes United Nations effortswith regard to the integration of countries with economiesin transition into the world economy and promotion of theiraccess to world markets  particularly through assistance tothe newly independent land-locked States of Central Asia of which Kazakhstan is the largest. We view this as amanifestation of the comprehensive approach by the UnitedNations in the field of socio-economic policy and deem itto be the most productive way to meet the challenges ofglobal sustainable social and economic development.In this connection I should also like to indicate thehigh value Kazakhstan places on its cooperation with theInternational Monetary Fund  the World Bank  the EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development  the EuropeanUnion  the Organization of Economic Cooperation andDevelopment and other international organizationsthrough their programmes of technical assistance. At thesame time  we would like to see this cooperation acquiremore dynamism and practical efficiency  which wouldcreate a favourable climate for market reforms inKazakhstan and other countries with economies intransition and for their better access to world markets andthe flow of foreign investments to these countries.In this context it is a matter of concern to us that according to some forecasts  the gap in the levels offactual and required assistance will sharply increase whenunemployment in the States of the former Soviet Unionpeaks. This is expected as a consequence of the closureof unprofitable State enterprises. Against thatbackground  the current level of Western assistance to ourmarket reforms will not be enough to make progresstowards the implementation of a second “Marshall Plan”.Another priority of socio-economic development inour country is its activity in the field of environment. Itis no accident that Kazakhstan has singled outenvironmental issues  since it is itself exposed to suchenvironmental disasters of a global and regional nature asthe Aral Sea crisis  the degradation of a vast area aroundthe Semipalatinsk nuclear-test grounds  the severedeterioration of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and thedangerous increase of its water level  which threaten thelife and economic activity in a large coastal area. Allthese things seriously hamper the process of social andeconomic reform in Kazakhstan. A great contribution tothe solution of the Aral problem is being made by theInternational Fund for the Salvation of the Aral Sea headed by Mr. Nazarbaev  President of the Republic ofKazakhstan. The Central Asian Inter-State Council on theAral Sea has been established  and a programme of actionfor the coming three to five years has been elaborated toimprove the environmental conditions of the Aral Sea.However  the States of the region have very limitedfinancial and technical resources. In this regard  I shouldlike to appeal again to the world community  the donorcountries and the specialized international agencies to jointheir efforts to fight this truly global  environmentaldisaster in the Aral Sea. In this connection  Kazakhstanproposes to hold in Almaty or in the city of Aralsk aspecial international conference on the Aral Sea problemunder the auspices of the United Nations  and to considerthe possibility of establishing a special structure withinthe United Nations system to deal with this problem.22When we speak about the balanced and sustainabledevelopment of society we cannot leave out the issue ofhuman rights. If an individual is poor and deprived of theelementary means of life  his political rights aremeaningless. A comprehensive approach to this problemwas demonstrated by the World Conference on HumanRights at Vienna in 1993  which analysed and reviewed theoverall activities of the United Nations in the field ofhuman rights. Pursuant to the recommendations of theWorld Conference on Human Rights  the United NationsGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session called for theestablishment of the post of United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. On behalf of theGovernment of Kazakhstan  let me congratulate Mr. J.Ayala Lasso on his election to this high and responsiblepost and assure the world community that my country willfully abide by the recommendations of the WorldConference on Human Rights and support United Nationsactivities in the field of the international protection ofhuman rights.With regard to social and economic issues  I shouldlike to highlight the recently concluded Cairo InternationalConference on Population and Development. Kazakhstantook an active part in that Conference and believes that itsoutcome will be yet another practical contribution to UnitedNations efforts to ensure global sustainable development.In this connection  we also expect significant results fromsuch major forthcoming international forums as the WorldSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen  the FourthWorld Conference on Women in Beijing and the UnitedNations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) inIstanbul.Kazakhstan supports the joint endeavours of MemberStates to reform the principal organs of the United Nations especially the Security Council.Guided by Article 24 of the United Nations Charter which states that the Security Council  in carrying out itsduties under its primary responsibility  acts on behalf of allMember States  Kazakhstan favours the enlargement of theSecurity Council to ensure equitable geographicalrepresentation and the effective and efficient functioningand transparency of the Security Council.For many years now we have been witnessing asignificant deterioration of the financial situation of theUnited Nations. Without going into the details of thisdifficult issue  I should like to note that the current sessionof the General Assembly is not an ordinary one  because itwill have to adopt a new scale of assessments for theapportionment of United Nations expenses for the period1995-1997.As a cornerstone of the whole financial system ofthe United Nations  the scale of assessments has alwaysbeen among the most important aspects of the functioningof the Organization. The adoption of the new scale ofassessments this year is also important in that the newarrangement will fully reflect the considerable increase inthe membership of the United Nations and solve to thegreatest possible extent problems related to thecontributions of a group of new Member States.Since the creation of this problem Kazakhstan hasdemonstrated realism and a balanced approach and hastried to take into consideration the interests of otherMember States. We hope that the principle of thecapacity to pay and of the need to improve themethodology of the scale by eliminating its mostdistorting elements will be taken fully into account in thedetermination of the new scale of assessments. Thiswould undoubtedly help to improve the Organization’soverall financial situation.With regard to the financial standing of the UnitedNations  I should like to refer to the question ofimproving administrative and financial management in thesystem. Kazakhstan has welcomed concrete steps in thisfield and supported the creation of the Office of InternalOversight Services  and we deem it appropriate that suchefforts be continued.Ten years ago  in this Organization  the formerrector of the University for Peace  Mr. Robert Muller said the following very true words:“A jubilee is an occasion for reflection and not forcelebration”.I believe that today  on the eve of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  we are all adoptingthis very approach in evaluating the Organization’s past present and future.In this context  I should like to note with gratitudethe great efforts of the Preparatory Committee and theSecretariat in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations. They are making a concrete contributionto the commemoration of this forthcoming historic event.Kazakhstan too is preparing to commemorate theevent in a fitting way. It has set up a national committee 23which is scheduled to arrange a variety of ceremonialevents  as well as to issue collectors’ stamps and coinsdevoted to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.The importance that Kazakhstan attaches to the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations is reflected also in ourinitiative concerning the holding of a special session of theGeneral Assembly within the framework of the event. Inour view  this could be the occasion for a thorough  usefuland interesting exchange of views on the most significantaspects of the activities of the United Nations and on it’srole.The forthcoming anniversary inevitably brings to mindanother historic international date — the fiftieth anniversaryof the end of the Second World War. Kazakhstanwholeheartedly supports the initiative to declare 1995 theinternational year of the commemoration of the victims ofthat war.In conclusion  I should like to express my firm beliefthat the United Nations will come to its anniversaryrevitalized and fully able to realize the rich potentialembodied in the aspiration to peace and humanism that wasenshrined in its Charter 50 years ago."
"88",3695,"KEN",49,1994,"Let me join other representatives who have spoken before in congratulating you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election to this high office is a demonstration both of the confidence that Member States have in you and of the respect they have for your beautiful country  Cote d'Ivoire. We are confident that under your wise guidance our deliberations at this session will achieve the desired results.I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Insanally of Guyana  for steering the forty- eighth session to a successful conclusion. During his presidency  Ambassador Insanally undertook several initiatives aimed at strengthening the General Assembly and improving its relationship with the other organs of the United Nations. We thank him for his dynamic and imaginative leadership.May I also extend our congratulations to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  on the untiring and visionary manner in which he is managing the affairs of the Organization.The peace dividend expected after the end of the cold war  four years ago  is yet to be realized. On the contrary  the world has been faced with the escalation of new conflicts and in some cases the intensification of old conflicts. The disappearance of the great ideological rivalry between the East and the West has enabled the United Nations more constructively to play its central role of facilitating conflict resolution and maintaining international peace and security. The emerging international situation has however brought with it new challenges to which the international community should respond in a dynamic manner and within the framework of the United Nations Charter.Kenya supports the ongoing efforts aimed at reforming the United Nations with a view to adapting to the new challenges  and hopes that these efforts will be intensified during this session of the General Assembly. We welcome progress already made in the reform of the economic and social sectors of the Organization as well as the revitalization of the working of the General Assembly. However  more needs to be done  particularly in the context of the new Agenda for Development. Furthermore  a great deal still remains to be done in reforming the Security Council to enhance its effectiveness  its transparency and its relationship with the General Assembly as well as Member States. The open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council has been able to highlight  substantially  areas where the Security Council needs to be reformed. It is our hope that the Working Group will reach a consensus on this vital exercise before the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.The role of the Security Council has become critical in the new era. Kenya is cognizant  and appreciative  of the special responsibilities entrusted to the five permanent members of the Security Council. However  the circumstances which led to the creation of the present membership structure have changed. It is therefore crucial that the membership of the Council reflect these changes and incorporate regional interests for a more balanced distribution of seats.The United Nations is currently involved in an unprecedented number of peace-keeping operations. This clearly underlines the growing confidence of the international community in the role of the United Nations. During the forty-seventh session  the Assembly adopted the Agenda for Peace  which emphasized preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. The most rewarding parts of this three-pronged strategy are the first two - namely  preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. This is especially true  when we consider that mobilization for peace-keeping is usually very slow. We are therefore convinced that the United Nations should invest more in preventive diplomacy and development to avoid the human catastrophes we have witnessed recently in many parts of the world  particularly Africa.We happily welcome the victory of democracy in South Africa and the dismantling of apartheid. Kenya heartily congratulates President Nelson Mandela  his Government and the people of South Africa on the peaceful transition to a new democratic and multiracial South Africa. We are also delighted with the peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between Chad and Libya. The positive developments in Mozambique and Burundi towards peaceful resolution of long-standing conflicts are indeed commendable. A comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict is now on a steady course with the ongoing implementation of the accord between Israel and Palestine and the recently concluded peace agreement between Jordan and Israel. We congratulate all the parties and encourage them to widen and intensify the peace processes.International peace and security can flourish only if peace and stability exist in individual countries. The fundamental responsibility of ensuring peace and stability lies with the individual countries themselves. The Charter of the United Nations clearly underscores that responsibility under the principles of sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.With the recent resurgence of problems based on ethnicity and of nationalism  sustained effort is required at the national level to forge national consensus. All nations have to build their democracies on the basis of their national circumstances  experiences  traditions and aspirations  but within the context of the universal values and norms of democracy  good governance and human rights.The international community also has an important role to play in the support of national efforts towards the strengthening of democratic processes  sustainable development  peace and security. Very often  international conflicts are fanned by the struggle for the sharing of scant resources and public offices in the absence of a wide economic base to absorb competing interests. Development needs  therefore  have to be addressed from a wider perspective. The international community's support for institutional capacity-building and human resources development is pivotal to sustainable development  peace and security.Over the last year  the international community has witnessed the intensification of some perennial conflicts. The experiences of Rwanda  Somalia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Sudan and Liberia clearly demonstrate that there is no substitute for a political settlement negotiated between the parties to the conflicts. At the same time  the international community  particularly the United Nations  should be tireless in its efforts to assist parties to reach lasting solutions to these conflicts.In this connection  regional bodies need to be strengthened  as their role in supporting development and facilitating solutions to national conflicts cannot be overstressed. The escalation of conflicts in one country has left neighbouring countries flooded with refugees and other spill-over effects  including the spread of banditry and illegal arms. Accordingly  we welcome the draft declaration on the strengthening of the cooperation between the United Nations and the regional organizations  and arrangements in the maintenance of international peace and security. Adoption of that declaration at this session of the General Assembly will be an important milestone towards strengthening the role of the regional bodies in the maintenance of international peace and security under the overall responsibility of the Security Council.The magnitude of the Rwandese human disaster calls for extraordinary efforts in the mobilization of the United Nations system and the international community to stop the suffering of the Rwandese people and to restore normalcy to that unfortunate country. The decision to scale down the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda at that critical time contributed to the vacuum that resulted in the estimated loss of 1 million lives  with about 4 million people being internally displaced or fleeing as refugees. The experience of Rwanda calls for fundamental changes to United Nations peace-keeping operations to ensure an adequate  timely and effective response.We take this opportunity to commend the neighbouring countries for accommodating so many refugees and offering logistical support for humanitarian operations. We also commend the countries  international organizations and non-governmental organizations that have been extending critical humanitarian support. We are encouraged by the assurance of the new Government that it will foster the reconciliation of the Rwandese people. This calls for the intensification of international effort aimed at restoring normalcy in Rwanda. Kenya  for its part  has continued to play a facilitating role in the supply of humanitarian assistance to Rwanda.On Somalia  we strongly believe that the continued presence of United Nations peace-keeping personnel is critical in the pursuit of peace and security in the country if we are to avoid the deterioration of a situation that is already unacceptable. We note with concern the Secretary-General's report on the growing incidence of violence and attacks on United Nations soldiers as well as the inability of the Somali faction leaders to agree on a formula for the creation of an interim central authority. While we commend the efforts of the international community in the search for a settlement to the Somali conflict  we are greatly concerned about the failure of the faction leaders to utilize the opportunities afforded by the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and the Organization of African Unity  as well as the neighbouring countries  to bring an end to the conflict.Somalia is a sister country with which we share an 800-kilometre border  family relations  and ethnic and cultural affinities. The very heavy influx of Somali refugees into Kenya has had a devastating effect on the most ecologically fragile parts of the country. The refugee burden on my country is still excessively high  with about 300 000 registered refugees. Kenya is cooperating closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in accelerating the resettlement and voluntary repatriation of refugees. Physical and social infrastructures have also been overextended due to excessive usage.The national efforts aimed at mitigating the negative effects caused by the influx of refugees in the border region are constrained by the magnitude of the problem and the competing security  administrative and development commitments in the area. In this regard  while appreciating various forms of assistance from the international donor community  including the non-governmental organizations  to address the problem  Kenya further appeals to the United Nations and the donor community to assist in the financing of the rehabilitation of the physical and social infrastructure as well as the restoration of the region's ecosystem.The border region security dimension is another issue of great concern to Kenya. Our people and our security personnel have been subjected to numerous acts of banditry by armed gangs crossing into Kenya from Somalia. For this reason  we are reiterating our request to the Secretary-General to reinforce the UNOSOM patrols along the Somalia side of the border so as to complement the efforts of Kenyan security personnel on our side of the border. We believe that the joint security efforts will significantly scale down the flow of armed gangs and individuals into the Kenyan side.The problem in the Sudan has been of great concern not only to Kenya and the neighbouring countries  but also to the international community. After four rounds of negotiations in the past year  it has become apparent that the regional peace efforts spearheaded by Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda  Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea and Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia  under the chairmanship of President Daniel T. Arap Moi of Kenya  within the framework of Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGAD)  have so far not been able to bridge the differences between the parties to the conflict. We appeal to all parties involved in the conflict to be flexible in the search for a just and lasting solution. The international community has an important role to play not only in terms of humanitarian assistance but also in facilitating the settlement of the fundamental differences between the parties. In this regard  Kenya is very grateful to the Governments of Norway  the Netherlands  the United Kingdom and the many others that have generously provided material and financial assistance to the process.On Bosnia and Herzegovina  we are greatly concerned that despite many serious attempts at a negotiated settlement no solution is in sight. Kenya strongly appeals to the combatants to opt for a negotiated settlement for the sake of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Kenya is substantially involved in United Nations peace-keeping activities  having contributed military and civilian police personnel to various peace-keeping operations world wide. The enormous rise in the number and scope of peace-keeping operations demands that the ability of the United Nations Secretariat to cope with such large-scale operations be strengthened.While peace-keeping will continue to be a vital responsibility of the United Nations  the adequate financing of these operations  which now represents a substantial portion of the United Nations budget  is critical to their success. In this regard  we urge Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time in order to enable the Organization to respond effectively to the enormous challenges posed by peace-keeping operations.The budgetary system for the peace-keeping operations also requires improvement. Notwithstanding the fact that peace-keeping operations are temporary by nature  it is cumbersome to approve budgets for periods of one to three months and usually retroactively. The current practice of piecemeal budgets compounds United Nations cash-flow problems  leading to the stifling of the operations of the Organization. Consequently  troop-contributing countries continue to subsidize United Nations peace-keeping operations at great sacrifice  a situation which cannot be sustained  especially by developing countries.My delegation is also concerned over the growing number of fatalities and injuries among United Nations peace-keeping soldiers and other personnel deployed by the Organization. In this regard  the ongoing efforts to elaborate a convention on responsibility for attacks on such personnel and measures to ensure that the culprits are brought to justice is a positive response by the international community to this problem.The world's economy continues to reflect sharp contrasts between countries and regions  with the industrialized countries  China and the South-East Asia region showing slight to rapid economic growth rates. The situation in Africa  on the other hand  is still of great concern  as the region's economy continues to show no signs of tangible recovery. The continent remains highly vulnerable to adverse international economic policies as well as to natural calamities  such as drought and epidemics  owing to its limited capacity to develop institutions and systems to cushion populations from these types of calamities. This situation has been compounded by the persistent recurrence of drought  debt burden  a decline in financial flows  low commodity prices  and the implementation of painful but necessary economic reforms and the uncertainties associated with major political reforms.My country and many other African countries have in the past few years undertaken fundamental reforms to create  among other things  an environment conducive to encouraging investment flows as a necessary ingredient for economic growth and development. This underscores the determination of the African countries to speed up the recovery and growth of the economies. However  the sustainability of these efforts requires increased international assistance to facilitate an early realization of the objectives of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa. We hope that at this time  when many developing countries are implementing major structural reforms and the liberalization of trade policies  the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the setting-up of the World Trade Organization will lead to the elimination of all trade barriers and the expansion of international trade.The mounting debt burden of the African countries  especially those of sub-Saharan Africa  continues to be a major constraint to economic growth and development. The problem of debt in Africa is worsened by the persistent low economic growth rates of the continent's economies. It is evident that the various measures taken by the international community on bilateral and multilateral bases to mitigate the situation  though welcome  have achieved limited results. Kenya believes that a lasting solution to the debt burden is a bold initiative for an effective reduction or cancellation of the bilateral and multilateral debt of the low-income countries  particularly in Africa.The ""Agenda for Development""  as an instrument for the promotion of an action-oriented approach to economic growth and development parallel to the ""Agenda for Peace"" as presented by the Secretary-General  should be given paramount attention by this Assembly. The essence of it should be the recognition that development is a fundamental human right and that peace and development are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Kenya affirms  however  that the State continues to bear the primary responsibility for its development while recognizing the importance of the complementary role of the international community.Kenya subscribes fully to the view that the new Agenda for Development should be people-centred. While recognizing the importance of overall economic development needs  action programmes must give appropriate priority to the education  training  health and welfare of the people. The Agenda should take into account the fundamental role of science and technology in socio-economic development  particularly for developing countries. Indeed  the new Agenda for Development should become an instrument for promoting a new consensus on international cooperation for development  rather than a process of negotiations for financial needs.Kenya welcomes the finalization of the elaboration of an international convention to combat desertification. The degradation of fragile dry lands is increasing at an accelerated rate and claiming millions of hectares every year. The afflicted countries are fully aware of their responsibilities to fight this imminent threat  but their efforts will not bear fruit without the support of the international community. The mobilization of resources as called for in Agenda 21 remains critical. Commitments of new and additional financial resources to fund environmental projects  as agreed upon in Rio  should be honoured. My delegation welcomes the recent restructuring and replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility as a positive step towards the fulfilment of some of the Rio commitments.My delegation welcomes the establishment of the Office of Internal Oversight Services  headed by an Under-Secretary-General. We hope that the establishment of this Office will lead to greater efficiency and the reduction of waste and mismanagement  which the international community can ill afford. We also hope that the United Nations will now foster greater transparency in the awarding of United Nations contracts and in the procurement of goods and services  taking into account the cost-effectiveness of obtaining such goods and services from sources closer to the recipient countries.As a country that is host to one of the United Nations centres  Kenya wishes to reiterate its commitment to cooperating with the United Nations in its efforts to strengthen the United Nations Centre in Nairobi  the capacity of which remains underutilized despite its enormous potential. In this connection  Kenya urges that the permanent secretariats of environmentally-related conventions  including those on biodiversity  climate change and desertification  be located in Nairobi  taking into full account the need for utilization of the capacity of the new secretariats and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as well as the human-settlement secretariats based in the United Nations Centre in Nairobi. Indeed  this would be consistent with the wish of the General Assembly and the governing bodies of the two organizations concerned  which have called for the strengthening  harmonization  cost-effectiveness and enhancement of the efficiency of UNEP and other United Nations programmes.The recently concluded International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo clearly underlines the resolve of the international community to coordinate actions and strategies on social development as envisaged in the United Nations Charter. The resolve of the international community to deal with the problems of population and development in accordance with the Cairo Programme ofAction  which was adopted by consensus  gives us a strong basis for tackling population problems.Kenya associates itself with the preparations and anticipated positive results of the forthcoming World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. We hope that the Summit will come up with programmes and commitments which will effectively address the problems of poverty and social integration and lead to sustainable economic growth and broad-based social development. We are of the view that national action and international cooperation should give priority to the eradication of poverty  the elimination of obstacles to economic and social development  the expansion of productive employment  and the creation of a favourable international economic and social environment.The Fourth World Conference on Women  to be held in Beijing  China  in 1995 offers a suitable opportunity to build on the successes of the 1985 Nairobi Forward- looking Strategies and to solidify the gains of women in all spheres of life. All necessary steps at the national  - regional and international levels should be taken to develop a political  economic  social and cultural environment conducive to the full integration of women into sustainable processes of development.Kenya also looks forward to the successful outcome of the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) to be held in Istanbul  Turkey  in 1996. In order to ensure broad-based national preparations for the Conference  the national Steering Committee has prepared a work programme incorporating the mobilization of action in the shelter sector so as to create public awareness. My delegation acknowledges the significant progress made in the preparatory process by the HABITAT II secretariat in Nairobi  under the direction of the Secretary-General of the Conference  Mr. Wally N'Dow. However  financial limitations are hampering elements of the preparatory process. We hope that these constraints will soon be overcome.Any durable international system must have a sound legal regime  backed by principles of respect for and compliance with the rule of law at domestic and international levels. The recognition by States of their obligation to abide by these principles is not only an indispensable requirement  but also forms the fabric of international norms and standards which guide lawful international behaviour.It is in this context  therefore  that we hail the decision to hold an International Congress on International Law in March 1995 here in New York  under the framework of the United Nations Decade of International Law.In 1989  Kenya joined the growing number of nations that have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A few weeks from today  on 16 November 1994  the world community will witness the entry into force of this Convention. This long-awaited event  which marks the culmination of a process started many years ago  is a significant milestone in the human endeavour to create a new legal order for the oceans.African States do not possess the requisite scientific knowledge  technological capacity and management skills to be able to explore and exploit the marine living and non-living resources. The Convention  as well as Agenda 21  both of which furnish the basic blueprint for cooperation in marine and ocean areas  have laid emphasis on the significance of the development of manpower  technological capacity and training  particularly in the developing countries. We believe that these and other allied problems should be addressed to enable African countries to derive benefits from the rights and opportunities offered by the Convention. It is our hope that  following the successful conclusion and adoption of the agreement on the implementation of deep seabed mining  all States will now become parties to the Convention  in order to secure universal participation.In conclusion  we feel confident that  as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  the international community has the requisite resources and talents to deal effectively with the global concerns and challenges facing it. In particular  the Organization will have to address the crucial issues of maintenance of international peace and security  sustainable development  the environment  humanitarian issues and reform of the United Nations. In conformity with the aspirations of the Charter expressed in the words ""We the peoples""  everybody throughout the world has high expectations of this Organization. We cannot and must not let them down"
"89",3719,"KGZ",49,1994,"I wish to congratulate the President on hisappointment to this highly responsible and important post.My delegation will work constructively with him during thecourse of this  the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations.Since the end of the Second World War  the fiftiethanniversary of which we shall be celebrating next year  theworld has been engaged in peace-building. It has been along road  and it has not been without its dramaticmoments. Over the past half century the world has cometo the brink of nuclear war many times. Now  with the endof the cold war  with the dissolution of the bipolar world a new challenge has arisen in the shape of a series of warsand conflicts based on ethnic and religious intolerance thathave exploded in many different areas of the world.In his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" the SecretaryGeneral spoke of the concentration of efforts towardspreventive diplomacy  of steps for increasing internationalconfidence-building and achieving early recognition ofconflict situations. Such measures have taken on specialimportance in our countries with the fall oftotalitarianism  because we have inherited many long-standing issues of conflict that had previously beenhidden and suppressed by a regime of terror in theconditions of that time.The United Nations  in our view  could play aleadership role in the study of typical conflict situations.It could systematize the approaches  principles and pathsfor the resolution of traditional issues of dispute such asborder issues  the sharing or allocation of water and othernatural resources  the self-determination of nations andterritorial integrity  and the protection of minorities on thebasis of ethnic  religious  linguistic and other differences.This would allow the United Nations to establish a legalbasis for decisions that would help decrease the potentialfor new conflicts and aid in the resolution of existingproblems. Only by following the highest authority oflaw  and only on the basis of international law  can weweave a solid fabric of peace throughout the planet  in allof its smallest corners  no matter how remote orprovincial.Violence and intolerance among people have led tounending war and bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia.The tragedy of Bosnia poses a challenge to allhumankind. Fifty years ago the nations of this world having united  put an end to nazism and genocide. Whythen are we now moving so slowly in the face of theviolence that is obviously based on ethnic and religiousdiscrimination and that is reverberating throughout theplanet? We stand for a political settlement of conflicts.We call for both sides to put an end to the bloodyslaughter. In our view  the recommendations of theContact Group provide a way out of this crisis and hopethat peace can be restored in the heart of Europe.We greatly value the efforts of the Secretary-General  his Mission and the Observer Group of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE) to resolve issues peacefully in Tajikistan. Wewelcome the recently signed cease-fire in Tehran  inaccordance with which hostilities have temporarily ceasedand political prisoners and prisoners of war are beingreleased. We have great hope for the gradual end of thiscrisis and for the unification of the Tajik peoples  whohave experienced more than enough sorrow and suffering for the return of all refugees to their homes and for therestoration of peace with our neighbours. We express thishope now  before the coming winter  and call upon all31countries to render vitally important humanitarian aid toTajikistan.We are following with great concern and alarm thesituation in Afghanistan and welcome the efforts towardssettlement. The restoration of peace in that country and theachievement of national reconciliation would bring long-awaited peace to the Afghan people  who have suffered somuch  and drastically improve the situation in our region ofthe world. That region is exhausted from gunfire and war.It is yearning for trade and a return to tilling the soil.Notwithstanding the tremendous difficulties inherentin our search for peace and accord in that country  we urgethe world not to give in either to moral or to donor fatigue.It is not possible to dodge responsibilities during this tryingperiod because the deadly conflict in this country has beenbrought about by participation on many different sides.Afghanistan has a plethora of weapons. The country isprey to a non-stop and intensive arms race. Hope for peacecan be guaranteed only if the international communitydevotes its unwavering attention and political will tounravelling the knot of the Afghan conflict.That is why my country has consistently called forcompletion and effective implementation of the Register ofConventional Weapons. We support the initiative of theUnited States announced by President Clinton on theratification of and support for General Assembly resolution48/75 K of 16 December 1993 on a moratorium on theexport of land-mines.The Kyrgyz Republic has consistently stood for acomprehensive  effective reduction in conventional arms.We are actively and diligently working on the conversionof our defence industry to civilian production. Kyrgyzstan as a non-nuclear State  signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and advocatestransforming it into an agreement of unlimited duration.We welcome the efforts of all countries - and first andforemost the United States of America and France - toreach a consensus on the issue of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban.We support the initiatives put forward by PresidentNazarbayev of Kazakhstan on confidence-building measuresin Asia  and we envisage our region of Central Asia located as it is between two nuclear Powers  as an area freeof nuclear weapons. That would be our Central Asiantreaty.Our world  so full of anxiety and so weary  believesthat hope for peace is not an illusion. I recall with greatexcitement the unseasonably warm day of 13 September1993 at the White House in Washington when  after manyyears of conflict  a declaration of principles on Palestinianself-rule in Gaza and Jericho was signed by the IsraeliGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization.It is with great satisfaction and happiness that we seetogether with us in this Hall representatives of theGovernment of South Africa that was elected on ademocratic basis. Let us stock up on patience. We canachieve breakthroughs and visible results on the difficultpath to peace and concord only if we do not give in tofatalism.United Nations peace-keeping efforts are achievingsignificant success in settling many of the conflicts of ourtime. We know that 75 countries are participating in 17United Nations Missions overseeing the holding andmonitoring of elections  rendering humanitarian assistanceduring disasters and restoring what has been destroyed  aswell as ensuring a United Nations military and policepresence. The issue of creating reserve peace-keepingforces has now been raised. From this rostrum we hearthe commitment of dozens of countries to peace-keepingoperations. We need the blue helmets of peace  not themercenary black helmets of death which have recentlyparticipated with increasing frequency in conflict zonesaround the world.Fully aware that peace-keeping operations are animportant factor in the future new world order  mycountry  with its highly qualified doctors  nurses engineers and rescue workers  would like to participate inpeace-keeping operations. We accept and support theproposals that many countries have made here at theGeneral Assembly during discussions of peace-keepingissues with regard to the need and opportunities forconducting training of military and civilian personnel onboth a multilateral and a bilateral basis. Such possibilitiesare also open to us as participants in the Partnership forPeace programme of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO).As a country experiencing a period of emergencyand in need of immediate assistance because of naturaldisasters and social hardships  we warmly support theproposal of Argentina’s President Menem that a civilianservice be created to provide immediate humanitarianassistance under the auspices of the United Nations.32Development is the main problem facing youngdemocratic societies. Thirty years’ experience of North-South collaboration has taught us  the new 1990s generationof independent countries  instructive lessons. It is easy forour achievements and our real advantages to become lost inthe picture of the protracted drop in production levels andthe destruction of the social infrastructure. The people ofKyrgyzstan are grateful to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  the World Health Organization(WHO)  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) and other institutions in theUnited Nations family that have sought to help us at thisdifficult time.In the face of a sharp increase in drug trafficking interwoven with transnational organized crime  first in ourregion and then through Russia to Europe and othercontinents  we need energetic and massive measures toblock the drug-distribution routes and destroy production.The United Nations International Drug Control Programmehas become truly critical in our region. As a whole  wewould like to see greater action and coordination of thework of the United Nations specialized institutions with thenew States  both at their headquarters and in their regionaloffices.It is noteworthy that not only traditional developedcountries  but also developing countries  which bear theburden of their own numerous economic and socialproblems  have helped in the establishment of the newlyindependent States and their entry into the world order.And this has particular significance. We are firmlyconvinced that the timely rendering of full-fledged effective assistance to us - countries with transitionaleconomies that must now choose their own paths at thisdifficult time - will help us to stand more quickly on ourown two feet  form the foundation for a market economyand develop democratic foundations for society. Weourselves will then be able to render speedier assistance tothe more needy. We support such a policy of reaching outtowards solidarity  mutual support and collaboration.Bearing in mind the close collaboration of countrieswith transitional economies with international financial andeconomic institutions  precise coordination and deeperinteraction of the work of the United Nations and theBretton Woods institutions are becoming increasinglynecessary.The Kyrgyz Republic welcomes and shares theobjectives and fundamental parameters of development setforth in the preliminary report of the Secretary-General ""An Agenda for Development"". These are peace economic growth  the environment  justice anddemocracy.The recent World Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo and future Conferences on socialdevelopment and the improvement of the status of womentestify to the world’s deep concern about the situation ofbasic human needs at the turn of the next century. Ifhuman rights are all-inclusive  universal and inalienable then these rights also pertain to all women and childrenon Earth. The improvement of the status of women iskey to resolving vital social problems such as thoseinvolving population  education and health care. In otherwords  it is the most important issue on the eve of thetwenty-first century for an agenda for humanity.In my country  we will fully support and are readyto cooperate with the newly appointed United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. We inKyrgyzstan  a country in which over 80 ethnicities reside seek to create equal and just conditions for all of ourcitizens. There are no restrictions on the development ofculture  the arts  education or media in the languages ofall ethnic groups. Along with an increase in mosques  thenumber of Orthodox and Protestant churches is growing.Committed to ideas of friendship and concord  we areconsistently working on programmes and measures to haltmigration from our country and to preserve the presentmulti-ethnic composition of society. On the basis of theDeclaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging toNational or Ethnic  Religious and Linguistic Minoritiesadopted at the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  my country  together with the RussianFederation  cosponsored a CIS convention on the rights ofethnic minorities  which is currently open for ratificationto all other Commonwealth members.Democracy in my country is very fragile. Politicalpluralism  freedom of the press and speech  and adherenceto human rights and fundamental freedoms in theRepublic are not accidental gifts from above but genuinevalues for which a real struggle is being waged in society- the struggle between openness and isolation  blind forceand respect for the law  totalitarian ways and commitmentto freedom. But the people of Kyrgyzstan  headed byPresident Askar Akaev  having made its choice threeyears ago  firmly and unwaveringly stand for democracyand a market economy.33A tectonic political  social  and economic shift istaking place across the enormous Eurasian land mass. Thesuccess of the present transformations in Russia strengthensour own awareness of the irrevocability of the choice of thedemocratic way. Kyrgyzstan  like other nations of theCommonwealth of Independent States  is deeply committedto democracy  the principles of freedom and independence and the philosophy and spirit of the creation of peace. Myancient people  yet still a young nation  like the ""Manas"" -a Kyrgyz epic poem of a million lines - the millennium ofwhich we will celebrate in 1995  is undergoing arenaissance. We realize that a long and thorny path awaitsus. But the most important thing on that path is peace which is the same for everyone on this Earth and isindivisible."
"90",3764,"KHM",49,1994,"On this solemn occasion allow me first toconvey to you  Sir  on behalf of the Cambodian delegation heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidencyof the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. Your election is very important because it is atribute not only to your diplomatic skills  to someoneexperienced in international affairs  but also to the tirelesswork done by Côte d’Ivoire  your glorious country  forpeace.I am delighted to take this opportunity to convey toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally our satisfaction at the exemplary way in which hepresided over the work of last year’s session of theGeneral Assembly.We wish also to congratulate the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  on themany efforts he has constantly made for peace andsecurity throughout the world since he has been at thehead of the Organization. The Kingdom of Cambodiareiterates its firm support to the Secretary-General.(spoke in English)It gives me particular pride to be here today as therepresentative of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The RoyalGovernment under the First Prime Minister  His RoyalHighness Prince Norodom Ranariddh  and the SecondPrime Minister  Samdech Hun Sen  was installed as thelegitimate Government of Cambodia a little more than ayear ago  on 24 September 1993  through the foresight generosity and courage of the Members of the UnitedNations and the bravery of the Cambodian people inchoosing  through United Nations-sponsored elections  aliberal democracy  building up national reconciliationunder the high guidance of His Majesty King NorodomSihanouk.I have come here today to represent the Cambodianpeople in expressing our warmest gratitude to theMembers of the United Nations for their wonderful gift offreedom. After 23 years of war Cambodia is now atpeace and able to start to move towards development social justice and prosperity. This has not been an easytask because our financial base is still very low. As amember of the group of least developed countries Cambodia remains one of the poorest countries in theworld and a large proportion of its people are saddledwith crushing poverty. But  again  the United Nations isat our side. The Bretton Woods institutions are helpingus to re-establish a solid fiscal base and the specializedagencies have almost all moved in to assist developmentand strengthen our institutions.In the economic field  there has been some progressover the past few years. According to the 1992 report the inflation rate was estimated to be 300 per cent  but in1993 it dropped to 70 per cent. This year our localcurrency is very stable: 1 dollar is equal to 2 500 riels.Bilateral donors have also been generous  and asassistance moves from the area of emergency10rehabilitation to that of reconstruction  achievements arebeginning to be noted.However  the most important of the RoyalGovernment’s priorities for reconstruction and ruraldevelopment have unfortunately lagged behind other kindsof development. The constraints of distance  aninfrastructure ruined by two decades of war and acontinuing insurgency have hampered efforts  but in oursecond year of office  the Government  together with ourfriends  will tackle those problems. Infrastructure can berebuilt  and our king  His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk  isleading the move for reconciliation with the insurgents  theso-called Khmer Rouge group  who do not recognize theUnited Nations-sponsored elections and continue tochallenge the legally elected democratic government  andabove all have rejected the cease-fire that has beenproposed through His Majesty’s tireless efforts.Please allow me to reiterate  on behalf of all thepeople of Cambodia  our deep and lasting gratitude to all ofthe States Members of the United Nations and to theindividual bilateral donors who have so generouslysupported reconstruction in our country  both through theUnited Nations and its institutions  and through theirpledges at the first and second ministerial meetings of theIntergovernmental Committees on the Reconstruction ofCambodia (ICORC)  held in Paris and Tokyo respectively.With the assistance of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) we have now developed our firstcountry programme  which will be presented to theExecutive Board of UNDP on 6 October 1994.The UNDP is also assisting us to reform the civiladministration within Cambodia.Many other specialized agencies of the United Nationsare also doing excellent work within the country: the UnitedNations Population Fund  the United Nations Children’sFund  the International Labour Organization  the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations and the World Food Programme  to name a few.Cambodia has itself been through the holocaust oftyranny  invasion and internal disturbances. Our NationalAssembly is now in the process of restoring Cambodia asa judicial State where human rights  political pluralism liberal democracy and  above all  freedom of expression arerespected  as envisaged in our Constitution. To this end we have been grateful for the support and encouragementof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations  whose close cooperation with theCambodian Government has helped us in our task of re-establishing law and confidence in the country.Cambodia is the only country in the region to haveasked the Secretary-General of the United Nations todispatch a special representative for human rights. Incomparison with the twenty years of war andtotalitarianism under the previous regimes  progress hasbeen made. We also appreciate the early visit of thenewly appointed United Nations Commissioner forHuman Rights  the Honorable José Ayala Lasso.Because of our own terrible experiences  Cambodiafeels to the depths of its soul for the plight of theordinary people in Rwanda. We congratulate theinternational community for its intervention in Rwandaand we are pleased to see that the situation is nowstabilized. In particular  we wish to applaud andcommend the French for the rapid action they took tohelp put an end to the killing and suffering of theRwandese people.On the same basis  Cambodia wishes to call on therival factions in the former Yugoslavia to stop theirfighting and cooperate with the United Nations.Cambodia is  of course  well acquainted with the SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General inthe former Yugoslavia  His Excellency Mr. YasushiAkashi  and is full of admiration for  and confidence in his efforts to restore peace and security to the people ofthat troubled region.Again  from the Cambodian experience of usingdemocratic elections as a catalyst for peace  we wish tocongratulate the people of South Africa and the newdemocratic government led by President Nelson Mandela on their move towards a normalization of the lives of thepeople and on the return of South Africa to the world’sembrace.Cambodia fully supports the Geneva Declaration of12 August 1994 between the United States of Americaand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea andhopes that the Declaration will be fully and sincerelyimplemented. Cambodia strongly supports the earnestdesires of the Korean people who  in the not-too-distantfuture  will bring their beloved country towards fullreunification.Cambodia welcomed the just initiative taken by theinternational community on the question of Haiti to avoid11bloodshed and to oversee the smooth transition to ademocratically elected government. Cambodia calls on thepeople of Haiti to work towards the national reconciliationand development of their country under the democraticallyelected president  Jean Bertrand Aristide.We pray for an end to the senseless killing inAfghanistan  so that the Afghan people may be able toresume their normal lives and rebuild and develop theirwar-torn nation.We are pleased to see the political outcome inNorthern Ireland and hope that peace and happiness willsoon return to that beautiful land.The situation in the Middle East has brought us greatjoy. The peace agreement between Israel and thePalestinian people is the most encouraging historical eventof our time.The recent accord between Israel and Jordan isdefinitely the right step towards peace  security and stabilityin that region. We encourage others to follow the exampleof this discussion for a peaceful world.Cambodia is situated in south-east Asia  in the Asia-Pacific region. As we have moved towards developmentand prosperity for the Kingdom we have welcomed thefriendship of the member countries of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which invitedCambodia to be a special guest for the second time at thetwenty-seventh annual ministerial meeting held in Bangkokin July 1994. At an appropriate time  Cambodia looksforward with great enthusiasm to full membership inASEAN. We will be delighted to see all 10 countries ofour subregion one day join in the great ASEAN family.This will be a positive development for harmony andsecurity in our part of the world. ASEAN has done a greatdeal for Cambodia during our difficult years  and for thiswe are eternally grateful to all of its six distinguishedmembers: Brunei  Indonesia  Malaysia  Philippines Singapore and Thailand. Cambodia also welcomes thepositive developments around the continuing growth of theAsia Pacific Economic Community. To use the economicachievements of the most prosperous of the nations of ourwider region as a springboard for further growth  peace andstability is something that Cambodia highly values.(spoke in French)In addition to the constant efforts made by theCambodian authorities to rebuild our country after thedisastrous 20 years of war  Cambodia also aspires torejoin the international community as a State of law.The policy of neutrality and peaceful coexistenceadvocated by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk sincethe period of Sangkum Reastr Niyum - People’s SocialistCommunity - which lasted from the 1950s to the 1970s remains the key to our foreign policy in order to promotepeace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.Cambodia is committed to development and peacefor the well-being of our people  and we heartily welcomethe important appeal by Mr. Clinton  President of theUnited States  for the elimination of anti-personnel land-mines throughout the world  as the sine qua non fordevelopment and lasting peace. Our people bear the scarsof these deadly practices  and a sincere commitment fromthe international community would save the lives ofinnocent men  women and children throughout the world.We would like to take this opportunity to thank sincerelyall donor countries for their generous contributions to theCambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC).The globalization of national socio-cultural policiescan be harmonious only if there is close and sincerecooperation between the industrialized countries and thedeveloping countries. Hence  we wish to pay tribute tothe international community for its support for theInternational Committee to Save the Temples of AngkorWat  in particular  the valuable work done by UNESCOand the École Française d’extrème orient. The templesof Angkor Wat  one of the seven wonders of the world have been designated the common heritage of mankind.Cambodia is also concerned about environmentalissues  and will be signing the Agreement to CombatDesertification in Paris.Cambodia welcomes the convening of the WorldSummit for Social Development  to be held inCopenhagen  and the World Conference on Women  to beheld in Beijing next year. We give particular attention tothe development of our human sources  because of itsimplications for the process of social stabilization.Cambodia will actively participate in the work of thesesummits.12Cambodia welcomes the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations and has already set up anational committee to participate in various events to beheld next year.Before concluding  I wish to voice sincere gratitude tothe United Nations for the deployment of peace-keepingforces  and Cambodia takes this opportunity to inform theinternational community that it will make available its smallpeace-keeping forces at the request of this Organization.In conclusion  Cambodia remains convinced thatMember States will respond to emergencies and will meettheir obligations. Cambodia is solemnly committed tocomplying with the United Nations Charter."

The convening of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the UnitedNations provides the Governments of all Member Stateswith an important opportunity to reaffirm theircommitment to the cause of peace  democracy and thepursuit of a higher quality of life for our peoples.I wish to join other representatives by extendingwarmest congratulations from the Government of SaintKitts and Nevis to you  Mr. President  on your election topreside at this session of the General Assembly. I assureyou of my Government’s continued support andcooperation.Allow me  Sir  to thank the outgoing President  HisExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally  for the astute and mostable manner in which he conducted and guided the affairsof this body during its forty-eighth session despiteunprecedented trials and numerous challenges. Hisresolve and his successes give credence to hiscommitment to the planting of seeds of cooperation andgoodwill in every corner of the globe to ensure that ourchildren and grandchildren may feast on harvests ofpeace  equality  freedom and democracy.The Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  has faced many problems of greatcomplexity during the past year. I wish to congratulatehim on the outstanding manner in which he has beencarrying out the mandate of the Organization.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis shares thecommitment to democracy  respect for human dignity andthe protection of human rights. Our people enjoy the1effective workings of the democratic process and thesafeguards provided by its institutions. We are determinedto do all that we can  in our time  to ensure that futuregenerations too will be able to exercise their democraticfreedoms in an atmosphere of political stability.There is an ever-increasing thirst for democracythroughout the world. In our hemisphere  military regimeshave been giving way to democratically electedGovernments.Nowhere has this process been more dramatic than inHaiti  where  in 1991  the people  in free and fair electionsunder the keen scrutiny of the international community chose Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President. For almostfour years the will of the people of Haiti and the resolve ofthe international community have been callously frustratedby the military  who usurped and have held on to power.Saint Kitts and Nevis is in full agreement with theresolute action taken by the United States  with the supportof the international community  to ensure compliance withSecurity Council resolution 940 (1994). The multinationalforce has been carrying out its work with dedication professionalism and restraint. While there have been someuntoward incidents  we must not be deterred. We must beprepared to stay the course for the benefit of the people ofHaiti and for the growth of stable democracy in thishemisphere.The process of establishing democracy will not endwith the return of President Aristide; it will have justbegun. In order to support the process  it is absolutelyessential that the international community be ready tomobilize significant financial and technical resources toensure the rebuilding of Haiti’s economy and institutions -institutions destroyed by decades of neglect andmismanagement. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready toassist in the long and arduous task of helping the Haitianpeople rebuild their economy.For many years the international community struggledto bring democracy to the majority of the people of SouthAfrica. Today South Africa can be held up as a beacon ofhope and a testament to the triumph of democracy. Lastyear my delegation welcomed the announcement of theholding of non-racial and multi-party elections - somethingfor which my Government had been calling since joiningthis Organization 11 years ago. We have successfully andemphatically closed the final chapter of the brutal andunjust system of apartheid  and a new and democratic SouthAfrica has emerged from its ashes.However  despite the successes  the new SouthAfrica is still on the threshold of unprecedentedchallenges. The journey is long and arduous  but thecountry’s leaders and its people have a wonderfulopportunity to right historical wrongs while at the sametime charting a new and purposeful course in their future.The amalgamated voice of the people of South Africa hasbeen heard  not only within that country but the worldover. They have put their faith in the democratic process.As South Africa sails the fresh and often tumultuouswaters of representative democracy and attempts toinstitutionalize social justice  St. Kitts and Nevis reiteratesits commitment to join with the international communityto give that country and its people the requisite support todevelop lasting democratic and social institutions toensure that democracy does work and is seen to work forevery single citizen.The contrasting realities of our world are quite realand apparent. Whenever we believe that we have solvedone major problem  another presents itself elsewhere.This notwithstanding  we can all be pleased at the currentmovement towards peace under way in the Middle East.Not long ago the prospect of peace in any form seemedpractically impossible. However  today the peace processseems to be gaining a firm foothold in that region. Theinternational community must be ready to give unreservedsupport to that process and afford it more durablemechanisms for success.My Government welcomes the consolidation ofpeace and the efforts at cooperation between theGovernment of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. No one could have predicted that so muchwould have been possible  and in so short a time. Therapidly changing face of Middle East politics augurs wellfor the overall peace process  quality of life and stabilityof the entire region. In this spirit  my delegation applaudsthe joint Declaration officially ending the state ofbelligerency between the State of Israel and theHashemite Kingdom of Jordan. This historic event marksyet another bold and positive step on the road to ensuringa lasting peace in the Middle East. My Government callsupon the countries in the Middle East to give peace apractical chance.As prospects for peace continue to flourish in theMiddle East  the tranquillity of the Gulf region is onceagain being threatened by an Iraqi troop build-up near theKuwait border. It is time for the people of Kuwait to feelsecure within their own borders. It is time for fullcompliance by Iraq with Security Council resolutions2pertaining to the aggression against Kuwait. It is time forKuwait nationals detained in Iraq to be returned to theirhomeland. It is time for Iraq to pursue peaceful policieswith its neighbours. Once again the Government ofSt. Kitts and Nevis urges the Government of Iraq to respectthe finalization of the demarcation of the boundary betweenKuwait and Iraq  which was accomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on20 May 1993  and to respect and abide by Security Councilresolution 833 (1993)  which guarantees the inviolability ofthe boundary between the two States. It is the fervent hopeof the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis that internationalsupport for this resolution will act as a deterrent  both nowand in the future  against conflict between Kuwait and Iraqand will at the same time help enhance stability andsecurity in the region.The constantly changing realities of the present worldsituation call for Member Governments to harden traditionalattitudes while making genuine attempts to search forpragmatic solutions requiring different and unprecedentedapproaches and compromises. It was against this backdropthat at the last session of the General Assembly myGovernment called upon the warring factions in theYugoslavian conflict to come to the negotiating table.We note with great satisfaction that the leaders ofCroatia and Bosnia and Herzergovina have managed toarrive at a peaceful settlement of disputes. However  myGovernment abhors the wanton murder  ""ethnic cleansing""and systematic persecution of innocent people which stillcharacterize the brutal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.These atrocities and the flagrant and consistent violation ofhuman rights are an affront to everything we as humanbeings hold sacred. The international community mustcontinue to express its just indignation at the atrocities inthis arena of conflict. At the same time  we must pursueall initiatives to find a just and lasting solution  preferablyat the negotiating table.Last year my delegation commended this body for itstireless efforts to keep the international community from thebrink of nuclear warfare and called upon all countriessignatories to the Treaty on non-proliferation to continue toabide by it and to urge those who had not yet becomeparties to it to do so. We repeat this plea today. We alsolook forward to an indefinite ban on all nuclear testing.I must reiterate  however  that we should not stopthere  but should aim also for the non-proliferation of allweapons  including chemical  biological and conventional.In this regard  St. Kitts and Nevis also supports themoratorium on the export of land-mines  and goes evenfurther by calling for a ban on their manufacture as wellas their export. Land-mines continue to cause tremendousmisery and untold hardship for many populations world-wide long after conflicts have ended. In most cases thevictims of these land-mines are poor farmers and innocentchildren.It is our sacred and solemn responsibility as worldleaders to ensure a safe world for our nation’s children.My delegation therefore congratulates the United Nationson its consistent efforts to fulfil its humanitarian missionsin the many different theatres of tragic sufferingworld-wide. The humanitarian catastrophe which hasbeen unfolding in Rwanda threatens to destabilize thefragile economic and political balance of its neighbours.The scope and scale of this human disaster unprecedented in the history of modern-day Africa should catapult us to seek a peaceful end to the crisis.Reports on the revolting policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" andindiscriminate massacres of women and children strike afamiliar  mind-wrenching note in our collective psyche.Although its resources are minuscule  St. Kitts andNevis could not fail to make a financial contribution tothe United Nations relief effort in Rwanda. We must actdecisively to mobilize more resources from every possiblesource to intensify the relief effort in that tragic country.We  the Members of the United Nations cannotpamper our consciences with pious speeches on what theUnited Nations ought to do to alleviate the suffering while at the same time rendering the Organizationimpotent by refusing to give it the necessary financial andmaterial capabilities it so desperately needs to carry outits functions more effectively.The United Nations is being called upon with greaterfrequency to respond to a greater variety of conflicts suffering and development needs. If the Organization isto be able to respond effectively  we must evaluate fromtime to time not only our resources  but the way in whichwe manage those resources  and ensure that there isgreater accountability in such management. In short  theUnited Nations  recognizing the responsibilities entrustedto it by the international community  must be moreaccountable to its Members. What we are suggesting therefore  is a more balanced relationship predicated onthe principles of responsibility and accountability. Thedelegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the creationof the Office of Internal Oversight Services; its creationis not an end in itself  but a means to ensure that there isgreater accountability within the Organization.3We must remain cognizant of the fact that thefundamental sovereignty of all States  large or small  isrespected equally by the United Nations. If necessary  theUnited Nations will protect the rights of the small againstthe power of the large. It has institutionalized the rights ofsmall and micro States to exist and to coexist with the bigand powerful nations. All independent States  therefore irrespective of their size and population  are equal underinternational law. Every effort should be made  therefore to enable small States to participate more fully in the day-to-day decision-making process of the United Nations. Oneway to achieve this is through more equitable geographicalrepresentation within the Secretariat  and I appeal for thisto be implemented.Another way in which the United Nations can be mademore globally inclusive is by bringing more Members intothe fold. Last year  my Government called upon the UnitedNations to begin the process that would lead to the ultimatere-admission of the Republic of China in Taiwan into theUnited Nations.My Government stands firmly behind that appeal andwe repeat this appeal here today. The Republic of Chinain Taiwan continues to adhere to the Charter of the UnitedNations and to govern itself by the principles ofinternational and humanitarian law. It has provenrepeatedly that it is a country committed to peace democracy and development  not only for its 21 millionpeople  who are entitled to proper representationinternationally  but for all peoples  that their quality of lifemay be improved. The Republic of China in Taiwan is amajor international player in commerce  trade anddevelopment assistance  and would make a significantcontribution to the work of the United Nations.I would now like to turn our attention to the questionof sustainable development and small States  and tocommend quite highly the efforts of the United Nations inbringing the reality and concerns of small island developingStates to the forefront of international focus.The Declaration of Barbados is a step in the rightdirection. It recognizes that small island developing Stateshave special and peculiar needs. We  in small islanddeveloping States have been saying this for a long time.Our very survival as a people and as independent States isdependent on the sustainable development of our humanresources and the maximization of our scarce materialresources. These limited material resources are underconstant and severe stress despite our efforts.Although we recognize the Conference in Barbadosas a giant step for small island developing States  thediscussion must be taken much further  beyondconference halls and into communities  and translated intopractical tangible benefits. In Saint Kitts and Nevis  forinstance  over the past ten years we have been engaged inprojects and programmes whereby we seek to create asound and pragmatic balance between economic andsocial development  on the one hand  and environmentalprotection on the other.However  existing problems and innovative attemptsby small island developing States to improve theirstandard of living very rarely receive consistent supportfrom the developed world. Micro States like Saint Kittsand Nevis are being called upon to prove their viabilitywithin the international community. The irony lies in thefact that when we manage to raise our standard of livingto a decent level  the international community withdrawsor reduces its support under the pretext that our GNP percapita is too high.I do not believe that we should have to reiterate thevulnerability index of small States like mine. AlthoughSaint Kitts and Nevis does not produce or use anysignificant amount of material to damage the ozone layeror contribute to coastal erosion and rising sea levels  weare among those which suffer most as a result of theirimpact. Small island States like mine suffer greatly fromenvironmental and natural disasters  yet we lack thecapacity to respond to and recover from them. Theobjective reality of our individual and collectiveexperience speaks volumes. We have seen how less thana month ago  tropical storm Debbie — insignificant really  as a tropical storm  not strong enough to be ahurricane — devastated the banana industry in SaintLucia  thus wreaking havoc on that country’s economy.We need special attention. We need special regimes.As I have done in the past  I appeal for greater equitywithin the international economic system. The time hascome for the developed world to rethink the outdatedpolicy of trying to make a single prescription fit allcountries. We need to develop a more durable  andcountry-specific approach  based on fairness  economiccircumstance and need. Above all  the concept of thevulnerability index must become part of the economiclanguage and armamentarium of all multilateral andnational development institutions.Indeed  the developing world should not view oursmall island Caribbean States as dumping grounds for4over-produced consumer items  but see us as developingeconomies whose fragile banana and sugar exports need tobe protected.The Declaration of Barbados underscores the fact thatsmall island States have sovereign rights over their naturalresources. The developed world  therefore  cannot claimpaternity over our biodiversity under the pretext that theirtechnology was used.Further  on the issue of the environment  I would liketo call upon the developed countries to de-link economicassistance  trade and investment from environmentalprotection. In most cases  small island developing Statesare penalized for allegedly exploiting limited resources andfor so-called environmental degradation.I urge the international community to assist developingcountries to obtain the wherewithal to gauge theexploitation of resources and to do environmental impactassessments so as to ensure that the precarious balance ismaintained.Social  economic and political advancement in smalldeveloping countries should not be held to ransom by theindustrialized world as a way of punishing them forenvironmental degradation. The protection and preservationof the environment is a global responsibility and mustengender a collective approach. The industrialized worldmust take responsibility for much of the damage to theenvironment and work towards a framework forinternational cooperation and partnership in preserving it.Developing countries ought to be given assistance andbe presented with alternatives to destroying the forest ordepleting the limited resources at their disposal. While theinternational community moves ever closer to therealization of economic blocs  special attention must also bedevoted to the fragile commodities export sector in some ofthese countries  and the need for special regimes to be putin place to ensure the viability of most of these smalleconomies  which do not have the advantage of economiesof scale and large consumer markets.I should like to repeat my fervent appeal toGovernments of developed countries and to multilateralagencies to become more supportive of and responsive tothe needs of small developing countries by providing thetechnical assistance  information-sharing  technologytransfer and investments  and to promote human resourcedevelopment through education and training.I call on the international community to honour itscommitment made in Barbados in May 1994:“The international community should cooperatewith small island developing States in theimplementation of the Programme of Action ... byproviding effective means  including adequate predictable new and additional financial resources inaccordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21;facilitating the transfer of environmentally soundtechnology  including on concessional andpreferential terms as mutually agreed”.(A/CONF.167/9  Annex I  Part Two  III.1)This will ensure success in achieving our goal ofsustainable development.There is nothing more noble than the gift of life. Atthe important and historic World Summit for Children of1990  participating Governments agreed to make theworld a much safer place for future generations ofchildren. At the United Nations Conference on smallStates  we decided to commit our efforts to the efficientuse of land resources  to work towards creating bettereducation and improved health care  and to exploit naturalresources on a sustainable basis.If we achieve this  we shall indeed be bequeathingto our children and their children a much safer world. Itis against the backdrop of safeguarding our children’sfuture that the Government of St. Kitts and Nevisparticipated in the International Conference on Populationand Development in Cairo. We fully support the viewthat the issue of population control must be addressed.Although we share the view that a populationexplosion may eventually threaten the Earth’s capacity toprovide in a sustainable manner  we do not believe thatsimply trying to control population growth will by itselfsolve the serious problems that we are facing today. MyGovernment is of the view that a concerted attempt toredeploy much of the world’s resources  to discover newresources and to use them more equitably would betterserve the interest of development for all peoples.I cannot but remind us all that the internationalmenace of drugs and drug trafficking still looms large.The danger and the trade are ever-increasing. We shouldcontinue to wage a determined and aggressive war ondrug trafficking and narco-terrorism  which seek toundermine and unravel the social and political fabric ofour societies.5The challenges facing the United Nations aremonumental  but not more so than those facing individualnations  large or small  or individuals in poor communities as well as in affluent societies. We occupy a globalcommon. Therefore  we must together find practicalsolutions to the problems of hunger  poverty  war  crime development and freedom in every corner of our world. Ifwe fail  none will be secure  none will be at peace  nonewill be free."
"92",3833,"KOR",49,1994,"May Icongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. I am convinced that your vast experience andyour leadership will contribute greatly to the success ofthe session. At the same time  I wish to acknowledge theexcellent work of your predecessor  Ambassador SamuelR. Insanally of Guyana  during the last session of theGeneral Assembly.I should like also to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisdedication to the cause of the United Nations.The evolution of the world scene since the lastsession confirms that we live in an age of historictransition. The encouraging developments in South Africaand in the Middle East confirm that conventionalparadigms of the international system are changing.Nations have become so interdependent that force can nolonger act as the final arbiter. In relations betweennations  rules  agreements and civilized norms have comeinto play as much as traditional regulators.Until the modern era we lived in what might becalled a Hobbesian world  where conflict  rather thancooperation  was the defining characteristic of relationsbetween nations. Basically  international relations wereregulated through the mechanism of the balance of power.Sometimes we had the hegemony of one Power  andsometimes several Powers acting in concert  but thesewere only variations of what was essentially a struggle forpower  a struggle for domination.Then  in the early part of this century  came theWilsonian vision  which called for a global organization.To this vision we owe the United Nations. After theSecond World War - even at the height of the cold war -mankind envisaged a bolder world. The vision of aglobal welfare was presented  for example  by theSwedish scholar Gunnar Myrdal  who urged us to move""beyond the welfare state"".Now  at the end of the twentieth century  the demiseof the cold war offers us yet another vision of a newworld. The old order based on force is losing its grip oninternational relations. Gone are the days when defects inthe balance of power necessarily invited ambition or20adventure. The days of expansive and proselytizingideologies have passed. A new order based on peacefulaccord  cooperation and interdependence is emerging.This can best be characterized as a non-zero-sumglobal society. In today’s world no country can remainunaffected by the havoc of another  whether caused byhunger  tyranny  environmental pollution or the proliferationof weapons. Similarly  every country can benefit fromworld prosperity  world peace and a cleaner worldenvironment. This new world  if successful in addressingthorny issues such as the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  will allow us to escape from the age-oldsecurity dilemma.What can we do to solve such critical impendingproblems as poverty  pollution  population  nationalconflicts  oppression and the arms race? Most of all  weneed shared values and common purposes. We first needa sound understanding of the nature of these new problems.We must recognize that these are problems that affect us alland require our concerted efforts.In this new era genuine world peace cannot beachieved without our properly addressing the issues ofsocial and economic development.My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on an agenda for development as a timely andappropriate initiative. His report has moved the UnitedNations to the foreground of discussions on development.Given the importance of the political will of nations inthis endeavour  the United Nations system as a wholeshould play a leading role by serving as a forum for nationsto work out remedies for economic and social problemswhich undermine peace and security in many parts of theworld. We hope that the current General Assembly sessionwill provide a much needed opportunity for more seriousdiscussion on these vital issues. Taking advantage of itsrecent experience in development  the Republic of Koreawill make its full contribution to the effort for globaleconomic and social development.In June this year a variety of issues on developmentwere discussed at the World Hearings on Development. Atthese Hearings special emphasis was placed on human-centred development  the interrelationship between peaceand development and the need for strengtheninginternational cooperation. I hope that a concrete actionprogramme will be worked out  based on the informativeviews presented at the Hearings and at the high-levelsegment of the 1994 substantive session of the Economicand Social Council.Our past experience has taught us that socialdevelopment and economic growth are inseparable.Meaningful social progress necessarily includessubstantial economic growth. At the same time  thesubstance of social development - the promotion of socialwelfare  equitable redistribution and the protection of theenvironment - is crucial for sustainable economic growth.In this context  I am convinced that the World Summitfor Social Development  to be held in Copenhagen nextyear  will set a new landmark in the field of socialdevelopment by producing effective and feasible actionplans.Economic and social development is closely linkedwith environmental issues. During the past four decadesthe world population has doubled  while the globaleconomy has grown eightfold. For the first time theEarth has begun to feel the heavy strains of humanactivity. It has become evident that the planet can nolonger keep up with the pace of its exploitation. Abalance must be struck  and harmony sought  between theenvironment and development.Two years ago the United Nations took a mostimportant initiative by holding the United NationsConference on Environment and Development. Weshould uphold the goal set by this conference:environmentally sound and sustainable development. Toachieve this goal  the advanced countries should play aleading role in protecting the environment. Supportshould be given to developing countries in the form offinancial contributions and the transfer ofenvironmentally-sound technology. Developing countries for their part  should make efforts commensurate withtheir capabilities.As a member of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  the Republic of Korea has activelyparticipated in formulating global regimes for theenvironment. We have joined international environmentalagreements and contributed to the Global EnvironmentFacility (GEF). My Government will continue its effortsand cooperation to attain both development and a betterenvironment.21Today we are witnessing a massive exodus of peoplein many parts of the world  the consequence of armedconflict and natural disasters.We are pleased that the United Nations capacity toprovide humanitarian assistance has been strengthenedthrough close coordination between its relevant bodies.However  appeals for urgently needed resources are usuallymet with a fraction of the targeted figures  thereby seriouslyhampering the effective implementation of humanitarianprogrammes. Once again  we need generous assistancefrom the entire international community.I am happy to report that  thanks to the recent publiccampaigns organized by the Government and various non-governmental organizations in Korea  the Korean public hasbeen alerted to the importance of humanitarian assistance.This is demonstrated by the fact that we have been sendingfinancial aid  medical personnel and supplies to suchtroubled spots as Rwanda.On human rights  more than a year has elapsed sincethe Vienna World Conference on this important subject washeld in 1993. My Government is encouraged to see thatsome of the provisions in its Programme of Action havealready been implemented.Since last year the Korean Government has beenpursuing in earnest a policy that we call ""new diplomacy"" which emphasizes the universal values of human rights welfare  liberty and democracy. Currently we are preparingto become a party to the Convention against Torture  andlast July the Third United Nations Workshop for theAsia-Pacific Region on Human Rights Issues was held inSeoul. Among the outcomes of the Workshop wasacceptance of our proposal to hold the Workshop on aregular basis. That agreement is an expression of thecollective will of all the Asia-Pacific countries  which hashelped us to move one step closer to the ultimateestablishment of a regional human rights institution.Another critical task for global peace and security ispreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction both nuclear and biochemical. Most urgently  we must dealwith the problem of nuclear proliferation. The Republic ofKorea supports the indefinite extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the Reviewand Extension Conference in 1995. The Treaty has madean enormous contribution to international security as themainstay of the non-proliferation regime. The legitimacyof the NPT should be reinforced through renewed efforts onthe part of the nuclear Powers and through increasedinternational cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclearenergy. At the same time  the effectiveness of the NPTregime should be enhanced by strengthening thesafeguards system of the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA).The negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban Treaty(CTBT) at the Conference on Disarmament are also veryimportant. A universal and verifiable CTBT willundoubtedly serve as a major instrument in strengtheningthe non-proliferation regime and advancing nucleardisarmament. The recent changes in the world orderrequire a rationalization of disarmament agendas and newworking methods. The multilateral disarmamentframeworks must meet these requirements. In view of theever-increasing importance of the Conference onDisarmament as a negotiating forum  its membershipshould be expanded.In keeping with the spirit of the United NationsCharter  efforts for disarmament and security measuresshould also be encouraged on the regional level. In thisregard  the Republic of Korea welcomes the productivediscussions on confidence-building measures at theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)Regional Forum last July in Bangkok. A securitydialogue for the North-East Asian subregion wouldcomplement this region-wide framework.A major challenge to the NPT regime is the NorthKorean nuclear problem  which poses a serious threat notonly to the Korean peninsula  but also to the Asian--Pacific region and the world as a whole. The suspicionssurrounding the North Korean nuclear programme shouldbe completely cleared by securing transparency of itsnuclear activities  past and future  as well as the present.For this  North Korea should fully cooperate with theIAEA in the implementation of the safeguards agreementand implement the Joint Declaration on theDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.If North Korea fulfils its obligations in good faith we will do all we can to assist the DPRK in the peacefuluse of nuclear energy. Depending on the resolution ofthe nuclear issue  the Republic of Korea stands ready tomake its technological and capital resources available forNorth Korea’s overall economic development in the spiritof mutual prosperity.The post-cold-war international situation presents uswith opportunities for a new world as well as multiplechallenges to our efforts for peace and development.22Therefore  it is all the more imperative that the role of theUnited Nations be increased.One of the most remarkable changes in the aftermathof the cold war is the strengthened role of the UnitedNations in peace-keeping. As regional conflicts have cometo replace the bipolar confrontation of the cold war  UnitedNations peace-keeping operations have expandeddramatically  both in number and mandate.Given the limited resources for United Nationspeace-keeping activities  more effort should be made for theeffective use of preventive diplomacy. The decisions onUnited Nations involvement in actual conflicts should bemade selectively and with proper priorities. Continuedefforts should also be made to address the modality ofintervention and the means of securing the necessaryresources.The Republic of Korea remains firmly committed toUnited Nations peace-keeping activities. As part of itsongoing support  the Republic of Korea sent an engineeringunit to Somalia last year. Last month we dispatched amedical unit to Western Sahara  and in a few days Koreanmilitary observers will arrive in Georgia. Korea also plansto join United Nations efforts to arrange stand-by forces.The new diplomacy of my Government puts emphasison globalism. Through active engagement in global affairs Korea seeks to play its due role within the United Nationsframework. It is in this vein that the Republic of Korea haspresented its candidature for a seat on the Security Councilfor the 1996-1997 term. We look forward to theencouragement and support of other Member States for thiseffort.We support reform of the United Nations. Reformsare needed in order better to cope with the new challengesfaced by the world body. As United Nations membershiphas increased from 51 in 1945 to 184 in 1994  anenlargement of the Council seems in order. The keyquestion is how to increase the number of seats withoutcompromising the Security Council’s effectiveness.Creation of a third category of Council members  coupledwith the expansion of non-permanent membership  may bean answer.For the United Nations fully to assume its role in thenew international environment  its financial difficultiesshould be duly addressed. It is also imperative that theefficiency of the Organization and its management beenhanced to guarantee the effective use of availableresources. In this regard  my delegation welcomes theestablishment of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and looks forward to the active role of thenewly-appointed Under-Secretary-General for InternalOversight Services.The Republic of Korea feels a particular sense ofaffinity with the United Nations. Both Korea and theUnited Nations were born in the wake of the SecondWorld War. Upon creation  both entertained greatexpectations: the United Nations hoped for global peace;Korea hoped for national integrity and prosperity. Theyboth experienced disappointment  however  as theirexpectations were crushed by conflict and division: thecold war and East-West division for the United Nations;the Korean War and South-North division for Korea.Now  at last  the United Nations has risen from itsunhappy past with new hopes; the world body is nolonger held hostage to the paralysing cold war vetoes.The Republic of Korea has also overcome socio-politicaldifficulties and economic underdevelopment. But thedivision on the Korean peninsula still remains. It is theardent wish  and also a firm belief  of the Korean peoplethat the shackles of national division will soon be brokenas the South and the North work together in the spirit ofreconciliation and cooperation.My country’s unique relationship with the UnitedNations makes the upcoming fiftieth anniversary all themore meaningful to us. The National Committee of theRepublic of Korea for the Fiftieth Anniversary of theUnited Nations was established last April. ThisCommittee is preparing a number of programmes  withspecial emphasis on enhancing the awareness of the roleof the United Nations among the new generation. Wealso plan to actively participate in the programmessponsored by the United Nations. In this regard  I ampleased to note that a leading Korean corporation isparticipating as a global sponsor in the preparation for theUnited Nations fiftieth anniversary.Next year the United Nations will celebrate itsgolden anniversary. It will be an occasion for us all to bereminded once again of the goals set forth in the Charterof the United Nations. The new world which wasenvisaged by the founding fathers of this body is yet totake shape. But we must be aware that we now stand ata critical juncture in history  and that a rare opportunityhas been handed to us.23We have to reach for a peaceful and prosperous worldbased on interdependence and cooperation between nations.Success will depend on our ability to understand the natureof the new global environment  which is fundamentallydifferent from the old one  and on our determination tomeet the challenge.We have to associate ourselves with the forces thatwill shape the future. United  and only by being united can we build and thrive in this new world society."
"93",3879,"KWT",49,1994,"It gives me pleasure to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait  our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your qualities of leadership will ensure efficient and smooth deliberations. I take this opportunity to underline the good and friendly relations that exist between Kuwait and your country.I should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Samuel Insanally  the President of the last session of the Assembly  for the competence he demonstrated in guiding the Assembly's proceedings during his term of office. The delegation of Kuwait would like to place on record its appreciation for the achievements made under his leadership.I wish also to reiterate the appreciation of the Government and people of Kuwait and my own personal recognition of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his consistent efforts to enhance the performance of the world body and the pursuit of its goals on behalf of mankind. Kuwait fully supports the Secretary-General's vision in carrying out his ""Agenda for Peace""  in which he elaborated his concept of preventive diplomacy.Next year  the United Nations will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of its creation as an Organization of sovereign States whose relations are governed by the principles and purposes embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. The overriding concern of this global institution is to secure world peace  the independence of nations and freedom  and to harness energies for construction and development. The United Nations system is also a framework within which we collectively seek to alleviate the misery and suffering of our deprived and disadvantaged fellow human beings. It is in this context that people would attain their freedom and independence  colonial rule would come to an end and the right to self- determination would become more entrenched than ever before. Thanks to the United Nations mandates  universal efforts are ever-growing to liberate humanity from the grip of suppression and fear and from the shackles of backwardness and ignorance  on the one hand  and to ensure global security and stability  on the other.The results of these efforts over several decades have been reflected in major historic achievements despite all the challenges and odds faced by peoples in their steady endeavours to attain independence and reaffirm their identity. All those accomplishments turned out to be the salient features of our collective vision of the future. In all fairness  the admirable work of the United Nations and its accomplishments since its inception proved the relevance and importance of the tenets and objectives upon which it was conceived. In the early days  freedom from colonialism was the primary concern. The focus has now shifted to the improvement of general living conditions. In the past  the struggle was for independence  whereas the challenge now lies in the reaffirmation of and commitment to the rights of the human person to a decent life in freedom.Indeed  the world has recently undergone an enormous transformation in terms of ideology  systems of governance and international relations. The United Nations interacted with these changes. The era of confrontation between ideological blocs has now given way to genuine mutual and multilateral interdependence. A cursory glance at the recent and forthcoming United Nations major world conferences clearly proves this trend. There was the Earth Summit inRio de Janeiro in 1992  the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993 and the Conference on Population and Development which ended days ago in Cairo. The World Summit for Social Development and the World Conference on Women are to be held in Copenhagen and Beijing  respectively  next year.In this regard  Kuwait supports the movement towards renewal and restructuring  away from the static stereotypes of the past. To our minds  international restructuring is a constant evolutionary process which should be responsive to the ever-changing global developments. Hence our active contribution to the efforts made by the General Assembly and its organs towards updating and reviving the mechanisms of the United Nations system. It is our hope that the current streamlining exercise will foster the capability of the United Nations to meet the increasing demand for its services and operations and will contribute to a better fulfilment of its mandates under the Charter.In particular  we look forward to the development of the work  composition and effectiveness of the Security Council so that it may reflect the recent changes on the world scene  on the one hand  and satisfy the wishes and aspirations of the United Nations larger membership  on the other.In the meantime  Kuwait believes that our collective efforts should at this stage focus on the formulation of more recognizable parameters of an international order which should be based on the following facts.Firstly  the rationale  essence and thrust of the new order should derive from logical facts. Dialogue  persuasion and non-use of force  the rejection of aggression  the condemnation of terrorism and respect for the rights of all Member States to pursue their own policies in such a way that ensures their own interests within an international framework structured along the lines of justice  equality  the rule of law and compliance with international treaties  especially the United Nations Charter  should all be key components of the new vision.Secondly  focus on human development in the context of economic and social development should represent a qualitative shift away from the futile  indeed harmful  stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction and the consequential squandering of national assets on disastrous aggressive adventures. In this regard  Kuwait has evolved a relevant vision through its painful experience of the brutal Iraqi occupation. One of the major lessons drawn is that the issue of human resources development should be accorded a higher priority on the international agenda.Thirdly  the promotion of North-South dialogue with a view to narrowing the existing gaps in the living standards of the two groups. The ultimate aim is to ensure that the North should not continue to maintain an almost exclusive monopoly of wealth and affluence while the South continues to languish in the tight grip of endless poverty. Is it not high time for us all to recognize that the concept of collective security will remain seriously deficient and doubtful under the existing socio-economic equation  i.e. a minority living in luxurious comfort while the majority is striving to survive in appalling misery?Fourthly  insistence on the elimination of all vestiges and forms of racial discrimination  including opposition to the neo-racist policies and practices that surfaced as a result of the collapse of the old order. Obviously  the neo-racists resort to the use of force in order to secure territorial gains and to acquire land by force under the smoke screen of ethnic cleansing. Within the practice of ethnic cleansing emerges an unmistakable pattern at work. Intensely bestial instincts of mass murder and destruction break loose  contrary to all norms of human discipline and civilized conduct. Therefore  we are all duty-bound to resist and suppress this criminal tendency in order to reassure all peoples of their sense of human community and common destiny.In this context  I wish to pay tribute to the leaders of South Africa and to congratulate the people of South Africa on their triumph over the system of apartheid. We know too well the great sacrifices they made and the long hard path they forged to reach where they are now. I am confident that the emergence of a non-racial South Africa to the arena and the resumption of its role in the United Nations will in time contribute significantly to multilateralism in terms of consolidating the principles of justice and equality. There is no question but that the struggle of the people of South Africa to eliminate racism will probably remain for a long time to come a rich source of inspiration for all of us.In the crucial area of peace-building on the basis of justice  the Middle East region has recently seen dramatic developments that could indeed prove to be historic turning- point  which may well be recorded in the annals of peace achievements despite the enormous problems arising from the many hotbeds of tension that jeopardize security and stability in different regions of the world. Following their agreement to end the state of war between them  Jordan and Israel signed an accord to serve as a basis for a just settlement.Also  the Palestinian National Authority started to assume its responsibilities in the local administration of Gaza and Jericho in the Israeli-occupied territories as a first and important step towards the exercise by the people of Palestine of their inalienable right to self-determination.Furthermore  contacts are now under way to ensure the resumption of negotiations on both the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks  which would lead to a just peace that would address  as we hope  in a an equitable and responsible manner  the concerns of all parties directly involved. Kuwait has expressed its support for these endeavours. It also participated in the multilateral meetings  while fully convinced that this formula is doomed to failure unless concrete and significant progress is achieved on all bilateral tracks. The multilateral formula  as we must always bear in mind  is an arrangement to back up the bilateral tracks  and not a by-pass to skirt them. It was in this spirit that Kuwait participated in the regional meetings  and out of our conviction that endorsement of and support for the peace process in the Middle East was in the final analysis a collective responsibility to be shared by the international community inasmuch as the entire world  not just certain protagonists  stands to gain from its benefits. For the record only  let me recall that Kuwait had participated in the ad hoc meetings on economic development for the territories subject to self-government. We contributed $25 million towards building the institutions required for the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.The People of Palestine have suffered over the past several decades unspeakable injustice and deprivation as a result of the loss of their land  the denial of their right to self-determination and from being prevented from establishing their national State. It is our hope now that this people  which is recognized for resourcefulness and a sense of purpose  will at long last be able to exercise its full rights like all other peoples  including the establishment of its State  whose capital would be Al-Quds Al-Shareef.Let me reiterate that the underpinnings of lasting stability and comprehensive peace as envisioned in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  together with the concept of land for peace  require a firm political commitment to ensure progress on all tracks - especially the Syrian track  which is the cornerstone of the peace-building process. Full withdrawal from occupied Syrian territory is therefore essential. Equally essential is the complete and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which requires a total Israeli pull out from southern Lebanon.In today's world  which is characterized by interrelated and complex interests and civilized conduct on the basis of compliance with the rule of law and respect for international treaties; in today's world  when the winds of modernism have been blowing even to the most distant regions  the Iraqi regime continues to be a menace to security and stability in our region. It persists in defying the collective will of the international community as represented by the Security Council. This is demonstrated by its failure thus far to comply unconditionally with all the Council resolutions relating to its aggression against the State of Kuwait. Its reaction has invariably been characterized by subterfuge  procrastination  equivocation and selectivity.Although more than four years have now passed since the Iraqi regime was defeated and its forces evicted from Kuwait  and regardless of its acceptance of all Security Council resolutions  including Security Council resolution 687 (1991)  which set forth cease-fire conditions and highlighted regional security arrangements  the regime continues to refuse to address the core issue of the whole problem  namely recognition of the State of Kuwait and of its sovereignty within the international borders as demarcated  approved and endorsed by the United Nations and guaranteed by Security Council resolution 833 (1993)  adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter.The international community's firmness in the face of the Iraqi regime's manoeuvres  the Security Council unanimity in its insistence on seeing the Iraqi regime fulfil all its obligations under Council resolutions are the right and appropriate response to the defiant stand of the Iraqi regime.At this juncture  let me outline Kuwait's policy regarding this fateful question. First  Iraq must unconditionally implement all Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression  especially resolution 687 (1991).Secondly  Iraq must accept Security Council resolution 833 (1993) regarding the demarcation of borders between Iraq and the State of Kuwait. Here  Kuwait insists that such acceptance should come in a clear and unequivocal manner. It should be formally documented by the IraqiRevolutionary Command Council and the Iraqi National Council and published in the Iraqi Official Gazette. All the above should then be set out in a letter addressed to the Security Council and deposited as an official document in the records of the United Nations.Thirdly  Iraq should cooperate in good faith and in a responsible manner with the International Committee of the Red Cross in accounting for all Kuwaiti and third- country prisoners and detainees. Serious efforts must be made to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue  which has long been exploited by the Iraqi regime as a bargaining chip for securing narrow gains.Fourthly  all provisions of Security Council resolutions relating to the return of Kuwaiti property and to compensation must be carried out. We would also like to see concrete implementation of the paragraphs relating to the Iraqi armament programme  the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the export-import permanent control system.Fifthly  Iraq's regional behaviour should not jeopardize security and stability in the region. Iraq should respect the norms of good neighbourliness by renouncing its greedy claims and its policy of blackmail; it should cease intervening in the internal affairs of neighbour countries and abstain from sponsoring and supporting terrorism  and it should renounce the aggressive tendencies which have been its hallmark for too long.Once again  we would like to underline the fact that we in Kuwait are aware of the suffering of the people of Iraq and sympathize with the Iraqis who have had to endure hardship as a result of the policies pursued by a regime imposing itself by force on the Iraqi people. That is the very same regime which declines to utilize the mechanism offered to export oil under Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). In the same vein  let me emphasize that we would like to see the territorial integrity of Iraq preserved and safeguarded. This too is an essential component of regional stability.The whole set of Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq constitutes one indivisible political and legal whole. We cannot and should not tolerate the selective approach pursued by the Iraqi regime in implementing Council resolutions. Core issues must be addressed squarely by Iraq  otherwise it will remain under the illusion that it can dent the steadfast position of the Security Council. At this point  I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Security Council  which demonstrated unanimity in its recent review of sanctions against Iraq on 14 September. The Council reaffirmed that the sovereignty and boundaries of the State of Kuwait under its resolution 833 (1993) are the essence of the matter and that this will form the basis of the Council's priorities in dealing with the sanctions regime.High among Kuwait's national priorities comes the issue of stability in the Gulf region. Accordingly  we have been working in close collaboration with other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to resolve all the outstanding problems between Iran and the United Arab Emirates in regard to the three islands - Abu Moussa  Greater Tumb and Smaller Tumb - through dialogue and on the basis of respect for national rights and international treaties. Hence  we have supported the recent initiative by the United Arab Emirates to have recourse to the International Court of Justice  which is the international judicial organ that has the competence to resolve disputes between States. In the meantime  we are confident that both parties to the conflict will demonstrate reason and prudence and that they are eager to reach a just and peaceful settlement of the litigation through legal channels and in such a way that would not compromise the rights of the United Arab Emirates.Kuwait is following with deep concern the situation in Afghanistan. We appeal to all factions there to put the interests of the Afghani people ahead of all other considerations. We sincerely call upon them to put an end to the fighting and to help facilitate the current efforts of the United Nations to bring about national unity and channel energies towards reconstruction.We are distressed also by the increasing deterioration of the situation in sisterly Somalia. Again  we appeal to all factions that are engaged in the conflict there to demonstrate wisdom by acting in accordance with the interests of all Somali people. We pray for national reconciliation that will preserve the unity and independence of Somalia.The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina is of great concern to the Government and people of Kuwait. Initially  we were optimistic that the efforts of the Contact Group would prove to be successful in reaching the comprehensive Peace Plan. The Bosnian Muslims and Croats gave the internationally supported peace plan their approval despite the fact that it did not satisfy all their legitimate demands. However  the Bosnian Serbs  in open defiance of the international will  rejected the Plan and  instead  relied on the use of force to impose a fait accompli and to exact territorial gains  at the expense of other parties.Kuwait believes that the Security Council should  without any further delay  lift the embargo imposed on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslim to enable them to exercise their legitimate right of self-defence in the face of blatant aggression.In today's world it is totally unacceptable that we should all remain virtually passive witnesses to an exercise in which a minority  through the use of overwhelming military force  tramples the legitimate rights of the majority.In the context of global realities on the ground  the international community should not underestimate the gravity of problems faced by the developing nations in their pursuit of economic development and progress. Economic readjustment and restructuring  foreign-debt burdens and pressures of inflation are but a few of these weighty problems. These obstacles to development were recognized by Kuwait at an early stage. Hence  Kuwait took the initiative to write off loans of developing countries whose repayment was overdue. Parallel to that action  we have expanded the operations of the Kuwait fund for economic development. We have also increased our contributions to the regional and international financial institutions.For more than two decades now my country has been playing a leading role in the provision of aid to developing countries. The total assistance provided by Kuwait exceeds 4 per cent of its annual gross national product and is more than four times the suggested level of official development assistance. That being the case  we hope that developed countries will increase the level of their assistance with a view to reducing the current disparities in standards of living.An effort to narrow the gaps between the living conditions of peoples around the world would make a powerful impact on world peace and stability. Equally  the creation of job opportunities and the maintenance of hope in the future are essential for a peaceful life at home and to harmonious relations between nations.In this context  Kuwait welcomes the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement that was achieved after long and arduous rounds of negotiations  and it looks forward to the entry into force of that agreement following the required endorsements.Dialogue  understanding and rapprochement are valuable tools in international relations. They facilitate our cooperation and our collective endeavours  as a family of nations  to meet our needs and fulfil our aspirations. If the fruits of technology and science can be fully harnessed for this purpose we shall reap the benefits thereof. The whole planet has indeed become a global village  in which we can closely follow world events as they unfold  thanks to the great leaps forward in the areas of science  technology  transportation  communications and information technology.If anything  this is a testimony to impressive human cooperation. Such cooperation  when anchored in dialogue and understanding  is perhaps the most viable option for bringing us closer to peace  stability and progress."
"94",3925,"LAO",49,1994,"irst  I am very pleased to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His wide experience and knowledge of international affairs  his well-known wisdom and patience are guarantees of success in the many difficult tasks of this session.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary- General of our Organization  for the praiseworthy efforts he has made in the service of world peace and development. Aware how heavy is his burden in this complex  fast-changing time  we wish him every possible success in the discharge of his lofty duties.The present session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world situation is still undergoing very complex changes. While the end of the bipolar era opened the door to dialog and cooperation between States  it did not usher in an era of peace  which the world so badly needs if it is to construct a sound world economy. In some regions of Europe  Africa and Asia  religious  ethnic  tribal and border conflicts  often of tragic proportions  are still raging  thus making the international situation unstable and fragile. It therefore seems clear that it will be difficult to achieve a new world order in which true peace prevails and in which peoples and nations  large and small  powerful and weak  rich and poor  benefit. The international community should give more thought to thismatter and join together to build a new era of peace and justice  to which the peoples of the world have so long aspired.In Europe  the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is still tense. The risk of new military clashes between the various parties remains. It is our view that the parties to this painful conflict should demonstrate wisdom and above all realism by concluding a just and equitable political settlement as soon as possible  and thus contribute to the restoration of peace in that country and in the entire region.In Africa  after so many years of efforts  both within and outside the United Nations  the Republic of South Africa is free at last. In a spirit of national reconciliation  the parties concerned have managed to reach an understanding and to cooperate in the building of a united  non-racial and democratic South Africa. We continue to believe that the people of South Africa  under the wise leadership of President Nelson Mandela  will prove equal to the task of overcoming the obstacles that face them and begin the economic development of their beloved land.Still in Africa  in Rwanda  we have seen unprecedented bloodshed. The Government and people of Laos strongly condemn the abominable carnage  which has been described as genocide of an innocent population  and we call upon the parties to the conflict to take the necessary steps to prevent such unacceptable crimes from ever happening again.The world is following closely the disturbing humanitarian situation in the Caribbean. In our view  there should be a political solution to this complex situation  through sincere dialog between the parties directly concerned. The signing of the joint communique of 9 September 1994 by the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America to resolve the problem of the exodus of Cubans - the consequence of more than 30 years of externally imposed economic constraints - is clear proof of this. That agreement  the fruit of long and difficult negotiations between the two parties  constitutes an important first step in the settlement of their differences  which should contribute to strengthening peace  stability and cooperation in the region.In Haiti  due to the animosities still keenly felt by the partisans of the military regime and President Aristide's sympathizers  the political situation continues to be fragile and complex. We believe that  in the best interests of the Haitian nation  it is time for the parties to show great wisdom and begin the economic reconstruction of their beloved land.In the Middle East  the autonomous interim Palestinian Authority  established in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region  pursuant to the Declaration of Principles on interim autonomy arrangements  signed in Washington on 13 September 1993  marked a new phase in the search for a just and lasting comprehensive settlement of the Arab- Israeli conflict. We welcome this new  crucial step  and hope that the parties to the conflict will do everything possible to achieve a comprehensive settlement  just and honorable for all  within the framework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions.In Western Asia  despite countless efforts exerted towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict  Afghanistan remains the theater of a bloody civil war. In conformity with the recent statement of the President of the Security Council on 11 August 1994  we address an appeal to the parties concerned immediately to put an end to their hostilities  achieve national reconciliation and begin the difficult reconstruction of their ravaged homeland.In the Korean peninsula  after months of uncertainty  dialog between the parties concerned has finally resumed. We warmly encourage that dialog and the Lao delegation welcomes the conclusion of the Agreement signed in Geneva on 12 August 1994 between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States of America. Because of its importance everything should be done to ensure that this sensitive region of the world becomes a nuclear-weapon-free zone. In the interests of peace  stability and cooperation in that region as well as in the world  it is essential that all the parties concerned show understanding and mutual trust in order to find a peaceful solution to the issues between them.In South-East Asia a new era of cooperation in areas of common interest between countries of the region has grown ever stronger. The inauguration in April of the Lao- Thai friendship bridge across the Mekong  built with financial assistance and cooperation from the Government and the people of Australia  is an especially salient event for Laos  Thailand and Australia  as well as other countries of the region  in our efforts further to strengthen regional cooperation in different areas. In addition  the Heads of State or Government of our respective countries have regularly been exchanging visits with a view to expanding and deepening their friendship and cooperation in anextensive and fruitful field of cooperation. The participation of my country  once again  in the ministerial meeting of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July in Bangkok  Thailand  once again demonstrates our sincere desire to cooperate in all possible areas with the countries of ASEAN  thus responding to the desires and deep aspirations of the peoples of the region and the world.The present situation in the Kingdom of Cambodia remains the subject of major world attention. As an immediate neighbor  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  ardently wishes that the Cambodian people will be able to live their lives in peace  in an atmosphere of national reconciliation  and to work for the reconstruction of their homeland  which will thus contribute to the strengthening of peace and cooperation in the region. To that end we fully support the various measures that have been taken by the Cambodian Government  under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh  and His Excellency Mr. Hun Sen.In Myanmar a new  important event has taken place. Efforts towards national reconciliation and the start of economic cooperation with the outside world have been bearing their initial fruits  thus consolidating the stability of the country.In the Lao People's Democratic Republic we note  fortunately  that on the whole our economic performance has been good. On the average  annual economic growth for the past three years has been of the order of 6 per cent to 7 per cent in real terms. The inflation rate has not exceeded 10 per cent a year and exchange rates generally remain stable. No less importantly  foreign investment has considerably increased. At the present time the Lao Government is exerting major efforts to achieve the goals set in its socio-economic development strategy from now to the year 2000.That strategy presented to the fifth round-table meeting organized expressly for the Lao People's Democratic Republic in Geneva last June  under the sponsorship of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  was conceived as a realistic and trustworthy document and has received broad support from participants. On behalf of the Lao Government and people I wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the friendly countries  international organizations and non-governmental organizations for the assistance they have afforded us in the past in our effortstowards national development and we hope to be able to continue to benefit from that assistance in various fields.The world economy  far from improving  still faces an uncertain future. Marked by recession and imbalances  it also suffers from grave structural problems. Developed countries do not hesitate to take certain measures that run counter to the legitimate interests of developing countries. Because of the world economy's interdependence it is important that developed countries undertake to cooperate with the developing countries in order to restore the economy and to promote development in the interests of all. In that respect it is essential fully to honor commitments undertaken in support of international cooperation as they have been set forth in resolutions of the General Assembly  in particular  the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation  in particular the Revitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries  the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and the resolutions of the conferences that have followed it.The question relating to drug abuse and illicit trafficking remains an issue of world concern. Aware of the disastrous consequences that can result from this  the Lao Government has taken vigorous measures to encourage the population gradually to give up the poppy crop and to choose other substitute crops  created a special unit against drug abuse  and established cooperation with neighboring countries in order to make its contribution to the international fight against this scourge. As part of these efforts and with the assistance of the United Nations International Drug Control Program (UNIDCP) this year we have developed a comprehensive program for drug control. That program  the cost of which is $35 million  consists of setting up 16 projects  including the strengthening of drug control administration  reduction of supply through eradication of the poppy crop  a strategy for treatment and rehabilitation  and the establishment of a special investigation unit. With assistance and cooperation from the international community we hope to be able to achieve the goal we pursue.The advancement and defense of human rights is an important and sensitive question. Unanimously seen as universal  these rights  often having historical  cultural and religious implications  are inseparable and interdependent. On that note we welcome the creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights and it is our hope that the High Commissioner will effectively discharge the very responsible functions that have been assigned to him.The world exists in an uncertain international political environment. In that context the United Nations  the only universal multilateral forum  should have a crucial role to play. Strengthened by the purposes and principles of its Charter  it is in a position to provide the necessary framework for cooperation  dialog among States and the maintenance of international peace and security.In order to carry out its noble task effectively in this new era  the United Nations must restructure and democratize itself. It is also most important that the United Nations give top priority to a program of action on development that could serve as a framework for promoting growth and economic development throughout the world. We feel that  to be effective  any program of action on development must be action-oriented and based on a spirit of true international cooperation and interdependence; above all  it must take into account the basic legitimate interests of developing countries  especially the least developed among them."
"95",3968,"LBN",49,1994,"We are gathered here today  in a new session of theGeneral Assembly  in a new year in the life of the UnitedNations  one that will take us to the end of the first halfcentury of its existence  which we shall celebrate next year.Half a century will have passed since the birth of agreat dream  a dream that humanity envisaged as anendeavor for peace  reconciliation  solidarity rapprochement  and dialogue amongst peoples of differentethnic origins and cultures across continents  a dialogueamongst nations  States  ideologies  religions  and creedsof this world  with all its differences and singularities.Through this great dream  humanity wanted to createan arbiter  a referee on right  justice  and peace  and aforum in which it could discuss its problems and seekarbitration; in which it could find a way to defend rightswhen rights are denied  to defend itself when injusticeprevails  and a champion that would stand by its sidewhen it is threatened.Through this dream  mankind sought to put an endto wars and armed conflicts  to protect the sovereignty ofnations  and to guarantee respect for their independenceand free choice.Thus  the United Nations came into existence.The United Nations was born; and along with it  agreat project emerged - one that was expected tocontribute to the solution of the world’s crises. Alongsidethe Organization  its political  security  social  economic and cultural organs were set up. The peoples of theworld expected a lot from those organs  and treated themaccordingly  with a deference commensurate with theirstanding.The will of this prestigious world body  whichrepresents the position  the decision  and the will of theworld’s peoples  is more comprehensive than the will ofany individual State  no matter how great and powerful itmay be. The peoples of the world looked up to it andaccorded it the respect normally granted to the defendersof right and justice. Right and justice supersede politicalinterests  no matter how strong they may be.How far away are we today from this dream  fromthis great endeavour  from all those intentions  slogans ambitions  aspirations  ideals and prospects?Where is peace in the world  when battlefronts arewidespread? What have we done about the resolution ofconflicts while conflicts escalate? What about theelimination of violence which is still on the ascendance?How far away are we today from protecting what is right;from upholding the sovereignty of nations which is stillundermined; from respecting human rights and the rightsof peoples and States which are still being trampled?What have we done about the resolutions adopted bythis very Organization  in this very General Assembly33Hall? What about the resolutions that awaitimplementation  and the many others that await adoption and are knocking about in the labyrinths of impotence anddeals? How far away are we today from the credibility andauthority of our resolutions  from the one single standard bywhich we should judge things?I beg your indulgence for daring to voice thesequestionings. I beg your indulgence  because they arevoiced by a State which is not privileged to be a memberof the club of powerful nations which dare to question theUnited Nations.I beg your indulgence  because those who need theUnited Nations are not the powerful and the influential.The United Nations was not created for them. It wascreated for the oppressed  for the unjustly treated  for thosewho are not powerful by any means.The small size of States and the humble size of theirpopulations have never been the true yardstick by whichtheir role and contribution should be measured. Manynations have had a history larger than their geography  arole larger than their size  and a contribution far greaterthan the potential of others. Lebanon is one of thoseStates.We have existed for thousands of years  ever sincehumanity first organized itself into entities. We have hadour political  cultural  economic  legal  and humanisticstructures ever since.Side by side with its Phoenician civilization  Lebanonembraced Pharaonic  Mesopotamian  Persian  Greek Roman  Arab  and Western civilizations. Our foremostcontribution was to give mankind its first alphabet. Wehave also enriched it with our legal  intellectual  cultural economic  scientific  educational and humanisticcontributions.We were present when the United Nations was born.We were also present when the International Court ofJustice issued its first opinion  and we contributed to itsmaking. We volunteered to work in all the United Nationsorgans and programmes at all levels. We shouldered ourshare of responsibility by hosting some of them  and byoffering them the best of our men and intellectuals.Social and cultural pluralism was our nationalhallmark. In our composition  we were able to developan abridged formula for multicultural nation States. Theprinciple of state-building in the post-First World War erawas based on nationalities and ethnic origins. But todayin the era of communications super-highways  in the eraof ever-increasing demographic mobility  we have cometo recognize that this principle  when put to the test  hasfailed.While attempts have been made through the years toobliterate the distinctive identities of peoples living undercertain regimes - as in the case of the Soviet Unionduring the Stalin era - those identities have resurfaced  ashave the problems which resulted from the attempt attheir suppression.If Lebanon were an almost unique case in the past given the pluralistic features of its society  it is no longerso today. The Lebanese experience has becomecommonplace  as we have come to witness through thenow commonplace demographic movement of populationsand the lowering of geopolitical barriers. While ourformula has been tested  many countries are still in theexperimental stage.With the demise of the theory of nationalism  thereis need for a new system  one that allows for thecoexistence of different cultures and identities under theroof of one homeland  as dictated by modern economic technological  and practical challenges and needs.Lebanon  its land and its people have had to sufferthe ravages of regional and international conflicts  thevagaries of hurricanes of international ideologicaldifferences and their complications. But  as ever in ourhistory  we have been able to prove that we have theability to rise to the challenges that face us and that ourformula for coexistence is much stronger than somepeople may have believed  merely because it is the onlyfeasible and practicable one.When Lebanon was able to overcome the warswaged by others on its soil  armed with the will of itspeople and the support of its brethren and friends; whenLebanon enhanced its internal security and stability reactivated its national dialogue and tore down thebarriers between its various factions and forces; and whenLebanon started to rebuild its institutions  rehabilitate itsinfrastructures and embark upon its political andeconomic endeavours  it proved once again that its34time-honoured existence could not be wiped out and that itwas too strong to be eliminated.But Lebanon’s full sovereignty over all its territoriesand its total independence will remain compromised so longas major parts of its soil are not under its control and solong as the State remains unable to extend its fullsovereignty over all its national soil through its ownlegitimate national forces.So long as Israel occupies Lebanon’s territories despite repeated United Nations resolutions and the will ofthe international community; so long as Lebanese citizensare still languishing in Israeli detention camps  ignored bythe international community and out of the reach of thehumanitarian organizations that are not allowed to visitthem; so long as this continues  the wounds will not healand the blood shall not be stanched.So long as that occupation continues over more thanone eighth of our national territory; so long as Israeli raidscontinue to sow the land daily with bombs  mines andbooby traps - killing mainly our innocent children; so longas these criminal acts continue against a heroic people thatrefuses to surrender  the cries of our women and childrenwill continue to haunt the world along with our cries ofanger  revolt and resistance.Until now  the occupation has failed to contain thisanger  regardless of the means employed. Day after day the death toll rises  ours and theirs. Blood flows inSouthern Lebanon and in the Beka’a Valley. Notechnological invention  no matter how ingenious  and notechnique of war have been able to undermine our people’sdetermination to regain its independence  freedom sovereignty and peace.There are over 300 Lebanese men and women stilllanguishing in Israeli prisons. Some have died; others havebeen disabled. In their prison cells  they hear about atheory called ""human rights""  one that tops the agendas ofour meetings and forums. Theorists are preoccupied overthe rights of flora  fauna and the environment while ourprisoners wonder to which class they belong and underwhich category they are classified.So long as the international community addresses theworld’s problems by using more than one standard; so longas Security Council resolutions remain unimplemented; andso long as Chapter VII of the Charter is applied selectivelyto troublemakers who lack any kind of protection  wecannot be deemed faithful to the true mission of theUnited Nations.We have waited so long for the internationalcommunity to show some real interest. We have alsowaited impatiently for the implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 425 (1978)  only to see the Councilrefrain from condemning the aggression rather thanenforce its resolutions. When it does condemn  thecondemnation applies equally to the aggressor and theaggressed under the pretext of supporting the peaceprocess.We were invited to the Madrid Peace Conference.We were optimistic about the invitation  the content andthe sponsorship. The co-sponsors were super-Powers andthe Conference was to be convened on the basis of a just comprehensive and lasting peace  anchored in theprinciple of ""land for peace"" and on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978) respectively. We accepted advice to join in thatmechanism. By accepting the invitation  we accepted thecontent. We were expected to discuss mechanisms andschedules.Three years have passed since the convening of theMadrid Conference. Months followed upon each other’sheels in waiting  time and again  for parliamentaryelections  for presidential elections  for the appropriatemoment on the local level and for circumstances aimed atimproving the position of one side while isolating orcornering the other side.Three years have passed  and our tour of worldcapitals is almost complete. From Madrid to Washington to Paris  to Oslo and to Moscow. We are still discussingthe basic principles which should have been settled thevery first moment the Conference was convened. Theprinciple of ""land for peace"" still awaits the definition ofthe land concept. The principle of withdrawal is stillunclear  since in the way that it is proposed  it still meansoccupation under different forms.The principle of negotiating land for peace  whichpresupposes equality in the negotiating positions  ispreempted by pressuring the Arab negotiator so that he isleft with nothing to offer. Resistance must stop - so weare told - without any guarantee of withdrawal orliberation. The boycott must end  but no guarantees aregiven for the recovery of the usurped rights. We mustenter the multilateral negotiations without knowingwhether or not there will be peace and what the form and35content of that peace will be. We are asked to celebrateand to shake hands without knowing what it is we arecelebrating. We are required to take into account the localpublic opinion of others; we have to reassure that publicopinion of others as if we ourselves do not have a publicopinion to convince and as if we do not have our ownsceptics who question our opting for peace.Yes  we the victims of aggression are required to givesecurity guarantees to the aggressor. Those withoutweapons are required to reassure those who possess nuclear chemical and bacteriological weapons. Yes  we entered thenegotiations for peace - an honourable peace  not a guiltyone; a balanced peace  not a lopsided one; a just peace  notan unjust one; a comprehensive peace  not a partial one; agenuine peace  not a festive one; an equitable peace  not abiased one; a natural peace  not an artificial one; apermanent peace  not a temporary one; a peace of thepeople  not of regimes; a peace that makes us proud  notashamed; a peace of loyalty to  not betrayal of our martyrs.We want a peace that allows for the return ofrefugees  rather than consecrates their dispersion; a peacethat satisfies the revolutionary  instead of provoking him; apeace from which we draw strength; a peace we canprotect; a peace that will  once and for all  relieve the worldof this burden  the burden of our region; a peace that willput an end to exporting anger; a peace of prosperity development  and stability; a peace that will allow ourwidows to cease their mourning.The days when the problems of peoples were confinedto their own countries are over. The days when geographicand political boundaries were a barrier between peoples areover. Our era is one of interdependence and ofcommunication. It is an era of the lowering of all barriers.No country is too remote. No matter how far removedfrom the area of conflict  it will still be affected by thatconflict and by the demographic problems that do notrecognize boundaries or borders  unless such problems arestemmed at the source.We can always be subject to nuclear  chemical andbacteriological pollution  since there are no boundaries inthe atmosphere. The environment can very well becomecontaminated  because the mountains cannot stop the windfrom blowing  and nature cannot stop rivers from flowing.We will all be affected  whenever and wherever adisaster strikes. We are all concerned about the world’ssecurity  its stability  prosperity  resources  needs requirements  markets and citizens  wherever they may be.The Middle East must not forever remain a fieryvolcano that threatens the peace of the world around it challenges international security  and destabilizes theworld economy. It must not remain the source of theworld’s anger and resentment.Let there be no more occupied territories  no moreacts of aggression  no more prisoners languishing in theprisons. Let there be no more blood flowing through theland of the prophets. Let no more darkness prevail in thecradle of God’s religions.This region will not enjoy more favorableopportunities than those that exist today. Time will notbe forever on the side of those who seek peace. Ourregion must produce visionaries  as it has always done and not manipulators of peace.Our congratulations to you  Sir  on the assumptionof the presidency of this session of the General Assemblycannot come from the heart in isolation of what weexpect from the United Nations during your presidency.The efforts of the Secretary-General cannot be viewed orappreciated outside the scope of our view of the UnitedNations. May God guide you and illuminate your path inthe service of world peace to which Lebanon is dedicatedand for which it fights."
"96",4015,"LBR",49,1994,"Mr. President  I wish to joinothers who have spoken before me in congratulating you onyour election to guide the deliberations of the forty-ninthsession of the United Nations General Assembly. As youundertake this solemn and challenging responsibility weassure you of the Liberian delegation’s fullest cooperationand support.Let me also convey our gratitude to your eruditepredecessor  Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  forthe skilful manner in which he guided the deliberations ofthe last session.Our able and distinguished Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  deserves specialcommendation for his unwavering commitment to theprinciples of the United Nations and his untiring effortsin the promotion of world peace  international securityand human dignity. We are particularly pleased at hiskeen interest and involvement in the search for durablepeace in Liberia.As we approach the midpoint of the last decade inthis millennium we are encouraged that our worldcontinues to make steady progress in the transition fromyears of ideological confrontation to convergence onglobal interdependence.A manifestation of this changing situation is thegrowing utilization of a consensual approach toaddressing such burning issues on the international agendaas human rights  population and the environment. In thisregard we welcome the outcome of the InternationalConference on Population and Development held at Cairoand look forward to the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  to be convened in Copenhagen  Denmark in 1995  which will consider the core issues of alleviatingand reducing poverty  expanding productive employmentand enhancing social integration.General Assembly 22nd meetingThe peaceful transition from apartheid to majority rulein South Africa has been of monumental significance toAfrica. We heartily welcome the new Republic of SouthAfrica into the fold of the world body and look forward tothe positive contributions it can and will surely make to theachievement of the noble goals of the United Nations.These positive developments in the internationalsystem are  however  often overshadowed by flashpoints ofethnic conflicts around the world. The situations in Bosnia Rwanda and Somalia  and in my own country  Liberia among others  appear to be intractable. The brutality anddestruction unleashed by these conflicts often tend tooverwhelm the international community and make peace-keeping a major preoccupation of the United Nations and to an increasing degree  of regional organizations as well.Economic and human resources that could otherwise beapplied to improving the human condition are beingexpended on peace-keeping activities.Some of these intra-State conflicts are so complex thatpolicy makers are forced to debate the pros and cons ofpeace-keeping or peacemaking when the main issue shouldbe that of saving lives  especially in those situations wherea legitimate governing authority is absent.The result is that the international communitysometimes reacts with what may amount to short-cutsolutions. Often attempts at resolving some of theseconflicts unwittingly overlook the intransigence andrecalcitrance of warlords who were the ones primarilyresponsible for bringing untold suffering and deprivation totheir own people. These conflicts also create lucrativeopportunities for arms dealers and international supportersof warlords.A disturbing phenomenon associated with theseconflicts is that of the child soldier. Children are recruited indoctrinated and trained in the art of murder  mayhem andgenocide  thus depriving a country of an entire generationof its human resources. This is particularly true for myown country  Liberia  where the great majority of the60 000 combatants are children who have yet to completetheir primary education. The forced conscription of ourchildren — the building-blocks of our future — must bestopped  since it violates the Convention of the Rights ofthe Child. Therefore we should not yield to any action thathas the effect of sanctioning the acquisition of powerthrough the use of force or promoting solutions aimed atappeasing warlords at the expense of the larger unarmedpopulation.The world has witnessed the rise  during the lastfour years  of a powerful movement for democracy anddemocratization. This movement has swept asunder someof the strongest totalitarian regimes in its wake  fromEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to LatinAmerica  Africa and Asia.The international community must thereforedemonstrate its resolve to support this movement so thatthe democratic aspirations of all peoples are realizedthroughout the world. It would be an indictment of thepresent world leadership for it to simply watch countriesbecome involved in these conflicts  which may have beenignited initially by the spark of democratization.It is against this background that we wish to brieflyreview the Liberian peace process.At the outset  I should like to register the heartfeltgratitude of the Liberian people to the gallant men ofECOMOG — the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group — whofoiled the attempted coup on 15 September 1994. Since1990  their selfless sacrifice has provided a securityblanket in parts of Liberia  thus enabling us to worktowards the attainment of peace in our country.It will be recalled that in December 1989 theLiberian situation exploded into an armed conflict ostensibly to rid the country of military dictatorship. Bymid-1990  however  the conflict had degenerated into athree-way struggle for power. The State machinery haddisintegrated.None of the armed factions engaged in the struggleappeared capable of winning a decisive victory andestablishing legitimate authority. In the wake of thisdeadly stalemate  ECOWAS intervened with a two-pronged peace plan: A peace-monitoring force would bedispatched to Liberia to provide security for the country while the Liberians themselves would re-establish aninternal civil administration to prepare the country fordemocratic elections.The ECOWAS peace-monitoring group  ECOMOG arrived in Liberia in August 1990. An All-LiberiaConference was convened in Banjul  the Gambia  in thesame month  and elected the Interim Government ofNational Unity (IGNU). Upon the insistence of theNational Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL)  a second  All-Liberia Conference was convened in Monrovia in 1991 which endorsed the Interim Government. Unfortunately 2General Assembly 22nd meetingthe NPFL  which insisted on the Conference as aprecondition for peace  walked out during the deliberations.Several other meetings of the warring factions wereheld in Banjul  Freetown  Dakar  Bamako  Lomé Yamoussoukro and Geneva  in search of peace with thearmed factions. With remarkable success  the ECOWASpeace plan  with an interim civilian administration forLiberia and with ECOMOG  restored some degree ofstability and provided a semblance of law and order in thecountry for a period of two years.On 15 October 1992  the NPFL launched anunprovoked attack on ECOMOG and the people ofMonrovia in what was termed “Operation Octopus”. Therefusal of the NPFL to fully comply with theYamoussoukro Accord gave rise to a new armed group  theUnited Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy(ULIMO)  which claimed its sole purpose was to free theLiberian people from the NPFL.With hostilities raging among the armed factions  theUnited Nations  in concert with ECOWAS and the OAU decided to convene a peace conference of the parties to theconflict in Geneva in June 1993. The meeting was attendedby the NPFL  ULIMO and IGNU. The IGNU delegationincluded the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL).The United Nations Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative chaired the meeting  which was alsoattended by the OAU Eminent Person  the ExecutiveSecretary of ECOWAS and the Field Commander ofECOMOG.The framework agreed upon in Geneva was formallyconcluded and signed by the parties in Cotonou  Republicof Benin  on 25 July 1993. The overriding principle of theCotonou Agreement was to achieve disarmament anddemobilization of the warring factions  which agreed thatthey would give up their arms in exchange for participatingin the formation of a new government.The Cotonou Agreement provided for theestablishment of the Liberian National TransitionalGovernment  headed by a five-man Executive Council ofState  a 35-member Transitional Legislative Assembly andthe reconstitution of the Supreme Court and the Ad HocElections Commission. Each of these organs was to becomposed of nominees representing the parties to theAgreement. The Cabinet positions were apportioned inconsultation with the parties.The Liberian National Transitional Government wasgiven the mandate to extend its authority throughout thecountry  to repatriate and resettle refugees from abroad and to conduct free and fair elections within six months.Disarmament was to be carried out concomitantlywith the seating of the Liberian National TransitionalGovernment  and the armed factions agreed to cooperatewith the expanded ECOMOG to disarm under thesupervision of the United Nations Observer Mission inLiberia.The Liberian National Transitional Government wasinducted into office on 7 March 1994  and the SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-Generalgave assurances that disarmament would commencesimultaneously. He also assured the Liberian people thatthe armed factions would comply fully with theprovisions of the Cotonou Agreement. After the seatingof the Liberian National Transitional Government themilitary aspects of the peace process did not keep pacewith the political aspects as contemplated by theAgreement. Moreover  it took six months for theadditional troops from Tanzania and Uganda to arrive inLiberia. The expanded ECOMOG troops were neverdeployed and the factions did not disarm. They continueto believe in the attainment of political power by force ofarms or  more precisely  through the barrel of the gun.Consequently  there has been a mushrooming ofarmed groups. There are now two factions of ULIMOand two factions of NPFL. There is also the LiberianPeace Council (LPC) and the Lofa Defence Force (LDF).Each of the breakaway factions of ULIMO and the NPFL together with the LPC and LDF  have joined in acoalition of forces to fight the branch of NPFL led by Mr.Charles Taylor. As I speak  the battle in central Liberiarages on. A consequence of this situation is the massexodus of frightened citizens who have had to seek refugeand havens in neighbouring countries and a heighteningof the humanitarian needs of the country.I come now to the Liberian National Conference.Realizing the current morass in the country and theuncooperative attitude of the warring factions towards theLiberian National Transitional Government  a citizens’consultative meeting was convened in Monrovia from 29to 30 July 1994. At that meeting the people of Liberiadetermined that for the last four years the destiny of thecountry had been largely dictated by the warring factionsand that they  the citizens  were being marginalized.They also concluded that the stalemate in the peace3General Assembly 22nd meetingprocess was the result of the intransigence of the warringfactions with respect to disarmament and their failure tocooperate with the Liberian National TransitionalGovernment  ECOMOG and UNOMIL in carrying out theirrespective responsibilities and duties under the CotonouAgreement.The people of Liberia therefore decided that theymust  and would  become involved in breaking thestalemate in the peace process. They have thereforeconvened since 24 August 1994 the Liberian NationalConference (LNC)  with representatives coming from allwalks of life  including the 13 political subdivisions of thecountry  political parties  interest groups  professionalorganizations  social and religious organizations  trade andlabour unions  student and youth groups and women’sorganizations.The Conference organizers endeavoured to involve andencourage the participation of the warring factions. TheConference was addressed by the Special Representative ofthe United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers; the former United States President  Jimmy Carter;and the OAU Eminent Person  the Rev. Dr. CanaanBanana. General Arnold Quainoo  ECOMOG’s first fieldcommander and Special Representative of the ECOWASChairman  and the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS  Dr.Edouard Benjamin  also addressed the Conference andexpressed support for it.The Conference agenda included disarmament anddemobilization  governance and elections. The consensusof the Conference was that the fundamental problem of theLiberian conflict is not governance  but  rather  the refusalof the armed groups to disarm and demobilize. TheConference therefore called for strong and effectivesanctions to be applied against armed groups and warringfactions which fail to cooperate in the disarmament process.With respect to governance  the Conference indicatedthat the mandate of the Liberian National TransitionalGovernment should be extended and the Council of Statestrengthened so as to take the country through to free andfair democratic elections. We also see the LiberianNational Conference as the embodiment of the democraticaspirations of the Liberian people and their opposition tothe acquisition of power by force. Too much time  energyand resources and too many lives have been lost byLiberians and other West Africans to settle now for a lessthan honourable  just and lasting solution.I turn next to the Akosombo Agreement. TheLiberian National Conference had gained momentum andwas at the height of the debate on the fundamentalproblems of disarmament  governance and elections  whenHis Excellency  President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana Chairman of ECOWAS  along with the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  undertook newinitiatives to resolve the impasse in the peace process. Ameeting of leaders of two warring factions  Mr. CharlesTaylor of the NPFL and Lieutenant-General Alhaji S.G.Kromah  of ULIMO  together with the Chief of Staff ofthe Armed Forces of Liberia  Lieutenant-GeneralJ. Hezekiah Bowen  was held at Akosombo  Ghana. TheOAU Eminent Person  Dr. Canaan Banana  also attendedthe meeting. Except for General Bowen  the LiberianNational Transitional Government delegation wasexcluded from the deliberations at Akosombo.On 12 September 1994  General Bowen  Chief ofStaff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL)  withoutauthority signed the Akosombo Accord  along with thetwo warring leaders: Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah.The Agreement did not adequately address the issue ofdisarmament but instead called for the restructuring of theCouncil of State of the Liberian National TransitionalGovernment (LNTG). The two armed factions wouldeach nominate a representative; General Bowen —selected without consultation — would represent the AFL the constitutional army of Liberia; the ongoing LiberiaNational Conference would nominate one civilian; and theNational Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the UnitedLiberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO)would consult to nominate the fifth member of theCouncil. The restructured LNTG would have a life-spanof 16 months  with general elections slated for October1995 and installation of the newly elected government inJanuary 1996. The LNTG delegation registered itsreservations about the Agreement with the GhanianGovernment before returning to Liberia.In Liberia  the Akosombo Accord caused an outcryand widespread indignation. It was viewed as yet anotherattempt to appease the armed factional leaders whoseuncompromising stance has been responsible forprolonging the conflict  causing the death of so manyLiberians and bringing so much destruction and sufferingupon the people.The Government of Liberia has therefore rejected theAkosombo Accord for a number of reasons. First  theAccord endeavoured to reduce the armed forces ofLiberia  the constitutional army  to a warring faction.4General Assembly 22nd meetingSecondly  it failed to address adequately the politicalproblems — disarmament and demobilization of thewarring factions — that have been the single mostimportant stumbling-block to the peace process. Thirdly the premises underpinning the Akosombo Accord werefundamentally flawed. It ascribed power and influence toarmed leaders whose standing  credibility and control withintheir own respective factions are questionable. There wasalso a failure to recognize the changing military positionsof the factional leaders on the ground. For example  Mr.Charles Taylor of the NPFL has been unable to return to or regain  his headquarters at Gbarnga since leaving themeeting in Ghana  because his forces have been driven outby rival factions. A few days after General HezekiahBowen returned from Ghana  there was an attempted coupand mutiny in his army ranks  and he had to seek refuge atthe headquarters of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group(ECOMOG). General Alhaji Kromah’s ULIMO remainssplit.We are pleased to note that as an indication of hissincerity and commitment towards finding a just and lastingsolution to the Liberian crisis  the President of Ghana andcurrent Chairman of ECOWAS  His Excellency JerryRawlings  was quick to respond to the concerns raised bythe Liberian people to the Akosombo Accord. Within daysof its signing  he dispatched a delegation to Liberia to holdconsultations on the Agreement. He has since convened abroader-based consultative meeting in Accra. Consultationson the Agreement continue in this regard.The Liberian peace process is now at a critical stage.The reaction to the Akosombo Accord and the renewedoutbreak of hostilities in central Liberia among the armedfactions may lead some to conclude that Liberians aresimply not ready for peace  but this is not so. We areready for peace. We believe peace could finally be withineasy reach  given the right mix of initiatives. Recent eventsin the country  including the failed coup attempt bydissident elements of the Armed Forces of Liberia andrenewed hostilities among the warring factions  reinforcethe need for effective action towards disarmament anddemobilization.I would be amiss if I did not say how grateful thepeople of Liberia are to the United Nations  ECOWAS  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  non-governmentalorganizations  relief agencies and the entire internationalcommunity  who have made untold sacrifices andcontributed towards the search for peace in Liberia. In thislight  we wish to appeal to the world community to givegreater support to the work of ECOMOG by providingadditional logistics and resources to enable it effectivelyto execute its mandate under the Cotonou Agreement.Haiti provides a hopeful example of what can beaccomplished when the international community stays thecourse in helping to find a peaceful solution to intra-Stateconflicts. Indeed  while the same set of variables thatinfluenced tougher United Nations action in Haiti may notobtain in Liberia  the people of Liberia are crying out tothe world  especially to those countries that are betterendowed and constantly hail the benefits of democracy to take the high moral ground and lend their potent voicesand wherewithal to ending the human misery andsuffering in Liberia.I am therefore confident that the United Nations which has striven to implement the provisions of itsCharter for about half a century  can still muster thecourage and will to respond to the requisites of peace democracy and development for the truly global era thatis dawning as we approach the twenty-first century."
"97",4061,"LBY",49,1994,"On behalf of my country andin my own behalf  it gives me great pleasure to congratulateyou  Mr. President  on your election to the Presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. The factthat you belong to our beloved continent  coming as you dofrom a country bound with my own by bonds ofbrotherhood and relations of friendship and cooperation isa source of added pride to us in your assumption of thishigh office. My delegation is confident that  familiar asyou are with the work of the United Nations  and with yourextensive experience in the field of international relations you will be able to steer this session to a successfulconclusion. I should also like to seize this opportunity toexpress my delegation’s appreciation of your predecessor His Excellency Ambassador Insanally  for the wisdom hedisplayed  the efforts he made and the initiatives he took toreform the United Nations and enhance its role. Further  Iwish to express our gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali the Secretary-General  for his tireless efforts to strengthenour Organization so as to enable it to face the numerouscrises that beset the international community.The international situation witnessed manydevelopments during the forty-eighth session. The will ofthe people of South Africa has triumphed after a longstruggle and great sacrifices. It is indeed heartening tosee in our midst today the delegation of South Africa representing a united  democratic and non-racial country.Brotherly Yemen has survived its transient crisis andremains one united country  whose citizens are workingwith more determination and greater expectations  to buildthe modern State of Yemen. Along with thesedevelopments  tangible progress has been recorded in theimplementation of the Peace Accord in Mozambique.Moreover  the artificial tension in the Korean peninsula isnow subsiding. We are hopeful that the difficultiesrelating to the reunification of the Korean peninsula willbe overcome through dialogue to be entered into on equalfooting.Such developments are a source of satisfaction andwe greatly welcome them. However  they do not maskthe gloomy points of the wider picture of the internationalsituation. Many disputes still await a solution. Theoutbursts of nationalist passions  ethnic chauvinism andpower struggles in the absence of any power among thepeople  have led to the outbreak of new regional conflicts.Although some of these conflicts are getting closer to asolution  as is the case in Liberia  where the conflict isheading towards a permanent solution  the internationalcommunity must still support national reconciliationefforts in Afghanistan  overcome the setbacks to the peaceefforts being undertaken in the Balkans  consolidate therole of the United Nations in establishing peace in thatregion and guarantee the legitimate rights of the parties tothe dispute there.The international community is also called upon torenew its efforts aimed at reaching a satisfactory solutionto the problem of Cyprus. It must encourage peace talkson Angola and support work towards a negotiatedsolution in sisterly Somalia  in addition to demonstratingincreased solidarity to alleviate the tragedy of theRwandan people. It must also make more efforts to solvethe problem of Kashmir on the basis of bilateralagreements and the relevant United Nations resolutions inparticular.In the interest of stability in the Persian Gulf region my country stresses the importance of the unity andterritorial integrity of Iraq  and calls for an end to allinterference in its internal affairs. We also consider thatthe sanctions imposed on Iraq  which cause suffering tothe Iraqi people  should be lifted  since the reasons forthese sanctions are no longer valid. Their continuation9can only mean a grave injustice aimed at the destruction ofthe Iraqi people and the extermination of large groups of itspopulation.The United Nations has adopted many resolutions onthe Question of Palestine  all of which acknowledge theright of the Palestinian people to return to their homelandand to exercise the right of self-determination. Althoughthe United Nations has repeatedly reaffirmed theseresolutions for more than 40 years  the Palestinian questionstill awaits a solution  the Palestinian people remaindisplaced and their rights are systematically andcontinuously violated. This proves that the so-calledongoing peace process lacks the elements necessary for anycomprehensive settlement. This also shows that theresolution of the Palestinian question and the establishmentof comprehensive peace in the Middle East cannot berealized merely by returning Gaza back to its status as amunicipality and adding Jericho to it  but must rather comeabout through the liberation of all occupied Arab territoriesincluding the Syrian Golan and the acceptance of ademocratic solution that would meet all the rights of thePalestinian people  including their right to return to theirhomeland and establish their own independent State.A few months ago  we celebrated the historic victoryof the people of South Africa. It is no coincidence that thestruggle of the Palestinian people is in many ways similarto that of the people of South Africa  and that many of theacts of heroism of both peoples echo each other. Thesolution that made it possible to build a united  democraticand non-racial state in South Africa offers a model forresolving the question of Palestine through theestablishment in Palestine of a democratic non-racial Statewith Al Quds as its capital  where Arabs and Jews can livetogether. This is the proper solution  without which itwould be impossible to reach a just and lasting peace thatserves the interests of both Jews and the Palestinian Arabs.The numerous changes witnessed by the world afterthe cold war have created opportunities to build a morestable and secure world. However  the hopes of thepeoples of the world for greater and better understandingand for wider cooperation have started to wane. Theexperience of the past few years has caused deep concernregarding some developments. Some States have begun totry to impose their control and to expand their hegemony using their power and influence in utilizing internationalorgans to implement their plans  and using them particularly the Security Council  as a tool to punish thosecountries which abide by their principles and adoptindependent policies and positions. This was the verycontext of the dispute between my country and France Britain and the United States of America in what hasbecome known as the Lockerbie crisis. This problem wasraised  pushed arbitrarily through the Security Council and dealt with under Chapter VII of the Charter  which isnot applicable in this case since Libya has not threatenedanybody and has never acted in a manner that jeopardizedinternational peace and security. The whole issue ismerely the suspicion that two Libyans may be connectedto the Pan Am flight 103 incident.Aware as it has been all along of the motivationbehind this entire issue  my country has shown sincerereadiness to cooperate in uncovering the truth andcircumstances of that incident. We have taken thenecessary judicial measures consistent with the Charter ofthe United Nations and international law  with only oneproviso  that they do not involve any violation of Libya’ssovereign rights.Although the Security Council was pushed into theadoption of resolution 731 (1992)  Libya did declare itsreadiness effectively to cooperate in the implementationof that resolution. In that respect Libya took practicalsteps that were widely welcomed by numerousorganizations  including the League of Arab States  theOrganization of African Unity  the Organization of theIslamic Conference  and the Non-Aligned Movement. Itwas our hope that the three States concerned would takethat into consideration and respond positively to therequests of Libyan authorities for cooperation incompleting the investigation. However  the three Statesconcerned responded in an entirely different way. Insteadof accepting the initiatives calling for dialogue andnegotiation  and showing flexibility in dealing with theother aspects of the crisis  by reconsidering SecurityCouncil resolution 748 (1992) with a view to lifting thesanctions imposed on the Libyan people  instead  theyresorted to the Security Council once again and  usingtheir influence  managed to persuade it to adopt resolution883 (1993)  tightening the sanctions imposed byresolution 748 (1992).The argument invoked by the three States concernedto justify maintaining the sanctions and the threat even totighten them further  is that Libya has not complied withthe requirements of Security Council resolution 731(1992). And when these States are confronted with thefact that the Jamahiriya has really complied with these10requirements  their officials  and particularly British andAmerican officials  answer with the words ""Libya knowswhat is required of her"". Officials in both countries haverepeatedly used this phrase to such an extent that we areconvinced that the aim behind the raising of the Lockerbieincident is not to uncover the truth and the circumstancesof the issue but rather to achieve premeditated politicalobjectives. Indeed  if the aim had really been to bringLibya to comply with the requirements of resolution 731(1992)  that aim has been fully realized. Libya has takenthe legal measures necessary to pinpoint responsibility forthe terrorist acts perpetrated against both American andFrench planes. Libya has requested the three Statesconcerned to cooperate in completing the investigation inthis respect. Libya has even invited neutral bodies tofollow it up and international and humanitarianorganizations to monitor its fairness. My country hascooperated with the French judge in charge of theinvestigation aimed at determining responsibility for theexplosion aboard French UTA flight 772. Contacts in thisrespect still continue. My country has also cooperated withthe Government of the United Kingdom in trying touncover certain elements accused by the BritishGovernment of involvement in terrorist acts. To this end several meetings were held between the Libyan and Britishsides. Today  we are very glad to see that negotiationshave already started between Britain and the political andmilitary wings of the Irish Republic Army (IRA) and thatan agreement has been signed by the two parties. Now theleaders of the IRA are being received and welcomed at thehighest level in both London and Washington with a viewto holding negotiations with a view to ending the disputeand all its side effects.Libya has condemned international terrorism in all itsforms and declared its readiness to commit itself towhatever measures are adopted by the internationalcommunity to combat this scourge. Libya has also severedall its relations with all groups and organizations suspectedof being involved in terrorist acts. Libya has emphasizedthat it will not allow its territory  citizens or institutions tobe used for such acts whether directly or indirectly. Wehave declared our readiness to punish severely whoever isproved to be involved in any terrorist acts. Libya has alsodeclared that there are no terrorist training camps on itssoil. It has repeated its invitation to the Security Council or any international body mandated by the Council  toverify this. All these practical measures confirm the extentof my country’s seriousness in stamping out thephenomenon of international terrorism. This seriousnesshas been reflected in the call by the Jamahiriya for theconvening of a special session of the General Assembly tobe devoted to the study of the causes and dimensions ofthis problem and its support of the proposal to convene aninternational conference to define terrorism  includingState terrorism  and the means to eradicate it in all itsforms. It is State terrorism with which Libya is nowbeing threatened at the hands of a State which is apermanent member of the Security Council. That Statehas abducted Libyan prisoners of war from Chad and isnow training them and equipping them to undermine thesecurity and stability of Libya. This is the same terrorismto which Libya fell victim in 1973 when Israeli planesintentionally shot down a Libyan civilian airliner  killingall 108 passengers aboard; and also when the UnitedStates of America in 1986 bombed Libyan cities whilepeople were asleep in their beds and caused great loss oflife and damage to property. Later it was revealed thatthe acts used by that State as a pretext for its aggressionwere unfounded.The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has spared no effort intrying to resolve the dispute  including trying the twosuspects in the Pan Am flight 103 incident  although thematter has been predetermined by the 1971 MontrealConvention which gives Libya the right to try the twosuspects itself. However  the refusal by Britain and theUnited States of America to abide by this Convention  towhich they are both parties  has prompted Libya to seekother ways of holding the trial. Thus  Libya offered toresort to the International Court of Justice or to surrenderthe two suspects to the United Nations office in Libya forinvestigation. Libya has also proposed that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should establish a fact-finding legal commission to verify the seriousness of theaccusations  including carrying out a comprehensiveinvestigation. Competent Libyan authorities referred thematter to the basic popular congresses which constituteour legislative authority and they in turn made thedecision that they had no objection to letting the twosuspects stand trial before a fair tribunal to be agreedupon. Proceeding from this  my country declared itsreadiness to enter into negotiations with the Statesconcerned under the supervision of the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations on the trial to be held in a placeagreed to by all parties concerned where full guaranteeswould be available to establish the truth  indeed the veryaim of Security Council resolution 731 (1992).Recently  new information on the American aircraftincident has been uncovered  including a book entitledTracking the Octopus by Coleman and Donald and thestatements by the manager of a Swiss electronicscompany. These new revelations obliterate the central11element on which the accusations against the two Libyancitizens was based. Despite all this  Libya maintained itscooperation in trying to identify all the circumstancessurrounding the incident. On this basis  Libya accepted theproposal of the Council of the League of Arab Statescontained in its resolution 5373 of 27 March 1994. Thatproposal called for trying the two suspects by Scottishjudges under Scottish law at the seat of the InternationalCourt of Justice. Even after new information was revealedby the Palestinian citizen  Yousef Shaaban  before aLebanese Court  Libya did not hesitate to go ahead with thetrial and did not waver in its declared readiness to acceptany verdict emanating from such a trial.This  once again  underlines the fact that the LibyanJamahiriya has no objection to the trial of the two suspects.All that Libya wants is for the trial to be fair and just  freefrom any emotional or media influences  and with theavailability of all guarantees consistent with the norms oflegality and international law  which Libya has observedand applied. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) cantestify to this  since that Court has considered  over the past10 years  three cases to which Libya was a party. The ICJdecided the case relating to the continental shelf betweenLibya and Tunisia  and both parties fully implemented theruling of the Court. The same happened in the case of thecontinental shelf between Libya and Malta; once again thetwo parties implemented the ruling of the InternationalCourt of Justice. This year  the Court decided the territorialdispute between the Jamahiriya and Chad. Though theruling rejected Libya’s demands  the Jamahiriya didimplement it in a constructive spirit that was welcomed andappreciated by both the Security Council and the Secretary-General. This shows the extent of my country’scommitment to and respect of international legality something that great powers pay lip service to but neverapply. These States refuse even to appear before the ICJ since they believe in the legality of force and not the forceof legality.Most international and regional organizations haverenewed their appeal to the three States to accept theinitiatives calling for dialogue and negotiation  with a viewto reaching a peaceful settlement to the crises. Thoseorganizations  including the 11th Ministerial Conference ofthe States Members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the60th Session of the Council of Ministers of theOrganization of African Unity  welcomed Libya’sacceptance of the Arab League’s proposal. This augustAssembly  which includes all States represented in thoseorganizations  is now called upon to show its appreciationof Libya’s position  Libya’s steps and initiatives and theproposals that we have accepted. It should call on thethree States concerned to show flexibility and enter intodialogue with the Jamahiriya with the aim of reaching apeaceful settlement to this problem. This Assembly isalso called upon to express its support of these demands so that the Security Council will reconsider its resolutionson the crisis and lift the unjust sanctions. It is absurd andignorant to depict the sanctions as being against theLibyan Government  because in Libya there is noGovernment as such. The power is in the hands of thepeople  who now suffer the consequences of thesesanctions - for example  the crash of a Libyan civilianaircraft in 1992  leading to the death of all 157 civiliansaboard  as a result of the ban on spare parts.Furthermore  1 622 people have been killed in caraccidents  and 350 people  most of whom were children old men and women died as a result of delays in movingthem abroad for medical treatment. These sanctions havealso caused economic damage estimated at $4.5 billion.These damages are detailed in official documentS/1994/921.Before the Second World War  and following theend of that war  the Libyan people suffered and continueto suffer all sorts of pressure  troubles and pains. Wehave been subjected to colonialism in its worst form: aFascism that wreaked havoc in our country  killing displacing and exiling countless numbers of our citizens.Against our will  we had to be a theatre of war betweenthe colonial powers  a war that was fought on our soiland for which we were the fuel. That war’s mines arestill buried in our soil  in our farms and under our homes.From time to time  these mines explode and kill innocentpeople. In previous sessions of this Assembly  mycountry has repeatedly called on the States concerned tocooperate with us in removing these mines. Today 7 October  coincides with the commemoration of theLibyan people of the 25th anniversary of the evacuationof the last Fascists who had settled in Libya andoppressed its people. Once again I repeat my call andurge the States concerned to respond positively to theresolutions of the General Assembly  instructing them toprovide the necessary information on mines  givetechnical assistance in removing them  and paycompensation for the losses they have caused. This mayalso be a good opportunity to remind the imperialist statesthat occupied our lands for over 40 years that we havenot forgotten the ruin and destruction they left behind.I should also like to announce that my country through this Assembly and other forums  will seek tocompel colonialist states to pay fair compensation for the12resources they have looted and the wealth and money theyhave plundered from our country. The peoples of the worldare called upon to adopt a historic resolution  through thisOrganization  condemning colonialism and forcing formercolonial powers to compensate their former colonies  inorder to prevent the re-emergence of colonialism andprevent the powerful from once more blackmailing andoppressing the weak.The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya welcomes efforts aimedat enhancing security and cooperation in the Mediterraneanregion. We voice our satisfaction with the initiatives whoseobjective is to enhance economic  social  cultural andenvironmental cooperation in the region. Libya calls fortaking all measures necessary to remove all causes oftension in the area  especially through the withdrawal offoreign military fleets whose continued presence jeopardizespeace and security in the Mediterranean  which in turn areclosely linked to international peace and security. TheArab Maghreb Union has achieved tangible progress on theroad towards economic integration among its countries andtowards the consolidation of the underpinnings ofdevelopment in these countries. It has also opened newchannels of cooperation with organizations in the areas towhich we belong both geographically and culturally. Libyawelcomes those steps and expresses the hope that theMaghreb Union will succeed in playing a similar role withits counterpart organizations on the other side of theMediterranean  beginning with the intensification ofcontacts and meetings  as well as active dialogue with theinstitutions concerned  on a basis of equality and commoninterests in a manner capable of responding to the conceptof joint development and the collective responsibility formaintaining peace and strengthening cooperation on theshores of the Mediterranean.In view of the stability of the political system in theJamahiriya and its importance as an economic market  itwould be impossible to marginalize or ignore its role in anycooperation between the shores of the Mediterranean ifsuch cooperation is achieve its objectives  at the forefrontof which is serving the peoples of the region and achievingtheir prosperity.Some progress has been registered recently in the fieldof disarmament. This is a welcome development. Libyalooks forward to more international cooperation with a viewto destroying nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  aswell as other weapons of mass destruction. We lookforward to the banning of the development  stockpiling anduse of all such weapons. My country also hopes that moreefforts will be made to conclude a treaty on making Africaa nuclear-weapon-free zone and the activation of theinitiative aimed at making the Middle East region freefrom weapons of mass destruction. The Libyan ArabJamahiriya is a party to the nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty. We hope that the preparatory committee for the1995 review conference will  in its next session  reach anunderstanding that takes into consideration the concernsof all parties to the Treaty  especially as regards itsextension. My country still has some difficulty inaccepting an indefinite extension of the Treaty  becausesuch an extension does not take into account several ofour concerns  including the unavailability of crediblesecurity guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon states.Furthermore  the area in which we live suffers from asecurity imbalance  resulting from Israel’s acquisition ofnuclear weapons and its non-adherence to thenon-proliferation regime. It has not acceded to theTreaty  nor has it signed a safeguard agreement with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That iswhy my country would like to emphasize that it isessential to address these concerns at the time ofconsidering the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treatyin 1995.Respect for and protection of human rights is one ofthe fundamental underpinnings of Libyan policy. Thishas been demonstrated in various forms which includedthe setting up of the International Committee for theQaddafi Human Rights Prize and the adoption of thegreen document on human rights and basic humanfreedoms. Libya is determined to support and contributeto all international efforts aimed at guaranteeing theeffective enjoyment of human rights. We thus welcomethe conclusions of the Vienna Conference  whichconstitute a step on the road to the support andenhancement of human rights. That human rightsConference rejected the manipulation of human rights andtheir use as a tool of political pressure. This universallyadopted principle must be respected  especially by Statesthat selectively raise problems related to human rights.The international community must stand up to anyattempt by any State or group of States to exploit humanrights as a means of interfering in the internal affairs ofother States. It must also oppose any attempt by anyState or group of States to distort the principles andvalues of other peoples or to promote the principles andvalues of such States or groups of States as the onlyproper values that should be embraced by all peoples.The international community’s hopes for a secureand stable world cannot be realized without addressingeconomic problems  particularly in the developing13countries  where economies continue to face difficulties asa result of the aggravation of the problem of external debts the application of protectionist trade policies  the impositionof harsh conditions for their importation of advancedtechnology  the deteriorating prices of raw materials and thecontinued attempts to impose new taxes  such as the carbontax  which could hurt not only the economies of the oil-exporting States but also those of oil-importing countries.We believe it is impossible to solve these problemseffectively unless the international community dealsseriously with and puts an end to the erroneous practicesthat continue to characterize international economicrelations. Such practices include coercive economicmeasures  such as the freezing of assets and theconfiscation by certain developing countries of the propertyof a number of developing countries  including my own.Such measures constitute an impediment to growth  asidefrom the fact that they run counter to the Charter of theUnited Nations  norms of international law and theresolutions of the General Assembly.The General Assembly is the natural place forMember States to exercise their rights and express theirviews on the initiatives aimed at reforming the UnitedNations. In the course of the last session  we followed withkeen interest everything that was achieved in this regard.My country expresses its satisfaction at the progress madetowards revitalizing the activities of the General Assemblyand the establishment of an effective working relationshipbetween the Assembly and the Security Council. We hopefuture efforts will result in an increase in the membershipof the Security Council based on equitable geographicaldistribution. To our mind  this process must beaccompanied by measures to remove obstacles to the properfunctioning of the Council  such as the privilege of vetopower  and improvements in its working methods so that itcan function in accordance with the principles of theCharter and  eschewing double standards  deal consistentlywith all issues.If we examine past Security Council practices we shallfind that while the Council showed interest in trying tosecure commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it has turned and continues to turn a blind eye to Israel which has not acceded to the Treaty and actually possesses200 nuclear warheads. Furthermore  the Security Councilhas insisted on invoking Chapter VII of the Charter in casesto which it is not applicable  while at the same time failingto invoke Chapter VII in the case of Israel  despite itsdefiance of United Nations resolutions and its continuedoccupation of the territories of States Members of theUnited Nations. The Council kept silent on the Israelirefusal to withdraw from southern Lebanon and on themassacres perpetrated against the Palestinians  such as theone in Hebron’s Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi Al-Sharif - theMosque of Abraham - where  in an act of terrorism  afanatical Zionist settler  trained in an American camp killed over 50 Palestinians while they were praying.My country believes that  in the context of reformingthe Security Council  the Council must be neutral andgive none of its members a chance to dominate it or steerit towards serving its own interests  as has been the casein so many instances  the latest of which was theCouncil’s granting of permission to one of its permanentmembers to invade an independent State Member of theUnited Nations  the Republic of Haiti. It has been saidthat the objective of that action was to restore democracyand protect human rights. If this were true  why wasthere no such action in the past  when the people of thatcountry were suffering under the yoke of a repressiveregime  subjected to the most vicious violations of theirhuman rights? What happened was a flagrant violation ofthe Charter  an act of aggression against the inviolabilityof an independent country. It also establishes thedangerous precedent of giving permission to a State unhappy about waves of immigrants reaching its shores to occupy the land where the immigration originates.Libya cannot afford to overlook this invasion orkeep silent about it  first  as a matter of principle and secondly  because Haiti has a special place in our history.Forty-five years ago Haiti played a decisive role in amatter of interest to us. Its deciding vote won theadoption of the General Assembly resolution on Libya’sindependence.At this time next year  the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations will begin. Whiledevelopments in recent years have revealed someweaknesses in some of the United Nations organs’handling of dispute settlement and crisis management  thiscannot be attributed to the Charter but  rather  to thetendency by certain Powers  insisting that their approachalone should be adopted  to impose their hegemony on thehandling of international matters.This question should be the focus of attention in thenext session because it will mark the demise of the oldorder and the building of the new order that will replaceit. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya intends to participatewith others in building this new order to ensure that itwill be an order based on justice and equality thatrespects peoples’ political and economic options  secures14full commitment to international law and full respect for theCharter of the United Nations and stands up to those whowould push the United Nations towards the fate of theLeague of Nations. The new order we need is one thatenhances and protects human rights and eradicates poverty suffering  division  conflicts  disputes and wars. It must bean order in which no State seeks to impose its hegemonyand abuse its influence  an order that supports thesettlement of disputes among States by peaceful means  notby arbitrary and coercive means. We need a new orderunder whose umbrella all peoples can look optimistically toa future where security  peace and stability prevail."
"98",4092,"LCA",49,1994,"Permit me  Sir  to extendto you the congratulations of my country and of mydelegation on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. You bringwith you to the office of the presidency experience whichis both wide and varied. Added to this is yourwell-known commitment to the ideals and principles thatgovern this Organization. These qualities together serveto provide us with every confidence that under yourdistinguished guidance our deliberations cannot but beproductive in the furtherance of the objectives of thisworld body.I want also to take this opportunity to applaudAmbassador Insanally of Guyana for the distinguishedmanner in which he led the Assembly during its forty-eighth session.As the international community gathers once againto bring its collective wisdom to bear on solutions fordealing with problems which continue to threaten thewelfare of the world and its people  we cannot but  with7a sense of mixed emotions  reflect on what we as a bodyhave been able to accomplish to date. Those emotionsrange from the satisfaction experienced at the success ofour collective efforts to bring about a climate ofcoexistence and harmony in South Africa and the MiddleEast - with the prospects now provided for humanadvancement in those regions - to the sense of deep regretthat  even as we record such major successes  the sufferingand the waste of human life caused by territorial conflictand the injustice of decisions based on ethnic considerationscontinue to place serious obstacles in the path of universalprogress.My delegation salutes both President Mandela andVice President de Klerk for their courage and determinationin working together to consolidate their strong beginningsin the direction of a multiracial democracy. My delegationwill continue to support the international community in itsefforts to assist the millions of deprived South Africansattain a better quality of life.However  my delegation is still deeply concernedabout some other countries in Africa  which continue towage a hopeless battle against poverty  disease  debtsettlement and political strife. It is important that moreattention be given to the economic welfare of Africa toprevent other unfortunate massacres similar to thosewitnessed in Rwanda and Somalia.In keeping with the spirit of universality that prevailstoday  Saint Lucia had hoped that the question of fullmembership of the United Nations for the Republic ofChina on Taiwan would be favourably considered as asupplementary item on the agenda. Saint Lucia continuesto lend its support to the Republic of China on Taiwan inits efforts to achieve full membership of the UnitedNations  and urges the inclusion of this item on the agendaof the fiftieth session. It is indeed anomalous that acountry already making a valuable contribution on theinternational stage should continue to find itself debarredfrom participation in the family of nations.Saint Lucia is heartened by the progress towards peacein the Middle East that has been achieved between Israeland Palestine and between Israel and Jordan. However  mydelegation notes with some concern the renewed potentialfor conflict between Iraq and Kuwait  and again calls uponthe Government of Iraq to recognize and respect theterritorial integrity of the State of Kuwait.The devastating conflict in the former Yugoslavia which the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has lamented has spared no one in its violence  remains like several other conflicts around the world  a majorfocus of peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts by theUnited Nations.These conflicts not only challenge the capacity ofthe United Nations to deal with those problems in a waythat would lead to their resolution  but also engender newand frightening dimensions of human suffering  resultingfrom the large-scale displacement of populations and theconcomitant disabilities to which they become exposed.The net effect of such calamities goes beyond theurgent call for a global response  in that it creates newstresses in the developing world  through the diversion ofscarce resources away from peaceful development  intoattenuating human suffering.My delegation therefore wholeheartedly supportsefforts by the Secretary-General to foster greater regionalinvolvement in conflict-resolution and in the creation ofappropriate humanitarian support structures.With rising unemployment  poverty and drug abuse our societies face an almost insurmountable challengewhich threatens the ability of our youth to achieve theirtrue potential. The response to this mounting threatresides in a universal blueprint aimed at reversing theeconomic and social ills from which it springs. In thisregard my delegation supports the Secretary-General’sAgenda for Development.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment  held in Cairo this year  was a powerfulinitiative  however contentious some of the issues mayhave been. The forthcoming World Summit for SocialDevelopment  to be held in Copenhagen and the WorldConference on Women  to be held in Beijing  offerprospects of great promise in identifying new approachesto the attainment of productive employment and therelease of innate capacities as well as the empowermentand participation of all sectors of the population in thealleviation of their conditions. My country willparticipate in and support those processes.Saint Lucia is of the view that the issues leading tothe isolation of Cuba from the mainstream of economicand social development within our hemisphere areoverdue for re-examination. My delegation calls for thespeedy removal of all impediments to Cuba’s ability toparticipate within the commonwealth of nations in themanner permitted by the Charter of the United Nations.8The recently concluded agreement between theGovernment of the United States of America and theGovernment of Cuba on immigration is timely andwelcome. My delegation expresses the hope that thisagreement will open new vistas for further dialogue andgreater understanding between the two countries.Like other countries of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM)  Saint Lucia shares the vision of hope forHaiti. We are proud to be a participant in the UnitedNations Mission in Haiti  as we have participated in formermeans of assistance to Haiti  and  along with ourCARICOM counterparts  assisted by the wider internationalcommunity  will work tirelessly for the successfulimplantation of true democracy in Haiti. The unfoldingevents of the past few days give added impetus to theefforts of the regional and international community to bringHaiti towards self-fulfilment within the community ofdemocratic nations.It has been made clear that the holding of democraticelections and the installation of a legitimate Governmentcannot by themselves guarantee democracy  especially in acountry devoid of democratic traditions. To sustain suchdemocratic beginnings  appropriate structures must be putin place  adequately resourced in both human and materialterms  and suitable support mechanisms must be designedand firmly rooted. Above all  there must be theinternational will to encourage  facilitate and enrich thisdemocratic process  as would be exemplified throughmassive development assistance over a sustained period.The global economic situation is at present at a criticalcrossroads  reflecting a speedily moving trend towards tradeliberalization and the need for national economies toimprove their own efficiency and competitiveness.The constraints of smallness have continuallyconspired against States like Saint Lucia in terms of itsability meaningfully to raise its gross domestic product.While the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)and its successor organization the World TradeOrganization  seem to offer medium- and long-term benefitsat least to some developed countries  there remains anagging concern among developing countries that certainbarriers may still remain  or be created  that wouldeffectively militate against the products of developingcountries entering the markets of developed countries.My delegation joins with the rest of the developingworld in calling upon the developed world  and the majorinternational institutions  to re-examine their policies andemphases  with a view to adopting measures that canrealistically assist small developing economies in theirattempts to keep pace with the dictates of contemporaryeconomic trends.Of particular concern must be the consequences ofthese new developments for small island States such asours  whose exposed economies make them vulnerableand sensitive to changes that take place elsewhere. SaintLucia’s economy  for instance  has already experiencedthe shock resulting from changes brought about by theadvent of the European Union.Saint Lucia’s economy is highly dependent on itsexport of bananas to the European Union and despite newarrangements put in place to provide limited accessguarantees for fruit from African  Caribbean and PacificStates (ACP) - and Saint Lucia expresses its appreciationto those European States that have been instrumental insecuring these arrangements - the industry in Saint Luciahas experienced a devastating downturn in prices  whichin turn has been directly responsible for the economicdisruption  and its allied social instability  that occurredduring the latter part of 1993 and this year  1994.It is to be regretted that even the limited concessionsprovided by Europe in discharge of its treaty obligations have been subjected to a withering attack by forces whichseem fully prepared to see the economies of small islandStates  already possessing so little room for flexibility placed in total jeopardy.That is the experience that urges this delegationagain to call the attention of the international communityto the special circumstances of small island developingStates and the need for particular measures to deal withtheir peculiar circumstances.The Government of Saint Lucia has been observingwith some concern the development of the NorthAmerican Free Trade Association (NAFTA)  given theserious adverse consequences it will have in the mediumterm and long term for relatively nascent industries andthe micro-economies of our small States. MyGovernment regrets that United States legislation onNAFTA contains no expressed arrangement which takesinto account the limits of our industrial base.Consequently  the fragility of our economies will onlyworsen  resulting in economic and social discontent.In this regard we appeal to the internationalcommunity for special trade considerations while9adjustments are made to meet the international challengesthat the world economic environment engenders.The countries of the Caribbean Community  cognizantof the rapidly changing economic environment  and theurgent need for cooperative effort to adjust  and in somecases  survive the challenges ensuing from this change have undertaken measures to deepen their relations withtheir Caribbean neighbours by formally creating theAssociation of Caribbean States (ACS)  membership ofwhich encompasses all countries washed by the CaribbeanSea. We hope the international community will be helpfulin encouraging this self-help initiative to achieve its fullpotential.Last year  at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro  the issueof sustainable development was accepted as a majorcomponent to be included in the development agendas ofcountries the world over. Arising out of the universalblueprint emerging from that Conference is the recognition at last  of the peculiar circumstances of small islanddeveloping States in their pursuit of sustainabledevelopment.Designing development policies and implementingprogrammes for small island States such as Saint Luciarequire considerable imagination and ingenuity  as wasshown by the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  held inBarbados earlier this year.A successful follow-up to that Conference would relyheavily on financial resources for the implementation of itsfindings. My delegation calls upon the internationalcommunity to provide active support to the United NationsDevelopment Programme  which has been charged with theresponsibility for the coordination and implementation ofthe programme of action.Our small island State  Saint Lucia  seems to oscillatebetween triumph and disaster. Last year we highlighted ourtriumphs in the recognition of our two Nobel laureates.This year the disastrous hand of nature in the form oftropical storm ""Debbie"" struck Saint Lucia  dramaticallyemphasizing the vulnerability of small island developingStates. Over an 11-hour period  this small 660-square-kilometre territory  historically dependent on agriculture mainly bananas  tourism and small-scale manufacturing was battered by nearly 15 inches of rain  resulting in fourdeaths by drowning  numerous landslides  and massiveflooding that destroyed bridges  roads  houses  and 60 percent of the banana crop. Even our international airportlay buried temporarily beneath two feet of water andmud.With over 50 per cent of the working population ofSaint Lucia engaged in banana-associated enterprises  andwith more than 50 per cent of export earnings derivedfrom banana exports  destruction of 60 per cent of thebanana crop cannot but create serious economic andsocial consequences for us. This again underscores thevulnerability of small States like ours  and the need forthe international community to recognize their specialpeculiarities and needs and to make appropriate provisionsto facilitate their survival.Permit me  on behalf of my Prime Minister  and theGovernment and people of Saint Lucia  to expressprofound thanks and appreciation to the several membersand agencies of our Organization for their expressions ofsympathy  concern and support  and  in several cases offers or tangible manifestations of assistance in our timeof need.As we focus on the milestone of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations and its Charter  weshould perceive the ideas that subtend this body as acementing balm that would bring the disparate pieces ofour shattered globe together in peace  harmony  creativityand beauty. The United Nations has over the years beenparty to the achievement of many political strides towardsdemocratization and unprecedented levels of cooperationbetween nation States.The global situation that necessitated the creation ofthe United Nations has undergone tremendous changesover the last 50 years. Our membership has more thandoubled  and  as we continue to witness the emergence ofnew States  social and economic demands increase coupled with new  pressing concerns  such as theenvironment  women’s rights  children’s rights and goodgovernance  to name a few. My delegation supports thedemand for enhancing the resources of the United Nationsto enable it to cope with its expanded responsibilities. Itis also necessary that this Assembly be made moreeffective and efficient in the execution of its functions  sothat it can become more responsive to the needsparticularly of developing countries  and can assist thosecountries in their development processes.Saint Lucia joins scores of other delegates in callingfor an increase in the membership of the Security Councilto reflect the increase in membership of this Organization10and the concept of universality that the Charter advocates.It is also necessary that the Security Council allow for moreconsultation with the General Assembly in its deliberationsso that its perspectives may become even more reflective ofthe world community.In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1993  entitled""The Antilles  Fragments of an Epic Memory "" SaintLucia’s Poet Laureate  Derek Walcott  said:""Break a vase and the love that reassembles thefragments is stronger than that love which took itssymmetry for granted when it was whole.""We see in this idea the touchstone for the UnitedNations and the international community as thisOrganization approaches its anniversary year. We canextend this perception to embrace the cracked vases of ourglobe  in which the horrors of Somalia  the demoralizationand brutality of Haiti  the carnage of the Anglo-Irishconflict and the racial bigotry in other parts of the worldare all seen as products of the accident of history and thepoverty of the human spirit. It is hoped that through theefforts of the United Nations a renewed humanitarianismwill be engendered and bound with a strength thatguarantees peace and the well-being of the world and itspeople."
"99",4119,"LIE",49,1994,"At the outset  let mecongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I wish youevery success and pledge you the full support of mydelegation. I also wish to commend your predecessor  HisExcellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  forthe excellent and able manner in which he conducted thework of the forty-eighth session.Under his wise guidance  the Member States of theUnited Nations  during the forty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly  engaged in a creative and constructivedialogue on a question likely to have a great impact on thefuture work and credibility of the United Nations  that ofequitable representation on and increase in the membershipof the Security Council. The report of the Working Group which was adopted on 14 September by the GeneralAssembly  makes it clear that these discussions have had apositive beginning and that much more work in aconstructive and open-minded spirit remains to be done inorder to find a solution acceptable to all Member States.Even though detailed discussion of this sensitive issue mustbe continued by the Working Group  I should like toreiterate at this juncture that the Government ofLiechtenstein attaches the utmost importance to maintainingthe efficiency and effectiveness of the work of the SecurityCouncil  and that at the same time it holds the view that thediscussions of the Working Group should cover not onlythe enlargement of the Council  but also  and to no less anextent  its working methods.The second session of the Preparatory Committee forthe World Summit for Social Development  which will takeplace in Copenhagen in March 1995  concluded its workjust three weeks ago. The Liechtenstein Government isencouraged by the results of this session  which prove thatthe preparatory process is on the right track  and we areconfident that the consultations to be held by AmbassadorSomavía during the last week of October will lay a solidbasis for the work of the third session and bring MemberStates closer to achieving the important goal of a finaldocument which can be adopted by consensus. TheWorld Summit for Social Development can be a crucialevent for the future of mankind  and we must not missthis opportunity to promote social progress and betterstandards of living in greater freedom  which is one of themost noble goals of this Organization. This gathering  asthe draft final document acknowledges  is closelyinterlinked with other important conferences  notably theInternational Conference on Population and Development which was successfully concluded on 13 September inCairo  and the Fourth World Conference on Women  tobe held in Beijing in September 1995.Among other subjects under consideration by theGeneral Assembly  the draft final document also mentionsthe International Year of the Family  which we are stillcelebrating. I wish to underline that  in the view of theLiechtenstein Government  a concise summary andanalysis of the activities undertaken within the frameworkof the International Year of the Family  at both thenational and the regional levels  can make a substantivecontribution to the successful outcome of the two UnitedNations world conferences in 1995  and at the same timecan help achieve the goal of making the InternationalYear of the Family not an isolated event  but  rather  onewhich will have a continuing and long-term impact onnational policies as well as on regional and internationalcooperation. Liechtenstein has undertaken manifoldactivities in order to celebrate the International Year;amongst other things  it dedicated the commemorativeactivities for its National Day on 15 August to theobjectives of the International Year. The Government ofLiechtenstein therefore wholeheartedly welcomes thedecision of the General Assembly  taken in its resolution47/237 of September 1993  to hold an internationalconference on the family  which will take place here inNew York on 18 October  and hopes to be in a positionto contribute to giving the International Year a lastingimpact.In our view  preventive diplomacy  as outlined in""An Agenda for Peace""  could and should be used moreoften and more efficiently. We commend the activities ofthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE). Especially since the 1990 Summit meeting inParis  when the leaders of 36 States signed and committedthemselves to the Charter of Paris for a New Europe  theCSCE has shown that it can play a most useful role in8monitoring specific situations and in initiating negotiationprocesses. We are of the opinion that improvedcoordination of the activities of the Conference and thoseof the United Nations can achieve very fruitful results.The international political environment has changed.Having been accorded its rightful place in the promotionand maintenance of international peace and security  theUnited Nations now has as one of its central tasks that ofplaying a more active role than ever before in conflictresolution. Unfortunately it must be stated again this yearthat the sheer number and magnitude of the conflictssurpass the abilities of this Organization. There is noregion in the world without a conflict of some sort; regionalconflicts have become a major threat to international peaceand security. We are aware that peace-keeping must be andwill remain one of the Organization’s most importantinstruments for maintaining peace and security in the world but peace-keeping operations have to be provided with clearmandates and be set within a reasonable and realistic time-frame. Since Liechtenstein became a member of the UnitedNations in 1990 the expenses for peace-keeping operationshave increased dramatically. We are aware that thechanging global situation has made an increase ofpeace-keeping activities unavoidable  but it should also benoted that these costs increasingly constitute a heavy burdenfor national budgets.In this connection  we should note that we welcomethe creation of the post of an Under-Secretary-General forInternal Oversight Services and the appointment of Mr.Karl Theodor Paschke to this post. We hope that thisimportant step will lead to improved financial managementof the United Nations and at the same time to timely andfull payment of assessed contributions by all MemberStates  both into the regular budget and for peace-keepingactions.The Liechtenstein Government attaches the utmostimportance to the promotion and protection of human rightsand I wish to emphasize that the Declaration andProgramme of Action adopted by the World Conference onHuman Rights in Vienna in June 1993 can  if it is followedby full implementation of its provisions  constitute amilestone in the history of the United Nations. TheGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session took a first andvery important step by adopting the mandate for the HighCommissioner for Human Rights  a post which had beenunder discussion for a very long time. I wish to thankAmbassador Ayala Lasso for all the efforts he hasundertaken so far in fulfilling his very difficult task and toassure him of our full support. However  more anddetermined action by the General Assembly is needed including the allocation of an increased percentage of theoverall budget of the United Nations to the Centre forHuman Rights in order to enable it to carry out its taskseven more efficiently.The United Nations is approaching its fiftiethanniversary and preparing to commemorate that event ina dignified manner. I should like to thankUnder-Secretary-General Gillian Sorensen for her untiringefforts with regard to the commemorative activities of theOrganization. The jubilee is also a good opportunity tobring the purposes and the work of the United Nationscloser to the individuals  the people  who are the centralsubject of the Organization’s endeavours. Liechtensteinwishes to contribute to achieving this goal and hastherefore scheduled several activities  information onwhich will be provided in due course. I should like however  to avail myself of this opportunity to referbriefly to a project which is of particular importance to usand  we believe  of direct relevance for the UnitedNations.In one of Liechtenstein’s first contributions to thesegeneral debates after becoming a Member of the UnitedNations  His Serene Highness Prince Hans Adam II Ruling Prince and Head of State of Liechtenstein introduced at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly aninitiative on certain aspects of self-determination  and heelaborated on it at later sessions  including theforty-eighth. Self-determination has been of very greatimportance in the history of the United Nations and is  ofcourse  enshrined as a principle in its Charter. Asrepresentatives of Liechtenstein have outlined on severaloccasions  our initiative seeks to open up for discussionby the international community certain aspects of the rightof self-determination and to encourage a more flexibleand practical implementation of that right.Last year  at the request of the delegation ofLiechtenstein  a new sub-item was included in the agendaof the General Assembly  entitled ""Effective realization ofthe right to self-determination through autonomy"" . Wehad a very interesting debate in the Third Committee  atthe close of which Member States  while agreeing toconsider the matter further at a later stage  preferred notto do so during this present  forty-ninth  session of theGeneral Assembly. Reactions and comments made duringand surrounding the debate by a large number ofcountries  as well as developments on the internationalscene  have confirmed our view that this initiative istimely and potentially valuable for the international9community. We will therefore be pursuing it asconstructively as possible.It seems to us that at this stage it would be mostappropriate  and most likely to lead to fruitful results  forthis subject to be developed further within an academic rather than a political  framework. His Serene HighnessPrince Hans Adam II has therefore  as one element ofLiechtenstein’s contribution to the commemoration of thefiftieth anniversary  given a grant to Princeton University’sWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairsto establish a research programme on self-determination tobe conducted under the auspices of the Woodrow WilsonSchool’s Center of International Studies. Two conferencesare to be organized in March and June 1995 within theframework of this research programme. They will be openfor participation to all Member States of the UnitedNations  and I wish to extend an invitation to all States tocontinue working together with us to make further progresson this crucially important question.International law is the best guarantee of respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as well as ofinternational peace and security. In the case ofLiechtenstein  it is also the only guarantee. I therefore wishto reaffirm our commitment to cooperate with all States infurther strengthening international law in order to achievea secure  a peaceful and a prosperous future for thegenerations to come."
"100",4166,"LKA",49,1994,"First  let me offer you on behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka warm congratulations to the President on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. We wish him an eminently successful tenure ofthat high office.Sri Lanka would also wish to express its gratitude toAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana for hisexceptionally creative conduct of the work of the crucialforty-eighth session. Our good wishes extend also to HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-Generalof this Organization  who must contend with increasinglychallenging tasks at a time when the United Nations isundergoing major transformation.In Sri Lanka  the winds of change are blowing. Inour country  we stand on the threshold of a new era oftolerance and peace  ending dissension. In August thisyear  the Peoples’ Alliance was voted into office  after 17years in opposition  in a parliamentary general electionthat was internationally acclaimed as both free and fair.At this election - Sri Lanka’s ninth since independence -the people voted overwhelmingly  reaffirming their faithin parliamentary democracy  in fundamental freedoms andin the rule of law. Of the registered electorate  76.2 percent cast their vote  thus maintaining Sri Lanka’s longtradition of high political consciousness and modelelection procedures.What happened on 16 August in my country wasmore than the routine exercise of the ballot to change agovernment. In an election atmosphere in whichconflicting views were given full rein  the Sri Lanka voterremained mature  calm and solidly entrenched in ourcultural and democratic values. The result of the poll wastherefore a victory for moderation  tolerance and unity.In my first speech one month ago in our newly electedParliament  I  as a representative of the minority Tamilcommunity  made a statement that I shall now repeathere  in this supreme parliament of the peoples of theworld:""Let it never be said  if it could ever have been said that the Sinhala people are racists. They are not.They are absolutely not  and I think this election hasdemonstrated so handsomely that that particularargument can be laid to rest for ever.""Under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga  a peacefultransition of power has been effected  defying the cynicalpredictions of some. Our nation’s rich and diversecultural heritage  steeped in the great religions of theworld and buttressed by a unique foundation of five legal23systems  has made this triumph of democratic expressionpossible.Sri Lanka’s new Government reflects the multi-ethnic multi-religious fabric of its society. In Parliament  theGovernment has the support of a number of politicalparties  including those of the Tamil and Muslimcommunities. It is  therefore  well poised to bring an endto the conflict in the north-east part of the country throughpolitical negotiations  as mandated by the people. PrimeMinister Bandaranaike Kumaratunga  in her first address tothe nation on assuming office  stated:""We extend a hand of friendship to the people of thenorth-east and hope that their leaders would take it inthe same spirit that we have extended it.""The relaxation of the ban on certain essential itemsgoing to conflict areas and the reciprocal release ofpolicemen held by the secessionist movement are hopefulsigns of peace in our land. The all-island state ofemergency has been lifted and reintroduced only in theconflict areas. Our Government will pursue withdetermination its quest for peace in our land - a just andstable peace  acceptable to all our people - undeterred byany set-backs that might be encountered in pursuit of itsgoal.I seek the indulgence of this Assembly for havingdwelt on recent developments in my country at somelength. I did so because  at a time when in some parts ofthe world the ugly tide of intolerance is rising  we in SriLanka are proud that we have witnessed a vindication ofthe values of tolerance and principled conduct over theforces of narrow sectarianism and opportunism. Our recentexperience might fortify the efforts to banish prejudice andrancour among other peoples elsewhere.On the international scene  there have been shiningexamples of prolonged and bitter confrontation beingdispelled through dialogue and negotiation. Thus  wewelcome wholeheartedly the end of apartheid and theestablishment of a united  democratic and non-racial SouthAfrica under the inspired  and inspiring  leadership ofPresident Mandela.We also welcome the positive developments inPalestine subsequent to the recent agreements between thePalestine Liberation Organization and Israel  and betweenJordan and Israel  while expressing our concern over thoseissues that still remain unsettled.On the other hand  to our deep regret Bosnia andHerzegovina is still mired in bloodshed and violence andthe humanitarian crisis in Rwanda has not abated. Wereiterate our hope that the intense suffering anddislocation in those countries can be halted throughnegotiated settlement between the parties concerned andpolitically disinterested efforts by the internationalcommunity.Sri Lanka’s strong and positive identification withthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries began inBelgrade in 1961  when Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike wasPrime Minister. She was Head of Government when SriLanka hosted the historic summit of the non-alignedcountries in 1976. Our membership of this Movement then as now  derives from our deep conviction that itsprinciples empower the dispossessed of this world  givingthem dignity and hope for justice. The collapse of thebipolarism imposed on the post-Second-World-Warinternational scene is thus no reason for non-alignment tolie passive.At the Non-Aligned Ministerial Conference in Cairowe were proud to welcome South Africa as the onehundred and tenth member of the Movement. It issignificant that this great nation emerging from the long dark night of apartheid has chosen to adopt the principlesof non-alignment. Cynics have predicted that theMovement will sooner or later join the rubble of theBerlin Wall. In our view  the end of the cold war doesnot negate the rationale of non-alignment. On thecontrary  it vindicates the fundamental non-alignedprinciple that military confrontation can never promotesecurity  stability nor peace among nations. Principles areindestructible: people who believe in them areindomitable.There seemed a unique opportunity at the end of thecold war for the world to achieve its long pursuedobjective of general and complete disarmament undereffective verification  especially in the crucial area ofnuclear weapons. However  competing efforts by someto maintain a monopoly on nuclear weapons and byothers to break it frustrate our quest for nucleardisarmament.Sri Lanka is deeply conscious of the seriousresponsibility we undertake in presiding over the 1995 onthe Non-Proliferation Treaty Conference. It is imperativethat our advance towards a nuclear-weapon-free worldmake substantial progress. To that end  work in theConference on Disarmament towards a comprehensive24test-ban treaty is encouraging  though we must remainvigilant over any attempts to delay the conclusion of thetreaty. In other areas of disarmament  Sri Lanka recentlyratified the chemical weapons Convention  which we hopewill come into force next year.As we see the end of the nuclear arms race  we do notwant to have it replaced by regional arms races  whether toacquire nuclear-weapon capability or to achieve greatersophistication in conventional weapons. The UnitedNations arms Register is but a step on a long road towardstransparency and confidence building  eliminating the armsbazaar  with its links to terrorism  drug trafficking andmoney-laundering.Throughout the course of the Third United NationsConference on the Law of the Sea  which spanned adecade  Sri Lanka played a constructive and creative role.The pioneering role played by the late AmbassadorHamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  President ofthe Law of the Sea Conference and a former President ofthis Assembly  is part of the history of this uniqueendeavour.Sri Lanka has ratified the United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea  which has now entered into force and has signed the Agreement relating to implementation ofPart Xl of the Convention. This represents our continuingcommitment to the creation of a new legal regime of theoceans. Sri Lanka looks forward to participating in thehistoric inaugural session of the International Sea-BedAuthority in Jamaica.The Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  takinginto account emerging realities  has developed a fresh basisfor a pragmatic  forward-looking approach to peace security and stability in the Indian Ocean area. We callupon the countries concerned  particularly the permanentMembers of the Security Council and other major maritimeusers of the Indian Ocean  to enter into a serious andproductive dialogue for a new partnership in the context ofthe Committee.As the Law of the Sea Convention enters into force greater support needs to be extended to regional initiatives such as the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation(IOMAC)  promoting cooperation between the developedand developing countries.As the United Nations approaches its fiftiethanniversary  there is increasing  and more extensive  resortto multilateral action through the Organization. TheSecurity Council is finally playing the role - andsometimes goes beyond the role - originally envisaged forit under the Charter. Yet we must continue to reiteratethat foresight and careful assessment are vital in thepreparation for any Council intervention  and that suchaction should be pursued only with the consent andcooperation of the States concerned.Furthermore  it is important to emphasize that theSecurity Council acts on behalf of the generalmembership of the United Nations. Unless its actions arebased on the widest possible support  Council decisionswill not be universally respected nor be truly effective.In this context  Sri Lanka is of the view that Councilmembership should be increased to provide for widerrepresentation  including representation of developingcountries. Sri Lanka was honoured to co-chair theWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of theGeneral Assembly  including the strengthening of thenexus between the Assembly and the Security Council.We believe the approach we have taken to enhancetransparency and encourage democratic practices is onewhich is shared by the vast majority of developingcountries. We feel this process should be moved forward.It was in this context that in 1993 Sri Lankaannounced its candidature for the 1996-1997 non-permanent Asian seat in the Security Council  which bypractice of orderly rotation is due to the South Asiansub-region.Sri Lanka is particularly conscious of its identity asa small State  vulnerable to the ebb and flow ofinternational tides  both political and economic. Yet wehave not hesitated to take principled stands when wemust. Nor will we shirk our responsibility to act insolidarity with other developing countries. We share theirproblems and concerns.Sri Lanka is geopolitically and culturally an Asiancountry. We rejoice over the fact that our continent  aftercenturies of dependence  is once more resurgent politically stable and economically vibrant. This has beenachieved largely through self-reliance  indigenousentrepreneurship and the Asian value systems. As wemove at the global level to greater interdependence andinteraction  Sri Lanka will remain firmly focused on theAsian experience and its Asian context. We will spare noeffort to develop and strengthen our ties with our Asianneighbours. An express commitment to pursue theinterests we share with the family of Asian nations will25be a new  strong thrust in the foreign policy of ourGovernment.It is in that same spirit that we participated in thelaunching of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC). We are encouraged by the positivedevelopments in SAARC as it journeys into the twenty-firstcentury  propelled by two important trends in the region:democratization and the adoption of market-friendlyeconomic policies. Understanding among the peoples ofthe region is increasing. Contacts between professionalbodies in the region have rapidly gathered momentum.As a region severely affected by poverty  we in SouthAsia have already taken steps to share our experiences andwork out common approaches including the SAARCcommitment to eradicate poverty by the year 2002.Absolute poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy stalkone fifth of the world’s population. We trust that the 1995World Social Summit and the Agenda for Development willeffectively address these issues and mobilize essentialresources to back commitments to eradicate poverty provide employment and promote social cohesion before theend of this century.Our development experience has taught us theimportance of alleviating the poverty of the poorest and ofmaintaining social equity with economic growth. SriLanka’s favourable social indicators are the result of aconsistent bipartisan commitment over the years to themaintenance of a high level of social expenditure. Anumber of income-transfer measures are in place. Theseare indispensable to protection of the vulnerable segmentsof the population during a period of structural adjustmentaimed at accelerating economic growth.My Prime Minister has made a clear statement oneconomic policy  in which he indicates the Government’sfirm resolve to build a strong national economy within amarket framework  with the principal engine of growthexpected to be the private sector  both domestic andforeign.We are particularly mindful of the need to payattention to our youth. In 1995  when we shall celebratethe tenth anniversary of the International Youth Year  itwould be timely to focus on the achievements of the decadeand on further imperatives to advance the prospects foryouth. The former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka took theinitiative  at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus  to focusspecial attention on youth issues. Subsequently  the non-aligned countries  at the ministerial meeting held in Cairo supported the proposal to convene  at the highest politicallevel  a special plenary meeting of this Assembly devotedto youth affairs  as part of the fiftieth anniversarycelebrations.I must also stress my Government’s commitment tothe provision of a transparent system for the promotionand protection of human rights in the context of a trulyvital democracy. During our recent election campaign wepromised our people that we would  as a matter of thehighest priority  take steps to establish where necessary and strengthen where possible  a legislative framework topromote and protect the full enjoyment of human rights.Within five weeks of assuming office we have prepared for submission to Parliament  legislation to give effect tothe Convention against torture. Before the end of thisyear  legislation will be introduced for the establishmentof a national human rights commission. This commissionwill have judicial and investigative powers and will betotally independent of the executive.In addition  I have appointed  from among personsactive in work for human rights through independent non-governmental organizations  six outstanding nationalexperts with international credentials to assist me withtheir knowledge and views. They serve in an individualcapacity and on an honorary basis. Their appointment inno way precludes them from continuing to engage in theirpublic campaigning for human rights  including commenton or criticism of governmental performance in this area.Their appointment is further evidence of myGovernment’s firm commitment to the conduct of openand transparent government.At the international level  we are of the view thathuman rights should not become an arena for North-Southconfrontation and that no country should be singled outfor hostile attention on grounds other than genuineconcern for the human rights of its citizens. The scrutinyof a country’s human-rights record must be guided byprinciples of impartiality and objectivity. Such scrutinymust be motivated by a spirit of genuine concern dialogue and cooperation. In this connection  we wish tofelicitate the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  Ambassador Ayala Lasso  on his effortsto foster a cooperative  rather than a coercive  frameworkfor the promotion of human rights world wide.Sri Lanka is disappointed that  on the internationaleconomic scene  developing countries continue to sufferfrom inadequate access to trade and technology  from low26commodity prices and from excessive debt burdens.Financial flows for development have severely contracted.The economic disparities between the developed and thedeveloping worlds continue to widen.The Charter of the United Nations rests on two mainpillars: the maintenance of international peace and security and international cooperation for socio-economicdevelopment. The United Nations must therefore at alltimes proceed with equal commitment on both thesefronts - politico-security and socio-economic development.Nor must it be forgotten that economic inequalities andunderdevelopment are at the root of phenomena such asmassive refugee flows and even ethnic and other conflicts.We reiterate the non-aligned countries’ call forrenewal of the North-South dialogue on the basis of mutualinterests and interdependence. In this era of globaltransition  the need for a favourable internationalenvironment is imperative. Many developing countries areembarking upon structural-adjustment programmes  atconsiderable cost  yet these policies will be successful onlyto the extent that there is a genuine commitment to free-trade policies at the international level without extraneousconditionalities.Today - 26 September - Sri Lanka commemorates thethirty-fifth anniversary of the death of Mr. S. W. R. D.Bandaranaike  former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. He wassucceeded by Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike  the world’sfirst woman Prime Minister. Now - thirty-eight years later- their daughter  Ms. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has become Prime Minister. What is remarkable is thateach of them was elected to office by the free vote of thepeople in keenly fought elections. Each of them succeeded by wholly democratic means  in unseating a strongGovernment. In 1956  in this Hall  Prime Minister S. W.R. D. Bandaranaike referred to the unconquered unconquerable human spirit as the ""one golden thread""passing through the ""dark fabric of human history"". Hesaid:""I look upon the United Nations as the onemachine available to mankind today throughwhich it can express this unconquerable spirit ofman in its efforts to achieve ... peace  friendshipand collaboration"". (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Eleventh Session  590thmeeting  p. 235  para. 41)That remains our view of the United Nations today.We collectively articulate a global social contractbetween the Governments and the peoples of this worldwhom we represent. The success of a global socialcontract rests on how individual States keep the people’sfaith through good governance  the maintenance of humanrights  equity and justice  and the provision ofopportunities to enhance the quality of life. In SriLanka’s national context this involves political pluralismand makes of politics the discharge of a public trustwhere decision-making is open  transparent and based onthe widest possible extent of acceptance. Everyone inpublic life is accountable for his or her actions. MyPrime Minister expressed it in these words:""This is a beautiful but difficult dream  which weshall strive to realize.""It is this vision that must concomitantly inspire theconduct of relations between States. Only then will theUnited Nations truly be ""a centre for harmonizing theactions of nations""."
"101",4208,"LSO",49,1994,"On behalf of the peopleand Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho  and on myown behalf  I have the pleasure to extend to you  Sir  our4warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-ninthsession. Your election is a fitting tribute to the efforts thatyour country has made and continues to make ininternational relations  especially its mediatory role inconflict situations on our continent. Our special thanks alsogo to your predecessor  the Ambassador of the Republic ofGuyana  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally  whoseabilities and clear vision in steering the Assembly duringthe forty-eighth session will forever be remembered withappreciation.We are also indebted to our distinguishedSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose track record is without parallel.My delegation is proud to welcome the Republic ofSouth Africa  now free and democratic  back into theinternational fold. The resumption of the right of SouthAfrica  a founding Member of the United Nations  toparticipate in the deliberations of the General Assembly andother organs of the United Nations  is very timely  comingas it does as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations.Even as we approach the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury  our world is still mired in conflicts. OurOrganization must strive to contain these and othersituations  which are the legacy of the post-cold-war era.We are entering a new era  one in which democratic andinclusive global institutions can play a principal role inbuilding a better world. It is still difficult  however  tohave a clear vision of the future role of the United Nationsin the new international political order that is emergingfollowing the end of the cold war.As it approaches its fiftieth anniversary  the UnitedNations faces a number of challenges; it has to become areal instrument of international legality  peace and security.The Organization needs to have the means and theflexibility to play an increasingly active role in theseunpredictable times. Unfortunately  however  the UnitedNations of today still reflects the structure of the world of1945 as seen by the victors of the Second World War.United Nations organs such as the Security Council need tobe revitalized and democratized so that they may becomemore representative of the regions encompassed in thisOrganization.The General Assembly  as one of the principal organsof the United Nations  an organ that is universal incharacter and one in which Member States enjoy sovereignequality  needs revitalization as part of the current processof the transformation and reform of the United Nationssystem. The United Nations system should be able  at alltimes  to respond rapidly to changes and newdevelopments as they occur around the world. In the lastfew years we have witnessed significant events of historicmoment. We had not anticipated that the Iron Curtainwould be dismantled so quickly; nor could we haveforeseen the demolition of the Berlin Wall and theeradication of apartheid in South Africa. The UnitedNations may not possess the clairvoyance to predictevents before they occur  but it should have the capacityto respond to developments and crises rapidly andeffectively as they arise. The events in Bosnia andHerzegovina and  recently  in Rwanda starkly demonstratethe sluggishness of the decision-making process and thelack of responsiveness on the part of the system.Disarmament  especially in the nuclear field  remainsan urgent concern of this Organization. Its relationship tointernational peace and security is today more evidentthan ever before. We are mindful of the fact that inrecent years  at the height of the cold war  the worldexperienced a period of uncertain peace  a peace that wassustained more by the fear of a nuclear holocaust than bythe existence of harmonious relationships among nations especially the opposing nuclear blocs  or by progresstowards complete and general disarmament. Today conditions exist for the establishment of a stable andpeaceful global environment. It is under such conditionsthat the world can begin to enjoy what may be called thepeace dividend  whereby global expenditures will beshifted away from preparations for war and unendingconcern for national security towards investment indevelopment.Solid groundwork for cooperation andconfidence-building has been successfully laid in anumber of regions. The progress in this regard bodeswell for the future. In our region  the continentalorganization  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has established a mechanism for the prevention management and resolution of conflicts. The apparentinability of the world community to act in a timely anddecisive manner during some tragic conflict situations inour continent has taught Africa the cardinal lesson that wecannot continue to delegate our responsibilities to the restof the world. We have seen evidence of this a number oftimes  particularly during crisis situations in Rwanda andSomalia. Africa is taking up more seriously the challengeof fending for itself. We shall  however  continue to5count on international solidarity and cooperation during thetrial stages of the mechanism.In Liberia  the OAU  in conjunction with theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)and the United Nations  continues to seek a solution to theconflict on the basis of the implementation of the CotonouPeace Agreement. We are happy with the progressachieved thus far in Mozambique. The situation in Angola however  continues to be of grave concern to us.We urge the parties involved to show political will andto negotiate in good faith in order to ensure the earlyestablishment of lasting peace  stability and development.The complementarity between democracy and theobservance of human rights on the one hand  anddevelopment on the other  can no longer be a subject ofdebate. Democracy is the cornerstone of every civil societyand the preservation and sustaining of its institutions shouldbe binding on all of us. The expression by the internationalcommunity of the will to cooperate in this endeavour hasbeen clear in recent times. If it is necessary to lookbackward to yesterday  it is only to draw lessons that willenable us to march confidently and resolutely into thefuture  a future in which our citizens will live in harmonyand enjoy prosperity.The attainment of democracy  peace and developmentas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in thecharters of the Organization of African Unity and otherorganizations has become the responsibility of all nations.Where these principles are threatened by those who arereluctant to come to terms with the realities of today  theinternational community has stood up resolutely in defenceof our fledgling democracies. This attitude augurs well forthe new world order we seek to establish.The events in Haiti and our recent experience inLesotho demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt thatyoung and fledgling democracies can be seriouslythreatened or turned off their course. In the early morningof 17 August this year  the people of Lesotho woke up tohear an announcement over Radio Lesotho that shocked andbewildered them. According to that announcement  certainclauses of the Constitution of Lesotho had been suspended and as a result of that illegal and arbitrary act thedemocratically-elected parliament and Government ofLesotho had  it was said  been dissolved. The constitutionalcrisis we faced has since been resolved; however  I recallthese events because of the important lesson they broughthome to all of us who were directly concerned.First  it became abundantly clear that the support fordemocracy among our people cuts straight across partypolitical lines. Secondly  the international community canno longer countenance an open attack upon democraticprinciples and the institutions of democratic governance.The people of Lesotho rose up in large numbers todemonstrate their displeasure and their abhorrence of thedisguised coup against their elected Government. Despitethe repressive measures taken by those who had brazenlyintruded upon the constitutional order of our country  thepeople sent a clear signal that the powers of a tyrant areforever circumscribed by the will and the determinationof the people to resist oppression and by their desire to begoverned only with their own consent.I take this opportunity to thank the United Nations the Organization of African Unity and the commonwealthof nations for supporting my Government and my peoplein their struggle to maintain legality  constitutionality anddemocratic rule in Lesotho. I need to mentionspecifically the timely and principled intervention byPresident Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe  President NelsonMandela of South Africa and President Ketumile Masireof Botswana. It is through their mediatory efforts that wewere able to emerge from the unfortunate constitutionalcrisis that we experienced.The people of Lesotho will always remember thatwhen they faced a critical test  when the foundations oftheir young democracy were under attack and threatenedwith wanton destruction  the friends of democracy stoodfirm and remained resolute to the end. The memberStates of the European Union and the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) never wavered in theirsupport for democracy in Lesotho. The Governments ofthe United States  the United Kingdom  Canada  Japan the Federal Republic of Germany and Sweden took astand and immediately suspended all economic assistanceto Lesotho  thus sending a clear signal to the usurpers ofpower that what is really here to stay is democracy  andnothing else.We in Lesotho believe that the observance of humanrights would go a long way towards eliminating hotbedsof tension and civil strife. In almost every countryexperiencing some kind of civil strife  it will always befound that the first casualty of that strife is human rights.It is in this context that  recently  Lesotho ratifiedquite a number of international human rights instruments.At the regional level  we all support the work of SADC which has recently decided to establish a sector to deal6with human rights questions. We pledge to work with ourfellow SADC member States as we develop this new sectorof our organization. We also pledge to fulfil ourobligations at the international level through the variousUnited Nations bodies engaged in human rights work."
"102",4234,"LTU",49,1994,"I sincerely thank you Sir  for the honour and opportunity of addressing thisforum  and I extend my congratulations to you upon yourelection to lead the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.In this Hall  we see representatives of the entire world a world in which there has been unprecedented globalchange. Our planet is growing more unified in all areas oflife; economic and political integration is well under way.Nations  States and entire continents are drawing closertogether. It is unfortunate that not all changes lead toprogress. A new avalanche of problems confronts theUnited Nations and other international organizations affecting rich and poor countries alike.I fully concur with Secretary-General BoutrosBoutros-Ghali in his belief that today as never before ourinternational community needs a new and forward-lookingvision of our future. The time has long been ripe for usto discuss within the United Nations agenda the creationof a new and universal concept of development thatwould embrace peace  economic development  a cleanenvironment  social justice and democratic governance asthe five spokes supporting the wheel of humanity’sprogress. It is clear  I believe  that our generation musttake up the task of rediscovering the world and buildingwithin it new  mutually supportive relationships. One ofthe fundamental instruments at our disposal in this globaltask is the United Nations.On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of theestablishment of the United Nations  it is appropriate torecall the circumstances of its creation. It is importantthat we examine the strengths and weaknesses of theUnited Nations predecessor  the League of Nations. Wemust learn from this analysis so as to ensure that theUnited Nations shall not become a mere bystander toworld events. It is true  of course  that the globalsituation today is fundamentally different from that whichexisted at the outbreak of the Second World War. We nolonger suffer from the presence of dictatorial bandit Statesled by fanatics. But potential dangers exist today; theyare multifaceted and have spread throughout the world.Together we must overcome racism  hatred offoreigners  fanatical nationalism and intolerance. If we donot  these demons  once having manifested themselves inmen  communities or entire nations  could destroy the entireworld.Today I would like to take note of a historic day forLithuania  the Baltic States and all of Europe. It is all themore significant in that the General Assembly will discussat this forty-ninth session  the complete withdrawal offoreign military forces from the territories of the BalticStates  as called for by a General Assembly resolutionadopted at the forty-eighth session. On 31 August 1993 thewithdrawal of the Russian military from Lithuania wascompleted  and exactly one year later the same historicevent took place in Estonia and Latvia. That date alsocoincided with the withdrawal of Russian troops fromGermany. This harmony of dates is more than merelysymbolic: it marks the resolution of one more consequenceof the Second World War.Guided by the principles of the United NationsCharter  Lithuania continues to broaden its internationalrelations in a consistent manner. The goals and prioritiesof our economic  social and foreign policies remainunchanged.Lithuania seeks to secure democratic government andthe principles of a free market  and at the same time toensure the well-being of its people and the protection ofminority rights. Lithuania is confronted with seriousproblems of a social character common to all youngdemocracies.Yet at the same time  we must also recognize what hasalready been accomplished. Lithuania has a stablecurrency. Inflation is under control. The private sectoralready employs the majority of the work force. A vibrantand innovative market continues to grow. After four yearsof dramatic decline  the standard of living has beenstabilized  although it is still rather low. An attractive legalenvironment has been ensured for foreign investment.We attach great value to the bilateral and multilateralassistance to the process of democracy-building and free-market reforms. Western interest in and attention to therestored democracies of Central Europe is vital not only forus  the recipients of such assistance  but for the future of aunified Europe. Today the future of the West can nolonger be considered in isolation from developments in theEast.We benefit from successful cooperation with Estoniaand Latvia  our closest neighbours  with whom we sharea common history and common fate. This year apermanent body  the Baltic Council of Ministers  wasestablished. But as we look to the future  this will not beenough. If the Baltic countries are to become integratedmembers of Europe  then the establishment of a commonvisa and economic space can only be the first step ofmany. It is imperative that our foreign and defencepolicies be even more closely coordinated and that weharmonize our legislation in accordance with the norms ofthe European Union.I believe that all the countries of our region facenew opportunities with the establishment of anothercooperative body approximately one year ago: theCouncil of Baltic Sea States. This region has greatpotential. It is home to countries large and small economically strong and less developed  that not so longago were separated by the front lines of the cold war.The Baltic Sea States are unified by many commongoals as well as problems. Sadly  in recent days we havealso shared a common tragedy. I wish to express mydeepest condolences to the Governments of ourneighbouring countries and to the people whose lovedones perished in the catastrophe that befell the ferry M.S.Estonia.As I speak of our neighbours  I must also point toour relations with Belarus. We are heartened by the newpossibilities of concluding a treaty on inter-State relationsbetween our two countries. The signing of such a treatywill further secure the principle so valued by our nations:good-neighbourly relations.Lithuania attaches particular importance to itsrelations with Russia. As neighbours  we are veryinterested - perhaps even more so than other countries -in the success of the democratic and free-market reformsin that country.Russian relations with Lithuania and the other BalticStates today are a reflection of the current Russianposition concerning the evolving European order  one inwhich old divisions are disappearing. We would like tohope that the new Russia will adhere to the principles ofinternational law and will not obstruct the integration ofthe Baltic countries into European political  economic andsecurity structures. This would be a clear signal that thedemocratic reforms undertaken in Russia are irreversibleand that new lines of division will not be drawn in2Europe. It would reaffirm that Russia does not seek toisolate itself from the West and that  on the contrary  ittrusts the West and seeks cooperation with it on an equalbasis.Given Lithuania’s geopolitical situation and oureconomic opportunities  we can and are prepared to be abridge between East and West. But I also want toemphasize that a future as a buffer State is completelyunacceptable to us.Several days ago  in his address to the Assembly Russian President Yeltsin stated that it was essential toreject the imposition of one’s will on weaker States and tobuild a new order  founded on law and morality. I expressmy hope that democratic Russia will adhere to theseresponsibilities and thus justify the growing trust of theinternational community in its future.One year ago I said from this podium that Lithuaniawould welcome steps toward the gradual demilitarization ofthe Kaliningrad district. Today I can state with satisfactionthat Russia is reducing its military presence in that area.Lithuania  whose territory is traversed by transit to thisRussian enclave  is not indifferent to the future of theKaliningrad district and the Lithuanian minority residingthere. Occupying a unique place on the map of Europe  thisRussian territory demands special attention. It couldbecome a stone in the foundation of security and anattractive economic partner or  under less favourableconditions  a source or even exporter of military threat andunrest. Lithuania proposes to examine issues pertaining tothe Kaliningrad district as part of the round-tablemechanism established by the European Stability Pact. Wehope that all interested parties will give their support to thisinitiative.In concluding a fundamental bilateral Treaty withPoland this year  we have closed a chapter of our commonhistory. From the start of the 1930s and the outbreak ofconflict over Lithuania’s capital of Vilnius  relationsbetween us were tainted by open confrontation  a state ofaffairs still remembered in the halls of the Palais desNations in Geneva. I believe that this Treaty  whichrecognizes and confirms the present borders of ourcountries  can be considered the final rapprochement forLithuania and Poland. As we greet the future  Lithuaniansand Poles will be able to make their rightful contribution toa unifying Europe.We also strive to establish closer ties with othercountries of Central Europe. We share not only a similarhistory  but also current problems and future goals. I amconvinced that the convening of a meeting of the leadersof all Central European States in the very near futurewould benefit our countries. Such a conference wouldallow us to discuss our common reform experiences andour strategies for drawing closer to the European Union.Participation in multilateral and international forumsprovides new opportunities for Lithuania. An ever-increasing number of important political decisions aretoday being reached in international organizations. Thisis especially beneficial for small and medium-sized States.Lithuania sees the guarantee of its security  stabilityand well-being in joining European political  economicand security structures. Lithuania has always been anintegral part of European civilization and culture. Wehave never lost our European heritage. Our recent 50yearseparation from the world did not sever our roots. Ourgoal remains membership in the European Union. Wehave already concluded a free-trade agreement with theUnion that should come into affect next year. We alsoexpect soon to sign an agreement on associatemembership with the Union.Integration into the European Union cannot beconsidered in isolation from the broadening ofqualitatively new ties with the Western European Union.Lithuania is an associate partner of this defenceorganization of ever-increasing importance. We believethe strengthening of the role of the Western EuropeanUnion to be both logical and necessary.I am also convinced that the security and stability ofmy country and the region demand closer cooperationwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Lithuania has presented its formal request for membershipin that organization and will continue resolutely to seekthe fulfilment of this goal. Lithuania’s participation in thePartnership for Peace programme opens new avenues forLithuanian cooperation in efforts with Europe  the UnitedStates and Canada in their endeavours to prevent conflictand maintain peace. We firmly hope that our activeparticipation and that of other Central European States inthe Partnership programme will have a positive impact onthe broadening of NATO.The expansion of NATO eastward would not pose adanger or threaten any European State. Russian fears ofisolation  I believe  are groundless. We welcome Russia’sjoining in the Partnership for Peace and hope that its3participation in the programme will contribute to thestrengthening of mutual trust and stability.I should like to take note of several concerns of amore global character  the burden and urgency of which areparticularly felt by the countries in transition. Ourwell-founded fears are heightened by the continuouslygrowing gap between the developed and developingcountries. Can we truly speak of a stable Europe when thehourly wages of a laborer in the European Union are equalto one day’s pay in Central Europe and  in some countriesof Eastern Europe  to a month’s income? If thisunfortunate tendency is allowed to continue  a wave ofdespondency and instability may overflow all barriers.The young democracies of Central and Eastern Europeare confronted by dangers posed by organized crime  illegalmigration and trafficking in narcotics and  most horribly  innuclear materials. These are the unfortunate negativeconsequences of our rejoining the world; without thenecessary experience  they are difficult to address. Werequire coordinated and concrete assistance.We live not only in a time of great changes  but alsoin a world of great contrasts. As we celebrate the historictransformation of Europe  the stunning successes in theMiddle East peace process and the end of apartheid inSouth Africa  we are nevertheless witnessing continuingtragedies and conflicts all over the world.The efforts of the international community  expressedthrough the United Nations  do not always achieve theirdesired results. The main reason for this is the inability toenact decisive measures. This is particularly evident whenlarge countries are for any reason drawn into local conflicts leading to a clash of their global interests. In such cases the timely removal of built-up tensions becomes difficult.If we fail to avoid conflict  its containment and reductionbecome painful and long-term  often leading to the death ofBlue Helmets in the execution of their peace mission. It istherefore crucial that we join forces to improve the conflictprevention mechanism. In this regard  we support theinitiative of Germany and the Netherlands to improvecooperative relations between the United Nations and theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).Every State must contribute in a tangible way towardsthe creation of a peaceful and stable world. This must bethe responsibility of everyone. It would be inappropriatefor any country to seek to achieve its own interests orexpand its sphere of influence under the guise ofpeace-keeping missions. There are criteria which must befollowed in this regard - namely  the principles of theUnited Nations and the CSCE. These principles must  inmy opinion  apply to all countries  including the RussianFederation. We cannot agree to allowing countries tocarry out peace-keeping missions in any givengeographical space without the consent of the parties tothe conflict or the proper international mandate. I wouldlike to emphasize my conviction that the principles ofinternational law must be adhered to by all States  smalland large.With the end of the cold war and the spread ofdemocracy  old global divisions begin to disappear. It isvital that this continue. Those who believe that a newdelineation of spheres of interest can bring stability to theworld are mistaken. We who have felt the consequencesof such divisions of influence can testify that this wouldonly bring about new conflicts and upheaval.The United Nations has a particular significance forsmall and medium-sized States - in other words  themajority of countries. These States suffer first wheninstability and mutual distrust take root in the world. Inan anarchic world  guided only by an ad hoc order  smallStates are the first to fall victim to larger interests. SmallStates experience with considerable pain the negativeside-effects of global changes; they are the true front-lineStates. We have only to look at the front pages of theworld’s newspapers. Bosnia  Rwanda  Tajikistan - all ofthese are small States struggling with tragic historicallegacies.At the same time  if there exist guarantees for theirsecurity  small States develop rapidly and bring their owncontributions to the international community. I firmlyadhere to my remarks  made a year ago in this Hall  that""the future of a more integrated world lies indemocracy and the individuality of free nations.""(Official Records of the General Assembly  Forty-eighth Session  Plenary Meetings  7th meeting p. 14)This individuality and diversity do not have to divide us.Quite the opposite - they will enrich us.Lithuania became a Member of the United Nationsthree years ago. Until now  Lithuania was perhaps apassive recipient of the assistance and security thismembership provided. Today Lithuania seeks tocontribute actively to the undertakings of the international4community to strengthen security and stability throughoutthe world.Together with Estonia and Latvia  Lithuania is in theprocess of establishing a Baltic peace-keeping battalionwhich will be fully operational in the very near future.With the consent of the Lithuanian Parliament  a group ofLithuanian peace-keepers  serving within a larger Danishbattalion  is today a part of the United Nations ProtectionForce stationed in Croatia. I take this opportunity to thankDenmark and the other countries that provide continuousassistance in the creation of Lithuanian and Balticpeace-keeping units. In the future  within its financialcapabilities  Lithuania will continue to participate in similarUnited Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian missions.With the expansion of United Nations membership  therange of issues we are asked to discuss within the UnitedNations has also increased  imposing new responsibilitiesand new demands on the Organization. It is very importantthat the international community be properly represented inthe Security Council. Lithuania therefore supportsproposals to expand the membership of the Council creating new permanent as well as non-permanent seats.One of the principle guarantees of internationalstability is respect for fundamental human rights andfreedoms and their development and defence. It was  ofcourse  within the framework of the United Nations that thefirst landmark international human rights documents wereadopted.We believe the establishment of the office of HighCommissioner for Human Rights to be a timely decision.The High Commissioner must become the overallcoordinator of United Nations activities in the field ofhuman rights. The world clearly needs an institution thatcan rapidly and effectively report human rights violations particularly those which pose a danger of escalating intoprolonged conflict. Such reporting would enhance thepolicy of preventive diplomacy.Lithuania continues along the difficult road of reform maintaining a relatively high human development index  asreflected in the United Nations Development Programme’s1994 report on human development  where it is in twenty-eighth place. We are well aware of the particularcircumstances of this high ranking and of the fact that it iscalculated with the use of rather distorted gross nationalproduct statistics. Unfortunately  the use of these distortedfigures has led to excessive contributions to the UnitedNations and to a reduction in assistance provided.At the same time  Lithuania  like other CentralEuropean countries  has despite the odds achieved a highlevel of development in education  science and culture.This  too  is reflected in the human development index.This state of affairs has two aspects. As Lithuania cannoteffectively finance these areas from its own resources  anoverall decline is unavoidable. Another possibilityremains: with the help of the United Nations and otherorganizations  the decline may be halted in the fields ofeducation  science and culture. If the existing foundationis protected  recovery in the economic and social fieldswill follow more rapidly. Adopting this second solutionwould be less costly and more effective than allowing acollapse of the system.Lithuania  like other formerly central-commandeconomies  has inherited environmentally damagingtechnologies. While we have witnessed political andeconomic change  the restoration of a balancedenvironment in our countries will take many years andrequire financial resources.As the possessor of a powerful nuclear energyfacility  Lithuania is particularly concerned about nuclearsafety. Here  I wish to express our particular gratitude toSweden and other Western European partners forassistance they provide to increase the safety of ournuclear energy programme.Lithuania welcomes the increased attention thatinternational environmental organizations are giving to theconcerns of our region. I believe that combined effortsare capable of producing results much sooner than wefirst imagined. But  for this to occur  we must be assuredthat assistance provided by the United Nations will not bereduced. Of particular relevance to my country is thetransfer of environmentally sound technology andknow-how. An ecologically aware civilization mustbecome the goal of our era.If the international community does not provide thenecessary assistance and cooperation the situation in ourregion could change for the worse. The countries ofCentral and Eastern Europe receive a small portion of thetechnical assistance provided by the United Nations  butit is employed in our region effectively and with visibleresults.Here I should like to welcome the reforms initiatedby the Secretary-General. We now see the first results ofthe restructuring  and we are satisfied with the progress.We are particularly encouraged by steps taken to increase5managerial and policy-making accountability within theSecretariat  as well as the simplification and streamlining ofthe decision-making machinery. Lithuania supports andpledges its full cooperation with the new Office of InternalOversight.I would also draw attention to the fact that the UnitedNations Charter still contains certain outdated conceptsconcerning enemy States. These are a relic of the SecondWorld War. Therefore  I believe Articles 53 and 107 of theCharter ought to be amended.One of this year’s most important international eventswas the International Conference on Population andDevelopment held recently in Cairo. Next year the UnitedNations will continue the tradition of transcontinentalforums. The world social Summit in Copenhagen willafford us an opportunity to put people’s concerns at thecentre of social policy. This is of particular relevance tocountries whose economies are in transition  where peoplecarry the burden of rapid economic  social and politicalchange.The World Conference on Women  to be held inBeijing  will address the key question of how  in times ofawesome change  men and women can work together for apeaceful world in which equality and harmony will be thenorm and reality of life.At the beginning of my address I spoke of the wheelof human development being supported by five basicprinciples. Today we clearly face a time for decisions.Either that wheel will turn  slowly but surely  through thejoint efforts of us all  taking us towards ever higher plainsof progress  or it will stop turning  and if it stops it willinevitably begin to roll backwards - to chaos and barbarity.As humanity crosses into a new millennium  we mustnot allow the wheel to stop turning. This demands thecollective action of all States and peoples. That is why wemust always remind ourselves that no organization in theworld today can equal the authority  longevity  dynamismand vitality of the United Nations.That which divided nations  States or continentscannot achieve alone they can and will achieve together asthe United Nations. I am convinced of this  as there is noalternative."
"103",4278,"LUX",49,1994,"Allow me to express my deep pleasure at Mr. AmaraEssy’s election to preside over the General Assembly thisyear. This is a well-deserved tribute to your country  Côted’Ivoire  which is held in high esteem by the internationalcommunity.My distinguished German colleague  Mr. KlausKinkel  speaking on behalf of the European Union indicated the role it intends to play in international relationsand described its positions on the major political questions.These positions are fully shared by my country.Consequently I will limit my remarks to certain pointspertaining to the functioning of our Organization.Over the past few years  we have lived through theend of the cold war and far-reaching upheavals in theinternational arena. These changes have had important andlasting effects on many people  on the populations of manyStates that lived under authoritarian forms of governmentand have now conquered the freedom to exercise theirfundamental rights; on peoples freed of the constraintsimposed upon them by the competition between the twosuper-Powers  which enabled dictatorial and repressiveregimes to act with full impunity; and  finally  on theinternational community as a whole  which is no longerforced to live with the fear of nuclear conflagrationthroughout the planet.Democracy has made a historic breakthrough. It willbe restored in Haiti. In the Middle East the peace processis making progress. In South Africa apartheid has beendefinitively abolished  and this shining victory is shared byour Organizat ion  which fought apartheiduncompromisingly. Let us give careful thought to theformidable lesson of political courage  tolerance andreconciliation given us by Presidents Mandela and de Klerk.These advances are offset  however  by theemergence throughout the world of areas of tensionwhich  no longer masked by a bipolar structure  are nowgrowing in intensity. For three years now war has beenraging in the former Yugoslavia  with an increasing tollof death  suffering and destruction. In Rwanda  wewitnessed the unleashing of barbarism  which in a fewmonths killed hundreds of thousands of civilians andprovoked a refugee problem of exceptional dimensions.Similarly  elsewhere - in Africa  the Caucasus  CentralAsia - other regions are faced with new types of conflict resulting from the break-up of States and the resurgenceof nationalist  ethnic and religious passions.Never before has the United Nations found itself somuch at the centre of world politics. The United Nationstoday finds itself forced to face entirely new challenges to deal with an ever-growing number of demands andmissions that are increasingly complex. I hail thededication of our Secretary-General  who has persistentlydevoted his energies to the difficult mission of adaptingthe Organization to a new international environment  andof strengthening it to enable it to fulfil its new tasks. Iwish to pay tribute to the United Nations peace-keepingforces which have intervened in recent times in animpressive number of conflicts. They have contributed at times in a decisive manner  to protecting civilianpopulations  to preventing the spread of conflict and tofacilitating the process of transition to democracy. Asignificant number of them have given their lives in whatare often highly dangerous operations.The growth of peace-keeping operations has beenexponential. In the past five years  the Organization haslaunched more peace-keeping operations than during theprevious 40. Moreover  the Organization is nowembarked upon activities which far surpass the traditionalpeace-keeping concepts to which we had grownaccustomed. Indeed  most of the recent conflicts haveemerged not between States but within States; the Charterhardly contemplates such situations. We shall thereforehave to give thought to the conditions under which theUnited Nations should act in such cases  and askourselves whether it has the necessary resources andinstruments to fulfil its new missions.""An Agenda for Peace"" provides a framework forthe future evolution of our Organization in this field ofpeace-keeping. A number of the ideas put forward by theSecretary-General have been constructively put to use bythe Security Council and by the General Assembly. Butrecent experience has shown us  at times pointedly  that24there are often serious shortcomings to the way in whichthe United Nations conducts these military operations.Major operations can no longer be decided uponspontaneously; in the area of peace-keeping  the UnitedNations needs to strengthen its organizational  managementand planning capacities. It must be able to rely on apermanent high command structure capable ofsimultaneously conducting several multi-dimensional large-scale operations and which has adequate means forinformation processing and coordination.Effective crisis management implies the capacity toreact quickly  which is why it would be desirable toenhance the United Nations capacity to rapidly carry thenecessary personnel and equipment to the theatre ofoperations. In the recent past there have been too manyinstances in which the Secretary-General has been forced todelay operations approved by the Security Council owingto a lack of personnel or equipment. This implies that we the Member States  should contribute the necessary peace-keeping troops for future missions and that we should be ina position to put them rapidly at the disposal of the UnitedNations. These contributions should not be limited tomilitary personnel  but should also include civilians  frompolice to election observers. Indeed  peace-keeping requiresmany skills  including that of being able to intervenebetween opposing parties  of being sensitive to culturalparticularities  and of being able to act as a mediator. Thepersonnel who are called upon to intervene in thesecomplex  difficult and dangerous situations should thereforebe properly prepared and trained. Uniform training andjoint exercises constitute the key to the effective integrationof different national contingents in a multinationaloperation.Finally  there is a need for a substantial strengtheningof the safety provisions for the Blue Helmets.Driven to the limits of its financial and organizationalcapacities  the United Nations will increasingly need tocount on regional organizations and structures in order tocarry out these peace-keeping operations. Cooperationbetween the United Nations and such organizations isprovided for by the Charter  and it has been developed  forexample  in the former Yugoslavia  in Somalia and in theCaucasus. It should be further strengthened.Only the United Nations has the internationallegitimacy to decide to use force or to impose peaceenforcement measures. But in the sphere of peace-keepingand preventive diplomacy  the activities of regionalorganizations would have the advantage of relieving theUnited Nations of part of its work. Often having a betterunderstanding of the conflicts in their areas  suchorganizations could act with greater effectiveness.With respect to the European continent  the UnitedNations should intensify its cooperation with theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE)  the Council of Europe and the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO)  taking into account thecompetence of each of those organizations.Does international law authorize the United Nationsto intervene within a country? Does not the Charterassert the principle of non-intervention in the internalaffairs of a State?I welcome the fact that for some time now theinternational community has been treating that principlein a more flexible way. That principle should no longerserve as a shield for flagrant and massive violations ofhuman rights. That is what occurred in 1991 in Iraq when the international community came to the aid of theKurds  harshly repressed by Saddam Hussein  or  again in1992 in Somalia  when the task was to protect the supplyof humanitarian aid to a population threatened by famine.On each occasion  the international communitycourageously assumed its duty to assist  though it is truethat in Somalia a political solution remains to be found.Did the international community show similardetermination when  last spring  a virtual genocide wasperpetrated in Rwanda  especially when the Tutsicommunity became the target of a deliberate act ofextermination undertaken by officials of the Hutucommunity?The United Nations  after hesitating for a moment decided to reconstitute the United Nations AssistanceMission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in order to provideprotection to the population that was threatened. But theSecretary-General’s appeal was not heeded. The actionfinally taken by France and the Africans - and for this Ipay a tribute to them - succeeded at least in putting thebrakes on this infernal machine. I hope in any case thatan international tribunal will be created without delay tobring to trial those responsible for this crime againsthumanity.In this era of interdependence  efforts with a view tocollective maintenance of peace and security cannot bereduced to peace-keeping operations alone  but mustnecessarily take into account economic and social factors.25Famine  underdevelopment  the flow of refugees  over-population  environmental deterioration  drug abuse and finally  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction areall serious threats to our global balance and  hence  toworld peace.In the economic sphere  too  our security depends onthat of others. In all sectors that give rise to concern whether we are dealing with military  trade  environmentalor health problems  no nation can isolate itself from others.We are all affected by what happens beyond our borders just as our own actions within our borders inevitably haverepercussions on the community of nations as a whole.Our security is increasingly indivisible. We cannotdisregard the links that exist between development economic growth  protection of the environment andpopulation movements. If the situation deteriorates in anyone area  the whole can be destabilized.Having a global mandate in political  economic andcultural matters  the United Nations is the ideal forum inwhich to carry on the quest for lasting development that iscompatible with preservation of an environmental balanceand with the needs of social development.We express our satisfaction at the recent issuance bythe Secretary-General of his ""Agenda for Development"" which is a supplement to his ""Agenda for Peace"".We hope that at this session of the Assembly we willsucceed in identifying the priority sectors in which weshould undertake in-depth reforms.The promotion of progress and of economic  socialand environmental development needs greater attention ifwe wish to overcome the long-term threats to internationalsecurity. We must give our Organization the necessarytools to strengthen international cooperation  while nationalGovernments make efforts to overcome increasinglycomplex problems relating to development.Our vision of the future cannot merely accept povertyand privation in far too many parts of the world  wherepopulations are deprived of their fundamental right to foodand education and even to water  health and a roof overtheir heads. Wishing to make its contribution to a much-needed international solidarity  the Government ofLuxembourg has undertaken to double  by the year 2000 the percentage of its gross national product earmarked forofficial development assistance so as to reach the target of0.7 per cent.The agenda for humanity  if I may use theexpression of our Secretary-General  is the true challengefaced by the United Nations at the end of this twentiethcentury. From Rio to Cairo  through Vienna  Copenhagenand Beijing  major international conferences are supplyingglobal answers to these global questions. Mankind human development and commitment to his communityare at the heart of those concerns  whether we speak ofthe Earth Summit  the World Conference on HumanRights  the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  the World Summit for Social Developmentor the Fourth World Conference on Women. Improvingthe status of women and of women’s general access toeducation and health is one of the keys to the success ofthis vast undertaking.Millions of people in many parts of the worldcontinue to fall victim to flagrant violations of theirhuman rights. The Vienna Conference reaffirmed theuniversal validity of those human rights.The creation at the last session of the GeneralAssembly of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights should encouragegreater respect for those principles. However undertakings assumed are valuable only if they aretranslated into practical action. Thus  we must ensure thatthe United Nations has the necessary support and meansin this sphere to implement its programme of action. Wemust take the necessary measures to increase theresources and strengthen the functioning of the UnitedNations Centre for Human Rights  as well as that of theOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.Non-governmental organizations  through theiractions  are also now a part of the internationalconscience  including its conscience in regard to respectfor human rights. Thus  our Organization and all itsMember States should recognize and facilitate theimportant role played by those organizations.As we draw near to the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  our Organization hasbeen undertaking a series of negotiations with a view torevising its working methods. The work with a view tothe necessary reform of the Security Council hascontinued over the past year. It will be necessary topersevere in our search for a solution that will reconcilethe need for a more balanced composition with theconcern for effective functioning.26It is also imperative to improve the methods of workof the Council and ensure greater transparency in its workand better communication with the members of the GeneralAssembly. Although the latter do not participate in thedeliberations of the Council  they are bound by its decisionsand they are regularly requested to apply sanctions and toprovide funds or personnel for the implementation of peace-keeping operations.The Secretariat is a key institution of the UnitedNations system. It must have the necessary means to carryout the innovative work it has been undertakingenergetically and courageously. At the same time however  we should combat the proliferation of institutions since this exhausts the limited resources of ourOrganization and compromises the cogency of its efforts.In this period of limited resources  it is also imperativethat Member States seriously take up the question ofeffective management. Strict budgetary discipline isneeded  and resources should no longer be wasted onoperations with ill-defined goals. In that connection  wewelcome the various steps taken by the Secretary-Generalwith a view to making better use of the resources providedto the Organization and creating a more rigorous financialinspection system.Our Organization  in the end  will succeed onlythrough the way in which each State discharges its ownresponsibilities under the Charter. They include financialresponsibilities. The obligation of solidarity that is bindingupon all States of our Organization should motivate themto discharge their budgetary obligations to the UnitedNations in full and on time.Our Organization  which is the only forum that bringstogether virtually all the States of the world  needs thecommitment of its Members. It needs decisions that arewell thought out. It needs measures for proper follow-up.Only in that way will it be able usefully to contribute tochannelling international efforts to realize our commongoal: which is to make our planet a place where peace security and greater prosperity for all peoples of the worldcan prevail."
"104",4304,"LVA",49,1994,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish you everysuccess in leading this august body. May this session beconstructive and productive for you and all delegations.New geopolitical  economic and technological realitieshave appeared at the close of the twentieth century. Thedestructive cold war has come to an end and its symbol -the Berlin Wall - has collapsed. The insuppressiblelong-held yearnings of many peoples for freedom andindependence led in the end to the disintegration of eventhe seemingly indestructible Soviet empire  clearlyreaffirming the lasting strength and integrity of theprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations -peace  equality and justice. That is why this Organizationhas always played and will continue to play a role infurthering the progress of nations  as evidenced by its vastundertakings in the maintenance of international peaceand security  as well as its efforts to increase thewell-being of society and every individual.Two years ago  the Secretary-General in his report""An Agenda for Peace""  comprehensively analysedaspects related to the maintenance of peace and security.This report led to a broad debate on concepts such aspreventive diplomacy  peace-keeping  peacemaking andpost-conflict peace-building. Preventive diplomacy by theUnited Nations and other organizations undoubtedlyfurthered the resolution of a very difficult issue for Latviaand all of Europe - the withdrawal of foreign militaryforces from the territories of the Baltic States.With satisfaction I should like to report to theGeneral Assembly that  on the whole  General Assemblyconsensus resolutions 47/21 of 25 November 1992 and48/18 of 15 November 1993  entitled ""Completewithdrawal of foreign military forces from the territoriesof the Baltic States""  have been implemented. The lastRussian military units departed Latvia and Estonia at theend of August. Thus  the Second World War has endedfor the Baltic States. Our bilateral negotiations with theRussian Federation  which lasted for more than two years culminated with the signing on 30 April 1994 ofagreements the ratification of which has been included inthe agenda of the Parliament of Latvia.I can state with full conviction that the internationalcalls for the withdrawal of Russian troops  made by theUnited Nations and the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE)  amongst others  werepivotal to the successful resolution of this long drawn-outmatter.We believe that this approach may be useful as anexample for the resolution of other global issues and we areprepared to share our experience with others.The United Nations and the CSCE will continue tohave an important role in the implementation of theagreements. According to the bilateral agreement betweenLatvia and Russia on the Skrunda radar facility  any attemptto settle disputes or differences of opinion connected withthe agreement by means of military threats or by the use ofarmed force shall be considered a threat to internationalpeace and security and shall be brought before the UnitedNations Security Council. For its part  representatives ofthe CSCE will observe the implementation of theagreements and the fulfilment of the respective parties’obligations.However  we have yet to exhaust the opportunities forpreventive diplomacy in the Baltic region. Baltic regionalsecurity continues to be a pressing issue. On his visit toLatvia last summer  Mr. William Clinton  President of theUnited States of America  stressed that the sovereign andindependent Baltic States must not be part of any sphere ofinfluence. It must be noted that President Clinton playeda vital role in disentangling problems which had developedduring negotiations with the Russian Federation on thewithdrawal of its troops from Estonia and Latvia.I should like to remind the international communitythat the Russian radar facility will remain in Skrunda forfive and a half years  and nuclear reactors will remain inPaldiski  Estonia. Heavy Russian military transit takesplace through Lithuania to Kaliningrad  where a highmilitary concentration is maintained. On the whole  theseare risk factors which potentially threaten the Baltic Statesand  in fact  the entire Baltic Sea region. In many respects Baltic security is a guarantee for peace and stability inEurope. The Baltic States are already considering thepossible solutions to this important question  and I hopethat the Member States will devote their full attention andinterest to these ends.A significant dialogue between our two countries hasconcluded with the completion of Russian troop withdrawalfrom Latvia. Thanks to the support of many countries andinternational organizations  Latvia today is free fromforeign military presence. Nevertheless  without theforesight and the civility displayed by both parties  wecould not stand here today and speak of social harmonyand tolerance in Latvia  nor could we say that both Latviaand the Russian Federation have one less problem toaddress. Last spring  when I met with President Yeltsinin Moscow  I gained the conviction that in solving ourproblem he was guided by good will.In 1995  Europe and the world will celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the Allied victory over nazism.Latvians  too  fought against Hitler’s occupying forces inthe belief that an Allied victory would be followed by therestoration of Latvian independence. However  whilstmany nations breathed freely again after the end of theNazi occupation  the Baltic States were engulfed for thesecond time by the totalitarian Soviet empire. As othernations celebrated the defeat of nazism  Latvia wassubjected to the deportation of hundreds of thousands ofinnocent persons and the systematic destruction of theLatvian State and national identity. Latvia and its peopleare the victims of both regimes - nazism and communism.Justice would prevail if the new democratic Russia which played a decisive role in the destruction of the""Evil Empire""  were to engage with Latvia in theappraisal of the actions taken by the Soviet Union againstLatvia in 1940. The signing of truthful bilateraldocuments would preclude any petty psychologicalfeelings of revenge and would provide amends to thevictims of the totalitarian regime in both countries. These""truth"" documents would foster even greater harmonybetween the various nationalities in Latvia and  webelieve  lift some of Russia’s unenviable inherited burden.Such cases already exist. The documents signed bythe Presidents of Russia and several Central and EasternEuropean States have marked an end to the legacy of thepast  which had also been a burden to Russian society.We believe that it is impossible to fully comprehendthe consequences of the Soviet occupation without anobjective analysis of the events of 1939 and 1940. Theseconsequences have been and continue to be felt in Latviain the areas of political  economic and socialdevelopment. No other country lost nearly 40 per cent ofits native population during the Second World War; in noother post-war European country has the native populationbecome a minority in seven of its largest cities  includingthe capital; and no other country has experiencedpopulation transfers and mass deportations on such a2scale. The Latvian language  too  was under threat ofextinction  despite the fact that it had survived for 4 000years  partly in the form of a unique collection of morethan one million folk songs. We wish to protect Latvia’shistorical and cultural heritage  because Latvians canpreserve their national identity only in this small land onthe shores of the Baltic Sea. Latvians never have and neverwill ask for any other land.I should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to thenecessity for regional cooperation. History has repeatedlyshown that geographically and historically close States haveforged the deepest relations  thereby enriching andfurthering mutual development.Following the restoration of independence  the BalticParliamentary Assembly was formed  and this month workwas begun by the Baltic Council of Ministers  whichcoordinates our policies in foreign affairs  trade  legislationand other matters. In other words  a balanced and activeBaltic union has been created. At the same time  anevolutionary process towards an expanded European Unionwith a dynamic Nordic-Baltic dimension is taking place.The model for regional cooperation in Northern Europeaspired to by Latvia is ""three plus five"" - three Baltic Statesand five Nordic States.Recognizing the important role played by the UnitedNations in international peace-keeping  Latvia  together withits neighbours  Estonia and Lithuania  has established theBaltic Battalion  which in the future may participate in thepeace-keeping operations of the Security Council. TheNordic States  the United Kingdom and the United Stateshave greatly contributed to the establishment of the BalticBattalion. We believe that the three Baltic States willthereby further the aims shared by the Member States ofthe largest and most influential of international bodies - theUnited Nations.During the cold war the Baltic Sea was a boundary.Nowadays the Baltic Sea unites rather than divides States.Five years ago the ""Baltic Way"" - a human chain reachingfrom Tallinn through Riga to Vilnius - symbolized theshared road towards independence and democracy. Todaythis road has also regained its historical and economicsignificance in our region. At the turn of the century theBaltic Way will already be an established part of the globalinformation highway.I wish to reaffirm that Latvia will do its utmost tofoster peaceful cooperation and the spirit of understanding mutual trust and tolerance on the shores of the Baltic Sea.International peace and security and good-neighbourly relations between States are inextricablylinked to economic and social development. The end ofthe cold war has created new opportunities to devotegreater attention to these issues. Last spring theSecretary-General issued a report (A/48/935) entitled""An Agenda for Development"". Latvia welcomes thisinitiative  which marks a historic turning point in thework of the United Nations. From being an internationalforum primarily serving the interests of individual States the United Nations is becoming a representative anddefender of the needs of humanity. Economic and socialdevelopment increases the security of every inhabitant ofour planet.We believe that the United Nations and eachMember State should recognize the need not only for acoalition for democracy  but also for a fight againstorganized crime and the trafficking of nuclear materialsand narcotics. Without effective solutions to theseproblems  the security of each inhabitant of our planetand the development of every country and society areendangered. I invite the United Nations to considerorganizing a high-level meeting for the solving of thoseproblems.Many components of the United Nations system primarily the Development Programme  are concernedwith the promotion of economic progress. Therefore within the framework of the aims of the proposed Agendafor Development  one of the challenges is to simplify renew and integrate the United Nations system. Latvia isamong those countries whose economic  governmentaland social structures are undergoing a period of transition.Effective United Nations assistance to these countrieswould speed this process  allowing them to become donorcountries sooner.The concept of development is very broad. Itincludes social and economic progress; justice anddemocracy  as the foundation of society; and theprotection of human rights and the environment. Even ifthe threat of global nuclear war has subsided  the prospectof environmental catastrophe remains. I therefore restateLatvia’s proposal  first made at the 1992 Rio de JaneiroEarth Summit  to host in Latvia before the end of thiscentury a world summit at which participating Stateswould commit themselves to diverting all resourcesgained from disarmament towards long-term development especially for the protection of the environment andreversal of ecological damage caused by military activity.3This conference could take place in Jurmala  on the shoresof the Baltic Sea.Latvia attaches great importance to internationalconferences organized by the United Nations. As amember of the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee Latvia has become actively involved in the preparation forthe World Social Summit. Furthermore  Latvia is one ofthe few States whose head of delegation is also a Vice-President of the Conference.Each global conference is an opportunity for everyparticipating State to review and compare the sum of itsexperience. The issue of implementing the adoptedresolutions at both the national and international levels isyet to be fully addressed. I would like to inform theAssembly of the extent of Latvia’s adherence to therecommendations adopted at the World Conference onHuman Rights. In its Vienna Declaration and Programmeof Action the Conference invited States to establish andstrengthen national institutions for the protection of humanrights. The Conference recommended that each Stateconsider the desirability of drawing up a national actionplan identifying steps whereby that State would improve thepromotion and protection of human rights.Latvia demonstrated its commitment to United Nationsprinciples and its readiness to implement therecommendations of the Conference by establishing inMarch 1994 the post of State Minister for Human Rights as well as forming a Government Working Group on theProtection of the Rights of Individuals  allocating thenecessary resources towards these ends. We believe thatthe United Nations should devote a greater percentage of itsregular budget to the promotion and protection of humanrights.In response to a request by the Working Group  ahigh-level international mission organized by the UnitedNations Development Programme visited Latvia in July thisyear. The mission  which included representatives ofseveral international organizations  including CSCE and theCouncil of Europe  consulted Latvia on the development ofa national programme for the protection and promotion ofhuman rights. At Latvia’s invitation  the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will visit Latvia inOctober this year.I am proud that Latvia is one of the first countries tohave demonstrated an awareness of its responsibility byestablishing a national programme for the protection andpromotion of human rights. Latvia is prepared to discussand share its knowledge and experience with all interestedparties.We support the proposal made to the GeneralAssembly by Mr. Boris Yeltsin  President of the RussianFederation  that the principles of the Declaration on theRights of Persons Belonging to National  Ethnic Religious and Linguistic Minorities be embodied in thelegislation of all Member States. At the WorldConference on Human Rights Latvia called for theestablishment of standards and implementationmechanisms for the rights of minorities and foreigners.Those activities in the sphere of human rights aregrounded in history. Prior to the Second World War  asa member of the League of Nations  Latvia fosteredharmonious inter-ethnic relations. We are now trying torenew and cultivate this great tradition. Immediately afterthe restoration of its independence Latvia declared itsaccession to all the principal international human rightsinstruments. As I have already mentioned  a major effortis being made in the establishment of a nationalprogramme for the promotion and protection of thehuman rights of the individual in order that everyindividual be guaranteed equal rights and an equalopportunity to defend these rights. I believe that theconcept of equal opportunity not only characterizes thefundamental rights of the individual  but is also aprerequisite for development.Latvia has always been open to cooperation with theUnited Nations  the CSCE and other internationalorganizations. Latvia reaffirmed this when it passed itsCitizenship Law. In promulgating this legislation  itfollowed the recommendations of the CSCE and theCouncil of Europe  and the passing of the law has beenevaluated positively by these organizations.The need for rationalizing and revitalizing the workof the United Nations is becoming ever more apparent.Latvia is actively participating in the search for optimalsolutions. Latvia supports the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil  perceiving this as a fair opportunity for smallnations to increase their role in important internationaldecision-making. Latvia also supports the improvementof cooperation and coordination between the UnitedNations and other international organizations  includingthe CSCE  the European Union and the Council ofEurope.We also welcome and support the action taken bythe Secretary-General to introduce a new  effective system4of accountability and responsibility  and  pursuant to theUnited States initiative  to establish the Office of InternalOversight Services.Latvia supports especially the initiative to reform thecalculation of United Nations assessments  based strictly onthe principle of ""capacity to pay"". This would be a steptowards improving the dire financial situation of theOrganization and would pave the way for a fair solution tothe issue of the assessments of Latvia and many otherStates.Although the inescapable difficulties associated witha transition period can still be felt in our economy andsocial sector  Latvia is endeavouring to fulfil itsinternational obligations and commitments. However contrary to standard United Nations practice  the currentassessment of Latvia has been calculated without takinginto account its actual capacity to pay. Instead  the data ofa non-existent country - the former Soviet Union - has beenused to determine Latvia’s assessment. Latvia hasconsistently and unwaveringly stated that it was forciblyincorporated into the former Soviet Union and therefore isnot  and cannot ever be  its successor  with all the rightsand obligations that this would entail. This was also statedin a letter to the Secretary-General in 1992.Latvia expects that the General Assembly will addressthis issue in the course of this session on the basis of theprinciple of sovereign equality.We consider that the same importance should beaccorded to the United Nations principle of universality.Next year  the world will celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Latvia too  has begun preparations for this great anniversary. Wehope that the Riga Dom Boys Choir will sing at thecelebration concert to be held here in New York. Thiswould be deeply symbolic  since future generations willshape the fate of nations. In many ways their fate will bedecided by the heritage we leave to our children. We mustdo our utmost to draw closer to the age when nations willnot fight against nations  but all will join forces in thebattle against darkness. This sentiment  which has beendrawn deep from the well of our national wisdom  seems toembody the essence of the United Nations now and in thefuture."
"105",4351,"MAR",49,1994,"Iam pleased to extend to you  Sir  my sincerecongratulations on your election to the presidency of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly and to expressto you my great delight at seeing you  a distinguishedfriend from a sisterly country  conducting the work of thissession.Your competence and great diplomatic experience areassets which ensure the success of our deliberations. Weare convinced that  through you  Africa will bring to thissession its well-known capabilities and talents in order tosecure the best results for our work. Allow me to assureyou of the full cooperation of the delegation of theKingdom of Morocco.I should also like to pay tribute to His ExcellencyAmbassador Samuel Insanally  the PermanentRepresentative of the Republic of Guyana and President ofthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly  for thelaudable work he accomplished.I should like also to express to our Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  my sincere regards andappreciation for his untiring efforts in upholding theprinciples of the Charter and for the wisdom and theperspicacity with which he faces the increasingresponsibilities assigned to the United Nations in recentyears.The end of the cold war gave the peoples of the worldcause for hope that they were about to see the dawn of anew era in international relations  an era of democracy justice and an effective international solidarity which wouldtake into account the interests of all.Years after that historic opportunity  we have come torealize that our optimism was unjustified. We are to seeyet any sincere international effort towards the creation ofa new world order and of the hoped-for peace dividends wehave seen nothing concrete yet. On the contrary  what wesee now makes us fear that that historic opportunity is onthe verge of being dissipated in the fog of an ambiguousinternational political atmosphere.A close examination of the characteristics of thepresent world order reveals that its thrust focuses almosttotally on the issues of economic openness  freedom ofinternational trade  democracy and human rights.There is no doubt that these two last questionsdeserve every attention  since they are among theunderpinnings of any system of honest government and ofsocial justice and have always been among the goals ofenlightened civilizations in their search for a fair societyin which justice and social peace may prevail.Maybe it would be going too far to insist  as somedo  on the adoption of one model of democracy  out of allthe other models  by all the countries and societies of theworld without taking into account the numerous factorswhich have to do with the civilizations of the peoples ofthose countries  their customs  traditions  cultures  thedegree of their development  their general conception ofthe universe we live in  or their views concerning life andsociety.As regards our Organization  the principles ofdemocracy require us to examine its methods of operationin order to secure a unified implementation of itsresolutions and ensure efficiency in the discharge of itsduties.In view of the ever-increasing importance of the rolethe Security Council now plays in international affairs  wemust debate the extent of its adaptation to the greatchanges that have taken place in the world recently andwhich have affected the balance of power  side by sidewith the new political and economic trends  so that wemay find consensus solutions in reviewing the SecurityCouncil’s methods of work and in trying to enhance itsefficacy.The changes I have spoken of require us to reviewalso some of the provisions of the Charter with a view toenabling our Organization to face up to the newinternational challenges with the participation of all in theinterests of all.As for the question of human rights  the Kingdom ofMorocco attaches great importance to those rights  whichare enshrined in our constitution. However  I wish topoint out - as I did in past years - that human rights havedifferent aspects which must be respected fully. Weshould not focus solely on the political aspect whoseimportance has been established. The rights of the humanbeing to the essential  basic human needs such as food clothing  medicine and shelter are inalienable andfundamental  just exactly as the right to life. That is whythe World Conference on Human Rights  which wasconvened in Vienna last year  determined that economic17development which makes it possible to satisfy those needswas a fundamental human right.Consequently  the affluent nations have an obligationto pay more attention to the economic interests of thedeveloping world in order to help it reach the levels ofdevelopment that will allow it to accord to those rights thepriority they deserve.In this context  we expect the World Summit forSocial Development  which will take place in Copenhagennext year  to define the essential needs of man thesatisfaction of which would guarantee a decent life andexpect the Summit to set up a plan of action to stimulatesocial development and economic progress in the countriesof the third world.The world has entered upon a new era marked byfundamental changes in the traditional international relationswhich emphasized the primacy of political beliefs. Inaddition  the great Powers have engaged in a new race foreconomic interests in place of the arms race. The race thatnow concerns them is characterized by the strengthening ofrelations within great economic groupings with a view tothe creation of new economic blocs. These developmentswill undoubtedly alter the economic and political map ofthe world and will  thereby  widen the gap between thedeveloped and the developing countries.In a much more interdependent world  thanks to thenew means of communication and technology  such as livetelevision broadcasts  it has become ever more difficult topersuade the peoples of the developing countries to becontent with their lot while the disparities between theaffluence of the developed countries and the misery of thedeveloping countries are constantly worsening. Therefore it would be illogical to expect that lasting peace andsecurity could prevail in a world wherein the overwhelmingmajority of people live in despair  deprivation and socialmisery.The rich countries should find satisfactory solutions tothe economic problems of developing countries - inparticular  to those related to the deterioration in terms oftrade  the decline in commodity prices  externalindebtedness and technological weaknesses.In April 1994  the city of Marrakech hosted thesigning of various agreements under the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Through these agreements the international community established the primacy of therule of law in international economic and trade relationsand put an end to the law of the primacy of strength thatprevailed in the past.The agreements  which were signed by 109 States included a number of extremely positive elements. Oneof the most significant results of the Marrakechagreements was the creation of the World TradeOrganization  which will come into being next year andwill have competence in the areas of control andimplementation. We hope that this new organization thanks to its competences  the policies laid for it  and theprogramme of work designed to pursue those policies willbe able to lay real foundations for international trade thatwould free trade from the protectionism that plagues itunder many guises such as the so-called socialconsiderations that relate to workers’ rights andenvironmental considerations.In the aftermath of the Second World War and thesetting up of the United Nations  international relationshave been characterized essentially by the movementtowards the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke especially in Africa and Asia. Nowadays  only someenclaves remain from the colonial era. For particularreasons  those enclaves required more time for theirliberation  and they are now involved in settlementprocesses with the agreement of the interested parties.The British colony of Hong Kong will revert toChinese sovereignty in 1997  as will the Portuguesecolony of Macau in the near future. Similarly  the statusof Gibraltar is the subject of continuous discussionsbetween Spain and the United Kingdom with a view tothe return of that Territory to Spanish sovereignty. Theseare settlement processes that we in Morocco stronglysupport.As we know  some enclaves in the northern part ofMorocco are still under Spanish control. These are thecities of Sebta and Melilia and the neighbouring islands.Since its accession to independence  my country hastirelessly asked Spain to return those enclaves so that wemay restore our territorial integrity and put an end to thislong-standing dispute.There is no doubt the ideal solution in this respectwould be to follow the same procedure that was adoptedin the case of each of the territories I have justmentioned  namely  dialogue  natural understanding andharking to the voice of wisdom by heeding the logic ofour time and taking into account the interests of bothparties.18We believe that the Moroccan-Spanish group proposedby His Majesty King Hassan II to reflect and consult onthat question is the best framework within which it wouldbe possible to reach a settlement that may safeguard thesovereign rights of Morocco and  at the same time  allowsSpain to protect its economic interests.We are convinced that the historic ties of civilizationbetween Morocco and Spain as well as our relations ofgood-neighbourliness and our fruitful cooperation in severalareas will make it possible to overcome the difficulties thatlie in the way of the settlement of this dispute.The freeing of relations between Morocco and Spainfrom the remnants of the past is a matter of significantimportance in view of the fact that both countries belong tothe Mediterranean region  that sensitive part of the worldwhich should be a region of cooperation  stability andsolidarity.In this context  we are convinced that the prosperityand security of Europe and particularly of its Mediterraneancountries could not be fully achieved without genuineefforts to contribute to the development of the southernMediterranean countries. We are also convinced that thiswill be achieved only through the eradication of the existinggap between the countries of the two sides of theMediterranean and the establishment of a multifacetedcooperation that would be inspired by a comprehensivevision of the concept of cooperation and anchored in thewill of both sides to enter into a partnership that mayprovide a solid foundation for the prosperity and stability ofthe region.Proceeding from this conviction  the Kingdom ofMorocco proposed to the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe at its fourth session held inDecember 1993 in Rome  the convening of a ministerialmeeting to address the issues of security and cooperation inthe Mediterranean region in which all the Mediterraneancountries as well as all other countries interested in thefuture of that sensitive region would participate in order toconsult over the various issues and problems that face theregion. We do hope that the proposal will gain the supportof the countries concerned.Along with our brethren from the countries of theArab Maghreb  Morocco has made sustained efforts aimedat securing the unity of the region and ensuring the comingto being of the institutions of such unity.However  it is no secret to anyone that theachievement of the desired unity still faces certaindifficulties regardless of all that has been accomplished sofar at the institutional  structural and regulatory levels.Nevertheless  it is the conviction of all concerned that thesetting up of that edifice will benefit all the people of theregion and will open up great vistas in the areas ofdevelopment and progress.It is obvious that the pace of progress towards theachievement of the desired objectives is rather slow at thetime. However  my country remains prompted by asincere determination and by a firm will to overcomethose difficulties  in the conviction that its future and thatof the countries of the region depend to a great extent onthe achievement of such unity and solidarity amongstthem. In all this  there is the awareness that the ties ofcommon heritage  of common history  of culture  oflanguage and of religion bind all our peoples together.With regard to the so-called question of WesternSahara  the United Nations settlement plan has entered thefinal stage of implementation. The Kingdom of Moroccohas cooperated sincerely with the Secretary-General  asattested to in the Secretary-General’s reports  with a viewto facilitating his mission and speeding up the ongoingprocess. Therefore  we look forward with optimism tothe holding of the referendum within the next fewmonths.The past decade was one of the most disastrous forthe African continent in economic and in social terms.The limited international effort provided to assist thecontinent has not yielded any improvement so far. As amatter of fact  standards of living in many sub-Saharancountries continue to worsen as the per capita incomecontinues to decline while the growth rate of the grossnational product dropped to less than 1.5 per cent at atime when the population grows at a much greater rate.Thus the overall economic situation in Africa hasfallen to a level below the one recorded in the seventies.Because of such constant deterioration and themarginalization from which Africa suffers  partial andtemporary solutions cannot satisfy us. Exceptionalinternational efforts should be undertaken and drasticsolutions designed to remedy to the situation.On the occasion of the holding of the historicmeeting of Marrakech  in the context of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Agreements His Majesty the King has called upon the leaders of the19world to integrate the economy of Africa in the globaleconomy and urged the elaboration of a Marshall Plan witha view to reducing poverty and alleviating the suffering ofmillions of human beings in our continent.As an African country  the Kingdom of Moroccocontinues to do its utmost in assisting sisterly countries inthe sub-Saharan region by all the means at its disposal. Infact  my country channels 90 per cent of the funds itallocates to international cooperation to the assistance ofsisterly African countries.During the month of April 1994  the African scenewitnessed an important event  namely  the victory ofdemocratic forces  the forces of peace and freedom  againstthe forces of racial discrimination. Thus  South Africa’sfirst free elections in which all segments of its peopleparticipated have resulted in the election of Mr. NelsonMandela to the presidency of the Republic.The Kingdom of Morocco had earlier expressed itssatisfaction at those decisive developments  which ended ahalf-century-long conflict and allowed South Africa  a sistercountry  to usher in a new era of national harmony anddemocracy and give it reason to look forward to aprosperous future for all its people. My country made itscontribution by giving an impetus to the reconciliationprocess through meeting with and offering encouragementto Presidents Mandela and De Klerk  both known for theirwisdom and clearsightedness.We were one of the first countries to establishdiplomatic relations with the new South Africa - more thantwo years ago now - and we will make every effort tostrengthen the basis of our cooperation with that country which  to our great satisfaction  has taken back its rightfulplace within the United Nations. We have no doubt thatSouth Africa will greatly and positively contribute to theenrichment and effectiveness of the work of ourOrganization and to the well-being of the entire Africancontinent.One year after the signing in Washington of theDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-GovernmentArrangements in Gaza and Jericho  between the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel  we note today that thepeace process in the Middle East is moving along at asteady pace  thus giving rise to some optimism for the firsttime in the last 50 years.In spite of the hindrances and obstacles it faces fromtime to time  this agreement is being effectively andpractically implemented. We hope that this encouragingstart will continue and will include all the occupiedPalestinian territory  and that it will result in the transferof all powers to the Palestinian National Authority topave the way for a comprehensive solution that wouldgrant the totality of its legitimate rights to the Palestinianpeople  including the creation of an independent Statewith Al-Quds as its capital  in accordance with the UnitedNations resolutions.It was only natural that the Palestinian self-government experience should face initial difficulties andexperience sensitive beginnings. We hope that the Statesmembers of the international community that havefollowed this issue for decades and that supported thestruggle of the Palestinian people throughout its differentstages will not fail to grant all the necessary material aidand assistance to the Palestinian National Authorityduring this delicate period  in order to help it build itsnational institutions and its economic structures  and toensure the success of this experience.Similarly  Jordan and Israel have signed anagreement recently in Washington. However  the adventof peace and security in that region will always dependon the achievement of a comprehensive solution  whichwould guarantee the recovery of Syrian and Lebaneseterritories  in conformity with international legality and inparticular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1978).The Kingdom of Morocco  convinced of the virtuesof dialogue and concerted action among the parties to theArab Israeli conflict  was one of the first to recommendand promote this approach as the ideal means for thesettlement of disputes. My country strongly believes thatthe logic of war and violence does not lead to permanentsolutions. That is why we feel a great deal of satisfactiontoday as we see the parties in the Middle East engagingin a constructive dialogue to achieve an agreement thatwould put paid to conflicts and tragedies and usher in anew era of peace  cooperation and well-being in theregion’s history.In order to encourage peace efforts and to make theArab world benefit from their dividends  Morocco willhost next month  in Casablanca  an Economic Conferencefor the Middle East and North Africa. Highly placedgovernment officials  and businessmen as well asfinancial and economic experts will participate in theConference. This gathering will aim at setting the rulesfor boosting the economy and development in the two20regions  and at creating economic programmes based onpartnership for the benefit of the countries of the tworegions and their peoples.Regarding the dispute between Iran and the UnitedArab Emirates  we hope that the two countries  which aremembers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference will resort to dialogue to resolve their dispute over thefuture of the islands of Abu Moussa and the Greater andthe Lesser Tumbs. The historic and friendly relationsbetween the two peoples  which allowed them to coexistunder United Arab Emirates sovereignty on Abu Moussaisland  should enable them to return to normal relations.Contemporary history has known few tragediescomparable to the one being experienced by the people ofthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  who have been and still are  subjected to all kinds of collectivepunishments  massacres  ""ethnic cleansing""  displacement confiscation of property  destruction of places of worshipand demolition of cultural monuments. The inability of theinternational community and of the United Nations inparticular to put an end to these outrageous criminal actsand their inability to uphold the principles of internationallaw  which is violated daily by Serbian practices  isintolerable and unacceptable.Our Organization will celebrate next year its fiftiethanniversary. The period that has elapsed since its inceptionhas known many activities and accomplishments but alsosome failures and setbacks. As regards itsaccomplishments  one should underline its sustained actionto liberate peoples from the colonial yoke and to assistthem in obtaining their political independence  as well asits activities aiming at the settlement of many conflicts bypeaceful means and the maintenance of internationalpeace and security through  inter alia  peace-keepingoperations. Its specialized institutions and agencies havealso made considerable contributions through their greatefforts in social  health and cultural matters.However  our Organization has been unable toaccomplish some tasks entrusted to it by the Charter. Irefer in particular to economic and development issues.No large-scale action has been taken to help developingcountries in particular achieve economic development despite the efforts and the many meetings devoted to thisquestion.This fiftieth anniversary will take place in aninternational environment that is totally different from theone that followed the Second World War. OurOrganization must adapt to this change by exploring theprospects of the twenty-first century  of which we are onthe threshold.To this end  several ideas have been put forwardwith the aim of strengthening our Organization  reformingits structures and affording it the means whereby it couldmeet the new and increasing demands made upon it inmany areas. In short  the aim is to enable theOrganization to satisfy the current needs of theinternational community. The Secretary-General’s report""An Agenda for Peace"" appeared at the right moment toshow us the appropriate means by which the organs of theUnited Nations might serve international peace andsecurity. The report also introduced new ideasconcerning preventive diplomacy with the aim ofpreventing the eruption of new conflicts and dealt withthe issues of building and maintaining peace  as well asmany other issues  and put forth proposals which we aresure will improve the functioning of our Organization.There is no doubt that the fiftieth anniversarycelebrations will be an opportunity for many worldleaders and other high officials that are rich in experienceto rethink the future of our Organization in order toenable it to meet the highest aspirations of mankind in thetwenty-first century: to live in peace and security  insocial justice and human dignity."
"106",4375,"MCO",49,1994,"At the outset  I should like to extend my sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly  and to the newly elected members of theBureau. Your outstanding personal and professionalqualities are  I am sure  a guarantee of the success of ourwork.I also take this occasion to pay a tribute to yourpredecessor on the podium  Mr. Samuel Insanally  who often in difficult circumstances  fulfilled his mandateexpertly and efficiently. For instance  the opportunity hegave us freely to express our opinions and ideas onseveral important problems of our time  such as that ofdevelopment  was a significant initiative that will certainly5have a positive impact on all our further thinking and workon these questions.I turn now to our Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  to thank him warmly for his efforts inundertaking the very complex and sensitive missionsentrusted to him by the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil over the past months. Given that  in manyrespects  the state of the world continues to deteriorate these efforts have been all the more worthy. While someconflicts were born or rekindled  others - often long-standing  but no less virulent - have become worse or haveexpanded. Brutality and violence  sometimes interethnic have all too often exploded  and no real means have existedor been available to redress their effects or the harm theyhave caused.While we have been heartened by certain encouragingdevelopments in South Africa - which we welcome back todemocratic life - or in the Middle East  many potentialconflicts remain and others have already erupted or areabout to do so. Entire peoples are still under the yoke ofdictatorship. The suffering and barbarity entailed are all themore vicious and painful because the methods of repressionhave kept pace with scientific and technical advances. Thecrimes of the highest civilization go hand in hand with thecrimes of the highest barbarity. More than ever before women  children  the elderly and the weakest and mostvulnerable are threatened and victimized. When peacecollapses - and the more fragile it is the more violent is itscollapse - war quickly becomes total  and civilianpopulations  especially the poorest  are rarely spared.The international community  pained andoverwhelmed  can only resort  in desperation  tohumanitarian assistance. Bosnia and Herzegovina andRwanda are the most striking examples of this. Most often this humanitarian assistance comes in response to tragicsituations and complex political circumstances that make itdifficult to deliver and  despite all the haste and the effortsmade  render its benefits uncertain.Bearing in mind the decisions taken by the SecurityCouncil in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a viewto protecting the civilian populations  and inspired by thecourageous and generous initiative recently undertaken byFrance in Rwanda with the support of Africa and theUnited Nations  should not the international communityadopt a convention-based instrument that would meet thischallenge? For such challenges could face it again in thefuture.Through such an instrument  States parties wouldundertake in advance to authorize in case of a conflict theestablishment of protection and security areas reserved fordefenceless children  women and the elderly. Theboundaries of these zones would  of course  need to beclearly established  with the agreement of the State orStates concerned. Special access routes to such areas -neutralized airports  roads and railroads - would beprovided for in this treaty in order to ensure the deliveryof humanitarian assistance. The protection andfunctioning of these areas would have to be guaranteed byunarmed agents  preferably volunteers  under the auspicesand responsibility of the United Nations  and they wouldwear white helmets or have some other distinctiveinsignia  as has already been suggested.The Fourth Geneva Convention relative to theProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12August 1949 - which envisaged cordons sanitaires andsecurity zones  without however making them mandatory- could serve as a model to a great extent when weconsider this matter. Does not protection for the mostvulnerable sectors of the non-combatant population -children  women and the elderly - deserve trueinternational commitment? It would be particularlysignificant and symbolic if  on the occasion of its fiftiethanniversary  after considering a desirability study draftedby the Secretary-General  our Organization equipped itselfwith such an instrument  open for signature by all States providing for the establishment of humanitarian zones intime of conflict.In this way  the High Commissioner for Refugees the United Nations Children’s Fund and internationalcharitable institutions such as the International Committeeof the Red Cross or certain non-governmentalorganizations recognized for their humanitarian activitieswould be in a better position rapidly to provideprotection  relief and assistance to the civilian populationsafflicted by destructive conflicts and deprived of theirmost fundamental rights.While it is more important than ever for ourOrganization to secure for itself effective means ofprotecting innocent civilian populations  we must none theless not neglect future generations. By depleting thenatural resources of our Earth and damaging ourenvironment  often out of simple negligence  we arejeopardizing the future and the happiness of our children.The Principality of Monaco is fully aware of this and isstriving to assist to the extent within its power in6protecting the environment as well as in combatingpollution in the oceans and seas.By virtue of its maritime traditions  Monaco hasprimarily throughout its history stressed the protection ofthe resources of the marine environment. A large numberof initiatives have been taken in this respect on the local regional and even international levels. The Principality isalways ready to step up its efforts and to strengtheninternational cooperation in these areas.Indeed  in this respect a cooperative undertaking withthe United Nations has existed since 1961. Pursuant to anagreement concluded between the International AtomicEnergy Agency and the Government of Monaco  aninternational marine radioactivity laboratory has beenoperating in the Principality. This laboratory has garneredimportant and interesting experience in the realm of themeasurement of levels of radioactivity in the seas andoceans. With the assistance of the United NationsEnvironment Programme  it has developed various methodsof monitoring the marine environment on a worldwidescale.The proclamation of 1998 as the International Year ofthe Ocean  as proposed by the Economic and SocialCouncil  would  I am convinced  provide an opportunity tobolster this international cooperation and to once again takestock of the marine environment  after the assessmentdrawn up in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at the Earth Summit.In this spirit  we have paid particular attention tocertain conclusions of the Fourth United NationsConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly MigratoryFish Stocks whose migrations take place both within andoutside exclusive economic zones  which took place here inAugust. The alarm that was sounded as a result inparticular of the report drawn up by the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations with respectto the overexploitation of the seas and oceans cannot leaveus indifferent. The careful husbandry and use of suchprecious marine resources and the stepped up struggle tocombat marine pollution should continue to be the subjectof the most energetic and attentive concern on the part ofthis Organization.The agreement recently adopted in the context of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - and wevery much welcome the felicitous conclusion of thatagreement - demonstrates that with goodwill  theinternational community can find the right formulae toaccommodate the interests of all by preserving the generalinterest  that is  thinking globally but also acting locally.Only world cooperation can make it possible tosolve the grave problems associated with safeguarding ourenvironment and as a result respond to the tremendouschallenges that we face now and will increasingly face inthe future. With future generations in mind  I feelimpelled to speak of the future of our Organization which next year will celebrate a landmark event: itsfiftieth anniversary.Important world conferences - the one on populationand development which has just concluded in Cairo  theone on social development scheduled for Copenhagen inMarch next year  or the Fourth World Conference onWomen  which will take place in September 1995 inBeijing - have been and will be opportunities to intensifyour thinking and build up our means of intervention inkey areas for the future.The work in progress to improve the functioning ofthe Organization and its structures is encouraging. TheGovernment of the Principality is following thesedevelopments with interest.I should be remiss if I concluded my statementwithout thanking the members of the Security Counciland the States that have contributed to peace-keepingoperations and without stating that the Principality fullyappreciates the sacrifices made. Men and women servingthe Organization have lost their lives. We salute themand pay tribute to their memory. We must be watchful -and this is a major responsibility - in order to ensurebetter protection for these soldiers of peace whileremembering their wives  their children and their families.Our action is and should always be designed firstand foremost to serve mankind  to alleviate its sufferingsand remedy the evils of its plight. Is it not time at last tosay  as André Breton wrote  ""for man to go over to theside of man  lock  stock and barrel"".I wish  as I conclude my statement  to express myfervent and sincere wishes for the success of the work ofthis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I venture to hope that thanks to general goodwill andmutual understanding we may be able to find practicaland effective solutions  in keeping with the spirit andletter of the Charter of the United Nations  to the keyissues before us for our consideration."
"107",4400,"MDA",49,1994,"President Snegur (spoke in Moldovan; English textfurnished by the delegation): Allow me at the outset  Sir to extend to you my cordial and sincere congratulations onthe occasion of your election as President of the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that yourcompetence and active cooperation with Member States willpave the way for a successful and fruitful session.At the same time  I should like to express my deepgratitude to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for theoutstanding work accomplished in his capacity as Presidentof the previous session.I should also like to express sentiments of ourutmost consideration to His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  whose activities in redefining the role ofthis prestigious Organization in this changing world enjoythe appreciation and support of the Republic of Moldova.I am honoured to represent the Republic of Moldovafor the second time at this rostrum. Nearly three yearsago  in March 1992  I expressed gratitude to MemberStates for their considerable support extended to mycountry by recognizing it at the international level as anindependent State and by accepting it into the largefamily of the United Nations.Looking back over these years  I should like to notethat the Republic of Moldova gained its independence ina complex political context in which the aspirations forfreedom and democracy of nations led to the collapse oftotalitarian regimes and the emergence of new States.Unfortunately  those positive changes were followedby negative tendencies  such as threats to subregional andregional security. Moreover  we are witnessing thereappearance and aggravation of some older problemsconnected to national minorities  territorial disputes  thepresence of foreign military troops on the territory of newindependent States  the intensification of some separatisttendencies  often inspired and directed from abroad  andso on.Under these circumstances  the state of affairs ismore complex than we could imagine. The euphoria thatfollowed the events in Eastern Europe and on the territoryof the former Soviet Union generated in some the opinionthat the two main objectives - democratization of societyand building a market-oriented economy  both compulsoryfor the institutional reintegration of new States into thedemocratic world - would not face serious obstacles. Now however  we find that there is a desynchronization and evena time disparity between those two objectives. I would saythat that disparity is even more evident in the newindependent States that emerged as a result of the collapseof the former Soviet Union. In this sense  the Republic ofMoldova is no exception.The situation requires a larger conceptual and practicaleffort to correct such desynchronizations. It is obvious thatthe United Nations cannot remain indifferent to thedifficulties that confront the countries in transition. In thisconnection  we consider that the Secretary-General’sintention to draw up an agenda for development isparticularly opportune  and we welcome it. In our opinionthe assistance granted by the United Nations to youngStates should be provided on the basis of the concreteconditions prevailing in every specific country and theprogrammes being elaborated in each.Located at the intersection of the geopolitical interestsof some great Powers  Moldova was incorporated into aState and political entity in which democratic values weremeaningless. The experience of Moldova is different fromthat of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  wherethe communist ""freezer"" functioned for only four decadesand something was preserved from the previous democraticdevelopment. That is why we had to begin the process ofdemocratization and market transition almost from the verybeginning. The deepening of the economic crisis can beexplained to a large extent by the fact that we do not haveat our disposal sufficient financial and energy resources orthe raw materials necessary to support these reforms.In addition  our country’s potential was affected thisyear by a natural disaster of which the internationalcommunity has already been informed. We suffered humanlosses and considerable material damage  and we had tomobilize every effort and all resources to subdue theelements and overcome their consequences. Our voice washeard by the international community. I should like toexpress my sincere gratitude to the internationalorganizations and countries that granted humanitarianassistance to the Republic of Moldova and my sinceregratitude to the Members of the United Nations for theirunderstanding and sympathy  which they manifested byadopting the resolution (48/266) entitled ""Emergencyassistance to the Republic of Moldova"" during the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.Over the three years that have elapsed since theproclamation of the independence of the Republic ofMoldova  on 27 August 1991  our decision to developdemocracy and a State of law with a market economy hasremained firm  in spite of transitional difficulties. Thisfirm decision is being realized through our efforts tocreate the necessary legislative premises for promotingreforms  including privatization  for transforming theeconomy to one based on market relations and forensuring respect for fundamental human rights andfreedoms.The recent parliamentary elections held on a multi-party basis were free and fair  and this was confirmed byinternational observers. Another significant event was theadoption of the Constitution  which paves the way for thereal independence and democracy chosen by the people ofthe Republic of Moldova.The Republic of Moldova has ratified a series ofimportant international Conventions on human rights. Wehave consequently undertaken new commitments tochange the internal juridical framework in accordancewith international standards. Measures have been takento guarantee the rights of the national minorities  some ofwhich were on the edge of losing their identity during theSoviet regime. Many provisions of Moldovan legislationare aimed at protecting the right to retain  develop andutilize the language spoken on the territory of the country.Under the new Constitution  special forms of autonomymay be granted to some human settlements in the eastand south of the Republic of Moldova in accordance withspecial juridical statutes adopted under the constitutionallaws. For example  a draft for such a statute for thesouthern region is being examined in the Parliament.We consider that the good intentions of theGovernment of the Republic of Moldova and its concreteand positive actions represent essential premises for theelimination of sources of tension. It is our strong beliefthat they can be eliminated  and with less controversy  notthrough the use of force but in a peaceful way throughnegotiation and dialogue; as an old saying teaches us: ""Itis better to have a year of negotiations than a day ofwar"". This is true  since any armed conflict provokeshuman and material losses.The Republic of Moldova is and will remain fullycommitted to constructive negotiations  on the condition 2of course  that all the parties involved demonstrate politicalwill and common sense.At the same time we cannot ignore the fact that inspite of reasonable compromises made by Chisinau tendencies of separatism still exist in eastern regions  andhuman rights continue to be flagrantly violated. Forexample  despite the fact that the Moldovan authorities andseveral international organizations  including the UnitedNations  have expressed their deep concern about thesituation of the ""Ilascu Group""  as of today the members ofthe Group are still illegally detained. Another example isthis: the Moldovans from the left bank of the Dniesterriver are prohibited from using the Latin alphabet in theirschooling. The separatist leaders from Tiraspol continue toobstruct the signing of the already-endorsed agreement onthe legal status and the modalities and stages of thecomplete withdrawal of the 14th Army.I want to emphasize once again that a complete orderly and unconditional withdrawal of foreign militarytroops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova is thewill of our people. This will is clearly reflected in ourConstitution  which forbids the deployment of foreigntroops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. In thiscontext  it should be mentioned that the authorities of theRussian Federation show a correct understanding of ourposition. I would like to underline the important role of theinternational community  the international organizations including the United Nations  and especially the Conferenceon Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) infacilitating the bilateral negotiations.I avail myself of this opportunity to congratulateEstonia and Latvia on the withdrawal of foreign militarytroops from their territory and  at the same time  to expressour hope that the international community will support thesame kind of appropriate and orderly withdrawal of foreigntroops in the case of the Republic of Moldova.I should like to touch upon the subject of separatismand discuss it in a larger perspective. It is well known thatmany regions of the world are currently affected byseparatist tendencies. Respecting the right of nations toself-determination - a fundamental right outlined ininternational documents - we cannot ignore the fact that thisright is often used as a tool serving the interests of certainpolitical groups and  in that context  this right has nothingto do with the legitimate aspirations of people to liberty andnational sovereignty.Today  in my opinion  at the end of the millenniumthe separatist phenomenon is an extremely negative one and to ignore it can lead to tragic consequences for manycountries - indeed  for the entire world. In suchcircumstances  can we afford to allow dozens ofartificially induced States to emerge as a result of thepressure of certain interested political groups? Will thisfurther the strengthening of international stability andsecurity? We do not believe so. Given that the majorityof States have a multi-ethnic configuration  and could beaffected by such separatist tendencies  we cannot butemphasize the dangers this might entail. That is why webelieve that this kind of separatism - today’s deadly worldvirus - must be condemned by the internationalcommunity. We think that this issue should be moreclosely examined  and we hope that the United Nationswill give due attention to this matter.The Republic of Moldova has joined the UnitedNations as a young European country. Our Europeanaspirations are determined by our geopolitical and culturalaffiliations to the European democratic space  and we arelinked to it by our Latin heritage also. For us  to beisolated from the European space and its values means tofacilitate the re-emergence of some influences from whichwe suffered painfully in the recent past. That is why ourvital and fundamental goal is the integration of ourcountry into Europe. In this context  we firmly lookforward to increasing cooperation and linkage with theCouncil of Europe  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  the Western European Union (WEU)  and theCSCE  including expanding our relations with theEuropean Union  which represents the main guarantee ofdemocratic practices and values.The implementation of our options depends cruciallyon the willingness of the economic and political-strategicEuro-Atlantic structures to support Moldova actively.I think that establishing economic relations with theindependent States of the former Soviet Union and joiningthe Commonwealth of Independent States - where weparticipate only in the economic structures and are notinvolved in collective security or political-militarycooperation - will not become an obstacle to our gradualintegration into the Euro-Atlantic structures. We believethat in these times nobody wants new dividing lines inEurope or in any other part of the world. On thecontrary  we need to eliminate those once generated bythe cold war. At the turn of the century  not only Europebut the whole world finds itself in a complex process oftransformation. We want to establish new forms of3collaboration that would respond to the aspirations and theneeds of all States.The day is approaching when the internationalcommunity will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations. In all these years theUnited Nations has been - and it remains - the majoruniversal centre for maintaining peace and internationalsecurity and for mobilizing the efforts of States  incooperation with regional organizations  towards settlingglobal issues. The Republic of Moldova has the honour tocontribute  together with other States  to the implementationof the noble ideals of the World Organization. I amespecially pleased to inform the Assembly that a committeefor coordinating the activities and manifestations dedicatedto the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations has been created in the Republic of Moldova.In calling to mind the achievements and successes ofthe United Nations system  we cannot but mention the factthat so far it has operated under the guidance of a Charterconceived 50 years ago. I think that the new internationalrealities might call for some essential modifications to adaptthe provisions of the Charter to these realities.The Republic of Moldova supports the reformsinitiated by the United Nations aimed at improving theefficiency of the Organization and its major bodies.Our country shares the views expressed by thedelegations of many countries within the Open-endedWorking Group regarding the issue of fair representation onthe Security Council. The Council’s composition  itsfunctioning and methods of work should be modifiedwithout affecting the efficiency of its activities in its mainfield  which is ensuring international peace and security.Taking into account the active role and contributionperformed in the United Nations by Germany and Japanand their possibilities of assuming specific responsibilitiesin keeping international peace and security  Moldovasupports the candidatures of these two countries aspermanent members of the Security Council. Our positionon fair representation on the Security Council is that it isnecessary to take into account all regional groupsrecognized in the United Nations. In this sense  theRepublic of Moldova supports the proposal of theNetherlands to grant an additional seat to each geographicgroup  including countries from Eastern Europe.Consultations and debates on such an importantsubject should be supplemented with practicalorganizational and procedural measures  such as settingup some subsidiary bodies of the Security Council inaccordance with Article 29 of the Charter  and increasingand expanding cooperation with the General Assemblyand the regional organizations.At the same time  we consider that the workingmethods of the most representative body of the UnitedNations - the General Assembly - could also be modified.We are all interested in directing those activities as muchas possible towards consolidating the principles of justice democracy and development. The delegation of Moldovasupports the decisions adopted at the forty-seventh sessionaimed at increasing the efficiency of the GeneralAssembly and rationalizing the activities of itsCommissions.There is a direct link between peace and security onthe one hand and economic and social development onthe other. In this new era  when the United Nations isincreasing its efforts to maintain international peace andsecurity  we should not forget about the persistence ofinequalities and of grave social and economic problems which affect all countries  particularly those in transitionand the developing ones. In this sense  reform of theOrganization should include economic and socialmechanisms  especially the Economic and Social Council.This reform  already initiated  should be more effective inimplementation and be more rational in the utilization ofavailable resources.In this context  I should like to stress the importanceof the two previous sessions of the Commission forSustainable Development  whose work we hope willmaintain and intensify the impulse generated by the Riode Janeiro Conference on Environment and Developmentwith respect to the rapid implementation of thecommitments made in the framework of Agenda 21.Turning to another matter  I would like to note thatthe Republic of Moldova is aware of the financial crisisof the Organization. We are not indifferent to thissituation  and I would like to assure the Assembly thatmy country will do its best to fulfil its commitments.The recommendations of the last session of theCommittee on Contributions concerning there-examination and adjustment of the scale of assessmentsof Member States reflect more justly States’ real capacityto pay. We hope that the General Assembly will takethese recommendations into consideration in the spirit ofjustice and solidarity which characterizes the UnitedNations.4In conclusion  I express the hope that the constructiveatmosphere that characterizes the United Nations will helpus to identify the problems faced by the internationalcommunity and to find the necessary solutions.The delegation of the Republic of Moldova expressesits readiness to cooperate most actively and efficiently withthe delegations of other States in order to achieve the highgoals of the United Nations."
"108",4444,"MDG",49,1994,"On behalf of the delegation of Madagascar  may Icongratulate you most sincerely on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. You assumption of this important post brings prideand hope to Africa  which sees this session as a specialopportunity for drawing the international community’sattention to the economic and social problems it has beenfacing in recent years.My delegation assures you of its full cooperation andsupport  which we also offer to the other members of theBureau. To them also I address my congratulations. I alsowish to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Samuel Insanally  who so ably and in somasterly a fashion presided over the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.In this new era in international relations the worldfaces two contradictory situations: one  unforgettablepictures of national reconciliation and faith in the future the other  a vision of the horror of peoples and nationsripping each other apart  even to the extent of annihilatingone another. The international community keeps onswinging back and forth between pride and dejection andbetween great hope and deep despair.The actual progress made in ways of handling andsettling certain disputes nevertheless strengthens our beliefin the principles and covenants set forth in the Charter ofour Organization. For example  we welcome theencouraging developments in Mozambique  which is nowabout to hold its first multiparty elections. Similarly  thenegotiations in Lusaka between the Angolan Governmentand UNITA are beginning to bear fruit. Moreover  theclear efforts by those involved to smooth out thedifficulties of applying the settlement plan in WesternSahara give us grounds for some optimism about theoutcome of that dispute.My delegation would also encourage those who areinvolved in the nuclear problem in the Korean peninsulato continue their talks with a view to arriving at anegotiated solution  which would help to promote stabilityand peace in the region.With the same end in mind  Madagascar hopes therewill be a peaceful settlement  on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions  of the problems between Kuwait andIraq  with a view to establishing a mutually beneficialatmosphere of security and cooperation in the region.The much-acclaimed return of a united  non-racialand democratic South Africa to the community of nationsis one of the major events of the last decade of thiscentury and a subject of enormous pride for us all.Madagascar welcomes the establishment of a non-racialregime in that great country and firmly believes thatreorganizing South Africa on a democratic basis opens upnew prospects for cooperation and developmentthroughout the region.Thanks to the political courage of the Israeli Palestinian and Jordanian leaders  the Middle East hasnow begun a process of historic reconciliation thatseemed impossible just a short time ago. The MalagasyGovernment is following closely the ups and downs ofthe implementation of the Declaration of Principles onInterim Self-Government Arrangements in Gaza andJericho signed by Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization and the Agreement between Israel andJordan on the Common Agenda. The United Nationsshould encourage all the parties to use the relevantresolutions with a view to establishing a comprehensiveand lasting peace in the Middle East region.With the disappearance of a world balance based onfear of a nuclear holocaust there came hope for a worldfree from the scourge of war and favourable to thestrengthening of international cooperation. Unfortunately recent events in the international arena show that the newinternational order is indeed precarious.7Today we are seeing a reappearance of armed conflictin almost all parts of the world. Several countries are nowplunged in fratricidal wars resulting in human tragedy andpolitical chaos. Underlying these tragedies we see  interalia  intolerance  xenophobia  the problem of minorities and above all  the absence of democratic practices in thesettlement of disputes. Somalia  Liberia  Rwanda and theformer Yugoslavia are tragic and dangerous situationswhich threaten not only the equilibrium of their regions butalso international peace and security.Other situations which are too often ignored coulddegenerate into serious crises. The problem of borders incentral and eastern Europe  the disturbing situation in theIndian subcontinent and the flow of refugees in Africa  Asiaand even in Europe are all situations that show how fragileinternational security is.The efforts on the part of the United Nations toresolve regional and subregional disputes must be supportedby greater world-wide cooperation in disarmament. In thisconnection my delegation attaches high priority tocontinuing initiatives and concerted actions by MemberStates to put a stop to the uncontrolled movement of armsand to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.My delegation hopes that the consensus at the lastsession on multilateral negotiations on a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty will lead to the conclusion of auniversal treaty so as to improve the prospects for the 1995Conference of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons.Broadening the activities of the United Nations inregard to peace-keeping and in regard to full achievementof the development goals calls for greater effectiveness inthe United Nations machinery if the Organization is to liveup to the expectations of the international community.As for the role of the United Nations in themaintenance and restoration of peace  recent experienceclearly shows the need for reform with a view tostrengthening the United Nations capacity to preventbreaches of the peace on the one hand  and on the otherhand to carry out peace-keeping operations on the ground.Lessons can be learned from the difficultiesencountered in Somalia  the tragedy of Rwanda  and thesorry experience of the former Yugoslavia. Those UnitedNations missions that were to some extent successfulbenefitted from the following factors: broad support fromthe international community; the consent of the parties tothe dispute; and non-violent and impartial interventionforces. A peace-keeping operation per se should beaccompanied by diplomatic efforts and economic andsocial assistance and should also tackle the underlyingcauses of the conflict. In any event  preventivediplomacy is the best means of averting the eruption ofpotential conflicts.The use of regional machinery for the settlement ofdisputes would improve the conduct of peace-keepingoperations and would  for example  avoid delay inmobilizing humanitarian assistance. After all  who isbetter placed than the States of a region to react to apotential threat there  particularly if the region already hasan adequate structure for the prevention of conflicts?Examples of this are the system of collective security inEurope and the mechanism for the prevention management and settlement of disputes in Africa. Yetthis Organization should not just unload its problems onto regional mechanisms; rather  it should offert h o s emechanisms the necessary support by providing a clearand precise mandate and by making adequate financialand logistic resources available.Never before have circumstances been so favourablefor realizing the aspiration of the majority of Members ofthis Organization to an enlarged Security Council thatprovides equitable representation. Many proposalsconcerning this topic are now being discussed by theGeneral Assembly’s Open-Ended Working Group.Madagascar  which  as is demonstrated by itsConstitution  is deeply committed to democraticprinciples  believes that the democracy that is advocatedin many countries should apply in the international systemtoo. Madagascar is open to any proposal that would notdamage the effectiveness of the Security Council. At thesame time  we emphasize the need for democraticrepresentation reflecting contemporary realities.The Government of Madagascar does notunderestimate the special responsibility of States that arepermanent members of the Security Council  especially inthe area of contributions to peace-keeping operations.However  any reform that is undertaken should win thesupport of all Member States so that they will have thenecessary trust in it and be able to participate effectivelyand on an equal footing.The same principles apply to development problems in that political stability at the national  regional andinternational levels determines whether development8objectives can be met. There can be no peace withoutdevelopment  as can be seen in various parts of the worldwhere serious conflicts and political troubles have beencaused by economic hardship. Against this backdrop  theimperative of the universality of peace and developmentforcefully tells us to take note of how the world economicsituation is developing.The crisis that has affected the world economy formore than a decade is worsening  despite a slow and fragilerecovery in some developed countries. This crisis continuesto make a negative impact on the development process inthird-world countries: erratic fluctuations in rates ofexchange  an increase in interest rates and an unprecedenteddeterioration in the terms of trade - to mention only themost notable effects of the past year.The gap between North and South grows wider whilethe inequalities between the regions become increasinglystriking. Poverty and extreme poverty are daily beingingrained in the countries that are now referred to as thefourth world. The situation in Africa has become alarming.The crisis there is magnified by the negative effects ofnatural disasters and civil and ethnic wars.Problems such as the crushing weight of external debt stagnation  if not a reduction  in official developmentassistance  financial and trade restraints and a continuingdrop in commodity prices are - today as yesterday -symptoms of a crisis in development.Alongside this crisis  a serious change is taking placeat the cost of developing countries  particularly poorcountries. In the present restructuring of the worldeconomy the interdependence that is preached hascontradictory effects. While the countries of the Northenjoy protectionism in all its forms in their markets liberalism is becoming a requirement for developingcountries. Equally  there is talk of the interdependence ofproblems but sectoral approaches alone are still used.Economies in the industrialized countries are becomingincreasingly integrated  while we note increasingmarginalization of the economies of the poor countries.While the industrialized countries increase theirindependence in raw materials through the development ofmicro-electronics  the developing countries are suffering thebacklash  and their already-fragile economic position isbeing weakened further. These are new challenges that wehave to take up in the international arena.Faced with these paradoxes and contradictions which keep us deadlocked  and with economic stagnationin third-world countries  we have to ask how we can getout of this situation. It is clear that only by combiningour efforts at all levels - national  regional andinternational - shall we be able to produce a lastingsolution.As to the national level  I should like to cite the caseof my own country. The Government of Madagascar hasmade development the principal objective underlying itsactivities at the national and international levels. Thusdiplomacy is put at the service of development and without any ideological considerations  is focused on theestablishment of relations with all States on the basis ofrespect for the great fundamental principles set forth inthe various international legal instruments.While continuing to implement its structural-adjustment programme  Madagascar has made importantpolitical changes in the shape of democratization characterized by the blossoming of a multi-party approachand the creation of the conditions necessary to thepromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Inshort  we are working towards the advent of a state oflaw that responds to the deeply felt aspirations of ourpeople.This democratization of our political life isaccompanied by economic reform based on liberalismdesigned to promote active participation by our people inthe development of the country. In this context  ourGovernment is trying to create a climate of trust in ourinstitutional framework  and we are trying to draw upclear rules for production and investment in order toguarantee the necessary political support at the nationaland international levels.The Government of Madagascar would like to thankthe friendly countries and international institutions thathave understood the importance of the changes now underway and that intend to support them and to increase theircontributions to satisfy our most urgent needs and  in thelong term  help to strengthen our democratic process andpromote real  self-sustaining development.When we use the term ""immediate needs "" we arethinking of a set of relief mechanisms designed to dealwith the precarious situation of our principal socialsectors because of the demands of the structuraladjustment programme.9As for the economic recovery and developmentprogramme  I should like to recall that the Government ofthe Republic of Madagascar is prepared to concludeagreements with the Bretton Woods institutions. It is ourardent hope that  above and beyond their current demandsfor adjustments to achieve financial equilibrium andbalanced budgets  those institutions will take new measuresto reorient that programme towards true recoveryaccompanied by an economic take-off and sustainabledevelopment.At the regional level  developing countries have comeup with guidelines and goals and have now buckled downto implementing them. In the case of Africa  I would recallthe Lagos Plan of Action and Final Act  the AfricanAlternative Framework for Structural AdjustmentProgrammes (AAF-SAP) and the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Fouryears after the launching of the new Programme of Action we have to say that the expected results have not yet beenachieved and that Africa  one of the worlds least-developedcontinents  has not received the hoped for assistance andaid from the rich countries. Because of their own efforts toimplement measures for rehabilitation and recovery  ofteninvolving considerable sacrifices  the African countriesdeserve a more positive response from the internationalcommunity.It is crucial to problems of debt  commoditydiversification and the provision of adequate financialresources if African States are to be assured not only theconditions required for true economic and social take-off but also the success of the structural and political reformsnow under way  free from social upheaval and the dangerof a decline in security and stability.The United Nations has an important role to play infinding appropriate solutions to development problems.The persistent nature of the problems we customarily evokehere in the Assembly every year shows once again theinadequacy of the policies and measures adopted so far -despite the adoption of several international instruments forcooperation  such as the Declaration of the eighteenthspecial session of the General Assembly  the InternationalDevelopment Strategy for the Fourth United NationsDevelopment Decade  the Cartegena Commitment of theeighth session of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD VIII)  the Rio Declaration onEnvironment and Development and Agenda 21.The problems we are facing can no longer be dealtwith adequately on an ad hoc basis or constantly subjectedto adjustment measures. What is required is structuralreform of the international economic system  which despite profound changes  is still unjust and perpetuatesrelations of dependency. In other words  it is veryimportant to define new strategies and agree on newparameters and mechanisms that can reverse the inequitiesin international economic relations today.This is a task for the United Nations  which  becauseof its universality and its democratic principles  remainsthe only forum that can tackle these problems with anintegrated approach  taking into account the politicalimplications of decisions made by those principallyinvolved in development  including financial  monetaryand international trade institutions.The Agenda for Development  the indispensablecorollary to the Agenda for Peace  launched two yearsago by the Secretary-General  should give to theinternational community new guidelines as it seeks toattain development objectives. The elaboration of thatAgenda should be given special attention.The Agenda’s first objectives should be to eliminatepoverty  meet peoples’ basic needs and improve theirstandard of living. It should seek to promote effectiveimplementation of existing commitments and agreementsand take into account the goals of forthcominginternational conferences in the field of economic andsocial development. Instead of talking about requirementsor conditions  it should set forth practical and realisticways of meeting the challenges with which we are faced.In this connection  the attention of the internationalcommunity should be focused on questions of debt development financing  commodities  international trade environment and development.Support for economic and technical cooperationbetween developing countries and the strengthening ofregional and sub-regional integration initiatives should bean integral part of the new Agenda.Experience has shown the resumption ofdevelopment through renewed international cooperationcannot succeed without the political will of States especially the rich ones. Although such cooperationdepends on many variables  and is affected by manydifferent circumstances  it can no longer disregard theprinciples of justice  equity and equal but differentiatedparticipation.10At this crucial moment in its history  the Organizationmust learn from the past so that it can consolidate itsachievements  meet today’s challenges and develop a planfor the future of the United Nations.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will bethe time for drawing up a balance sheet  for making theOrganization  the Member States and the people of theworld face up to their respective responsibilities. Thishistoric moment will make clear the gap between hopes andreality  between commitments fulfilled and promisesforgotten.Efforts to restructure the Organization and give it asecond wind will be successful only if there is a trueresolve to arrive at a world consensus for development  inall its aspects  as the foundation of peace and a source ofhope for all mankind.For its part  Madagascar is prepared to work withpeace-loving and justice-loving States to build a betterworld."
"109",4483,"MDV",49,1994,"It gives me great pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to guide thework of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.His election to that important post is testimony to hispersonal credentials and to the important role played byCôte d’Ivoire in international affairs. I am confident thathis wise guidance and leadership will enable this session ofthe General Assembly to deal successfully with the veryimportant issues on its agenda.I should also like to commend the work of hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally ofGuyana  who demonstrated outstanding diplomatic skillsand dedication in so ably steering the work of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly to a successfulconclusion.Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  for his untiringefforts in promoting international peace and security andjustice.The winds of change that are currently sweepingacross the world give us  more then ever before  newhope in the promise of a better future  a future in whichscarce resources will be utilized to feed the millions ofhungry mouths and to provide basic health care  safedrinking water and a basic level of education to the needyrather than be again spent to build military might and tothreaten the world with a new era of confrontation - afuture which will provide a safe and clean environment inwhich human beings can live safely  in dignity  respectand hope.The recently held World Conference on HumanRights  the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  theInternational Conference on Population and Developmentand the forthcoming World Conference on Women andWorld Summit for Social Development are cleartestimony to that hope.This was the dream of our founding fathers  and itis also ours. With the end of the cold war and on the eveof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  let usnot hesitate to rededicate ourselves once again  with morevigour and more commitment  to the fulfilment of thisdream.The United Nations must be able to evolve andpromote a stronger and more comprehensive system forpreventive diplomacy and peacemaking. Let us not allowpotentially dangerous situations to escalate into situationsthat leave the international community with no alternativebut to take painful and expensive measures to enforcepeace. Most important  the Organization must play arevitalized role as the principal broker and promoter ofpeace and justice in the world.My delegation welcomes the present process ofrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations. Weare hopeful that the process of reform will take intoconsideration the concerns of all States to protect theirsecurity and maintain their sovereignty and territorialintegrity.The establishment of effective measures of internaloversight of the United Nations system is one of theuseful steps taken by the General Assembly. Special14attention must be given to all the issues involved in thechoice and recruitment of personnel if we truly intend toimprove the efficiency of the Organization  and we mustemphasize quality rather than quantity so that the UnitedNations system may remain non-biased  less-politicized andvibrant.For Maldives  the United Nations has always been andwill always be the best hope for warding off challenges tothe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. TheCharter of the United Nations  which we remain firmlybound to honour  recognizes the inalienable right of everynation to exist within secure boundaries and of the peopleof every country to live in dignity and peace. It thereforefalls to the world Organization to be the unequivocalguarantor of security and protection for those countries thatlack the physical means to provide their own or that mightsimply be overrun by more powerful States.Once again at this session the United Nations GeneralAssembly will deliberate the agenda item on the protectionand security of small States. My delegation hopes thatimportant item will once again receive the same attentionand support it was given at the forty-fourth and forty-sixthsessions.My delegation draws inspiration from the unwaveringand renewed resolve of the international community withregard to important security and political issues  which wassignificantly demonstrated in the Gulf crisis  among others.The inherent vulnerability of small States was never moreclearly demonstrated than it was in the case of theinternational intervention in Kuwait in 1990. Who  indeed could have imagined that a fully sovereign State Memberof the United Nations  economically strong and withpowerful friends  would find itself at risk of being wipedoff the world political map - and if a country like Kuwaitcan be forced into such a precarious position  where is thesecurity of far smaller and economically weaker States?The recent instances in which the United Nations tookfirm and decisive action certainly highlight the importanceand effectiveness of the collective-security systemenvisaged in the Charter. In addition  they brought hometo the international community the fact that a rapid-responsesystem needs to be constantly in place if international peaceand security are to be maintained. The Security CouncilSummit Meeting in January 1992 reaffirmed that body’scommitment to collective security as a valid principle in themaintenance of international peace and security. Mydelegation believes that this is the time to give urgent anddeeper consideration to the overall question of collectivesecurity. This is easily said  but the subject includes thequestion of improving the skill and ability to exerciseforesight and act with dispatch  as well as of building upthe capacity and capability to move with greatercoordination.True success in accomplishing this challenging taskfacing the international community will require sincerecommitment and dedication. This can be achieved onlyif every Member of the Organization exercises thepolitical will to settle all disputes peacefully  withoutdiscrimination  and to assist the United Nations to moveforward in that direction. The recommendations set forthin the Secretary-General’s report  ""An Agenda for Peace"" on preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping  peacemakingand post-conflict peace-building  can serve as anextremely effective tool to achieve this end.My delegation sincerely feels that as we studytogether every possible means of strengthening thestructure of the United Nations to make it more effectiveand responsive to a changing world the security of smallStates must be given its rightful place when priorities arereviewed and special consideration given the task ofpreserving international peace  security and stability.One of the most encouraging events in world historyhas been the classic manner in which the Republic ofSouth Africa  under the leadership of President NelsonMandela  has not only eliminated the policy of apartheid that most inhuman form of racial discrimination  but alsoestablished democracy with full respect for all the normsof national reconciliation. It is therefore with sinceresentiments of congratulation and good wishes that mydelegation welcomes the restoration of the Republic ofSouth Africa to its rightful place in the family of nationsand this Organization.I view the positive developments in the Middle Eastas a most valuable lesson on how sincere  determined anddedicated efforts based on peace and conciliation canyield rich dividends in dangerously volatile situations.I sincerely feel that the international communityowes a debt of gratitude to the Governments of theUnited States of America and other States concerned fortheir most valuable contributions to the creation of thenecessary atmosphere for the ongoing peace negotiationsin the Middle East  in which I fervently hope and praythe inalienable rights of the people of Palestine will berestored. I am convinced that the present trend of events if pursued with patience and in good faith by all the15parties involved  will result in the establishment of asovereign  independent State of Palestine  the settlement ofthe issues related to the occupied Territories and finally theattainment by that region of a comprehensive and lastingpeace based on the principles of justice and equality.Time and again Maldives has stressed the importanceof continuing accelerated efforts to attain the UnitedNations goal of completing the disarmament process. Mydelegation firmly believes that success in preserving andmaintaining international peace  security and stability willdepend on progress in the field of disarmament.Admittedly  there have been significant achievements in thisarea. However  the production  stockpiling and sale ofweapons of war continue on an alarming scale throughoutthe world.Although there is a convergence of views regardingthe dangers of nuclear arms  some countries seem to desireto acquire or retain nuclear-weapons technology. Webelieve that so long as this trend continues unabated it willindeed be difficult to improve the climate of security and topave the way for a safer world for generations to come.One of the key disarmament issues confronting theinternational community is the question of a decision onextending the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. We remain convinced that its unconditional andindefinite extension should be one of the cornerstones forbuilding a world free of all nuclear weapons. But thisrequires that all the countries possessing nuclear weaponsand nuclear-weapons technology take a responsible stand something that can come about only through a sinceredesire to establish a genuine international non-nuclearregime. In our opinion  the apparent reluctance of somecountries to comply with the International Atomic EnergyAgency safeguards system is not encouraging. Wetherefore urge all those countries to join the internationalcommunity in the persistent effort to establish a saferworld.My delegation also supports the concept of theestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones ofpeace throughout the world. We feel that the failure topromote this concept in all regions of the world is a clearindication of the doubt and suspicion that still prevail in theinternational community. Unless we can overcome theseuncertainties the chances of achieving global disarmamentwill indeed be bleak.As we begin yet another session of discussions consultations and debates on ways and means of uniting ourefforts and resources to make the world a safer place formankind and to alleviate the terrible human suffering inmany countries  we should  I firmly believe  pause toassess the tremendous responsibility we carry. Asrepresentatives of individual countries  we have toconsider our national interests; united  we have anunshakable commitment to giving undaunted andunwavering support to the process of making the UnitedNations as effective as is humanly possible  to prevent theevolution of such tragic  dangerous and explosivesituations as those in Somalia  Rwanda and Bosnia andHerzegovina.The question of Bosnia and Herzegovina has yet tobe resolved. We condemn the continuing violence andgenocide there  and call upon the international communityto take more decisive steps to implement the SecurityCouncil’s resolutions in order to discharge fully theresponsibilities entrusted to us by the Charter and restorethe sovereignty and independence of Bosnia andHerzegovina. Let us not tolerate in our time any act ofgenocide based on ethnic hatred or prejudice.Similarly  my delegation is deeply concerned aboutthe tragic situations continuing in Angola  Somalia andRwanda despite the fact that the United Nations is stillproviding humanitarian assistance to alleviate thesuffering of their peoples. While commending the effortsof the international community to help these countries which are being torn apart by civil strife  we feel that theassistance should not be limited to meeting humanitarianneeds  but should extend beyond that to restoring peaceand stability in those countries  giving them anotherchance to rebuild their national economies.As I observe the world economic situation I cannotbut feel considerable dismay at the fact that  despite therecent conclusion of the seven-year Uruguay Round ofnegotiations  the developing countries have not beenprovided with much impetus to maintain economic growthin the face of the increasing gap between themselves andthe developed countries and of persistent protectionism intrade.The situation adversely affects the least-developedcountries most as they lack the resources to overcome theodds stacked against them. I feel that furtherintensification of South-South cooperation has becomemore necessary  in order to harness their resources forpurposes of assisting the less developed of the developingcountries and encouraging developmental efforts on thebasis of collective self-reliance. The United Nations and16the international developmental and financial institutionsshould encourage and support this process.At the same time  the North-South dialogue must notbe allowed to be marginalized  since it is essential for thegrowth of a world economy on a firm foundation ofpartnership to promote common interests and benefits.Without this basic element  the chances of promoting astable world economy indeed seem bleak.After decades of protracted studies  research discussions and debates  and then the resulting experience we are today in a position to appreciate fully thatdevelopment is not simple. It can be achieved only througha process that encompasses numerous attributes of humanlife; education  health  the environment  peace  theeconomy  society and culture and national and internationalbehaviour all contribute to its achievement.The reviews and expert opinions gathered on theAgenda for Development  together with the recent sessionsof the Commission on Sustainable Development  indicatethat intergovernmental cooperation involving the variousagencies of the United Nations  regional organizations andnon-governmental organizations must contribute to layingthe groundwork for development. I do not foresee any easyor quick means of achieving development goals. Whilefurther detailed consideration is given to this multifaceted all-important question  I should like to add my voice on theneed to bear in mind the great diversity in the levels ofprogress that Member countries have been able to achieve and the wide variation in the extent of resources that theycan invest in this venture  which is an inherent right ofevery nation.As the representative of a small island State  I paytribute to all those responsible for the planning andorganization of the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  which washeld in Barbados this year. I believe that appropriaterecognition has now been given to the specialenvironmental and economic circumstances of small islandStates in the context of achieving sustainable development.One of the most important outcomes of this Conferencewas a re-emphasis on the dire need of small islanddeveloping States for the development of human resources.But assessment of the need is only a prelude to theimplementation of any programme of action. What isrequired is sustained effort by the developing States andtechnical and other input by the developed countries andinternational organizations. In view of the Programme ofAction and Declaration emanating from the BarbadosConference  as well as Agenda 21  I need hardlyemphasize the urgent need to stimulate positive responsesby the international community with regard to assistingthe island developing States to improve thesocio-economic standards of their peoples in order toembark on plans for sustainable development.At the same time  we are concerned at the speed atwhich international conferences are being held andambitious programmes of action being drawn up withoutsufficient resources to implement them. I make thisstatement because of the experience we have hadfollowing the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development in Rio in 1992. The expectations whichfollowed that conference have started to recede becauseof insufficient resources available to implement theprogramme of action. One of the most outstandingresults of the Conference was the creation of greaterawareness of the environmental problems that theinternational community faces. At the same time  it istragic to note that greater awareness of the predicamenton the part of those countries most susceptible toenvironmental damage only helps to increaseapprehensions of disaster and frustration.As an island developing country  Maldivesappreciates the tremendous achievement of theinternational community in establishing the rule of law onthe vast stretches of the high seas  which cover two thirdsof the surface of the Earth. The fact that it took 12 longyears after its adoption for the Convention on the Law ofthe Sea to enter into force is indeed a development thatwill be written in letters of gold in the annals of worldhistory.The question of human rights should occupy acentral place in our minds when we deal with all issuesof global concern. The establishment of the post ofUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights iscertainly a most welcome step. But this step can havemeaningful results only if the necessary resources areprovided for the High Commissioner to carry out hismandate fairly and objectively  without any furtherfinancial burdens on the membership of this Organization.I would also like to emphasize here that  while theUniversal Declaration of 1948 may be the universal guidefor future work in this area  we must not attempt to laydown rigidly uniform standards of human conduct andbehaviour for all societies without due respect for andregard to the diverse cultures and religions prevailing in17the world. For it is the full understanding of this diversitythat reinforces the fabric of what we call internationalrelations and the unity of the membership of thisOrganization.The United Nations is being burdened with more andmore onerous responsibilities not only for the preservationand maintenance of international peace  security andstability  but for also assisting mankind in the realizationof the goals of a safer world and a higher standard of livingfor the generations to come.I remain convinced that if this universal Organizationis to be successful in meeting the numerous challengesbefore it  every one of its Members must extend unstintingfinancial  technological  military and manpower-resourcesupport to the Organization.We cannot afford to be complacent  nor can wecondone any attempts to deflect the work of the UnitedNations to any path other than that of right  justice andequality  as enshrined in the Charter.For my part  I can only reiterate the sincerecommitment of the Government of the Republic ofMaldives to supporting the United Nations and theprinciples of the Charter to the best of our ability. Only byso doing is there any hope of avoiding disastrousconsequences. What is more  the Government of theRepublic of Maldives implicitly trusts the United Nationsas the guarantor of its security and as its protector."
"110",4530,"MEX",49,1994,"It is a great pleasure to attend the beginning ofthis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. Now that the threat of global war isreceding and local conflicts are proliferating  the untiringefforts undertaken by Boutros Boutros-Ghali on behalf ofpeace are increasingly arduous and deserve our deepestappreciation.My congratulations go also to the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Côte d’Ivoire  Amara Essy  who is serving asPresident of this important session of the Assembly.During its first half-century  the United Nationspromoted highly important diplomatic negotiations prevented disputes between nations  fostered thesettlement of regional controversies and prevented globalconflicts. It also encountered serious limitations - andwas  at times  close to paralysis - in the attainment of itsends. Its achievements and limitations alike havereflected the world power structure prevailing since 1945 as well as the efforts of its Members: countries that areequal and sovereign but diverse in their beliefs  culturalexpressions  geographical endowments and levels ofdevelopment.The United Nations is a child of its times  of theperiod following the Second World War. It was bornwith a mission to work for world peace and security andfor development. At that time  peace meant avoiding thenuclear conflagration toward which the bipolar arms racehad been sweeping us since the 1950s. Global securitythen meant avoiding the escalation of peripheral conflictsinto which the nuclear Powers could be drawn. At thattime also  world development depended on financing forrecovery and  therefore  on the recycling of resources bythe victorious Powers  which were net exporters ofcapital  in the form  very often  of ""international aid"".That peace  that security and that concept of developmentare no longer with us.Today  without the bipolar balance of power andfaced with the intense financial competition and theregional ethnic and religious conflicts of recent years  werecognize that there are other ways in which the UnitedNations should promote peace  security and development as set forth in its founding Charter. Now  at the end ofanother war - the cold war - it is time to recognize a newcontent in the objectives of our world Organization andnew conditions for providing deep-rooted  lastingresponses to the aspirations for justice and well-beingshared by all mankind.What kinds of peace  development and solidarity arerequired at the end of this century? Todayinternationalization of the economy is increasinglypronounced and the cultural plurality of nations is beingmanifested by the heightening of tensions in relationsbetween groups  countries and regions. The majordilemmas of our times therefore stem from profoundcomplexities in the economic and political spheres and inthe opportunities open to all peoples to attain a decentstandard of living. Thus  it is essential to find and applynew solutions to the problems resulting from the end ofthe bipolar confrontation and from the new economic10contests between powerful regions  whose effectssometimes have an even greater impact on nations remotefrom these centres of finance and trade. Today the answerslie not in weapons  but in the will to build consensus; notin interference  but in the ability to coordinate developmentpolicies within a framework of fair competition  ruled bystandards recognized by all participants.In building up new hope  we must unquestionablypersevere in our efforts to eradicate the nuclear threat andthe risks posed by chemical and biological weapons and thearms race. Mexico has always taken part in contributing toreducing those dangers. My country is pleased at the recentaccession by Argentina  Brazil and Chile to the Treaty ofTlatelolco  and by the forthcoming accession announced byCuba  which fulfil the Latin American ideal of inhabitinga nuclear-weapon-free region. We should now continue thenegotiations on  and put into effect  the comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty and the Convention on chemicalweapons  signed in January 1993 and thus far ratified by amere 14 States.But this is not sufficient. In the political sphere  weface the challenge of keeping the peace while maintainingrespect for the sovereignty of nations and for their culturaldiversity and political plurality  which  far from succumbingto interference or being diluted into uniformity  demandtheir own spaces  both within our countries and within theUnited Nations. Faced with a painful experience inChiapas  in the south of our country  Mexico turned thearmed challenge with which we were confronted on 1January into political dialogue 10 days later; it listenedcarefully to the voices of the neediest and committed itselfto finding a political way to solve their problems throughdialogue and in freedom  instead of attempting to crush theuprising  as was the custom throughout the world during thecold-war period. This is the spirit of political dialogue andpeace with honour required by the new era; this is the pathof new hope.The world has certainly seen many achievements inrecent times. Mexico welcomes the progress made innegotiations leading to lasting peace in various parts of theworld  especially in the Middle East. It would also like toexpress  once again  its satisfaction at the end of apartheidin South Africa and at the establishment of a democraticGovernment in that country.Mexico will continue its enthusiastic and unwaveringsupport for the peace processes in Central America andcongratulates the parties involved  which are makingprogress along the path of dialogue and negotiation. As amember of the group of countries that are friends of theSecretary-General  Mexico has taken part in the efforts toarrange direct talks to put an end to conflicts betweenLatin American sister countries. That is precisely thepath that might be followed  through the dialoguereopened regarding illegal migration  to put an end to thelongstanding differences in the hemisphere between theUnited States and Cuba  within a framework of fullrespect for the sovereignty and the right toself-determination of the Cuban people.With regard to the crisis in Haiti  Mexico reiteratesits commitment to the re-establishment of theconstitutional and democratic order. It also reiterates theneed to give preference to peaceful and diplomatic meansabove all others  as well as to foster specific forms ofcooperation to ensure better living standards for theHaitian people  for without them democratic institutionswill be weak and short-lived.The use of force and the threat of its use  whenworld peace is not in danger  are no longer valid meansfor sovereign nations to achieve their goals. What areneeded instead are economic exchanges  political dialogueand a common willingness to recognize and respect oneanother  unconditionally and without exception. With thatwillingness  which will benefit us all because it commitsus all  we can undertake thorough reforms of internationalorganizations  and in particular of the United Nations.Recognition of plurality  respect for sovereignty and thereaching of consensual accords are also bases on whichthe United Nations can construct new forms ofcooperation and technical assistance aimed atconsolidating democracy and at achieving the effectiveprotection of human rights.As a form of political organization of peoples democracy is certainly the best way to facilitatedevelopment with justice; it is also the system which bestguarantees respect for human rights. For the civil andpolitical rights recognized by the vast majority of theMembers of our Organization to be fully effective economic conditions in which all individuals can developtheir potential are required. Hunger and unemployment drug-trafficking and the depletion of natural resources forced migrations and new forms of trade protectionismimpair development and the full exercise of human rightsand hinder the democratic participation of individuals inshaping their own destinies. Therefore  coordinatedaction by nations to deal with these grave problems of ourtimes can help to broaden political participation and11ensure better conditions to improve well-being and providefor the protection of human rights.The efforts made thus far by the United Nations inthis field - such as the creation of the post of HighCommissioner for human rights - are notable but stillinsufficient. Reconsidering the question of the defence ofhuman rights and the strengthening of democracy alsoinvolves reconsidering the issue of development on thebasis of fair access to markets  capital and new technolo-gies. It is not by chance that democratic stability flourisheswhere there is economic stability and growth; nor is it bychance that more human rights violations occur where thepopulation is prey to poverty  illiteracy and disease.Making progress in democracy and respect for human rightsrequires new efforts to eradicate inequalities betweenindividuals  groups  peoples and nations.In the economic sphere  we are facing both thechallenges and the opportunities posed by interdependenceand globalization. We must now make progress in theharmonization of financial  technological and productionpolicies within the world economy in order to achievegeneralized growth. We are well aware that thedevelopment of the most industrialized nations may proveto be insufficient without sustained growth in thedeveloping countries. In the coming years the mostimportant growth of markets for the products ofindustrialized nations will occur in the developing countries.We know  too  that aid may prove to be ineffective andinsufficient  when the basic need is to move toward equalityof opportunities worldwide by opening markets to theproducts of developing countries.In the past few years the world has undergone atransition toward a liberalization of trade that isunprecedented in modern history. This movement towardtrue globalization  in which a large number of developingcountries are participating for the first time  is indicative ofthe renewed confidence of nations in their capacity tocompete and gain integration into world markets. This newliberalization is also a reason for us to feel optimistic thatfreer trade will contribute to the eradication of poverty.More trade will translate into more and better jobs.Nevertheless  there are still obstacles that must beovercome: we must be wary of new protectionist trends;we must recognize that the new financial resources are stillinsufficient for the needs of the developing countries andthat many of those countries continue to experience lessfavourable terms of trade as well as instability in interestrates. The challenge we face is to eliminate conditions thatimpede the free circulation of goods and services  thatlimit the creation of jobs and produce growing migration that exacerbate xenophobic attitudes and that stand in theway of world recovery.To that end  we must consolidate the present openingof markets to competition. No instrument will be ofgreater assistance in attaining that goal than the launchingof the World Trade Organization  which will complementthe Bretton Woods institutions. It is essential for us firstto guarantee that the results of the Uruguay Round areratified by countries that have not yet done so  andsubsequently to ensure the effective functioning of thenew world-trade system.Today  it is essential to maintain and expand largefree-trade areas and  in the new organization of worldtrade  to build new forms of coordination and cooperationso that free-trade areas will act as an impetus rather thanan obstacle to world trade. As progress is made in tradeagreements and treaties  it is imperative to recognize theasymmetries between nations and to avoid conditioningtrade on such matters as labour and environmental issues which  although legitimate aspects of trade  can be usedartificially to conceal new forms of protectionism. Theseactions comprise the major tasks on our economic agendafor the end of this century.In the sphere of social justice - an element essentialto peace - there is in the world a long-standing social debtstill to be paid. If we fail to pay it  it will be utopian tothink of progress in democracy or any widespread andenduring peace and security. To settle that debt  theUnited Nations must grant clear priority to developmentand cooperation within a framework of multilateral action rather than giving priority to actions backed by arms tomaintain security. We have before us the opportunity toreorder our priorities as we deal at this forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly with the topic of a new Agendafor Development  and thereby to move toward lastingpeace based on comprehensive  balanced worldwide de-velopment.Fully achieving development also presupposes thesustainable use of natural resources and the maintenanceof the fragile balance of ecosystems that are frequentlyoverexploited  resulting in the impoverishment of thoseliving under such systems. Here  the Agenda drawn upby the United Nations at the historic summit in Rio deJaneiro continues to be more an aspiration than a reality.It is imperative to move on from words to deeds. In nextyear’s summit on social development  there will be a new12opportunity to respond to this link between environmentand development  which is essentially one of justice.In brief  we need a major cultural change based on asimple truth: political pluralism within countries andamong nations is not a hypothesis; it is a reality that definesand characterizes all human groups. Consequently  Mexicostresses its opposition to illusory assumptions thatsovereignty is a vanishing concept. The globalization ofthe economy  an undeniable fact in our times  must bereconciled with the existence of diverse and sovereignnations whose status and will to exist cannot be denied much less violated  without seriously jeopardizing peace.Only on the basis of recognizing and respectingpluralism will we be able to implant new and better worldmechanisms for coordinating economic matters to achievea better distribution of capital  technology and joint formsof production. Only on the basis of respect for thesovereignty of each nation and the right of all peoples toself-determination will we be able to build a broader andmore enduring political consensus. Only on the basis ofthis awareness and of renewed solidarity will we be able tosustain action aimed at achieving effective justice in socialmatters.With this approach to the future  we will be able toaddress existing imbalances by taking shared responsibilityfor just and civilized coexistence. In brief  it is a questionof adopting and recognizing pluralism as an expression offreedom  and justice as an essential prerequisite for securityin the coexistence of nations.In Mexico  this approach is called social liberalism.It has served as a guide for the changes that we haveundertaken to respond appropriately to the challenges of ourtimes. A product of our history and of our shared universalaspiration to justice  social liberalism has led us toundertake far-reaching democratic reform  changes in oureconomic structures  a frontal attack on poverty  and a newlinkage between Mexico and the world. We are forging areformed State that depends not on its size but on itseffectiveness in achieving  with freedom  conditions ofgreater justice.In 1990 I spoke to this Assembly about the objectivesof Mexican change. Today we have results that strengthenour hopes and give us a better understanding of worldchallenges. From social liberalism comes the difficult butgratifying task of building new forms of political consensusto make progress in democracy; from it come the enormousefforts made to correct our macroeconomic imbalances andimprove the competitiveness of our country; from it toostems the consolidation of our Programme of Solidarityto benefit those who have least; from it come our effortsto make environmental protection a component ofdevelopment; and from it come our economicdiversification abroad  our entry into organizations suchas the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council  theestablishment of the North American Free TradeAgreement and similar agreements within Latin America and our membership of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development  in which new forms ofinternational agreement and cooperation are beingdeveloped.Recently  Mexico’s federal elections proved to be anenriching democratic experience. More than 36 millioncitizens participated in the elections  which is to say more than 77 per cent of registered voters. They werethe elections most closely monitored by political parties national observers and international visitors in our history.The Mexican people opted for legality and peace. Here I wish to express my gratitude for the technical supportprovided by the Secretariat of the United Nations  at therequest of the Mexican Government  in training andadvising groups of Mexican election observers.Today it is no longer possible to pursue peace security and development as isolated goals  whether in theinternational order or at the national level. The newworld balance calls for new mentalities and newpriorities: a reordering of international realities inaccordance with rules agreed upon on the basis of respectfor the sovereignty of each nation and recognition of thepluralities of peoples. The new vision turns differencesinto opportunities  opposing views into dialogue andcooperation and demands for justice into a commitmentof solidarity among peoples.Our times call for making development a priority forworld peace and security by encouraging global policiesof financial coordination and free trade with clear andequitable rules; by recognizing nature as an ally in thedevelopment of each nation  and the equally sharedresponsibility of all nations in maintaining globalbalances; and by deploying information networks toeffectively combat drug-trafficking and terrorism  whichconstitute attacks on the security of all. Fundamentally our times call for the uniting of all our efforts  indemocracy and freedom  to reduce poverty in the world.Otherwise there can be no possibility of peace and nolasting security.13These new imperatives express not only enormousneeds but also the aspiration for the equality of nations inthe building of a future that will hold promise only if itbelongs to all of us. That is the meaning of ""internationalcommunity"" as embodied in the Charter of San Francisco:a future that no one has the right to deny to futuregenerations.Today  as then  peace can be preserved only throughthe observance of law; today  more than in the past security requires the greatest development of every nation every country  so that together we can make a reality of thehope for a common future. The United Nations - ourOrganization - continues to be the forum par excellence forthe achievement of those noble goals."
"111",4556,"MHL",49,1994,"Allow me at theoutset to congratulate the President of the GeneralAssembly on his unanimous election. It is indeed a great21honour for his country. I can assure him of mydelegation’s willingness to assist him in his duties.Let me also congratulate His Excellency AmbassadorSamuel Insanally of Guyana on the exemplary manner inwhich he carried out his duties. His innovative use ofexpert hearings on the question of development werefollowed closely by the Marshall Islands delegation.My compliments are also extended to ourdistinguished Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whom we thank for his tirelessefforts on behalf of this Organization.On a more sombre note  I wish to extend thecondolences of my Government  delegation and people toour neighbours in the Pacific  Papua New Guinea andJapan  which have both recently experienced devastatingvolcanic eruptions. Our prayers go out to the peoples ofboth countries in the hope that they will be able to make aspeedy recovery.Further grim descriptions and graphic pictures of theterrible loss of life on the high seas in the sinking of the""Estonia"" have been occupying the air waves and televisionscreen. We should like to express our deepest sympathyand condolences to the affected families and Governmentsover this tragic accident.We now wish to join other delegations in welcomingSouth Africa to this Organization. The struggle of itspeople with racial inequality resulting from apartheid waslong and difficult  often resulting in the loss of preciouslives. We share their excitement in finally joining theconcert of nations.We also wish to congratulate our neighbour theRepublic of Palau on attaining its independence on 1October this year.The aftermath of the cold war has made it necessaryfor the United Nations to take on many challenges. TheOrganization itself has become involved in severalambitious undertakings in innovative international relationsand multilateral actions. We hope that these newendeavours of partnership will produce lasting solutions tomany of our global problems.That very partnership is evident by the work beingundertaken on the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change  which is viewed with great interest inthe Marshall Islands. Currently  we are working togetherwith the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)  ofwhich we are a founding member  in introducing a newprotocol to the Convention. We commend the Chairmanof the Alliance of Small Island States for her coordinatingwork in the International Negotiating Committee. Inaddition  we welcome the urgent call made by theGerman Foreign Minister for more immediate reductionsin carbon dioxide emissions. The German Government’ssupport for the AOSIS protocol is most gratifying. Wehope that the Conference of the Parties will adopt theproposed protocol to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change on Greenhouse GasEmission Reduction next year in Berlin.As an island nation  the Republic of the MarshallIslands regarded the adoption by the General Assembly atits forty-eighth session  earlier this year  of the Agreementrelating to the Implementation of Part XI of the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea as historic andof great importance. We view this Agreement as apositive step in bringing order to the exploitation ofmarine resources. In this vein I am happy to announcethat we will sign that Agreement at this session. We arealso happy to note the imminent entry into force of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  inNovember this year.In the months leading up to the BarbadosConference last April  we were very confident that at lastthe international community would try to do somethingpositive for the small island developing States  a group ofcountries that we feel has been neglected. We arepleased that we now have a Programme of Action  andwe will do our utmost to seek its successfulimplementation to enhance our island economicdevelopment.As a country with one of the highest populationgrowth rates in the world  the Republic of the MarshallIslands has followed with great interest the InternationalConference on Population and Development. It was ashame that this process was nearly derailed by semanticdisagreements. Fortunately  the Conference  in Cairo after arduous and intensive negotiations  saw fit to adoptan expanded international population strategy  as a resultof which we now have a well-thought-out Plan of Action.It is of concern to us that so much of the cost involved inthe implementation of the Plan of Action will be borne byindividual countries. We will  however  make everyeffort to maximize our participation in this Plan ofAction.22The United Nations Conference on Straddling FishStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks recentlycompleted its third round of discussions here in New York.We all owe a great deal to its distinguished Chairman forhis masterful stewardship. For the Marshall Islands  thisConference is particularly important as we seek to build ourcapacity to utilize our marine resources responsibly. Unlikedistant-water fishing nations  our geographical locationcompels us to ensure the sustainable exploitation of ourfisheries resources for future generations  whether within oroutside our exclusive economic zone. This is a matter ofsurvival  one that transcends economics.I submit  however  that large-scale commercialfisheries are a new concept for our people. That being so we are interested in modern methodologies for thecommercial exploitation of fisheries resources. We mustfamiliarize ourselves with them. In this regard  the activeassistance of the developed countries is needed to train ourpeople in the modern techniques of commercial fishing. Inthis context  it is essential that we gain preferential accessto international markets. We have brought this matter upmany times  and we urge the Assembly to promote trade aswell as training. While we are not asking for much  we dohope that assistance for self-help will continue to beforthcoming.The development of human resources is probably themost important factor in improving the economic situationin the Marshall Islands. We are grateful to New Zealandand to the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum -Australia - for their efforts in this field. We encourageothers to follow their example. Thus  together with otherForum countries  we will aspire to develop a strategy thatwill prepare the way for the World Summit for SocialDevelopment.We recognize that further improvement of ourrelationships with the various United Nations agencies inour region is essential. Furthermore  because of theirincreased responsibilities and workloads  we wouldencourage an increase in the number of representatives ofthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities  theUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the United NationsDevelopment Programme in the region  and we would alsosupport an increase in their funding.I also wish to associate myself with my colleaguesfrom the region regarding the application by the SouthPacific Forum for observer status at the United Nations. Iurge the General Assembly to seriously consider thisrequest  as it would be of great value to our regioninasmuch as it would strengthen our ties to the UnitedNations.Of equal importance is the World Conference onWomen in Beijing next year. As a matrilineal society  wehave long recognized the wisdom of including women inour decision-making process  and we look forward toparticipating in the Beijing Conference.During the World Hearings on Development earlierthis year  many of the expert witnesses spoke of the highproportion of United Nations expenditures earmarked forpeace-keeping  much to the detriment of overalldevelopment efforts. This is a matter of ongoing concernto the Marshall Islands as well as to several other smallcountries. We feel that the sheer number and cost ofthese operations are getting out of hand. The preservationof global peace is of the utmost importance  but inrelative terms the costs that fall on smaller developingStates is very large. The Marshall Islands will activelyparticipate in this matter in the Fifth Committee  and wehope to work together with others for a more equitableapportionment of expenses and assessed contributions.We are fully supportive of the views put forward by thePresident of Latvia regarding the concept of the ""capacityto pay"".The people of the Marshall Islands regard withabhorrence the numerous human rights abuses that areoccurring around the world. We shall be very vigilant inthe discussions following on the Vienna Declaration onthis matter. We believe there is no statute of limitationsto human rights abuses  as clearly they are crimes againsthumanity. The prevalent lack of common decency  whichthe President of Bosnia and Herzegovina so painfullydescribed in his recent address  must be eradicated.We note that His Excellency President Boris Yeltsinof the Russian Federation stated that the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations should alsocommemorate the victims of the Second World War. Mydelegation fully supports this concept  particularly sincethe fate of many Pacific Island people during the SecondWorld War remains an unwritten chapter in the historybooks. For example  the atrocities carried out against thepeople of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands have not beenfully addressed. We trust that moral restitution will bemade to the memory of these victims.The consequences of recent geo-political events haveamply demonstrated the need for the expansion of theSecurity Council. With 184 Members  the United Nationsmust ensure that the Security Council reflects the realitiesof the changed situation. My delegation supports theproposal for increased membership. Moreover  there is anacute need for increased transparency in the work of theCouncil. In this context  it is appalling to note that theSecurity Council  whose decisions affect all Members  doesnot involve more States in its decision-making process. Asa positive remedial solution  the suggestion by the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of New Zealand in this regard is ofgreat significance and should be considered.I should like to remind the members of the GeneralAssembly of the continued presence in the Marshall Islandsof dangerous residual radioactive contaminants from UnitedStates nuclear- weapons-testing programmes. Members willno doubt recall that it was during the relatively brief periodof the United Nations-approved trusteeship that 67 atomicbombs were detonated on islands that had been inhabitedpeacefully and productively by the people of the MarshallIslands for centuries. This must be regarded as a matter ofmore than historical interest  in view of the resulting legacyof horrific environmental degradation and tragic humansuffering - a legacy that threatens to haunt the Marshallesepeople for centuries to come.Documents recently declassified and released confirmthat the full extent of the radioactive contaminationresulting from these tests was not disclosed to the MarshallIslands by the United States during the negotiation of theCompact of Free Association. Accordingly  neither thecompensation provided nor the remedial measuresundertaken or contemplated for the clean-up of some of thecontaminated islands and the treatment of the affectedhuman population can now be regarded as adequate.My Government lacks the huge sums required toensure the proper clean-up and disposal of the radioactivecontaminants and the treatment of the radiation-inducedillnesses and birth defects caused by the nuclear-weaponstests. Notably  the containment facility that was establishedfor the radioactive materials gathered from somecontaminated areas is wholly unsatisfactory by anyreasonable environmental standard.What  then  is my Government to do? We may hopefor the unreserved cooperation of the former administeringPower in fully cleaning up and disposing of its nuclearwaste and in adequately aiding our afflicted people.However  as a country that every day continues to sufferthe consequences of the failure by that Power to meet itsobligations  we must look to such alternatives as we mayfind. In short  we must do more than simply hope.It is with this unhappy dilemma in mind that we askthe General Assembly to consider sympathetically ourefforts to attend to the restoration of our lands and thetreatment of our people. The clean-up and disposal ofnuclear contamination in the Marshall Islands will requirevery large sums of money indeed. The effective disposalof those contaminants will require their permanentisolation from the human biosphere. An internationalfacility on a remote  uninhabited atoll of the MarshallIslands for the safe  permanent disposal of nuclearmaterials would  if technically feasible and politicallyacceptable  meet these requirements. My Governmentwishes it to be understood that such a facility would alsoserve the global interest in securing the safe andpermanent disposal of a portion of the world’s dangerousnuclear materials  an interest that  at present  is by nomeans accommodated anywhere in the world.Consequently  my Government has resolved to conduct apreliminary feasibility study for such a facility and toconsult closely with interested members of theinternational community as we proceed.In this regard  I wish to commend the remarks madeby the Foreign Minister of Norway in calling on theInternational Atomic Energy Agency to convene aninternational conference on the management of nuclearwastes. We look forward with interest to such aconference  and we pledge our support.My Government recognizes that the establishment ofa nuclear materials disposal facility in the MarshallIslands may upon detailed analysis be found to beunfeasible or otherwise unacceptable. In that event  myGovernment will look to the Members of thisOrganization for their support in the effort to secure thecomplete removal from the Marshall Islands of allresidual radioactive contaminants and of the existingstorage facility. We expect that the party responsible forthe radioactive contamination of the Marshall Islands willprovide the funds and the technical means required toeffect this removal promptly and completely  as well asto ensure the restoration of all the affected islands to theirfull economic viability. We expect that this Organization which placed our islands under trusteeship in the firstplace  will ensure that justice prevails.At this time  my Government requests thesympathetic support of the General Assembly as we24continue with the effort to secure a commitment toadequate treatment and full compensation of all the victimsof the nuclear-weapons-testing programme. MyGovernment attaches the utmost importance and immediateurgency to this matter.The issues I have mentioned are of high priority. It ismy sincere hope that when we gather together next year our efforts will indeed have yielded concrete results  visibleand meaningful to our peoples. To accept anything lesswould be a disappointment."
"112",4579,"MKD",49,1994,"Allow me at the outset  Mr. President  tocongratulate Mr. Essy on his election and to wish allparticipants in this Assembly success in their work. Myappreciation also goes to the Secretary-General for hisable leadership of our Organization.At this year’s session the General Assembly willdeal with numerous issues of vital importance for thewhole of humanity. In the desire continuously to enhancethe role of the United Nations as a universal organizationof irreplaceable character  every Member State must makeits utmost contribution to the establishment of a better andmore prosperous world and to improving relationsbetween the peoples on this planet  in the spirit of theCharter of the United Nations. In that spirit  my country the Republic of Macedonia  is prepared  with all of itsmodest forces  to contribute to achieving these aims which are of universal interest  and to improving thefunctioning and the role of this Organization. I wouldlike to assure the Assembly that our delegation will makeits full contribution to that end.The President returned to the Chair.In the Republic of Macedonia  hopes run high thatthe work of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly will result in the adoption of the ""agenda fordevelopment - and we deem development the mostimportant issue facing humanity on the threshold of thenew millennium. We are convinced that the work of thissession will also have a positive effect in overcomingacute crises and conflicts in the world. In short  we areprepared to make our full contribution to thestrengthening of the role and the importance of the UnitedNations for peace and security in the world  economicprogress and the prosperity of humanity.The last decade of this century has shown veryacutely the problem of economic and social developmentin the world. On the one hand  there are the hopes ofhumanity  rightly directed towards the world of highlydeveloped countries as a guarantor of economic progress social safety  human dignity and a healthy environment.On the other hand  underdeveloped countries are facingthe elementary issues of survival and escape frompoverty  economic despair and insecurity.The countries in transition  including my own  aregoing through a painful period of trying to find their ownplace in the world of market economies and democracyand are additionally burdened by their own devastated29General Assembly 9th meetingForty-ninth session 28 September 1994economies  social problems and threats of new  regressiveand undemocratic situations.This controversial picture of the world shows the fullcomplexity of international economic and socialdevelopment and thus raises the question of a possible wayout of such a situation. I am quite certain that the majorityof the world sees the solution neither in various newideological concepts nor in new regional and politicaldivisions along such lines - and even less in ideas leadingto a division of responsibilities and rights among countriesbased on false altruism and utopian blueprints.A solution is possible only if we acknowledge theinterdependence of economic and social development. Thisis a fact to which no nation today can remain indifferent regardless of its size and level of development. It is morethan obvious that the economic problems of theundeveloped world constitute a serious threat to thedeveloped countries. Furthermore  it is more than clear thata solution to the problem of underdevelopment cannot besought in the form of social assistance or gifts. On thecontrary  the very essence of global economic and socialinterdependence teaches us that by helping the undevelopedcountries solve their problems developed countries are infact helping themselves. Thus  the inferior position of theunderdeveloped should be redressed through mutualresponsibility and by opening the prospects for economicdevelopment and democracy under the best possibleconditions on the world market.In that sense  the successful end of the UruguayRound of negotiations and the establishment of the newWorld Trade Organization in early 1995 are indeedencouraging. I am convinced that the new GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will stimulate thefurther liberalization of world trade and enhance the worldtrade system  because the reduction and elimination ofbarriers in world trade will provide a chance not only for arealistic way out for the underdeveloped and countries intransition  but also for the global growth of world trade andeconomic cooperation as well.It is no less important that the United Nations and itsspecialized institutions aim their efforts at increasinginternational financial support for development and attackling such acute problems as arrears and debt servicing.These would be very concrete and positive steps towardsovercoming the problems of underdevelopment.The comprehensive character of these problems mustbe regarded with a very keen awareness of two globalaspects as well: protection of the environment anddemographic processes. Without these two aspects  auniversal programme for economic and socialdevelopment cannot be envisaged nor can any future forhumanity. Global economic interdependence stronglyemphasizes the importance of regional and worldeconomic integration processes. Their outlook andadvantages are unquestionable and they should be assistedand encouraged by the United Nations. My countryviews its support of such policies as increasing thepossibility of and prospects for its own development aswell as the development of other developing countries andcountries in transition.Despite all the worthwhile efforts being made  Iregret to note that the Declaration issued at the WorldConference on Human Rights in Vienna is not beingcarried out as expected. The world is still faced withcrude and massive violations of human rights. Thetragedies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda aredistressing confirmations of this fact. There are manycountries where the economic  social and cultural rightsof the people are being violated. Policies of racial  ethnicand religious discrimination are widespread. We havebeen witnesses to ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocide. And what is most regrettable of all  these are all used asreasons for waging wars  murdering innocent people ona massive scale and destroying towns and villages.The region of the Balkans where my country issituated is one such unfortunate example. The war inBosnia and Herzegovina continues. All the efforts of theinternational community  the Security Council and themost influential countries of the world cannot convincethe Bosnian Serbs that peace is the only solution. It istrue that the forces of peace are growing. However  thefeeling of uncertainty in the region is still present  andeven spiraling. It is difficult to foresee a settlement ofthe situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia thatdoes not include full mutual recognition of the newlyindependent States and the establishment of diplomaticrelations between them.The sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro haveseriously burdened economic conditions in theneighbouring countries  in a region where economic tieshad already been severed and economic assistance fromthe international community is urgently needed.Insecurity in the South Balkans is also growing. TheRepublic of Macedonia is being exposed to the classiceconomic aggression of a unilateral economic embargointroduced by Greece in February this year in order to30General Assembly 9th meetingForty-ninth session 28 September 1994impose its will in matters concerning Macedonian nationalidentity. Serious tensions have also been caused by themost recent developments in Greek-Albanian andGreek-Turkish relations. These are all elements of greatconcern to us.Due attention to this situation is being devoted by therelevant responsible international factors and  within thisframework  by the Security Council. I should like toreaffirm the positive role and contribution of the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations deployed on apreventive mission in Macedonia  a very successful actionundertaken in the interests of peace and deserving widersupport.With its peaceful policy and position  the Republic ofMacedonia is a factor for stability in the region. We aresparing no effort to demonstrate that  even in a region asturbulent as ours  other solutions are viable; that peace isguaranteed by human and minority rights; that cohabitation tolerance and mutual understanding between various ethnicgroups is possible; that relations between States becomemore stable when the principles of the inviolability ofborders are respected through cooperation on an equalfooting; and that problems can be resolved successfullyonly through dialogue and political means. For us  a wayout of the historical frustrations and war myths in theBalkans is possible only through the implementation of theprinciples of the new European model of open borders integration and cooperation.That is why  today  the Balkan region needs thesupport of the international community on a number of keyissues: an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina  theprevention of a spillover of that war  and the establishmentof permanent foundations for peace; the strengthening ofdemocratic processes in all countries and in the region as awhole  and  especially  an increase in awareness of humanrights and the rights of national minorities; support foreconomic reform in these countries  in view of the fact thatmost of them are now in transition  and  most important their incorporation into collective security mechanisms.The worst threat for the Balkans is the emergence ofnew divisions and regrouping along religious or ethniclines. The Balkans cannot remain as a living relic of blocdivisions in Europe and the world  since if it does it willbecome an open threat to peace and stability on thecontinent and in the world. This can best be avoidedthrough preventive action by the international communityin this region  not only in the form of monitoringmissions but through concrete policies which get the jobdone.Allow me to conclude by expressing our hope thatthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly will serveto strengthen the role of the United Nations  in theinterest of peace and security in the world  in the interestof harmony in global economic and social development in the interest of the survival and protection of planetEarth and in the interest of humanity."
"113",4625,"MLI",49,1994,"Itis a great honour for me to address the General Assemblyfor the first time on behalf of the Republic of Mali.The Malian delegation welcomes the fact that thisyear’s session of the General Assembly is being held underthe skilful presidency of Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire.As well as being a personal tribute  his election honours notonly Côte d’Ivoire  which is Mali’s friend and neighbour but Africa as a whole. It also attests to the confidence ofall delegations in him. They are confident that he will leadour work effectively and wisely. He can rely on the fullcooperation of the Malian delegation. We convey to himour warmest congratulations and every good wish forsuccess.I wish also to pay tribute to Mr. Essy’s predecessor Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  for the devotionand skill that he brought to his work as President of theGeneral Assembly at its last session.I also take pleasure in greeting the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and in commendinghim for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of theUnited Nations.In the period since the last session of the GeneralAssembly there have been encouraging developments inthe cause of peace.The advent of a united  democratic and non-racialSouth Africa is part of this pattern. That event  whichputs an end to three centuries of domination  marks thecompletion of Africa’s liberation. But  in addition  byenabling majority rule to prevail  it brings South Africainto harmony with mankind’s essential values. For boththese reasons we must welcome the fact that joint efforts in Africa and around the world  were a powerful catalystin the eradication of the policy of apartheid. I pay tributeto the determination of the South African people and tothe courage of two men  President Mandela and Vice-President de Klerk  each of whom understood the trend ofhistory and opted for the course of reason and the path ofdialogue.At the same time  I wish to take the opportunityprovided by the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly to pay tribute to the Palestinian people and thePalestine Liberation Organization  under the leadership ofChairman Yasser Arafat. The Malian Governmentwelcomes the conclusion and the signing by Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization of the Peace Agreementon the autonomy of Jericho and Gaza  which constitutesa significant step forward towards settling the Palestinianquestion. My delegation will continue to support thepeace process in the interests of the Palestinian and Israelipeoples  because it provides a unique framework withinwhich to bring lasting peace  stability and security to thewhole region.While developments in South Africa and in theMiddle East amount to significant progress towards peace certain remaining conflicts are a continuing source ofgrave concern for the international community. Anyconflict capable of destabilizing any region of the worldis a threat to the peace and stability of the wholeinternational community.To increase the chances of resolving conflicts thathave worldwide repercussions the United Nations shouldresolutely support regional and subregional initiatives such as the establishment by the Organization of AfricanUnity of a central body for the prevention  management24and settlement of conflicts. But such initiatives need to bebacked up with genuine and forthright involvement byStates in the same subregion  as well as by consistentsupport from the international community  if lasting peaceis to be brought to the areas concerned.Is it not also time to collectively address one of thefactors underlying the development of armed conflicts insome regions of the world? I am thinking of the massiveuncontrolled circulation of small arms in third worldcountries in general  and of Africa in particular. We are allaware that very few of these countries manufacture arms.So where do they come from? How are they channelled?What can we do about them?In the view of my delegation  the answer to thesepressing questions would make it possible to find ways andmeans to ensure that our peoples enjoy a safe and stableenvironment that will favour development activities.Returning now to existing conflicts  we believe that inRwanda everything must be done to promote dialogue inorder to preserve peace in that country and in the region.In this respect  my country  Mali  has been activelyinvolved in the quest for a solution to the Rwandan tragedyand is participating in the implementation of the Arushapeace agreements through its contingent earmarked toreinforce the United Nations Assistance Mission forRwanda.The international community and the United Nationsmust continue their efforts to provide relief to the displacedpopulations and organize their return while stepping upeconomic  financial  material and technical assistance inorder to foster Rwanda’s reconstruction and economicrehabilitation.Similarly  there is a need for stepped-up cooperationbetween the United Nations  the Organization of AfricanUnity  the League of Arab Nations  the Organization of theIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement inorder to find a settlement to the Somali crisis inhumanitarian  political and security terms. This endeavourshould be accompanied by the launching of a massive andeffective programme of rehabilitation  relief andreconstruction in Somalia. Hence the presence of theUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) shouldbe maintained and strengthened.In Mozambique  national reconciliation is under way.My delegation wishes to hail the initiatives taken by theUnited Nations through its observer mission and calls forfull compliance with the electoral timetable.In Angola  we welcome the continuation of thepeace talks and call on all parties to fulfil their respectivecommitments in order to bring peace quickly back to thatcountry.With respect to the Western Sahara  recentdevelopments make it incumbent upon this Organizationto further pursue its efforts to bring about the holding ofthe referendum  in conformity with the pertinentresolutions on this issue.In Liberia  where my country is actively involved inthe search for a solution  all initiatives designed to bringlasting peace must be supported  in particular those ofthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS). We call on the parties to the conflict  thesignatories of the various agreements  to respect theircommitments with a view to promoting the furthermobilization of the human and financial resources thecountry needs. Everything should also be done to makethe experiment under way in the Military Observer Groupof ECOWAS a model for the settlement of other regionalconflicts.Our abiding conviction that peace is possibleeverywhere should bolster our determination to bringabout a settlement to other persistent conflicts.Thus  in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Mali supports allinitiations permitting the speedy adoption andimplementation of measures that will break down thestubbornness of the Serb party. My country  like othercountries of the international community  remainsprofoundly perturbed by the armed aggression and policyof “ethnic cleansing” being directed against the Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people. We must doour utmost to ensure that the relevant Security Councilresolutions are fully respected.It is with this same goal of reducing the number ofregional conflicts that we should approach activities tobring a return to democracy in Haiti and to restore peacein Afghanistan.Another source of grave concern for the internationalcommunity lies in the persistence of major economic andfinancial problems.25Indeed  one of the major challenges facing ourOrganization today is development. The developmentstrategies and programmes that have been pursued thus farhave not yielded the desired results  in particular in the caseof Africa.“An Agenda for Development”  proposed by theSecretary-General  does provide a useful opportunity todiagnose the existing situation  in particular in Africa  andshould permit us to propose appropriate measures to lay thefoundations for lasting development for the benefit of allthe peoples and nations of the world.The Agenda represents the last hope for millions ofpeople living in poverty and destitution  for millions ofchildren dying every year of endemic diseases  and for themillions of refugees around the world.That is why my delegation welcomes the upcomingWorld Summit for Social Development  scheduled forMarch 1995 in Copenhagen.Similarly  the Fourth World Conference on Women  tobe held in Beijing in 1995  should make an importantcontribution to the elaboration of “An Agenda forDevelopment”. This Conference will permit our countriesto better manage the tremendous human resourcerepresented by women by translating policies and measuresin favour of women into concrete programmes. Moresocial justice for women can only enhance society as awhole.In the same vein  my delegation welcomes the ongoingreforms in various bodies of the United Nations  notablythose responsible for economic and social development.The question of world trade and commodities isamong those to have received the greatest attention inrecent years. In this context  the agreement creating theWorld Trade Organization was signed in Marrakesh Morocco  on 15 April 1994.In the implementation of that agreement  particularattention must be given to the following issues: the specificconditions of the developing countries  in particular theleast developed countries  which must continue to receivepreferential treatment in the implementation of the newmechanisms designed to govern world trade; the transfer oftechnology in keeping with the aspirations of the countriesof the South; regional economic integration; immigrationpolicies; professional training; and job creation.Resolute political commitment on the part of thewhole of the international community is thus vital if theOrganization is to play the key role in the area ofdevelopment and international cooperation entrusted to itby the United Nations Charter and the pertinent GeneralAssembly resolutions.We welcome the fact that on 18 June 1994  theInternational Convention to Combat Desertification inThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification  Particularly in Africa  was adopted. Mali a country that has been hard hit by the cumulative effectsof drought and desertification  is hoping for the earlyratification and implementation of this Convention.Strengthening the role of the United Nations isbecoming more and more of a necessity  for as itapproaches its fiftieth anniversary  our Organization mustface many challenges  whether in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security or in the fields ofeconomic and social development or respect for humanrights.Let us equip this Organization with the means toaccomplish these tasks.While the celebration of the fiftieth anniversaryprovides a useful opportunity to assess the workaccomplished thus far  it is also a reminder of the limitsthat reality has imposed on the implementation of theCharter. In this respect  it is not simply the problem ofthe Organization’s financial situation that arises  but alsoits Members’ ability to agree on its priorities and its tasksthat is being questioned. We can only rejoice when wesee that our collective awareness of the disorder andshortcomings of the past has  for the first time  becomethe promise of a readiness to engage in serious thought as attested to by the development of “An Agenda forPeace” and the draft of “An Agenda for Development” which can become effective instruments to enable ourOrganization to provide a better future for present andfuture generations.I should like to take this opportunity to inform theinternational community of the democratic developmentsthat have taken place in Mali since 1991.In political terms  democracy is daily being furtherconsolidated and expanded. After free and democraticelections in 1992 we set up the institutions provided forby our Basic Law. My Government today is striving toeducate the whole of Malian society in democracy.26Evidence of this is the recent regional consultation meetingswhich permitted the whole population in their respectiveregions to voice their views on the major concerns facingthe Malian nation. That exercise has also permitted theGovernment  among other things  to gauge the impact of itsmeasures on the population.In economic terms  I wish to draw attention to theimportant achievements in the context of the policy ofeconomic recovery and reform of public finance. TheGovernment’s new economic policy also stresses thepromotion of the private sector.The challenges that face us are daunting and henceour achievements still need to be consolidated; but thatwill be possible with the support of the internationalcommunity.The success of the recent round-table conference onthe development of Mali  held in Geneva on 13 and14 September 1994  attests to the confidence of Mali’spartners in development in the measures that have beentaken.These qualitative changes in Mali have also beenobserved in several developing countries. They reflectthe fundamental aspiration of peoples to freedom  justiceand development with solidarity. These positivedevelopments  if they are to be consolidated  require aseries of complementary measures at the internationallevel. In this regard it is important to ensure equalparticipation by all States in the development of newnorms designed to place the international system on amore solid foundation while at the same time providingbetter security for all.It is my hope that the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization will provide a usefulopportunity to reflect in depth on these issues."
"114",4666,"MLT",49,1994,"I should like to join others incongratulating the President on his election to preside overthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Thewealth of his political and professional experience and hispersonal qualities will undoubtedly benefit the work of theAssembly in the coming months.He takes over his new responsibilities from HisExcellency Mr. Insanally who  as President during theforty-eighth session  continued to give the presidency thatforward-looking spirit which is so important as the UnitedNations system and  at its very centre  the GeneralAssembly increasingly become the effective focal point ofinternational life.Five years after the end of the Cold War  theinternational community continues to witness painfulsituations of political  economic and social strife.Daily the media bombard us with images of misery:victims of wars fleeing combat zones  abandoning all theyhad worked for and accumulated in a life-time; refugeescrossing deserts or oceans in superhuman efforts todistance themselves from situations where human dignityis trampled upon  where the essence of human rights haslong been lost; the poor and the needy nurturing hopes ofescaping from communities where development is absentor denied.The list of anguish is endless. Most of us aredisturbed and angered at the apparent impotence of theinternational community to attack the root causes of suchmisery.We tend to link many of these situations to the endof the Cold War and its aftermath  aware that thetransition in international power relations has had aneffect which goes far beyond its immediate politicalimpact. It has influenced in different ways the economicand social dynamic not only of those States undergoingthe process of transition  but even others - a spill-overeffect which is as difficult to contain as it is difficult toidentify and map out.We have entered a historical phase marked andchequered by regional conflicts - wars which sow deathand destruction and erase social and economicachievements in a matter of weeks if not days.There is the temptation to develop an immunity tothe tragic consequences of these ills by giving up on ourcollective responsibility to alleviate suffering. Every timethe international community gives in to this temptation itis rudely awakened by degenerating situations which wecannot but find shocking.Antagonisms with roots which go back in time haveexploded into situations of conflict and civil strife exposing a heritage of ethnic  religious and tribalanimosities. Massacres on an unprecedented scale havedevastated our collective conscience.The transition has created a vacuum. In attemptingto fill this vacuum  the new and frail forces of democraticpolitical leadership often have to encounter antagonisticeconomic  political and social forces interested in carvinga niche for themselves through the perpetuation of10instability. Illegal drug and arms traffickers  moneylaunderers and unscrupulous economic operators stand toprofit from an unregulated fiscal  political and socialenvironment. They often join forces in efforts toundermine the consolidation of democracy and the rule oflaw. The international community has long realized thatsuch ills cannot be tackled in isolation. Cooperation hasbeen strengthened in areas where borders fail to stop thespread of criminality.The ills of the present age also require enhancedbilateral and regional cooperation. Regions may learnlessons from each other as different illicit trade routesranging from drugs to plutonium  appear to spread theirtentacles to encompass the globe. The heart of the matterlies  however  in rehabilitating those social environmentswhich the illicit trade invades  thrives upon and exploits.Safeguarding the dignity of every human being through the full respect for the right to life  liberty andsecurity of person must remain the basis of our collectiveaction.We all declare ourselves committed to the principlesenshrined 46 years ago in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. This commitment  however  has oft fallenvictim to that pragmatic approach which demands lookingthe other way - a philosophy that justifies living with thelesser evil  supposedly to avoid the greater evil. Thefallacy of this approach has been seen in many and variedinstances  ranging from corruption within the body politic to totalitarianism at the national level  to trans-boundarycrime and terrorism at the international level.For five years we have been speaking of the creationof a new international order. The words and setting werepraiseworthy  as was the commitment to do good. In oureuphoria  we assumed that our desire for a new worldcommunity where law  order and development shouldprevail was universally shared.Crude realities have proved that in making thisassumption we failed to note that our desire for good couldbe matched  indeed challenged  by the evil intentions ofothers. It was thought that this challenge could come onlyfrom existing regimes which we rightfully tried to treat asoutcasts - little realizing that the roots of the issue weremore widespread and lay in the lack of balance andharmonious development of economic and socio-politicalsystems.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round this year andthe setting up of the World Trade Organization couldprovide us with a channel where trade practices becomemore transparent and fair. Trade is the driving forcebehind economic growth and social stability. Lack ofviable economic activity erodes the basis of democraticsocieties  rendering them fragile and subject to instability.One cannot but praise the efforts of the peoples andGovernments of many States in striving to build stableeconomic infrastructures. Their enterprise cannot beachieved without the constant support of developed Stateswith long-established free-market economies.A new approach requires that we gird ourselvesproperly to face the challenges ahead. On the nationallevel  political and socio-economic structures must ensuredignity for one and all.On 21 September  Malta celebrated the thirtiethanniversary of its independence. During these threedecades  many were the challenges faced and the lessonslearnt. Democracy based on the dignity of each citizen isa task that requires an ever-renewing commitment by allsocial forces to the right to freedom of opinion.Pluralism is an essential catalyst in the democraticprocess and requires that we honour its full meaning inthe different areas where it manifests itself. Howevermuch this impetus is strengthened when fired byGovernments  it is handicapped each time an authoritarianGovernment assumes that it can rule by diktat. Duringthe past seven years my Government has committed itselfto strengthening pluralism in such vital areas asbroadcasting  education and trade. Pluralism is a vote ofconfidence in the people  and a democratically electedGovernment cannot but reciprocate the trust bestowed bythe electorate.The consolidation of democracy was not the onlychallenge we had to face. During these 30 years weradically transformed an economy entirely dependent onthe presence of foreign military bases into one benefitingfrom thriving financial  industrial and tourism sectors.This transition has given Malta the economic buoyancyrequired of it as a prospective member of the EuropeanUnion. We note with satisfaction the decision  taken lastJune at the Corfu Summit  that Malta will be included inthe next phase of the enlargement of the European Union.This state of economic well-being has enabled theGovernment to consolidate a social policy inspired by theconcept of solidarity. Over three decades we have11introduced schemes ensuring equal access for men andwomen by providing appropriate formal educational andsocial structures.In enacting this policy  the Government has notignored its responsibility to ensure a dignified life for allthrough programmes that range from free medical aid forall citizens to care of the elderly and integration of thehandicapped.Today  Malta can rightfully claim to be a nation atpeace with itself and with others. Though conscious of ourlimitations  we have never let size inhibit our matureinvolvement in the international arena. On the occasion ofthe recent signing of the Agreement on the implementationof part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law ofthe Sea  many representatives acknowledged Malta’s role inlaunching the concept of common heritage - a concept thattoday is the guiding principle in a number of conventions.Malta stands committed to the creation of a global societybased on the principles of dignity and solidarity.Throughout the centuries  Malta has had its existencemarked by the contradiction between its size and itsstrategic importance. This has necessitated anunderstanding of the importance of regional stabilitythrough cooperation. Since independence  we havecultivated an awareness of the importance of stability in theMediterranean. The progress registered in the Middle Eastpeace process following the signing of the Declaration ofPrinciples and the Washington Accords of 13 September1993 makes it easier to understand the importance of theinterdependence of European security and Mediterraneansecurity.Malta has been the first in international forums - andhas sometimes been alone - to advocate the need for aMediterranean dialogue  and it has been consistent inadvancing proposals to this end. Over the years since theHelsinki Summit Declaration we have promoted the linkbetween security in Europe and security in theMediterranean.Today  the Mediterranean dimension is high on theinternational agenda. From both sides of this sea of destinythe need for a Mediterranean forum has been underlined -not for the sake of creating another international body butas an aspect of the logic of existence in the light of themany problems in the region. These problems range fromunemployment to overpopulation  terrorism and ethnic strife- all in a narrow highway that affects stability in the regionand beyond  thus threatening the future of millions.We cannot  therefore  but identify ourselves withForeign Minister Alain Juppé  who  in his address to thisAssembly at its 8th plenary meeting  stated that Francewould like to see Europe organizing a forum forcooperation involving all the Mediterranean States  andwould be making this one of the main goals of theforthcoming French presidency of the European Union.We also welcome the statement made at the 6th plenarymeeting by the President of the Council of Ministers ofthe European Union - Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -that Europe attaches great importance to security in theMediterranean.Principled cooperation reflects a fundamental andessential Maltese social reality. It was through theextension of this matured concept to the broader Europeanand international level that  within the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  Maltalaunched the initiative for the Conference to declare itselfa regional arrangement for the maintenance of peace andsecurity in the terms of Chapter VIII of the UnitedNations Charter - a declaration adopted by CSCE Headsof State and Government at the Helsinki II Summit.In calling for a new approach at the regional level we cannot but renew our support for  and ourcommitment to  the CSCE process. The CSCE was thefirst body to give tangible form to the connection betweenthe political  economic and human dimensions. TheCSCE need not be copied in its detail by other regions but it provides a model of confidence-building to whichother regions can aspire.The need for a new approach has long been felt atthe United Nations. Initiatives taken by Malta when itoccupied the presidency of the General Assembly at itsforty-fifth session  four years ago  are slowly bearingfruit. However  it is only legitimate to ask whether theresults are proportionate to the efforts made. MyGovernment welcomes as a step in the right direction therecently adopted resolution on revitalization of theGeneral Assembly. Important as it is  this step cannot butlead to others meant to enhance the role of this forum.We have to maintain the central role of the GeneralAssembly in the framework of the United Nations. Thisis the only forum where all members are permanentmembers. We believe that the General Assembly has todevelop and define the fact-finding mechanism thatpertains to it. We also have to ensure what formerSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar referred to as""a balanced constitutional relationship"". The maintenance12of this relationship with and between the principal organsof the Organization  including the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the Secretariat  is important not as anissue of the internal working of the Organization butbecause ""it bears on the guardianship of peace exercised bythe United Nations "".In his report ""An Agenda for Peace""  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali underlines the relevance ofthe General Assembly as a universal forum by calling forrecognition of its capacity to consider and recommendappropriate action in the maintenance of international peaceand security. He says:""To that end it is essential to promote its utilization byall Member States so as to bring greater influence tobear in pre-empting or containing situations which arelikely to threaten peace and security."" (A/47/277 para. 36)In this respect  the reforms related to the restructuringof the Security Council  which we hope will be negotiatedby next year  have a bearing because of the qualitativechange they would generate. My Government is studyingthe proposals already submitted  including the Italianproposal presented yesterday by Foreign Minister Martino.Next year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations system. The international communityis becoming more aware of the vast extent of commonconcerns which bond our fate as a global community. Anumber of international conventions today make specificreference to the common heritage of mankind.The universal acceptance of this principle is to ourcollective credit. It is proof of the sense of responsibilityand equity that inspires Member States in their obligationstowards present and future generations. Only an underlyingsolidarity can ensure the survival of the planet. This senseof inter-generation solidarity truly dignifies humanity.Malta has underlined the need for a unit to coordinateand monitor areas related to the common heritage. Aconvergence of all efforts becomes instrumental to theefficiency with which such initiatives  born of conventions may work and bear fruit.A scenario marked by institutional fragmentation canbe avoided only by establishing institutional oversight in theinterest of the areas we hold in trust for future generations.Rather than reinventing the wheel  we are proposing atransition and evolution in the role of Trusteeship Council for we are convinced that the Trusteeship Council couldbe such a point of convergence.We have taken note of the part of the report of theSecretary-General on the work of the Organization whichdeals with the Trusteeship Council and  in particular  therecommendation that the General Assembly proceed withsteps to eliminate that organ in accordance with Article108 of the Charter. We agree with the Secretary- Generalthat with the end of the Trusteeship Agreement on Palauthe Council  as conceived  has concluded its task.The concept of trust - a concept of English CommonLaw which is fundamental in its fiduciary nature - is onethat reflects the mission of the League of Nations andlater the United Nations in so far as certain Territorieswere concerned. We have to apply the concept of trustto new realities. We believe that the United Nationsholds in trust for humanity its common heritage and itscommon concerns: the environment; the resources of thesea and of the seabed; the climate; the rights of futuregenerations; and the safeguarding of the rights of peoplesin situations of complete breakdown of the organs of theState. We believe that we hold these in trust forhumanity  and an enhanced and redefined TrusteeshipCouncil can be the right organ for this purpose.The challenges of the present times demand that welook at the United Nations system with innovative eyes.We cannot aspire to a new world order and yet persist inviewing the institutional mechanisms of the UnitedNations through the same cold-war lenses  which are illfocused for our times and now shattered by the course ofhistory. We need to view the United Nations as acomplex adaptive system  a system which  withoutrenouncing its original ideals and basic principles responds adequately and promptly to contemporary needs a proactive United Nations rather than a reactive one  aUnited Nations which moulds a new mentality apart fromironing creases and mending tears in the fabric ofinternational relations.The challenge today is not a physical dividing wall.This generation can one day look back with pride at whatit has achieved. The recent ceremonies marking thedeparture of foreign troops stationed in Germany is areminder of how significantly different political realitiesare today from the days when the Berlin Wall cut acrossa city  a nation and a continent with the same callousnesswith which it cut across the soul and spirit of Europe.13Equally breathtaking was the transition from a SouthAfrica built on the bastion of apartheid to a democraticSouth Africa which cherishes the dignity of all of itscitizens.The walls of division are also being dismantled in theMiddle East  where political determination and goodwillcan and should ensure the full enjoyment of sovereigntyand political rights for all peoples living in the region.However  there are many other situations at which weshall some day look back in anger. The challenge to ourpolitical will today is the tragedy of the children in Bosniaand Herzegovina  the rotting  butchered bodies floating inthe rivers of Rwanda  the millions of refugees with theirlives wasted in never-ending waiting  the other millions ofdepressed and oppressed living an existence withoutdignity.1995 is a year of challenge. It is the year of theWorld Summit for Social Development and of the FourthWorld Conference on Women  the next two links in thetriad begun with the recent International Conference onPopulation and Development at Cairo. Three Conferenceswhich  with Habitat II  require a global approach focusedon development rather than on the promotion of hiddenagendas which are irrelevant in the resolution of essentialissues - essential issues which represent a billion peopleliving in abject poverty  half of whom go to bed hungryevery day.There is a poverty curtain which continues to create agreat divide and which becomes more impenetrable whenwe wilfully shut our eyes to the concept of solidarity.Empowerment becomes a mere cliché if it fails to ensure alife in dignity for this ocean of humanity denied of its mostbasic right to life  liberty and security of person.In issuing declarations we do well to underline ourcommitment to eradicating the root causes that generate somuch misery  anguish and pain. We do even better whenwe make firm commitments on assistance to States whichrequire our solidarity  States in need that require us tomatch our words with deeds.Solidarity means reaching out rather than holding out.Solidarity is the building block of greater security to ensurethe livelihood and dignity of millions. Solidarity is a keyfactor in the promotion of development in the lives andminds of men  and hence in the complex relations thatguide the international community.Our legacy to future generations would be a poorone if development and solidarity were not matched bycompliance with international standards of human rights.The importance of the rule of law and democracy requiresthat the international community safeguard human rights.Denial of liberty is the refusal of that oxygen that enablesa developed community to live in harmony with itself andothers. The challenge of the twenty-first century is notliberty in the abstract: it is the responsibility of theUnited Nations to be an instrument in forging principlesinto concrete action.A second-generation United Nations facing thechallenge of solidarity must serve as a guidepost tohumanity in its long walk towards peace in freedom."
"115",4712,"MMR",49,1994,"The delegation of Myanmarwould like to congratulate you most warmly  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and to assure you of our fullest cooperationin the discharge of your responsibilities. We areconfident that the wealth of experience and wisdom thatyou bring with you will prove invaluable in guiding ussuccessfully through the present session.We also wish to express our appreciation to theoutgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Samuel RudolphInsanally  for his sagacious and outstanding stewardshipof the previous session of the General Assembly.In South Africa  four decades of the despicablesystem of apartheid have finally been laid to rest. Theelection of President Nelson Mandela by the country'sfirst multiracial Parliament has given birth to a united democratic and non-racial South Africa. A nation thathas so courageously overcome such adversity andoverwhelming pressure deserves our support and acclaimas it faces its future with optimism. I am pleased to seethe delegation of South Africa rejoining us in thisAssembly. Its presence here reflects the momentouschanges taking place in the world today. The concertedeffort to abolish apartheid in South Africa has finallysucceeded. We welcome our brothers from South Africa wish them every success in rebuilding their nation andlook forward to working closely with their Governmentand people.The importance of adhering to the five principles ofpeace coexistence that form the basic tenets of Myanmar'sforeign policy bears reiteration. Myanmar  together withthe People's Republic of China and India  enunciatedthose principles nearly five decades ago. These time-tested principles have crystallized as the universallyaccepted legal norms of inter-State relations. In strictobservance of these principles  Myanmar has neverallowed  and will never allow  its territory to be used asa springboard for action or threats against another State.By the same token  Myanmar expects that other nationswill likewise abide by these principles in their conduct ofpolicy towards Myanmar.At this time of dramatic and profound changes  theUnited Nations represents the best hope for mankind inthe maintenance of international peace and security and inthe promotion of international cooperation in other areasof human endeavour. Whatever character and shape theemerging new international order may eventually assume we have no doubt that the United Nations will constitute6a vital element in that new order and will continue to playan increasingly important role in international relations. Aswe approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations it is the appropriate time for us to rededicate ourselves tothe purposes and principles of the Charter and to redoubleour efforts to further strengthen the role of the worldOrganization. In order to mark this auspicious anniversaryin a fitting manner  we have formed a high-level NationalCommittee in my country to carry out necessarypreparatory work and to coordinate commemorativeactivities at the national level.Myanmar firmly believes that the United Nations playsa pivotal role in promoting international cooperation fordevelopment and for the maintenance of peace and security.There is a close link between peace and development; it istherefore the view of my delegation that the Agenda forPeace and the Agenda for Development must go hand inhand. Now that the cold war is over and the avenues forpeace and development are more pronounced  we wouldlike to call upon the international community to create afavourable environment that ensures sustainabledevelopment.My delegation shares the view that at the present timethe search for security and peace in the world lies indevelopment  not in armaments. For most peoplethroughout the world  and particularly in developingcountries  any feeling of insecurity arises more out ofanxieties about daily subsistence than out of the dread of acataclysmic global conflict. Underdevelopment createspoverty  hunger  malnutrition  environmental degradationand so on  collectively leading to civil strife  ethnicconflicts and  eventually  the collapse of peace and security.These problems may in some instances be confined withinnational borders; however  some will definitely haveinternational and even global ramifications andconsequences.Both “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda forDevelopment” are top-priority tasks facing the UnitedNations  and they deserve equal attention and equalallocation of resources. United Nations peace-keepingmissions are stretched out across the globe  and UnitedNations agencies for development and humanitarian affairsfan out over an even wider area. Myanmar shares the viewthat economic and social developments are prerequisites forlasting peace and security. We would therefore like to seea strengthening of the Economic and Social Council intandem with the call for a restructuring of the SecurityCouncil to respond adequately to the new challenges ofinternational peace and security that have emerged in thewake of the cold war. Fifty years ago  against a politicalbackground that was very different from today's  theUnited Nations was born with the purposes of maintaininginternational peace and security  promoting developmentand safeguarding human rights. Now that the cold war isover and the international community is free from thesuper-Power rivalry that so crippled the United Nations inthe past  the Organization should be restructured to meetthe needs and challenges of the present-day world.Peace-keeping is an area in which the UnitedNations is being called to take on increasingresponsibilities. These operations constitute an importantinstrument of the world Organization in the preventionand containment of conflicts and in keeping peace whereit is most needed. Peace-keeping operations have amixed record of successes and some set-backs.Experience and lessons from past operations should becarefully reviewed and re-evaluated to ensure the moreeffective and proper conduct of such operations. It isimperative that United Nations peace-keeping operationsbe carried out only with the consent and willingcooperation of the parties concerned and that all aspectsof such operations strictly conform to the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter. There is also aneed for such operations to be rationalized  streamlinedand made more cost effective.In the field of disarmament we are encouraged bythe positive developments of last year. Intensivenegotiations are now under way in the Geneva-basedConference on Disarmament to achieve a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty. The steadily increasing trust andconfidence between nuclear- and non-nuclear-weaponStates has provided an opportunity for the internationalcommunity to come to grips with the prevention of thevertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.This opportunity should be seized by bringing thenegotiations on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treatyto a successful conclusion in the most expeditious way.The United States has announced its decision to extendthe moratorium for one year until September 1995. Webelieve that such a moratorium  if also observed by othernuclear-weapon States  would create conditions conduciveto the ongoing process of negotiating a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty.The review and extension Conference of the StatesParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) is less than a year away. We are of theview that substantive progress in crucial areas  namely thecomprehensive test-ban treaty  negative security7assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and a ban on theproduction of nuclear fissile material in all its aspects  willcontribute to a successful outcome of the reviewConference. A careful evaluation of the progress achievedin these crucial areas should be made before taking adecision at the review Conference on the further extensionof the Treaty. Myanmar looks forward to working andcooperating with other delegations for the successfuloutcome of the 1995 review and extension Conference.While I am on the subject of the NPT  may I take thisopportunity to inform the Assembly that  as a State Party tothe Treaty  the Myanmar Government has decided to signthe International Atomic Energy Agency SafeguardsAgreement and Protocol. The signing of the Agreementand Protocol will take place in the near future.Myanmar is also actively taking part in the preparatoryprocess for the implementation of the chemical weaponsConvention since becoming an original signatory to it.Like other signatories to the Convention  the ratificationprocess is currently under way in Myanmar.The signature on 4 May 1994 of the agreement toimplement the Israel-Palestine Declaration of Principlesmarks an important milestone towards a lasting peace in theMiddle East. The recent approval by the Israeli Cabinet ofthe transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinians in theareas of culture  youth and sports  international cooperation education  health  social welfare  tourism and finance isanother positive step that will further pave the way to self-rule by the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Wecongratulate the parties concerned for their courage andmutual accommodation. We are also heartened to note thatboth Israel and Jordan are implementing the WashingtonDeclaration signed by both parties in July. It is hoped thatthese initiatives  in the context of both bilateral andmultilateral negotiations  will facilitate and brighten thechances of lasting peace in the Middle East.After years of recession and stagnation the worldeconomy has resumed a modest growth. However  therecovery remains fragile and uneven  and it is in theinterests of both developing and developed countries tostrive for accelerated growth and sustainable development.While a number of developing countries have acted as themain engines of world economic growth  most of them arebeset by a deteriorating economic and social situation.Developed countries are also facing slow growth and highunemployment. In this era of growing globalization andinterdependence  concerted efforts by the world communityare urgently needed to resolve the acute economic andsocial problems.We welcome the Secretary-General's report  “AnAgenda for Development”  as most timely andappropriate. The report has highlighted economic growthas a crucial dimension of development and has singledout a supportive and favourable international economicenvironment for sustained growth. We fully share theview that the advancement of developing countries isbeing hindered by such obstacles as external-debtproblems  declining external resource flows  sharplydeteriorating terms of trade and mounting barriers tomarket access. We hope that the programme of action onthe implementation of the agenda will be agreed upon atthis session.Our aspirations for a new world economic orderwhich is equitable and non-discriminatory have not yetbeen realized. The major challenges of these decades —acceleration of development  alleviation of poverty narrowing the widening gap among countries — need tobe addressed on an urgent basis. We fully support thecall by the Group of 77  the Non-Aligned Movement andthe Assembly for the resumption of the stalled North-South dialogue. A constructive dialogue based oncommon interests and mutual benefits should enhanceinternational economic cooperation for development.We also welcome the successful conclusion of theUruguay Round  although our aspirations were not fullyrealized. We had hoped for an open  equitable andtransparent multilateral trading system which wouldbenefit all countries. We are most concerned with newforms of protectionism  particularly the attempts toimpose social and environmental conditions thatdiscriminate against exports from developing countries.These protectionist measures will adversely affect worldtrade and growth.We are heartened by the Communiqué issuedfollowing the Naples Summit of the Group of Seven which states that the Seven will continue efforts toenhance development assistance  trade and investment indeveloping countries. It states also that the Seven favoura reduction in the stock of debt and an increase inconcessionality for those countries facing specialdifficulties.My delegation notes with appreciation the report ofthe Secretary-General on the status and role ofcooperatives in the light of new economic and social8trends and welcomes the recommendations containedtherein. Today  cooperative societies constitute significantcomponents of the economies of developed and developingcountries alike and play a crucial role in their economicdevelopment.In my country  we attach great importance to thecooperative sector as one of the main pillars of oureconomy and as an effective means of acceleratingsocio-economic development. It is an important part of theeconomic strategy of the Myanmar Government to promoteand expand the cooperative sector in our national economy.As we shall next year be celebrating the centenary of theestablishment of the International Cooperative Alliance  itis most fitting that the Assembly should proclaim the firstSaturday of July 1995 the International Day of Cooperativesand that Member States should observe this day in futureyears as an annual event.The Earth Summit held in Rio two years ago firmlyplaced environmental issues on the global agenda  and sincethen hardly any international meeting has taken placewithout calls for common action to save our planet. Theprotection and promotion of the environment has emergedas one of the most pressing issues facing the world. Nolonger is the natural world perceived as a vast andinexhaustible frontier to be explored and exploited. Todaythere is growing recognition that the environment is not tobe subjugated  but is to be treated with respect and care.An increasing number of countries now recognize thatenvironmental issues warrant as much attention and effortas issues such as disarmament  narcotics and human rights.Myanmar is pleased to note that  in all of this  theregion of Asia and the Pacific has not been left behind. Aregional meeting to prepare for the 1995 report on the stateof the environment was held in Yangon in July this year.This meeting provided senior Government officials with anopportunity to discuss  in an integrated manner  issuesrelated to the assessment of the state of the environment atthe national and regional levels.The region of Asia and the Pacific comprises a largenumber of nations differing in size  resource endowmentand stage of economic development. It is a region facingall the conceivable environmental problems of the world -deforestation  desertification  climate change  and so on.While several countries of the region  particularly those inSouth-East and North-East Asia  have registered remarkableeconomic growth in the last few decades; others have yetto achieve their objectives.In many of our countries the eradication of povertyand greater equity in income distribution remain majorchallenges. Poverty and environmental degradation areclosely related. Therefore  the alleviation of poverty is nolonger simply a moral issue; it is a practical imperative.At the same time  achieving sustainable development willrequire that all countries  particularly the developedcountries  change their consumption patterns.In the past we have tended to focus more onremedial measures than on the causes of environmentaldegradation. But if we are to overcome the challengesthat we face we must deal with the underlying causes.As in the case of health care  prevention is just asimportant as  if not more important than  cure. We musttherefore formulate strategies that will set out to alleviatepoverty and provide the basic needs — food  water clothing  shelter  energy and health care — of ourpeoples  while protecting the environment.Aware of the fact that poverty is the fundamentalcause of environmental degradation  we in Myanmar areconcentrating on breaking the vicious circle of povertyand environmental degradation. With a view toremedying the situation  the Government launched in1989 a programme for the development of border areasand national races. This integrated approach is expectedto generate higher incomes and productivity by providingemployment opportunities and increased welfare.The border areas  which are inhabited by the nationalraces  have lagged far behind in all aspects ofdevelopment  owing mainly to the difficult terrain and thelack of an adequate infrastructure. However  the situationis being improved rapidly. There is extensive building ofroads  bridges  schools  hospitals and reservoirs. TheGovernment’s support for the development of mini-plantsto generate hydroelectric power will result in theprovision of alternative sources of energy  which willenable towns and villages to promote rural industries and at the same time  lessen their dependence on fuel wood.This integrated rural-area-development programmewill not only have positive effects on the socio-economicenvironment but also drastically reduce the area undershifting cultivation. The result will be conservation andthe regeneration of forest resources in the fragilemountain ecosystem.The sustainable management and conservation offorests has long occupied a place of pride in Myanmar’senvironmental efforts. Sustainable production from forest9resources and the conservation of biodiversity are assuredby a forest working plan and a time-tested selective fellingsystem. About 50 per cent of Myanmar’s total land surfaceis still covered by natural forests. Even though the forestarea is about 33 million hectares  the prescribed allowableannual cut is less than 3 million cubic metres for teak andother hardwoods. This volume of commercial extraction issignificantly less than the volume harvested by othercountries in the region.The Government’s current development activities inthe forest sector include the special project for greening thenine driest districts of the country; extension of the areaunder reserved forests; the establishment of newplantations; overall reforestation of the dry zone to providemuch-needed timber and fuel wood for rural communities;and measures to improve the watersheds.Myanmar attaches high importance to populationissues and recognizes the close link between population andsustainable development. We participated in the CairoConference  and we heartily welcome the adoption byconsensus of a non-binding 20-year Programme of Action.Our population-policy focus is on voluntary birth-spacingto promote the health of mother and child. The MyanmarMaternal and Child Welfare Association — a non--governmental organization — is actively carrying out itsassigned task in this field.Much has been accomplished by the United Nations inthe field of human rights. The Organization’s most recentaccomplishment in this area is the appointment byconsensus  at the General Assembly’s last session  of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.The appointment of such an important personage byconsensus testifies to the fact that both the developed andthe developing countries attach importance to the promotionand protection of human rights  in accordance with thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Mydelegation wishes the High Commissioner every success incarrying out his mandate.As a responsible Member of the United Nations andas an unwavering advocate of the values that theOrganization represents  the Union of Myanmar has alwaysupheld and adhered to the basic norms of human rights  asenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. As is confirmedby the Bangkok Declaration  the principles of nationalsovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference ininternal affairs should be respected by all nations  andattempts to use human rights to encroach on theessentially domestic jurisdiction of States should beavoided.In saying this we do not mean that human rightsmay be systematically violated behind the barrier ofnon-interference. We wish to see human rights promotedthrough cooperation and consensus-building  and notthrough the imposition of values that we do not share.We believe that  even as we seek universality ofhuman rights  we must never minimize or forget diversityin historical  cultural and religious backgrounds. We arealso against double standards and the temptation to usehuman rights as a means of achieving political ends.The right to sufficient food  clothing and shelter  theright to a decent quality of life and the right to livepeacefully and in security are often neglected in theclamour for individual rights. At this delicate juncture inour history  when Myanmar is in the midst oftransforming itself to a multi-party democracy with amarket economy  the interests of its 45 million people asa whole must take precedence over the interests of anyindividual. Confrontation and incitement to unrest andinstability have no place when the nation is in the processof reconciliation and reconsolidation.In keeping with the aspirations of all the nationalraces  Myanmar is also at present at the critical stage ofdrafting a firm constitution. My Government wouldcertainly not like to see the present momentum of theconstitutional process and the efforts for nationalreconciliation impeded in any way  nor can it allow areturn to the chaos and anarchy of the incidents of 1988.The Myanmar Government does not condone humanrights abuses. In fact  it is totally against them. We havecooperated fully with the United Nations in every fieldand  in this regard  with the Commission on HumanRights by providing information in connection withcommunications and queries concerning the situation inMyanmar. Not only have we provided information soughtby the Commission  but we have also received theIndependent Experts and the Special Rapporteur appointedby the Commission on Human Rights. The SpecialRapporteur  Mr. Yozo Yokota  was received in 1992 andin 1993. In deference to the United Nations and as agesture of our goodwill and cooperation  we will receivehim again this year.10The Memorandum of Understanding betweenMyanmar and the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) signed on5 November 1993  setting out UNHCR’s role in Myanmar’sborder development projects  is an illustration of our steadycooperation with the United Nations and its subsidiarybodies. It is normal that some issues should arise fromtime to time between neighbouring States. In such cases we always seek peaceful solutions based on mutualgoodwill  respect and understanding. A case in point is thematter of transport and movement of people betweenMyanmar and Bangladesh across our common border.Although some quarters tried to exaggerate the situation byinvoking potential regional destabilization  our twocountries were able to resolve the situation in a spirit ofmutual friendship and understanding resulting in therepatriation so far of nearly 70 000 returnees to theirhearths and homes.At the initiative of the Secretary-General  Myanmardecided to establish a dialogue with the United Nations toexchange views on various issues of common concern. Ishould like briefly to apprise the Assembly of thedevelopments leading to this decision.During his visit to Myanmar in March this year Under-Secretary-General Mr. Rafeeudin Ahmed  ExecutiveSecretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asiaand the Pacific (ESCAP)  delivered a letter and a verbalmessage from the Secretary-General to Secretary I of theState Law and Order Restoration Council. The Secretary-General  in his letter  made constructive remarks in regardto the measures taken by the Myanmar Government andshowed keen interest in the developments in Myanmar particularly the process of national reconciliation and stepstaken in drafting a firm constitution through the NationalConvention. The Secretary-General also expressed hisdesire to establish a dialogue with the Government of theUnion of Myanmar to exchange views on the various issueswith a view to considering how the United Nations couldassist in facilitating continued progress towards theresolution of these issues. Secretary I  in hisacknowledgment  informed the Secretary-General that acommunication would be made on this subject in the nearfuture.While attending the Ministerial Meeting of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations in Bangkok  Itransmitted  through the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofThailand  on 21 July 1994  our initial response to theSecretary-General. Further to this response  the MyanmarGovernment informed the Executive Secretary of ESCAPthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar hadbeen designated to initiate the dialogue proposed by theSecretary-General at a mutually agreeable date and  inthis regard  sought his advice on the modalities ofcarrying out such a dialogue more fruitfully. I am happyto apprise the Assembly through you  Sir  that I had twomeetings earlier this month with Mr. Marrack Goulding Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs of theUnited Nations  and that the dialogue between theMyanmar Government and the United Nations is nowwell under way.The global spread of drug abuse has become a majorinternational concern in recent years. The evilconsequences of illicit drugs transcend borders and thethreat of illicit drugs can be overcome only with effectiveinternational cooperation. We share the view thatconcerted action is needed at the national  subregional regional and global levels.Myanmar has always treated anti-narcotics measuresas a national responsibility. At the national level  theGovernment has adopted comprehensive plans for theeffective implementation of drug-suppression measures.A new law against narcotic drugs and psychotropicsubstances was enacted in 1993  encompassing effectivemeasures against the widening scope of the drug menace.In our national strategies against drugs  a new approachwas launched in 1988  the key concept of which was toalleviate the poverty of the peoples of the border areas byproviding them with a means of alternative income  whileat the same time working to raise their awareness of themagnitude of human misery resulting from drugs. Thisapproach is being carried out as one of the mainobjectives of our master plan for the development of theborder areas and national races. It is evident that themost effective approach to the eradication of poppycultivation would be to implement a comprehensiveprogramme for the social and economic development ofthe national races in the border areas. We have nowestablished a mechanism for coordinating action againstillicit drugs in all their aspects.We have also been coordinating our national effortswith those of our neighbours to ensure a maximumimpact in drug eradication in the region. The MyanmarGovernment has signed agreements with the People’sRepublic of China and the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme (UNDCP)  as well as withThailand and the UNDCP. Bilateral narcotics-suppressionagreements have been signed with Laos and India  and weaim to work out a similar agreement with Bangladesh. In11October 1993  in New York  Myanmar  the People’sRepublic of China  Laos  Thailand and the UNDCP signeda Memorandum of Understanding which would furtherharmonize collective activities aimed at reducing drugtrafficking and production  eliminating poppy cultivationand reducing drug demand and consumption. There havebeen two ministerial conferences at the subregional level inwhich Myanmar has actively participated. Myanmar is aState party to the 1961 Single Convention on NarcoticDrugs and to the 1988 United Nations Convention againstIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and PsychotropicSubstances. Moreover  on 7 June this year Myanmardeposited the instrument of accession to the United NationsConvention on Psychotropic Substances. We are alsocarrying out a series of measures in implementation of therecommendations contained in the Global Programme ofAction adopted at the seventeenth special session of theGeneral Assembly in February 1990.Members of the Myanmar security forces are engagedin a relentless war against drug trafficking. They may notbe wearing blue helmets like the men and women fromdifferent lands serving as guardians of peace under theUnited Nations banner  but the cause for which hundreds ofthem have sacrificed life and limb is no less internationalistand no less worthy. There are those who express doubtabout our commitment to the eradication of narcotics  andI would ask them: “Which country in the world hassacrificed the lives of over 190 soldiers  with an additional350 wounded  in the combat against drug traffickers in amatter of only four weeks?” With this serious dedicationand commitment in the fight against illicit drugs  we inMyanmar are ready and willing to cooperate fully with allour neighbours and the international community forsustained efforts against this scourge.Myanmar is a union of over 100 different nationalraces residing there. Unity among the different nationalraces is essential for the preservation of our independenceand sovereignty as well as for the economic and socialprogress of our country. Since regaining independence in1948  Myanmar unfortunately has had to face internal strifestarted by various armed groups. Because of this  thecountry has suffered immensely and lagged behind ineconomic development in comparison with other nations ofthe region. In these dire circumstances  it is only naturalthat the State Law and Order Restoration Council shouldattach the utmost importance to the preservation ofindependence and the strengthening of unity and nationalsolidarity among all the national races of Myanmar. Sinceit assumed the responsibilities of the State  the State Lawand Order Restoration Council has given priority to theachievement of national reconciliation.Beginning in 1989  less than one year after itassumed responsibility  the Government made overturesto the armed groups to return to the legal fold. SinceApril 1992  the armed forces have suspended militaryoffensives against the armed groups in the interest ofnational reconciliation. Over four decades of internalstrife has not benefited anyone  but has only caused deathand destruction and untold suffering for the people.No one appreciates peace more than a soldier. It istherefore most gratifying that a total of 12 groups havingtrust in the sincerity of the Government’s offer havereturned to the legal fold and are working together withthe Government for the development of their regions.These groups are also being provided with the opportunityto participate in the national political process — theNational Convention — to shape the country’s future.With the Shan State Nationalities Peoples’ LiberationOrganization  which returned to the legal fold on 9October 1994  the armed groups in the reconciliationprocess now number 13. They will be integrated in thesame manner as previous groups that are participating inthe National Convention.To the remaining groups that have yet to return tothe legal fold  the Myanmar Government reiterates its callnot to miss this golden opportunity but to join hands inbuilding a peaceful  democratic and modern union. Gunshave fallen silent in the country as never before in thehistory of modern Myanmar  and these groups shouldlook at the greater interest of the country and work forthe benefit of all the national races  in accordance withthe proclamations they themselves have been making forso long.At this juncture  let me turn to another aspect of theGovernment’s objectives: the drafting of a firm andenduring constitution. Towards this end  a NationalConvention has been meeting since the beginning of lastyear to draft a new constitution. Consensus has alreadybeen reached on the 15 chapter headings for the 104fundamental principles of the State and for the chapterson State  State structure and Head of State.At the resumed session of the National Convention which commenced on 2 September 1994  the Chairman ofthe National Convention Convening Work Committeeelucidated the points relative to the matter of self-administered divisions or self-administered zones in the12Union  and to constituting the legislative  executive andjudicial branches for detailed discussions and deliberationsamong the delegates. As for those who allege that theprocess is moving too slowly  let me ask: Is the worldtoday not full of examples where too much haste has led tochaos and confusion  even to armed conflict and thedisintegration of nations?At the same time  let me assure the Assembly that theState Law and Order Restoration Council has no intentionof unnecessarily prolonging the process or causing delays.However  a balance must be struck between the need toreach consensus among the nearly 700 delegates on veryurgent and vital issues  such as the national races  and thedesire for the process to be completed in timely fashion.Anyone following these deliberations closely will realizethat they lucidly give the lie to the allegations that thedeliberations in the National Convention were orchestratedby the Government.At the same time  I wish to indicate to certainobservers that in our society reaching consensus is moreimportant than debating who is right or wrong or who wonthe debate. We would like the constitution to reflect asmuch as possible the wishes of the national races  while atthe same time we would be most happy if consensus on theremaining chapters could be reached as soon as possible.What the Government has done  and is doing at themoment  is to ensure peace  stability  law and order whilestriving for the economic development of the entire nationso that the transition to democracy will be smooth andtranquil.Today the National Convention is in full session forfurther discussions on the fundamental principles to beenshrined in the new constitution. The very fact that thenew State structure will be a union system is amanifestation of the consensus that has been reached by theConvention. The new Union of Myanmar that is envisagedby the National Convention will be a genuine multi-party democratic State in order to bring the nation modernity unity  stability  peace and harmony. The new constitutionwill have safeguards to guarantee non-disintegration of theUnion  non-disintegration of national solidarity andperpetuation of sovereignty and territorial integrity.As in the case of other modern Constitutions  the threeorgans of government - the legislative  executive andjudicial — will be properly constituted and separated asmuch as possible and will be able to exert reciprocalcontrol with checks and balances among themselves.Among the fundamental principles already laid down independent administration of justice in accordance withthe law  administration of justice in public except whererestricted by law  the right to defence and the right ofappeal will be guaranteed. Furthermore  there will beconstitutional remedies  and the Supreme Court will havethe power to issue writs.Citizens will be able to enjoy the rule of law  whichis the fundamental legal safeguard necessary for ademocratic State. Because of the separation of powersenvisaged in the new constitution  the judiciary will bethe ultimate guardian of fundamental rights. Freedom ofthought  freedom of expression  freedom of belief freedom of worship  freedom to seek a livelihood andfreedom of organization will be guaranteed. There willbe equality of status  equality of opportunity and equalitybefore the law.The entire Myanmar nation is currently engaged inour national endeavour to establish a truly democratic andmodern society in accordance with the aspirations of ourpeople. We the people of the Union of Myanmar aredoing our utmost to advance the ongoing political andconstitutional process and the current programme ofnational economic development in the interest of all ournational brethren.We have a popular saying in Myanmar:“As we sow in our deeds  so shall we surelyreap in our future destiny.”We are therefore fully confident that  with continueddedication  determination and diligence in our nationalendeavour  we will surely be able to successfully establisha democratic society based on the universal values ofjustice  liberty and equality."
"116",4769,"MNG",49,1994,"May I offer you Sir  our sincere congratulations on your election to thehigh post of President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. We are confident that under yourable guidance the General Assembly will make significantprogress on the important issues before it.We express our deep gratitude to AmbassadorSamuel Insanally of Guyana for his admirable workduring his presidency.At the outset  I wish to extend our heartfeltfelicitations to the Republic of South Africa  which hasbegun its advancement along the road of democracy bydismantling the apartheid regime of racial discriminationand has assumed its rightful place in the community ofnations. This historic event testifies to the fact that thepurposes and principles that guide the United Nations including that of respect for human rights  can betranslated into reality.A number of other meaningful positive developmentshave taken place on the international scene over the lastyear  events that are inextricably linked to the tortuousemergence of a new atmosphere in the wake of the coldwar. None the less  instability continues to plaguevarious corners of the globe  bearing witness to theextreme difficulty of finding solutions to problems; hencethe urgent need to harmonize our efforts and enhance therole of the United Nations.The international community is on the threshold ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. As part ofthe world-wide preparations for this event  a committeehas been established in Mongolia to coordinate nationalactivities. The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationscoincides with the demise of the cold war  the advent ofa new era of mutual trust and partnership among nationsand the emergence of unprecedented opportunities toimplement the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter. This anniversary will serve as animportant moment of reflection on the Organization’s4past  the lessons from both its successes and its failures andthe tasks ahead of us. The world community expects theanniversary session next year to be crowned by theadoption at the summit level of a visionary documentembodying its hopes and aspirations and outliningmeaningful objectives for the new millennium. It is againstthis background that we see the special significance of thissession of the General Assembly  which is to lay a soundfoundation for the anniversary.The Secretary-General’s report entitled “An Agendafor Development” is a highlight of this session of theGeneral Assembly. My delegation expresses itsappreciation to the Secretary-General for producing athought-provoking report which offers a comprehensiveapproach to development and innovative ideas forconsideration. We hope that the upcoming discussion ofthat report will help in the search for an adequate responseto persistent inequalities and imbalances  as well as ways tocombat the abject poverty  external debt burden andenvironmental degradation that negatively affect thedeveloping countries.“An Agenda for Development” is expected to promotepeople-centred sustainable development through  inter alia a meaningful North-South partnership. In this connection it would be advisable that the targets of earmarking 0.7 percent of the industrialized countries’ gross national product(GNP) for official development assistance and allocating 20per cent of that assistance for human priority concerns bereflected in that “Agenda”. We also wish to see includedin the “Agenda” the idea of allocating 20 per cent of thebudget of the developing countries for the aforementionedpurpose. An active South-South cooperation is of vitalimportance for the sustainable development and self-reliance of the developing countries. In this regard theestablishment of the South Centre will have a significantbearing on the strengthening of the foundations of suchcooperation.The problems facing the countries in transition and theneed for international cooperation to overcome them havefound  in our view  a proper reflection in the “Agenda”. Inorder to ensure the success of transition  which has a directbearing on the future of world developments  it is only fairthat greater attention be given to enhancing theeffectiveness of international cooperation towards that end.Furthermore  this cooperation should be tailored to theyspecific conditions of countries in transition. In the caseof Mongolia  aside from such handicaps as a low level ofdevelopment and a disadvantageous geographical location our economy  in fact  finds itself dependent on anothercrisis-stricken country in transition.We believe that the time has come to make everyeffort to resolve the external debt problem of developingcountries  taking into account the vital interests of theirsocio-economic development and the urgent need to laythe foundation for equitable economic cooperation. Onthe other hand  it is incumbent upon the creditor nationsto display the political will to deal resolutely with thatintractable problem. One might add that the realisticassessment of the underlying political and economiccauses of the multiplying debt burden should be borne inmind in addressing this issue.The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Roundand the ensuing decision to create the World TradeOrganization represent an important step towards a fairertrading system.We hope that the entry into force of the Conventionon the Law of the Sea will facilitate the solution ofproblems confronting  above all  the least developed  land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States.The post-Rio period has registered a welcome shifttowards the broadening of international cooperation inaddressing environmental issues. Nevertheless  we haveto admit that there is a significant disparity between theimportance that the international community attaches tothis problem and the actual results of the work done inprotecting the environment and halting the ecologicalcrisis and remedying its consequences. In this regard  Iwish to emphasize that commitments  especially thoserelated to the flow of financial resources and the transferof technology  have to be faithfully honoured.As a country exposed to drought and desertification Mongolia welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on and the signing of  the international Convention to combatdesertification.The convening of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen next year is a clearmanifestation of the fact that social issues are beingbrought to the centre of the international agenda. Wetrust that the Summit will serve as a powerful engine formarshalling political will at the highest level and willbring about a viable action programme to effectivelyaddress social challenges. This Summit  taken togetherwith the recent International Conference on Population5and Development and the future conferences on women andon human settlements constitute an intertwined continuousprocess of international consensus building.Mongolia is advancing along the road of reforms relying on the active support of the donor community andof international organizations. The International MonetaryFund-supported enhanced structural adjustment facilityprogramme is in its second year of implementation. Thereis a positive trend towards checking economic decline andinflation and stabilizing the national currency. The role ofthe private sector in the national economy is growingconsiderably. Relying on the experience of the years oftransition  we are on our way to finding effective ways andmeans for the State-governed economy. A great deal hasbeen accomplished in laying down the legal foundations forsocietal life.Yet underlying problems continue to persist. At times we face a situation in which one problem succeeds another.The fuel and energy sector is in a critical state. The livingstandards of the population continue to decline; poverty andunemployment are on the rise. There is a severe shortageof internal financial resources.In order to make substantive progress in overcomingthese and other difficulties  foreign aid will continue to playa decisive role for some time to come. In this respect  weare looking forward to the fourth donor meeting to be heldin Tokyo this November. As hardships seem to persist  thepractice of holding regular donor meetings under theauspices of Japan and the World Bank remains essential.We trust that we will receive support and understandingfrom the parties concerned.However  this is not to say that we are pursuing alopsided approach to overcoming the crisis andimplementing structural economic adjustments  relyingsolely on outside assistance and ideas. It goes withoutsaying that the only way  eventually  is in the developmentof equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation.Proceeding from this premise  we endeavour to attractforeign investment  including private investment  and tocreate the necessary legal  economic and other conditions.For any State  and for small States in particular  peaceand stability in their respective regions are of vitalimportance. By and large  positive trends are prevailing inour region  despite the continued existence of hotbeds ofconflict and tension. An important factor contributing tothese trends is the development of Russian-Chineserelations and cooperation within the framework of friendlypartnership. Mongolia welcomes the recent agreementbetween Russia and China not to target each other withstrategic nuclear missiles; we see this as a developmentthat augurs well for stability and confidence-building inthe region and beyond. The maintenance of good-neighbourly relations with these two countries is ofparamount importance to Mongolia  and today theserelations are based on new Treaties on friendly relationsand cooperation.As opposed to the headway made in resolving andpreventing crisis situations in Asia  there seems to be nodiscernible shift for the better on the Korean Peninsula.We hope that the new leadership of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the other partiesconcerned  bearing in mind the international dimensionsof the problem  will display great responsibility inaddressing the problems at hand.The agreement between the Government ofTajikistan and the opposition group on a temporary cease-fire constitutes a first  important step towards nationalreconciliation in Tajikistan  and should be built upon.Last year’s truly historic developments in the MiddleEast paved the way for the positive steps that we arewitnessing today in the efforts to bring peace to theregion  inching towards a comprehensive settlement of theMiddle East conflict.We hope that the United States-Cuba bilateralagreement on the immigration question will prove to havea far-reaching impact on resolving the outstanding issuesbetween these two countries.We commend the peaceful manner in which the goalof restoring democracy in Haiti was achieved.The wars that continue to rage in Bosnia andHerzegovina and in Afghanistan and the tragedies inRwanda and Somalia testify to the highly complex natureof these problems and remind us again that the efforts ofthe international community to resolve them should by nomeans decrease in intensity.Bold steps are needed  particularly by the nuclear-weapon States  to solve the mutually interlinked problemsof the indefinite extension of the non-proliferation Treatyand the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty in1995  as well as credible security assurances for the non-nuclear-weapon States.6It is gratifying to note that the five nuclear-weaponStates supported Mongolia’s declaration of its territory asa nuclear-weapon-free zone and expressed their intention torespect that status. The Non-Aligned Movement has alsowelcomed that initiative as a commendable contribution toregional stability and confidence-building. In an effort tocontribute to the establishment of an effective verificationsystem for the future comprehensive test-ban treaty Mongolia has expressed its interest in being part of theglobal seismic monitoring network. We stand ready tocooperate on this question with the interested parties.The unchecked arms trade and its increase to globalproportions  and especially its extension into volatile andunstable regions of the world  is fraught with dangerousconsequences. We believe that it is high time for theUnited Nations to take a close and comprehensive look atthe issue with a view to formulating the legal parameters ofthe conduct of States in this respect.In recent years the role and influence of the Non-Aligned Movement in world politics have grown.Considerable progress has been achieved in implementingthe Jakarta Final Document  which epitomized the newstrategy of the Movement in the post-cold-war era. TheCairo Ministerial Conference  held last June  contributed tothe enhancement of the Movement’s activities. Here  Ishould also like to mention that this Conference emphasizedthe need to augment the Movement’s efforts with a view toadequately responding to common problems facing thedeveloping countries.I wish to make a few more comments on the UnitedNations.In the wake of the cold-war policy that limited thecapacity of the United Nations to implement fully thepurposes and principles of its Charter  new opportunitieshave opened up before the world Organization. All at once the eyes of the world  full of hope and expectation  haveturned to the United Nations. The United Nations hasexerted a great deal of effort  and it can be credited withimpressive accomplishments  especially in the areas ofpeace-keeping and humanitarian assistance. Nevertheless many Member States have voiced their concern over andcriticism of the restructuring of the United Nations andhave stressed the need to ensure a proper balance in itsactivities.We can well understand the justified criticism that ourOrganization is disproportionately preoccupied with peace-keeping and security issues at the expense of its urgentdevelopment agenda. We expect that with deliberationson and the subsequent adoption of the Agenda forDevelopment there will be less grounds for such criticism.The composition of the Security Council and itsmethods of work do not reflect the realities of the time.My delegation hopes that the ongoing deliberations in theWorking Group on this issue will be intensified andsuccessfully concluded by the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly.We commend and support the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in his efforts to enhance theeffectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat. We areconfident that the Secretary-General will persevere in hisreform process  and wish him every success in his futureendeavours.The Mongolian people is approaching an auspiciousevent  which will be observed this coming November —namely  the seventieth anniversary of the proclamation ofthe Republic  which represents an important juncture inrestoring our independence. My people has accomplishedsince then an arduous journey marked by ups and downs.Today we are continuing our reforms in line with ourdemocratic Constitution of 1992.In keeping with its foreign policy concept  Mongoliawill continue to endeavour to make its own contributionto the common cause of developing friendly relations andcooperation between nations and ensuring peace  securityand progress."
"117",4811,"MOZ",49,1994,"Mr. President  on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf  I wish to express my sincere congratulations to you on your unanimous election as President of the United NationsGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We are delighted to see a son of Africa  a distinguished diplomat from Cote d'Ivoire  a country with which Mozambique entertains friendly relations  presiding over our deliberations. I should like to pledge my delegation's cooperation in the discharge of your duties. I am confident that under your able leadership our deliberations will be successful.I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey through you  Mr. President  my utmost appreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally  for the brilliant manner in which he conducted the work of the previous General Assembly session.The Secretary-General of the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  deserves our warmest felicitations for the competent manner in which he has been discharging his duties. The people and the Government of the Republic of Mozambique remain grateful to his untiring efforts and dedication to the cause of peace in my country.Our participation in this forty-ninth session of the General Assembly takes place at a crucial moment for my country. In about three weeks' time the people of Mozambique will cast their ballots in the first multiparty elections scheduled for 27 and 28 October.The electoral campaign was inaugurated on 22 September last. To this end  14 political parties  including two coalitions  are running for parliament and 12 candidates are contesting the presidential elections.The electoral census shows that more than 6.3 million people of an estimated 7.5 million eligible voters have been registered. Given the existing difficulties deriving from 16 years of armed conflict  we believe the number of registered voters is quite significant and encouraging.A code of conduct aimed at ensuring that the electoral process is carried out harmoniously was signed by presidential candidates before the beginning of the campaign. A similar document was also signed by the 14 contesting political parties. Both codes establish specific rules and guidelines which must be observed during the campaign. In these documents  all parties have  inter alia  pledged to commit themselves to abide by and respect fully the results of the general elections  once they are certified to have been free and fair by the United Nations.The forthcoming multiparty general elections represent the culmination of a long and delicate process of implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique  signed in Rome in October 1992. The cantonment and demobilization of forces  including the dissolution of the High Command of the former Mozambican Armed Forces  has been concluded. In addition  the Government has transferred all its military assets and infrastructure to the new army. The formation of the agreed 30 000-strong Mozambican Defense Force (FADM) is also under way. However  owing to logistical and material difficulties facing the execution of this commitment  we will have a single army of only about 10 000 men by the time of the elections.My Government appreciates the fact that a mission of the Security Council has recently visited Mozambique to verify on the ground the status of the implementation of the General Peace Agreement and the performance of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). We took note with satisfaction of the conclusion arrived at by the mission  according to which conditions exists in Mozambique for the holding of free and fair elections  and that the United Nations will immediately endorse the results of these elections  as soon as they are declared free and fair. My Government attaches great importance to the need for ONUMOZ to certify that the signatories of the Rome Agreement have fully respected their commitments regarding the complete demobilization of their forces  so as to ensure a climate free of fear and intimidation during and after the elections.As we move closer to the final stage of the implementation of the General Peace Agreement  the people of Mozambique look forward to a lasting peace and stability under which national unity will be preserved and national reconstruction will be carried on as a matter of priority for the progress and prosperity of our country. That is why my Government and my party  FRELIMO  believe that the winner of the forthcoming elections should be able to form a government which  taking into account the best interests of the nation  will select men and women - irrespective of their political affiliations - with proven qualities of leadership and with a recognized capacity in the management of government affairs who are dedicated to serving the people and preserving peace and stability in the country.As President Chissano stated about 10 days ago  on the opening day of the electoral campaign  the government that will emerge from the forthcoming elections should be one that brings together all Mozambican citizens - a government that should truly serve the nation. He reiterated that  should he win the election  he would be guided by the ideals of reconciliation  dialogue and tolerance among all Mozambicans. That means that his government would seek permanent dialogue with the opposition in order to achieve consensus on the major issues and policies facing our country.We believe that the winner must commit himself to strengthening institutional mechanisms that can ensure an effective participation by the opposition in the decision-making process  particularly within the framework of the Assembly of the Republic. Every guarantee will be extended to the opposition so as to enable it to play a meaningful and active role in the political life of the country.That is our vision of the post-electoral future in Mozambique  a vision that will give high priority to the issue of unity and reconciliation  peace and stability  and rehabilitation and development in our country.In the meantime  it is our strong belief that the international community should encourage and put pressure on the parties to faithfully implement the Rome Agreement and to pre-empt any move aimed at renegotiating the Agreement or undermining its implementation. Pacta sunt servanda. With the elections less than a month away  it is imperative that the signatories to the General Peace Agreement and the international community as a whole do not lose perspective and depart from the legal and political framework of that important peace-making instrument. If we are to witness a successful outcome of the peace process in Mozambique  it is essential that the signatories of the Rome Agreement respect fully their obligations and refrain from raising issues  conditions or preconditions in the implementation of the Agreement. The international community must therefore exert the necessary positive influence over the parties to abide by their commitments under the Rome Agreement.My Government is determined to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. In the course of 19 years of independence  FRELIMO and the Government of Mozambique have always respected their commitments  both at home and at the international level.We have successfully established multiparty democracy in Mozambique; we have successfully embarked on economic reforms; and we have successfully concluded the General Peace Agreement. Today  at this critical juncture  we are once again ready to honour our obligations and responsibilities.Mozambique is emerging from 16 years of a devastating conflict that has deeply rent its economic and social fabric. Therefore  apart from the relentless efforts that the Government has been deploying in honouring its obligations within the framework of the General Peace Agreement  our endeavour is also directed towards the monumental task of national reconstruction. This noble task constitutes a basic component of the whole process towards a lasting peace in Mozambique. Our success in national reconstruction will greatly contribute to the political  economic and social stability of the country.The advent of peace in 1992 paved the way for the Government to fully embark upon the implementation of the economic recovery programme that was launched in early 1987. It is due to this undertaking that in 1993 our gross domestic product increased by 5.6 per cent as a result of a significant growth by basic economic sectors: agriculture  8 per cent; transport and communications  10 per cent; trade  17 per cent; and construction  3 per cent.Likewise  the rate of inflation dropped to 30 per cent in 1993  as compared to 165 per cent in 1987. Economic forecasts show that the conditions are present to reduce even further the inflation rate in the years to come. This is an encouraging trend in the performance of our economy that provides confidence in its continued growth.With regard to investment opportunities  the combination of two years of peace and wide-ranging economic reforms heralds a new era for Mozambican private-sector development. The role of foreign direct investment and other fields of cooperation with the international business community is recognized as being crucial to the success of national reconstruction in Mozambique.Moreover  my Government is engaged in rehabilitating the economic and social infrastructures destroyed by war. The reintegration of demobilized soldiers into civilian life  the resettlement of refugees and displaced persons  and the rehabilitation of socio-economic infrastructures such as roads  bridges  health centres  commercial networks  schools and water supplies are real challenges that will require the special attention of the government that will emerge from the forthcoming elections.In this context  we attach great importance to the ongoing demining process  as it will contribute to the normalization of life throughout the country  particularly to the resumption of agricultural production in the rural areas. This task is both delicate and enormous  bearing in mind the nature of the conflict that ravaged Mozambique and given the size of the territory. We therefore wish to reiterate our appeal to the international community to continue  in the light of General Assembly resolution 48/7 of 19 October 1993  to render its generous assistance in the form of financial  material  technical support and needed expertise for the mine-clearance programme in Mozambique.My delegation welcomes the call for a moratorium on export of land-mines and endorses the appeal contained in the 1994 report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization for the international community to take appropriate measures to limit the production  use and sale of anti-personnel land-mines with a view to achieving their complete ban.Since the last session of the General Assembly  the southern African region has witnessed an unprecedented historical event. My delegation wishes to join the previous speakers in welcoming a free and democratic South Africa back into the family of nations. With the presence of President Mandela in this Assembly Hall this morning  we honour the people of South Africa  all the men and women in southern Africa  and people all over the world who have contributed to the struggle for the elimination of the abominable system of apartheid.The accession to power of a democratically elected Government in South Africa represents the dawning of a new era not only in that sister country but also in the African continent in general. It is our firm expectation to see all the people of South Africa  regardless of their colour or social background  learn how to live together in harmony.The new South Africa represents the end of the policy of destabilization in southern Africa and the setting up of a peaceful environment at the regional level  which will certainly lead to a fruitful cooperation among the States of the region in their quest for progress and economic development.The eradication of the apartheid system in South Africa and the consolidation of multi-party democracy in the countries of the region have paved the way for the establishment of a climate of peace and stability in southern Africa. The countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  in building their community  are pursuing their joint efforts towards common regional security by addressing issues of conflict prevention and conflict resolution. The prospects of lasting peace and stability in southern Africa will allow us the opportunity to redouble our efforts within the SADC region in our search for progress. Furthermore  peace and stability in southern Africa will ensure our participation as equal partners in development cooperation with other regional economic groupings.The present session of the General Assembly provides us with an excellent opportunity for a joint assessment of current international political and socio-economic developments. We note with concern that the end of the cold war has not meant the end of armed conflicts around the world. Indeed  armed conflicts continue to proliferate  especially at the regional level  where they constitute a real threat to international peace and security.In this context  my delegation is particularly concerned by the tragedy and untold suffering which are taking place in the African country of Rwanda. Thousands of innocent people have fallen victim to violence  and as a result thousands more have been forced to leave the country  thus sparking another humanitarian crisis in our conflict-torn continent. We in Mozambique  having experienced a long- lasting conflict  wish to appeal to all parties concerned in Rwanda to settle their differences through dialogue. Only dialogue can bring peace and an end to the tragic situation and human suffering in that martyred country.Peace in Angola cannot be delayed any longer. While we appreciate the role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  and his recent initiatives to bring about a successful outcome at the Lusaka Talks  we still believe that the United Nations should redouble its efforts aimed at putting pressure on UNITA to respect the Bicesse Accords fully and abide by their letter and spirit. My delegation appeals to UNITA to lay down its weapons and seek to achieve its political objectives through dialogue and national reconciliation as a legalized political party.In the light of Security Council resolutions 864 (1993) of 15 September 1993 and 932 (1994) of 30 June 1994  the United Nations has a moral obligation to exhort UNITA to negotiate with the necessary seriousness  and in good faith  and to cooperate with the Government of Angola on an expeditious conclusion of negotiations under way in Lusaka. We further welcome Security Council resolution 945 (1994) of 29 September 1994 which  inter alia  calls upon both parties to honour the commitments already made by them at the Lusaka Peace Talks and urges them to complete their negotiations as soon as possible and to make every necessary effort to have the Lusaka Agreement formally signed before 31 October 1994.In the Middle East  we note with satisfaction the implementation of the peace accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  which have resulted in autonomy for Gaza and Jericho and the return of the PLO leader to his motherland. In the same manner  we believe that the recent Declaration signed by Jordan and Israel is a significant step forward in the relaxation of tensions in the region. The international community should continue to support these developments for the restoration of peace and mutual confidence in the Middle East. We encourage Israel and Syria to continue negotiations in order to conclude an early agreement on issues which for so long have been a source of conflict between the two countries.The question of East Timor continues to be of grave concern to the international community. My Government wishes to express its support for all initiatives for a genuine dialogue conducive to the achievement of self- determination by the people of East Timor.We have been following with keen interest the ongoing debate on the restructuring of the United Nations  in particular the flowing ideas within the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council. We believe that the expansion of the Council must reflect the growing need for justice and a balance of interests among nations and continents  with emphasis on increased permanent membership for developing countries in general and Africa in particular. To this end  we should sofar as possible work during the current session of the General Assembly to achieve consensus on this issue.In our opinion  the adequate representation of developing countries on the Security Council will rectify imbalances deriving from the current composition of this body and ensure its efficiency and legitimacy. Above all  it will confer a democratic nature on the decisions taken by that organ. In this context  my delegation fully subscribes to the African common position on this issue adopted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on 29 September.Since last year's debate on this issue  some countries have been singled out as qualifying for additional permanent membership on the Security Council. This year a number of countries have described Brazil as meeting the requirements for permanent membership in the framework of these reforms. My delegation fully shares that view.The presence of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique offers an opportunity to address the issue of peace-keeping operations. As we have stated on several occasions  peace-keeping forces will succeed only if they strictly adhere to the fundamental principles which guide them and scrupulously respect the terms of reference of the mission for which they have been established.It is our considered position that there is no universal formula for the success of each and every peace-keeping mission. In this connection  we feel that  though we may recognize the basic rules that govern peace-keeping activities  it is important to bear in mind specific situations and concrete agreements that have to be fully observed in each case. In other words  we cannot prescribe the same medicine for every kind of disease. This could be a prescription for death rather than for recovery  a recipe for disaster rather than for success. We believe that it is extremely important for the United Nations always to take into account the need to safeguard the sovereignty of the State concerned. Where there is a Government  even with weak institutions  peace-keeping missions should work in close cooperation and consultation with the local authorities and respect and strengthen those institutions  rather than try to weaken or undermine them.The International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo last month was a landmark in the efforts to control world-wide population growth in favour of sustainable development. The Programme of Action adopted by the Conference responds to the challenges that lie ahead of us. Similarly  the World Summit for Social Development  scheduled to take place in Copenhagen in March 1995  will offer an opportunity to the nations of the world to arrive at common ground on today's pressing issues  such as the social integration of disadvantaged and marginalized segments of the population and the eradication of poverty  especially in the developing countries. The Summit should also emphasize the need to improve the quality of life as an integrated approach to sustainable development  by incorporating health concerns in developmental strategies.Similarly  we look forward to the holding of the World Conference on Women  in Beijing in September next year. It is our expectation that the Beijing Conference will culminate in the adoption of comprehensive strategies and policies in order to address pressing issues affecting women world wide.It is regrettable to note that  four years after the holding of the World Summit for Children  the situation of children world-wide continues to be deplorable and a matter of concern. Amongst them  children in conflict situations deserve our special attention. My country is faced with an adverse environment for children  a legacy of 16 years of devastating war  which  among other things  broke up entire families and left many children orphans or deeply traumatized and without any kind of comfort or family warmth.We therefore welcome resolution 48/157 of 20 December 1993 which  inter alia  requested the Secretary-General to appoint an expert to undertake a comprehensive study of the question of the protection of children affected by armed conflicts. We in Mozambique feel honoured by the Secretary-General's recent nomination of Mrs. Graga Machel to coordinate a working group on such a study.Thirty years have now elapsed since Mozambique embarked on the search for independence and peace. It has been a long and difficult journey. Today we are at a crucial stage in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique and of the holding of multiparty general elections. On behalf of my Government  I would like to seize this occasion to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the international community for the solidarity and support it has extended to our people. It is our firm belief that we will continue to enjoy this support for the consolidation of peace  progress and prosperity in our country."
"118",4856,"MRT",49,1994,"First of all  I should like to extend to you  Sir on behalf of my delegation  my warmest congratulationson your well-deserved election to the presidency of theforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.We are convinced that your outstanding skills andyour vast experience will guarantee the success of thissession. Your country  the sister republic of Côted’Ivoire  has always played an effective and moderatingrole in the search for peace in Africa and throughout theworld.I should like also to express my most sincerecongratulations to your predecessor  Ambassador SamuelInsanally of Guyana  for the competence and skill withwhich he led the work of the previous session.I should like also to express  on behalf of theIslamic Republic of Mauritania  our admiration of andsupport for the unremitting efforts of Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations aimed at enabling our Organization to achieve its goals.Our current session takes place at a time when theinternational community is faced with numerouschallenges. These include a constant deterioration in theterms of trade  the growing disparity between rich andpoor countries  and an increase in hotbeds of tension. Inaddition  many people in the poor countries are beingcrushed under a debt burden that is constantly gettingheavier  with  as a consequence  gloomy prospects for thesocio-economic development of the peoples of thosecountries.Instead of the hoped-for prosperity  what we arewitnessing today are bloody conflicts which are ravaging29entire countries with all their attendant miseries and formsof destruction. Such nefarious developments not onlyundermine all the hard-won achievements of the people ofthose countries  but also afflict them with new types ofsuffering and make them lose any hope they may have hadin enjoying a life of dignity  stability and progress.The international economic situation continues to because for concern for a large number of developingcountries that feel the negative impacts of structuraladjustment programmes  which focus on macroeconomicequilibriums and display a marked degree of suchindifference to the social cost of such adjustments.It should be emphasized that of the 55 countries whichhave implemented those programmes during the 1980-1989period  only 7 have been able to improve their economicsituation. During that same decade  a downward trend inper capita income was noted in 29 countries  while in 13other countries there has been a real deterioration of socialconditions.These crisis elements have been compounded bystagnation and the reduction in public developmentassistance  despite the fact that the .7 per cent objective wassupposed to contribute to the creation of better conditions.It is regrettable to note that the deterioration in theeconomic situation is of such a nature that it may well havea negative effect on the implementation of internationalconventions and programmes  notably those which relate tothe environment  the programme of action for children  andthe programme of action for the advancement andprotection of human rights. Furthermore such deteriorationwill have an adverse effect on the chances for the successof other ongoing negotiations which aim at findingsolutions to problems that threaten the prosperity ofhumankind as a whole.As a matter of fact  the negative effects of theeconomic crisis are too numerous to enumerate andunfortunately  it is the most vulnerable sectors of society such as women  children and the poor that bear the fullbrunt of the situation. If in our time unemployment and ahigh crime rate are widespread phenomena  countries withlimited resources are apt to be more exposed to their effectsthan others. The need to devise a preventive approachwhich would make it possible to face up to these social illsis thus becoming all the more urgent.In this regard  we welcome the forthcoming WorldSummit for Social Development  in Copenhagen  and hopethe summit will result in initiatives that will enabledeveloping countries to make significant advances in theirdevelopment.It has become quite clear that development is thereal guarantor of world peace and that the miserableliving conditions of the overwhelming majority of theinhabitants of our planet make it impossible to achievepeace and stability in our world.Thus we place a great deal of hope in the Secretary-General’s proposed Agenda for Development. Such adocument would deserve our appreciation and shouldobtain widespread support in order for it to become a truetool in promoting economic and social developmenteverywhere.The fragility of the world economic situation shouldnot obscure the successes achieved in several areas ofinternational relations.In this context  we welcome the success of theSecretary-General’s consultations which aimed atresolving the problems posed to certain countries byChapter XI of the 1982 United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea  whose coming into force as of 16November 1994  will mark the beginning of a decisivephase in its evolution.Our country considers that the United NationsConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks should lead to strict and globalresolutions that would put an end to the plundering offishing resources as well as to the anarchy that currentlyprevails in the seas.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has  along withcountries threatened by the phenomenon of desertification made major efforts to conclude a world convention tofight drought and desertification  especially in Africa.While we welcome the positive outcome of thosenegotiations  we do express the hope that the conventionwill be the start of positive action on the part of theinternational community in favour of those countrieswhich have suffered the most.All the results achieved thanks to the efforts of theUnited Nations highlight the focal and vital role withwhich our Organization is entrusted and attest to itsuniversality.30There is no doubt  however  that a reform of thestructures and procedures of the Organization is nownecessary. The decisions already taken to revitalize theEconomic and Social Council will be no more than a deadletter so long as they are not accompanied by the allocationof resources that would make it possible to implement thedevelopment programmes.We should always bear in mind the fact that allconflicts and all the resultant peace-keeping operations which mobilize such vast financial resources  have as theirmain cause the deterioration of the economic and socialconditions of the countries concerned.A rapid overview of our globe and the areas of tensionis enough to prove that underdevelopment and the problemsit causes only fuel such tensions.Advances in the area of democracy and human rightsare  to be sure  the most important achievements theinternational community has seen in recent times.While we commend the progress achieved in these twoareas  we must not lose sight of the fact that democracycannot be confined to the national frameworks of individualStates  but should embrace also international relationsamong nations.This is the reason why we support efforts to expandrepresentation within the Security Council by increasing itsmembership. We hope that such reform will take place inline with the tenets of democratic transparency.Whatever the final formula adopted for the newconfiguration of the Security Council might be  we believeit will be necessary to respect the principle of the co-equality of Member States  and the fact that  according toArticle 24 of the Charter  the Security Council acts onbehalf of those Member States  and must  therefore  reflectthe views and aspirations of the international community inits entirety.The democratic process which was launched in 1986in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania through theestablishment of democratic institutions and theorganization of presidential and parliamentary elections in1992  has been consolidated further with the organizationof elections for municipal councils and for one third of thesenate seats. Those elections  which have elicited extensiveparticipation on the part of voters  have been coveredextensively by the independent national press  followingelectoral campaigns by several political parties whichrepresent various trends of opinion.Thus the Mauritanian people are daily consolidatingthe foundations of their young democracy  which in thewords of the President of the Republic  His ExcellencyMr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya  is the mainspring""of all sovereignty and legality"".It is in this democratic environment that theMauritanian people are waging a determined struggleagainst various aspects of economic and socialunderdevelopment.We should highlight the important gains made byour country through the implementation  in 1984  of aseries of economic reforms  as well as the politicalstability  freedom  justice and equality now enjoyed by allMauritanian citizens.We should also voice the pride of the IslamicRepublic of Mauritania at being one of the fewdeveloping countries where there have been no politicalprisoners  and where freedom of the press  a multi-partysystem  and freedom of trade unions have becomerealities similar to those which States that value the ruleof law  such as the countries with longstandingdemocratic traditions  pride themselves on.The quest for peace will continue to be our mainconcern so that we may rise to the challenges of the endof this century. The end of the cold war has opened upnew vistas for the emergence of a better world wherejustice and peace may prevail. Yet the increasing numberof hotbeds of tension which require the organization ofpeace-keeping operations leads us to believe that a newstyle of diplomacy is becoming a must if we are toprevent the recurrence of human tragedies similar to thosewhich were witnessed in the past or those which we nowexperience and are unable to stop or to resolve.Our country hopes that the recent developmentswhich have been taking place in the Middle East willconstitute the beginnings of a solution to the tragedy ofthe Palestinian people and that  at last  they will be ableto exercise their legitimate right to establish anindependent State. We believe that the Declaration ofPrinciples of 13 September 1993  giving autonomy toGaza - which was followed up by the Cairo agreement of4 May 1994 and most recently  on 25 July 1994  themeeting between His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan andIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin - will usher in a31new era. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania hopes thisinitial success will lead to a just  comprehensive and lastingpeace based on the implementation of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).The United Nations should continue to support peaceefforts in the Middle East until such time as a finalsettlement of the problems still pending in the region isreached. In this connection  we hope the commitmentundertaken by donors at their meeting on 1 October 1993will be translated into concrete action that would revitalizethe economy of Palestine and help solve its economic andsocial problems.In that sensitive region  the after-effects of the Gulfwar continue to make themselves felt. The IslamicRepublic of Mauritania  which has always affirmed itsunswerving support for international legality  has madeclear its total rejection of any violation of fraternalKuwait’s independence or territorial integrity or of therights of its citizens  just as it stands against anything thatmight undermine Iraq’s unity or territorial integrity. Thetime has come to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqipeople.In the same sensitive region  my country wishes torenew its unflagging and total support for the recovery bythe fraternal State of the United Arab Emirates of itslegitimate rights over the islands of Lesser Tumb  GreaterTumb and Abu Moussa.With regard to the Arab Maghreb  we still hope theUnited Nations will be able to eliminate the obstacles whichcontinue to impede the resolution to the Sahara problem.My country will spare no effort in helping the Organizationin the implementation of resolutions relevant to this issue.Our determination stems from our desire to reach a just andlasting solution and to strengthen the process of building aunited Arab Maghreb.We also hope the embargo imposed on the Libyanpeople will be lifted. We are aware that the Libyan ArabJamahiriya has shown tangible proof of its readiness tocooperate with the United Nations and other groups andthat the embargo is affecting the interests of all otherpeoples in the Maghreb.With regard to Africa  I should like to express mycountry’s satisfaction with the peace-keeping operationsapproved by the United Nations with the aim of putting anend to the bloody confrontations in parts of that continent.The Rwandan tragedy  marked by the death of half amillion people in the space of a few weeks  is one of themost horrible ordeals of our era. In this connection  Imust commend the excellent organization of OperationTurquoise  which has been led and meticulously executedby France within the allotted time-frames. The operationwas a model of proper and disinterested humanitarianintervention. My country took part in that noblehumanitarian action that saved tens of thousands ofhuman lives and provided our Rwandan brethren with anopportunity to work together to find a solution to theirproblem. We hope such international efforts will enablethose brethren to heal their wounds and work towards theestablishment of national unity and the rebuilding of theircountry.Unfortunately  Rwanda is not the only place inAfrica where an armed conflict is causing fratricidalstrife. In Somalia  Liberia and Angola  civil warscontinues to rage  despite the tireless efforts of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity to restorepeace and concord in place of hatred and war betweenbrothers. We hope the citizens of those countries willheed the voice of reason and will agree to safeguard theirinterests and the right of their peoples to enjoy peace andsecurity. This objective can be achieved only throughresponsible and constructive dialogue. Experience hasshown that the language of arms cannot lead to validsolutions.In Mozambique we are following with specialinterest the various steps expected to lead to the holdingof elections on the 27th and 28th of October 1994. Wehope those elections will embody the spirit of the peaceagreement concluded in October 1992 and that they willbe conducted under proper conditions of peace andconcord.The human tragedies that have beset the Africancontinent should not blind us to the positive events thathave taken place  such as the triumph of democracy inSouth Africa under the presidency of Nelson Mandela andthe settlement of the conflict between Libya and Chad.We welcome the representatives of South Africa. Theirpresence here among us  representing as it does theculmination of a decades-long struggle by all Africanpeoples  is a source of pride and happiness.On the European continent  which appears to all asthe most fertile ground for democracy and respect forhuman rights  the outright aggression by the Serbs againstthe Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a clear affrontto the human conscience. The efforts of the international32community over two long years have failed to put an endto the Serbian aggression  which has clearly taken the formof ""ethnic cleansing"" vis-à-vis the Muslims. No seriousmilitary effort has been made yet to put an end to thesuffering of the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina who continue to suffer under the embargo that denies themthe arms needed for self-defence. Indeed  it is high timethe United Nations discharged its full responsibilities underthe Charter and used all necessary means  including armedforce  to put an end to that terrible tragedy in line with theprinciples of the Charter and the Organization’sresponsibility to maintain peace.In 1995 we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversaryof our Organization. That commemoration should make itpossible for us to take stock of the progress made over halfa century and to devise better plans and programmes todeal with future problems. Two other events of majorimportance will take place in the same year and will haveto do with the search for solutions to major problems whichare still pending: the World Summit for SocialDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Womenin Beijing. We hope the results of those two meetings willcoalesce with the outcome of the negotiations which aim atreforming the Security Council so that the Organization willbe equipped with the necessary structures that would enableit to deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century.Today more than ever  the peoples of the world aremaking the United Nations the repository of all their hopes and the Organization must ensure the maintenance of peaceand promote cooperation for development at one and thesame time. By so doing our Organization would crystallizehumanity’s aspirations to a world of peace and stability andwould then become a true crucible where all nations joinedtheir efforts to bring forth an era of freedom  democracyand respect for human rights."
"119",4902,"MUS",49,1994,"Let me say atthe outset how pleased I am to see you  Sir  presiding overthe General Assembly at this session. In addition to beinga well-deserved tribute to you personally and to yourcountry  your presidency is a distinct honour and privilegefor Africa. Your task will definitely not be easy but we areconfident that your wisdom and broad experience will helpguide our Organization in discharging its leadership role inworld affairs. I hasten to pledge to you my delegation’sfull cooperation and active participation in the deliberationsahead.Let me take this opportunity to say how welcome theleadership provided by Ambassador Samuel Insanally wasduring the past session. We commend him for the clearvision and diligence with which he steered the work of theOrganization.The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali equally deserves appreciation for having carried out hisresponsibilities with sagacity and serenity despite thecomplex and sensitive nature of the issues that haveretained our attention this past year.It is also my distinct pleasure to associate myselfwith all those who have extended a hearty welcome tonon-racial democratic South Africa within the fold of theAssembly. The end of apartheid in South Africa alsounderscores the end of colonialism on the Africancontinent. However  there still remain a few areas wherethe process is not complete  but I firmly believe that itwill not be long before we can boast of a totally freeworld. In this regard  I should like to say that  withrespect to the question of the return of the ChagosArchipelago to the sovereignty of Mauritius  we havecontinued to pursue a positive dialogue with the UnitedKingdom and that some progress has been registered.The United Nations of today is perceived differentlyfrom what it was less than a decade ago. The fabric ofinternational relations is undergoing profoundtransformation. There is now more latitude and scope forinternational cooperation and partnership than ever beforeand the United Nations is increasingly becoming the focalpoint for such cooperation on a number of fronts. Thenumerous activities in such fields as peace-keeping preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  humanitarian relief election monitoring and supervision undertaken by theOrganization during the past few years indicate that itsleadership and potential to play an active role on theinternational scene have been recognized.But we should all accept the obvious reality that theUnited Nations  despite its potential and goodwill  doesnot have the material capacity nor can it muster thefinancial resources to attend to every potential or actualcrisis situation. While it has become evident thatsolutions to the present-day crises cannot but be evolvedwithin the framework of international cooperation  suchcooperation  however  is still lacking or  where it doesexist  is but lukewarm in substance. That is why  despitethe end of super-Power rivalry which  in theory  shouldhave eased tensions the world over  conflicts and tensionshave continued to flare up. Though the internationalcommunity does mobilize itself  albeit with disastrousdelay at times  to address such situations  peacefulsolutions remain elusive. Is it because our agenda inaddressing these problems is not always the same?Coming from a small island State where our prioritiesremain the economic progress of the country and theconstant improvement of the quality of life of ourcitizens  I harbour the dream that we  leaders of the6international community  can still bequeath to futuregenerations a world which thrives on peace. On the eve ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization can we notpledge and dedicate ourselves to that goal and recommit ourefforts to that end?It has  it seems  become fashionable to questionwhether the United Nations system is well adapted to thenew changing situations that confront us and whether it isequipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.But we often forget that we are the United Nations.My delegation believes that the United Nations  givenits universality  should inevitably continue to have a centraland important role in the universal management of oursociety. But to be able to do this satisfactorily there is anurgent need not only to revitalize the Organization streamlining its agenda  but also to overhaul its structures bringing in more transparency in its internal operations andtaking on board the aspirations of the developing countrieswhich  after all  constitute the majority of our world.In this regard  my delegation welcomes the ongoingdeliberations in the open-ended working group on thequestion of equitable representation on and increase in themembership of the Security Council. It is our hope that thewide spectrum of views expressed so far on this subject though seemingly divergent  would eventually converge tobecome a consensual approach that would render theCouncil more transparent and democratic.The review of the membership of the Council shouldbe such as to make it functionally effective and as widelyrepresentative of the membership of the United Nations.But it should also  I reiterate  be the product of as large aconsensus as possible to preserve its credibility. In thiscontext  while considering an increase in the permanentmembership of the Council  one should not be biased infavour of the economic giants of this world alone. Thedeveloping countries have a legitimate right to berepresented on the permanent slate of the Security Council for our concerns are different from those of theindustrialized and developed countries. The African andLatin American continents should imperatively have theirshare of the responsibility incumbent on the Council. Wehave no doubt that those called upon to represent these twocontinents as permanent members will have significantcontributions to make in the interest of the world at large.While we do not favour too radical a reform  we believethat the decisions of the Council should be arrived at byconsensus rather than through veto power. Such decisionswould obviously be more easily acceptable to theinternational community. However  the present vetosystem should be maintained for some time to come.It is a fact that the United Nations has been playinga more active role in world affairs and has been assuminggreater responsibilities in the fields of peace-keeping andmediation in conflicts in a number of countries. But therestructuring exercise needs to address other levels of ourOrganization as well  so as to embrace the developmentdimension of international relations. In this respect  oneshould not shy away from a possible review of the UnitedNations Charter itself  but the process  we believe  shouldbe gradual and consensual. A strengthened and reformedUnited Nations should be able to contribute positively tothe fulfilment of the vision of its founders.It is opportune here to remind ourselves of what  asfar back as 1945  the then United States Secretary ofState reported to President Truman on the result of theSan Francisco Conference. He said:“The battle of peace has to be fought on two fronts.The first is the security front where victory spellsfreedom from fear. The second is the economic andsocial front where victory means freedom fromwant. Only victory on both fronts can assure theworld of an enduring peace. No provisions that canbe written into the Charter will enable the SecurityCouncil to make the world secure from war if menand women have no security in their homes andjobs.”Almost half a century later  we find an echo of thesame sentiment when our Secretary-General states that“the development imperative is as much a priorityfor the United Nations as the imperative of peace. ...There can be no sustainable development withoutpeace. There can also be no real peace withoutdevelopment.”We fully subscribe to those views and would goeven further to say that international peace and security as well as an equitable and conducive environment andthe redress of the asymmetrical international financial andtrading relations  are necessary prerequisites for thesustainable development of all countries in the world especially the developing ones.In this respect  the plight of Africa is well known tothe world community. The causes of its ills and of itsweaknesses are well documented. While the disease has7been diagnosed  the cure is not yet in sight. Africa needsa new order with a clear vision of hope that will ensure itsgradual integration into the international economic andtrading systems. Its marginalization  deliberate oraccidental  must be stopped and reversed.The issue of human rights continues to be the subjectof varying perception. We believe that human rights areindivisible  and therefore we hold the view that a revisedand reformed United Nations should concentrate equally  ifnot more  on economic  social and cultural rights bypromoting international cooperation for development.May I be allowed here to quote the example ofMauritius? Since the last decade  the rapid strides we havebeen making in the economic field have been accompaniedby consistent progress in the social and cultural fields  aswell as in the strengthening of the democratic framework.Basic rights and freedoms  such as freedom of speech  ofassociation and of movement  and the holding of generalelections at regular intervals of five years with the freeparticipation of political parties and individuals are anintegral part of our culture. Our experience exemplifies thesynthesis that is being achieved through economicdevelopment  which brings dignity to the population; socialdevelopment  for the protection of the weaker sections ofthe population; and the strengthening of all democraticinstitutions  for the evolution of a harmonious society.The report by the Secretary-General entitled “AnAgenda for Development” is therefore timely and will nodoubt place the issue of development in its different aspectsin a prominent place on the international agenda. TheSecretary-General needs to be commended for thisinteresting report  which highlights the multidimensionalnature of development. The report has been furtherenriched by the constructive proposals contained in theMinisterial Declaration of the Group of 77 adopted on 24June 1994 in New York. I commend this Declaration as animportant contribution by the developing world to thedebate on the report.Let our world  both developing and developed  takeadvantage of the new environment. And let us commitourselves to reducing poverty  hunger and illiteracy in theworld; commit ourselves to ensuring a steady andincreasing flow of financial resources  as well as transfer oftechnology  to the developing countries; and commitourselves to comprehensively tackling the debt problem.Only through such commitments and shared responsibilitiesand action in an increasingly interdependent world will it bepossible to stop the further marginalization of a largenumber of developing countries and help integrate themin a just and equitable international economic  financialand trading system.Next year will witness the establishment and settingup of the World Trade Organization  which is expected tocontribute towards the development of an integrated  moreviable and durable multilateral trading system. I take thisopportunity to exhort the members of that organization toadopt positive measures so as to ensure that thedeveloping countries  this time  secure a fair share in theexpected growth of the world.Genuine fears have been voiced by a number ofdeveloping countries  especially small island States  thatare vulnerable to natural disasters and suffer from thedisadvantages of being far from their sources of supply ofraw materials and foodstuffs and the markets for theirexport products. It is feared that the results of theUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) will adversely affect their trade  especiallythe trade preferences from which they benefit in thecontext of contractual agreements entered into with agroup of developed countries  principally with theEuropean Union.My own country stands to be affected both as anexporter and as a net food-importing country. Wetherefore appeal for steps to be taken  as provided for inthe Final Act of the GATT Uruguay Round  to provideadequate compensation for any such loss. I should likehere to stress the need for the preservation of the existingpreferential trade regime of the Lomé Convention of theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific Group and the EuropeanEconomic Community.Any attempt to bring in new issues concerning themultilateral trading system  including the World TradeOrganization  would not be appropriate at this juncture.In this regard  it would serve no useful purpose for thedeveloped and the developing countries to adoptconfrontational positions while dealing with such sensitiveissues as the “social clause and the trade regime” and“trade and the environment”. My country for one willresist the inclusion of any clause that may appear as adisguised protectionist measure.However  I also believe taking as an example myown country  where worker’s rights are protected by theConstitution  that internationally recognized labourstandards and norms and the legitimate rights of workersshould be respected. This is important if man is to be at8the centre of development. The enjoyment of these rights and the observance of labour standards  should beencouraged in all countries  without  of course  losing sightof their respective levels of socio-economic development or the development needs and objectives of developingcountries.I am happy to state  in that context  that myGovernment recently introduced legislation to ensure thatworkers participate in the management of enterprises andbecome shareholders in the sugar sector where they areemployed. This is being done in the context of a newsocial order based on partnership  and it is meant to favourthe democratization of the economy.This leads me to the forthcoming World Summit forSocial Development  the Fourth World Conference onWomen and the United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (Habitat II)  to be held next year. In our view all these conferences are geared towards one simple goal:to better the lot of mankind  and in so doing  to enhancehuman dignity. It is our sincere and cherished hope thatthese summit meetings and conferences will contribute tothe debate on the Agenda for Development and willencourage a better understanding of the nature andcomplexity of the development problems facing thedeveloping world. May these conferences come up withreasonable and concrete proposals  backed by a clearcommitment of resources for their implementation.It is true that the end of the cold war and thedisappearance of ideological conflicts have significantlyaltered the geopolitical configuration of the world. Theyhave modified the nature of international relations  withstrategic economic alliances replacing military ones in aworld still in search of a new order — which thus far hasremained elusive.In such an uncertain and volatile situation  where thesurvival of the fittest and of the most competitive is theorder of the day  small and economically vulnerablecountries need assurances with regard to their security andcontinued economic development and social progress. Inthis respect  renewed attention is being given  in differentparts of the world  to regional cooperation and integration.We believe that the salvation of small and weakeconomies depends on the successful implementation ofregional cooperation and integration programmes. We viewregionalism as an important complement to multilateralism especially when open regionalism does not lead toexclusiveness. I therefore appeal to the internationalcommunity to fully support the successful implementationof regional cooperation and integration programmes especially the nascent ones in Africa.In our own region  organizations such as the IndianOcean Commission  the Preferential Trade Area forEastern and Southern African States and the SouthernAfrican Development Community are useful vehicles foreconomic cooperation and integration among membercountries and help to strengthen our economies.Political stability  good governance  respect for basichuman rights and freedoms are prerequisites to economicdevelopment. It is therefore the duty of the internationalcommunity to ensure movement in that direction. Wehave  however  failed by not responding quickly enoughto the agony of Rwanda  and  as the Secretary-Generalhas stated  we have acquiesced in the continued loss oflives. The serious plight of hundreds of thousands ofrefugees from Rwanda remains a major source ofconcern. We should redouble efforts and commitourselves to urgently addressing such human catastrophesof epic proportions  which  if left unattended or if tackledtimidly  may very well spill over into neighbouringcountries of the region and affect them adversely.I had the opportunity to state my country’s positionon this issue at the recent Organization of African Unity(OAU) Summit in Tunis  where I warned that Burundiwas sitting on a powder keg that risked explosion unlessthe international community acted in earnest to containthe problem. Though the situation has eased to a certainextent  due mainly to Operation Turquoise and to thecommitment of troops from OAU member States  theregion still remains fragile. Countries which have theresources must come to the fore and fully assume theirresponsibility to prevent a recurrence of this tragicepisode.My country  for its part  besides its interventions ininternational forums and its modest contributions in cashand in kind  played host to the dialogue between thePresident of Zaire and the President of Rwanda  whichculminated in the signature of an accord with respect mainly  to the refugee situation.I should like to use the opportunity of speakingbefore this forum to appeal to my brothers in Angola Liberia and Somalia and elsewhere in Africa  wherepockets of tension exist that can flare up into unnecessaryconflicts  to apply peaceful means to resolve and iron outtheir differences.9It would be fitting here to flag Mozambique as anexample where dialogue has prevailed over armed struggle and where  in a few days’ time  the people will beexercising their freedom of choice to elect those they wishto govern the country. Similarly  it is a matter ofsatisfaction that the constitutional problem in Lesotho hasbeen resolved peacefully and through constant dialogue. Inthat respect  I should like to commend the efforts deployedby my brothers  Presidents Mugabe  Masire and Mandela.I wish the same fervour could be demonstrated byothers who are active in the Bosnia and Herzegovinaconflict  where countless lives continue to be lost  wherehuman suffering has crossed the limits of endurance  wherethe population seems to have resigned itself to a fateimposed upon it by the warring factions. Are we notresponsible enough  human enough  to resolve the problemsbesetting that region  the more so as conflicts like thosewhich have plagued Northern Ireland and the Middle Eastover decades  and which appeared unsolvable  are beingaddressed resolutely  and with positive results?Indeed  the positive developments in the Middle Eastmark a turning point in the inter-State relationships in thatregion and augur well for peace and stability. It is myfervent wish that the spirit of moderation and compromisethat has made it possible for positive results to be achievedin the ongoing negotiations will continue to prevail andhelps open other avenues for peace to be restored in theentire region.Let us  leaders of the world  on the eve of the fiftiethyear of our Organization’s existence  take inspiration fromthe positive trends that have emerged in the Middle East from the successful transition in South Africa as a result ofpeaceful negotiations  and commit ourselves to resolvingconflictual situations — historical as well as current —through dialogue. In this regard  let me make an earnestappeal to Pakistan and to India  countries equally dear andnear to us  not to internationalize their differences but toaddress them bilaterally through peaceful means. Weshould like to encourage both Governments to resume theirdialogue in a spirit of trust and compromise  in the higherinterests of their countries and peoples  and indeed in theinterest of the entire region.I am gratified to learn that in Sri Lanka  following theinstallation of the new Government  a dialogue has beeninitiated between the parties in conflict. This is indeed acommendable move.Such positive efforts can only be beneficial to theinternational community  for the peace dividends that willthus ensue will permit the world to tackle  with undividedattention  the agenda of economic and social development in order to make the world a safer place in which to live.That is why we continue to hope for speedy positivedevelopments in such places as Fiji  where equality ofcitizenship is yet to prevail.Another issue that remains a major preoccupation ofmy country is the question of disarmament. Next year the Conference to review the Non-Proliferation Treaty(NPT) will take place. Mauritius has made its positionamply clear on this issue. Any extension of the NPTshould be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament andthe achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty  aswell as the establishment of a negotiating frameworkwithin which the discriminatory nature of the Treatyshould be examined. We have stated in no uncertainterms that the world cannot be divided permanently intocountries permitted to have nuclear weapons and countriesnot permitted to have them. A treaty perceived asmaking such a decision permanent is bound to fail andcannot be expected to last.Without the convincing support of the NPTmembers  we may fail in our endeavours to make theworld nuclear-weapon-free. The recent dispute betweena Member State of the Treaty and the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency clearly indicates that the NPT isnot infallible. Equally alarming is the trading in enricheduranium and plutonium  in stark contradiction of theobjectives of the Treaty. As long as there are nuclear-weapon States  there will be an urge for other States withnuclear potential to acquire such weapon-grade material thus putting the world community in jeopardy.Mauritius would like at this point to welcome theefforts for the conclusion of a treaty to make all ofAfrica  a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It is our earnesthope that the exclusive club of nuclear-haves  principallythe permanent members of the Security Council  will doeverything to permit the emergence of such a zone andthe conclusion of the treaty.10(spoke in French)As Acting President of the Conference of Heads ofState or Government of French-speaking countries  I shouldlike to say a few words in the French language  whichbrings together this community of dialogue and cooperationnumbering 47 countries with more than 400 millioninhabitants. Since 1986  the highest officials of thesecountries  which are found on the five continents  have beenregularly holding summit meetings to review thoseproblems that affect the francophone world and seektogether for solutions to global problems.My country thus had the honour of hosting the FifthSummit of the Francophone World last October. It mayseem surprising to some that a country member of theCommonwealth whose official language is English shouldhave been selected to host such a Summit and thus tobecome the spokesman of the francophone group for a two-year period. In fact  for us Mauritians  this is in no wayunusual  since we live with our cultural and linguisticdiversity in perfect harmony. Indeed  Mauritian culture isthe result of a synthesis worked out through history. Welive in a society that integrates the linguistic  religious andsocial contributions of Europe  Africa and Asia. The themeof “Unity in Diversity”  which inspired the work of thatSummit  is very dear to our country. All the segments ofthe Mauritian nation participate in creating a nationalidentity while preserving their ancestral cultures. Thismessage of unity in diversity  based on the recognition ofdifference and on human solidarity  is even more relevantin the difficult and complex situation in today’s world.The Heads of State or Government wish thefrancophone world to cooperate more closely with regionaland international organizations that are working fordemocracy  peace and the development of the world — firstand foremost  of course  is the United Nations. We haveadopted a series of resolutions to promote this newpartnership. It is  moreover  in this context that we had thepleasure of welcoming the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  toMauritius. During the Summit  we were able to intensifya dialogue that we have been maintaining since then byvarious means. However  we hardly had time to acquirethe means to implement our own resolutions when eventsbegan to move rapidly in the francophone world.Indeed  on the day following the Mauritius Summit our brother Melchoir Ndadaye  President of Burundi  wasbrutally assassinated. The Organization of African Unityand the United Nations were immediately notified. Thenthe situation deteriorated in Rwanda  and once again wenotified these two international forums. Given the lack ofaction during the first few days  we welcomed France’sintervention for strictly humanitarian purposes  whichallowed numerous lives to be saved.In addition to their concern regarding the GreatLakes region  the countries of the francophone world aredeeply moved about the situation in Haiti. We have beenfollowing developments in that country very closely  andwe were gratified to note that positive steps have beentaken towards re-establishing democracy. We areawaiting with great impatience  and in the interest of theHaitian people  the return of legitimate power to thiscountry  a country that has suffered so much in the courseof its recent history.The francophone world  for its part  has adoptednumerous resolutions aimed at securing for theFrancophone community a more dynamic presenceinternationally. It will thus be able to make acontribution in the specific fields of its competence. Ishould like  in particular  to cite a resolution endorsingthe Secretary-General’s report  which is rightly entitled“An Agenda for Development”. This resolution spells outthose themes which the francophone world would like tosee taken into consideration in the agenda and which willbe put forward by our representatives within the UnitedNations during the preparatory stages.At the Rio de Janeiro Summit  later in Vienna  thenin Barbados and in Cairo  and tomorrow in Copenhagenand in Beijing  the countries of the francophone world areconsulting on the major problems the United Nations hasinscribed on its agenda. This is being done to arrive atcommon positions for meeting the great challenges ofdevelopment.Such concerted action is essential for the harmoniousdevelopment of our world at the dawn of the thirdmillennium; hence we are called upon to make a specificcontribution to illustrate that spirit of humanism thatmotivates the francophone world.The Mauritius Summit succeeded in situating thefrancophone world in a more political and morediplomatic context. The francophone world has anoriginal and positive message to spread through the world a message of liberty  solidarity and sharing. I am mostpleased to have conveyed it to you."
"120",4939,"MWI",49,1994,"I congratulate you  Sir on your election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its forty-ninth session. Malawi is proud of you and ofyour country  Côte d’Ivoire  as you represent Africa in thatvery important post. I have every confidence that you willguide the deliberations of the Assembly to a successfulconclusion.I join other delegations in paying tribute to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally ofGuyana. Mr. Insanally fulfilled his mandate very wellindeed  despite the many difficult tasks the United Nationshad to carry out during the past year. My delegationwishes Ambassador Insanally well in his future endeavours.The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has once again demonstrated that he is the right man tolead our Organization as it continues to assume greaterresponsibilities  particularly in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. The Secretary-Generalhas ably led the Organization in responding mostpositively to the many conflict situations that beset theworld today. My Government lends its support to hisconsiderable efforts aimed at assuring international peaceand security and at promoting economic and socialdevelopment around the world. We wish him all the bestin carrying out his arduous tasks.As I address the Assembly today  30 years after theonly time my predecessor did so  I bring with me amessage of renewed hope and friendship from the peopleof a newly democratic Republic of Malawi to all thepeoples of all the States represented here this morning.Freed from fears of itself  Malawi courageously embracesthe rest of the family of nations; freed from self-imposedisolation  Malawi stands ready to engage actively inefforts to find international solutions to the problems ofour times.Everyone here today will be fully aware of thepolitical changes that have taken place in my countryduring the past two years. The one-party dictatorship thathad ruled Malawi for 30 years came to an ignoble end bythe will of the people. In the historic elections held on 17May this year  the people of Malawi threw out anoppressive Government that had for so long trampledupon their human rights and fundamental freedoms withimpunity  through arbitrary arrests  detentions without trial and torture  a Government that brutally suppressed allpolitical dissent and denied its people any form of freedomof expression and association. In so doing  it sought to robits people of the very essence of a human being: the abilityto think. The people of Malawi rejoin the family of nationstoday as a free people.Let me assure the Assembly that the Malawian peopleshall never allow any form of dictatorship to rear its uglyhead on their soil again.The national referendum held in June 1993 and thepresidential and parliamentary elections held in May thisyear took place in a peaceful manner  and have both beendeclared by the international community to have been freeand fair. This outcome was a clear manifestation of theardent desire of the people of Malawi to see changebrought about in their country: positive change  wherehuman rights and fundamental freedoms are enjoyed andrespected by all  individually and collectively.The changes in Malawi resulted also from theconcerted efforts and assistance of the internationalcommunity. On behalf of the Government and the peopleof Malawi  I wish particularly to thank the United Nationsfor its special role in the process of reform anddemocratization in Malawi. The Electoral AssistanceDivision of the Secretariat here in New York  the Centrefor Human Rights in Geneva and the office of the UnitedNations Development Programme in Malawi all workedtirelessly to help us set up the necessary institutionalframework for bringing about the desired political change.Let me also thank the Commonwealth Secretariat  theOrganization of African Unity  the friendly Governmentsand the non-governmental organizations that were involvedin our transition process for the invaluable assistance theytoo rendered to Malawi during this very critical and delicatestage of our nation’s evolution. It is my sincere hope thatour partners in the democratic transition will consider waysin which they can continue to work with the Malawianpeople as they confront the many serious problems arisingfrom the excesses and vagaries of the discredited order theyrecently overturned.My Government is committed to consolidating peace democracy and the rule of law in Malawi. We haveemphasized that our struggle was not about personalities orindividual leaders  but rather about changing the politicalway of life. It has always been the desire of theGovernment to work constructively  together with otherparties  for the benefit of the nation. It is thereforepleasing that recently the Government and one of theopposition parties  the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) reached an agreement that facilitated the appointment tothe Cabinet of some AFORD members  includingMr. Chakufwa Chihana  President of AFORD.My Government has refrained from any form ofwitch-hunting or revenge against members of the formerregime. No one in Malawi need ever fear for his life orliberty simply because he holds differing political viewsor beliefs. In this context  my Government will guaranteeall persons accused of wrongdoing the opportunity to beheard in an open court of law.We have at the same time expressed our desire tosee established in Malawi a culture of respect for humanrights. In this regard  my Government has  among otherthings  recently signed with the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  Mr. Ayala Lasso  whovisited us in August  a Joint Declaration on the MutualDesire to Cooperate in the Development of Programmesfor the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights inMalawi. Education in Human Rights has thus aprominent place in the programmes that are envisaged.This is because my Government firmly believes that therule of law in Malawi can be consolidated if the peopleknow and understand what their rights are.Basic human rights and fundamental freedomscannot however be meaningfully enjoyed where peopleare living in conditions of economic desperation. Themajority of the people of Malawi live in extreme poverty.It is for this reason  therefore  that poverty alleviation hasbeen given top priority on my Government’s agenda. Thefocus on the alleviation of poverty is intended to helpconsolidate the freedom and democracy that Malawianscurrently enjoy.It is common knowledge that  out of a total in 1994of 173 countries  Malawi is number 15 from the bottomon the scale of United Nations Development Programmehuman development indicators. This reflects ourextremely low ratings in socio-economic indicators covering areas such as health  social welfare  education housing  food and nutrition. Malawi’s external debt isalso quite high. At the end of June 1994  the externaldebt stock stood at $1.9 billion. Malawi’s balance ofpayments position is precarious. Its commodity terms oftrade are deteriorating and are currently estimated at72.3 per cent.2Meanwhile  Malawi continues to suffer from theeffects of the severe drought of 1992-1993  which afflictedthe whole of southern Africa. The country is once againexperiencing serious food shortages  owing primarily tovery poor rains in the 1993-1994 season. The countryurgently needs nearly 400 000 metric tons of grain  mainlymaize  if it is to avert mass starvation and death among thepeople.The HIV/AIDS pandemic has also adversely affectedmy country. The ones hardest hit by this scourge are theyoung and most productive segment of the population. Theresources which my Government is able to allocate  in itsnational budget  for dealing with this problem are far fromadequate: it wishes it could do more.Malawi continues to suffer also from the after-effectsof the influx of refugees of recent years. The number ofrefugees from neighboring Mozambique  which oncetotalled over a million people  has now been reduced tonearly a quarter of a million. But it will take years probably decades  to deal with the full impact of such largenumbers. Many sectors of the economy  such as health education  the basic infrastructure and the environment have been adversely affected  with grave implications forthe already serious poverty in the country.It is thus quite clear that fulfillment of theGovernment’s policy for the alleviation of poverty will bea major challenge indeed. The task ahead is enormous.Many sacrifices will have to be made. My Government is however  determined to meet the challenges head-on. Wehave to try in order to succeed. In this context  myGovernment is working out a programme of povertyalleviation that will be flexible and implementable  andwhich can benefit from tangible and active assistance fromthe donor community. A Presidential Council on PovertyAlleviation  under my chairmanship  has been establishedto advise the Government on the actual implementation ofthe programmes envisaged. It is the Government’sintention that people in the rural areas should be the mainbeneficiaries of the poverty alleviation programmes.The programmes will also give special attention to thesituation of children. Malawi is a party to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child. It is the intention of the newgovernment to translate the provisions of the Conventioninto reality for every child. The first step was theintroduction  last month  of free primary education. Todate  there are 3.2 million children in school — an increaseof 1.3 million from last year. This truly is a children’seducational revolution.My Government is conscious of the need toempower women so that they can become active in allsectors of the economy and so that discrimination againstwomen and girls may become a thing of the past. Effortsare under way to close the gender gap in primary andhigher education and to ensure the participation of womenin decision-making. We look forward to participating inthe United Nations Fourth World Conference on Womenin Beijing in 1995.Allow me at this juncture  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Malawi  to thank  mostsincerely  the United Nations system  donor Governmentsand agencies  and our many other partners in developmentfor the invaluable assistance that they have given toMalawi since it attained independence. I have broadlyoutlined the problems and challenges that Malawi faces.I am very confident that our partners in development willcontinue to assist us as we forge ahead in our efforts toimprove the standard of living of our people. I wish toappeal specifically for donor sympathy to write offexisting loans made to the Malawi Government.I wish to assure you  Mr. President  that anyassistance that is given to Malawi will be used for thepurpose and target groups intended. The democraticallyelected Government should be given the chance to makedemocracy work. I also invite the private and publicsectors to come and invest in Malawi. The investmentclimate in Malawi is very favourable  and opportunitiesexist in such areas as tourism  mining  finance andbanking  and distribution.Malawi welcomes the efforts to redefine the role ofthe United Nations in matters pertaining to development.In this context  the report (A/48/935) of the Secretary-General  “An Agenda for Development”  is  in our view very timely indeed. The priority areas for developmentoutlined in the report deserve the political commitment active support and tangible assistance of the internationalfinancial and donor community. The key and persistentproblem areas of concern — external debt and debtservicing  poor access to science and technology fordevelopment  inadequate financial flows  rapid populationgrowth  and problems relating to women and to socialdevelopment — need to be tackled head-on. Africa isparticularly afflicted by these problems and deservesfocused attention.The crisis situation facing Africa calls for urgent andimportant measures  such as those outlined in the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in3the 1990s  which has yet to be implemented. Thesemeasures  as augmented by the conclusion of the TokyoConference on African Development  should be givenactive support. Malawi regards the recommended prioritiesfor development in the Agenda for Development and theProgramme of Action outlined in the New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa as being complementary and criticalto the development of Africa. Malawi is all the moreinterested in these developments because they are exactlyin line with the poverty-alleviation strategies that it has setfor itself.Many positive political developments have taken placein Africa in recent times. The current wave ofdemocratization has reached many parts of the continent including the southern Africa region  and apartheid hasbeen buried. Let me take this opportunity to congratulatethe people of South Africa on their first truly democraticgeneral elections  held in April this year  which ushered inthe multiracial Government led by His Excellency Mr.Nelson Mandela. The present Malawi Government ispleased that South Africa has finally and proudly resumedits seat in the General Assembly and in all the other bodiesof the United Nations  as a free country.The people of Malawi have close social  cultural economic and other relations with the people ofMozambique; thus their joy is our joy and their sorrow isour sorrow. We are one people. We therefore welcomewholeheartedly the fact that the General Peace Agreementis so far being implemented satisfactorily. And asMozambique moves closer to its first multi-party generalelections later this month  it is our firm belief that thesuccessful installation of a newly elected Government inthat country will be a major accomplishment for theinternational community and southern Africa  in general and for the Mozambican people  in particular. Such anoutcome will give the people of Mozambique theopportunity to rebuild their country and truly embark ondevelopment after many years of vicious civil war. Wewish the people of Mozambique every success as they drawnearer to the election date.The success of the peace process in Angola would because for great jubilation and satisfaction for myGovernment and the people of Malawi. For too long thepeople of Angola have been denied peace. They deserve tolive in honour and dignity. They have a right to a peacefulpresent and a hopeful future. Peace in Angola would alsobe of benefit to the entire southern African region.Southern Africa requires peace  security and politicalstability to enable it to harness and direct its vast humanand natural resources towards economic growth andsustainable development.We are thus encouraged by the indications of someprogress in the peace talks that have been going on inLusaka  Zambia  under the auspices of the UnitedNations. We fervently look forward to the conclusion ofa mutually agreed final resolution to the longstandingpolitical deadlock and armed conflict in Angola.The peaceful resolution of conflicts in other parts ofAfrica would give us in Malawi equal joy and comfort.Thus  for example  the situation in Rwanda has been asource of great concern to my country. We are  however gratified that the horrible carnage we saw in Rwandarecently has since come to an end and that the choleraepidemic and the outbreak of dysentery in the refugeecamps in eastern Zaire have now been brought undercontrol. My Government is pleased to have made amodest troop contribution to the United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In thisconnection  let me most sincerely thank the BelgianGovernment for providing the Malawi troop contingent inUNAMIR with logistical and other support.The task of the international community in Rwandagoes beyond humanitarian assistance. The world must  inthe short term  undertake to assist Rwanda in the processof political settlement based on national reconciliation. Inthe long term  however  the major challenge for theinternational community and the people of Rwandathemselves is to find ways and means to resolvepermanently the issues that breed and nurture the kind ofintense ethnic fears and suspicion that have resultedduring the past quarter of a century alone in over fourwaves of blood-letting  which seem to grow morehorrendous on each successive occasion.My Government wishes to record here its support forthe courageous efforts exerted by the people of Burundito avert a similar situation to that which has consumedneighbouring Rwanda. It has been slow and painfullyfrustrating  but we believe that by having resorted to thenegotiating table  and not to arms  the people of Burundihave taken the first step towards finding a lasting solutionthat will ultimately secure permanent peace for theircountry. We wish them well in this noble endeavour.My Government is greatly concerned at the apparentlack of a decisive response from the internationalcommunity to the pitiful situations in Liberia andSomalia. We are also saddened by the fact that4inflexibility and dogmatism seem once again to havebrought to naught months of painstaking effort in the searchfor a solution to the problems of Sudan. Our sincere hopeis that the latest set-back will not lead to abandonment ofthe Sudan situation by the international community.My Government has followed closely the situation inWestern Sahara. While the General Assembly has beenseized of the situation in that Territory  we note with muchconcern that real interest in this issue appears to diminishevery year. It seems that the Assembly has begun routinelyto adopt resolutions that  in fact  are leading directly tointernational acquiescence in the status quo. We thereforecall upon the international community  and in particular theUnited Nations  to live up to its responsibilities and fulfilits promise to the Sahouri people by acting without anyfurther delay to hold the long-awaited referendum on thatTerritory’s political future.My Government has followed with equally keeninterest developments in other regions of the world. Wehave been encouraged by the quickened tempo of the peaceprocess in the Middle East  as well as by the flame of hope albeit flickering  kindled by the first serious dialoguebetween the parties to the political deadlock over theKorean Peninsula. It is my Government’s hope that thedialogue that has been going on between the People’sRepublic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwanwill lead to a solution that is mutually satisfactory to theparties concerned.At the same time  we have been deeply grieved by thesituation in the former Yugoslavia  where some  with aseemingly perverted sense of fair play  would have usbelieve that if the victimized are prevented from defendingthemselves against the aggressors the conflict there canmore quickly be brought to an end.Recently delegations from the United States and Cubamet in this historic city and  through negotiations unfetteredby preconditions  were able to reach a mutually agreeablesolution to a dispute that had heightened tension betweenthe two countries. We believe that  through a similarapproach  these two neighbouring countries could alsoresolve such differences as have divided them for nearly40 years. Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall andafter the cold war was declared over  we can see no reasonwhy these two great nations should not sheathe their cold-war sabres and embrace each other for the sake of peaceand progress in their region. My Government thereforeeagerly looks forward to the day when it can join the worldin applauding the resumption of normal and friendlyrelations between Cuba and the United States.The founders of the United Nations set forthprinciples that have stood the test of time. The validityof the purposes of the Organization cannot be denied even today. Malawi believes in the principles andpurposes of the United Nations. In our view  thisOrganization  with all its shortcomings  still represents aviable option for addressing the many political socio-economic and other issues that confront our worldtoday. Working through the United Nations  we can allmake our world a better place.The year 2000 is just six years away. Let us allwork together to make the twenty-first century one inwhich respect for human rights and fundamental freedomsand respect for the rule of law are the rule and not theexception. Let us work together to emancipate our peoplefrom the socio-economic and other ills that hold them inbondage to misery in their daily lives. Let us worktogether to avert the escalation of conflict situations. Thepeaceful settlement of disputes remains one of thecardinal principles of this Organization and ofinternational law. Let us make mediation a priority —mediation at any stage of a conflict. But  better still  letus use this Organization to find ways to reduce  if not toeliminate  the causes of conflict situations; to reduce  ifnot to eliminate  the means by which conflicts are fuelledand perpetrated. In making these humble suggestions  weare inspired by the preamble to the Charter.On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoptionof the United Nations Charter  let us resolve to make theOrganization even more relevant for the next 50 years.Let us work to strengthen the United Nations. Let usmake the organs of the Organization more effective transparent and accountable. In this regard  we supportthe current efforts to reform the Security Council provided that such reform is not at the expense ofeffectiveness.Let us all work together to rationalize the workprogrammes of the United Nations. Let the agenda of ourOrganization reflect the priorities of our time.The people of Malawi have embraced democracyand the rule of law  and they look forward toconsolidating their recovered freedom. At a time whenglobal interdependence has become a reality  the peopleof Malawi look optimistically towards a reform of thisOrganization that will ensure that it can more effectively5play its role in international efforts to achieve security andeconomic prosperity for all the peoples of the world."
"121",4985,"MYS",49,1994,"I should like to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the UnitedNations General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. MayI also express our appreciation to Ambassador SamuelInsanally of Guyana for having successfully guided thework of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth sessionand further enhanced its centrality.The cold war has ended  and totalitarianism has metits nemesis. At this very critical stage in history  we mustseize the opportunity to redesign the international order soas to realize the aspirations of the global community. Wemust meet this challenge and collectively reconstruct a trulyjust order for our time and for the generations to come.Indeed  the global community has reached manysignificant milestones. More nations have agreed to resolvetheir disputes by peaceful means. South Africa hasemerged from its political catharsis as a nation free ofapartheid and with majority rule; Cambodia experiencedfree and democratic elections; and lasting peace in WestAsia came closer to realization with the Israeli-Palestinianaccords.However  the initial euphoria will be somewhatshort-lived. The path ahead is strewn with uncertaintiesand pitfalls. The end of the cold war has yet to rewardus fully with its promise of global peace and security. Ithas instead unleashed the demons of parochialnationalism  tribalism  religious fanaticism — aswitnessed in the “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia — tribalwarfare in Rwanda and religious dissension in somecountries. The North-South divide in wealth  power andcontrol over resources is still too pronounced to beignored  and the redistribution of global prosperity is farfrom being realized.The paramount challenge facing the globalcommunity today is to fulfil the promises made in recentyears of systemic change in the global environment. Thisis to be achieved through sustained efforts in regard toeconomic development and through the strengthening ofcivil society and multilateral institutions.Development is the only secure foundation for globalpeace and security  for the origins of conflicts are oftenvery deeply rooted in socio-economic deprivation anddisparities. As for civil society  its growth into maturityrequires the establishment of institutions for a stable andresponsive social order  a democratic participatoryarrangement as a means to channel political energy  andan environment in which culture can flourish.In all these areas  it is the people that matter — theirfreedom  security and development. All great traditionsof mankind  East and West  concur in the sanctity of thehuman person  the family as a fundamental unit ofsociety  and the primacy of moral and ethical values as afoundation of civilizations. The sanctity of the humanperson warrants the State’s protection of the inalienablerights of all to freedom  to participate in social  politicaland cultural processes and to optimize the potential of thehuman person through development. The rights of theindividual must be safeguarded inasmuch as the stabilityof society cannot be compromised. It is within thisframework that we conceive the restoration of humanrights in any society  industrial or developing  as acontinuing endeavour which we must never abandon.The promise made at the 1992 Rio Summit remainsunfulfilled. If no increased official developmentassistance is forthcoming and the international target of120.7 per cent is not met  this will represent a seriousreneging on the Rio commitments  notwithstanding theGlobal Environment Facility.This will raise questions as to the commitment of theNorth to pledges made at major conferences. The WorldSummit for Social Development will take place next year and what will be the value of assiduously negotiateddocuments when  as with the Rio Agenda 21  no real meansare provided for their implementation? The recentInternational Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting atMadrid highlighted the preoccupation of the majordeveloped countries  often at a tangent from the needs andrequirements of developing countries.At the Rio Summit  the developed countries declaredthat the tropical forests belonged to the whole world. Itwas maintained that these forests must always remain inorder to maintain biological diversity and sustain ecologicalbalance. Today  South-East Asia is covered in thick haze adversely affecting the health of the people. Hundreds ofthousands of hectares of virgin forest are burning  andvaluable species are being lost.If indeed the tropical forest is the heritage of mankind the responsibility for its protection must necessarily becollective. While the South-East Asian countries will takethe necessary measures  we appeal to the globalcommunity  especially the richer members  to help us putout this fire on an urgent and priority basis.We regard the issue of global population asinseparable from the overall concern of development.Reductions in fertility mainly come about from investmentin education and health care for women. While we sharethe fundamental objectives of the Conference on Populationand Development in Cairo  we deplore the attempt toimpose views without regard for the values of others.The peace dividend that we aspire to reap will not berealized without sustained growth in the global economy.However  growth prospects are often hampered by short-sighted policies and structural crises within the industrialeconomies. Viewed in this light  the popular call formacroeconomic stabilization should not be confined to thedeveloping countries alone but instead should encompassboth the developing and the industrial economies.The United Nations will soon commemorate its fiftiethyear of existence. It would be uncharitable to ignorealtogether the outstanding contributions made to humanityby this world body and its agencies. It has provided aplatform for international cooperation in the fields ofeducation  law  health  culture  economics  refugee reliefand so on. But more significantly  it has  by its veryexistence  prepared the groundwork for a global order thatwould be truly democratic and multicultural.However  as we draw up the balance sheet of thatera and contemplate the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury  we must take into serious account our manylimitations. Clearly  the United Nations as it exists todayis unable effectively to deal with critical global issues. Inthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Security Councilremains paralysed in the implementation of its ownresolutions. Should we also ask then: if the Council wasready to plunge into the Gulf crisis a few years ago  howcan that be reconciled with the political timidity and clearabsence of resolve to take effective action in the case ofBosnia and Herzegovina  even after the rejection of theso-called peace plan by the Serbs?Within the United Nations itself  the peace-keepingoperations decided on by the Security Council provide noclear institutional structure for consultation  especiallybetween non-Security-Council member troop-contributingcountries and Security Council members. Yet the majorPowers are resisting the urgent need for regularconsultations between the Security Council and troop-contributing countries.While the situation in Somalia clearly reflected theneed for some form of United Nations involvement  if notintervention  there have been other operations where evencountries in the region have been totally opposed toUnited Nations involvement. My delegation  which hasbeen deeply involved in United Nations peace-keepingoperations  is concerned about operations which servequestionable interest groups.In the Security Council  while agreement betweenthe Permanent Five has removed obstacles and facilitatedsettlements of disputes  the momentum behind the push tosolve issues  if not properly checked and balanced by aprocess of accountability and non-selectivity of issues may prove to be the undoing of the Council itself and ofits moral authority. The role of major Powers  at leastthose that still deserve that status  is explicitly recognizedin the Charter of the United Nations. However  many ofus will not be willing to agree that these Powers shouldcontinue to be Charter-privileged to intervene whereverthey wish and only when their own interpretations ofpeace and security warrant intervention.13Reform of the Security Council is necessary to reflecta more equitable geographical representation and towardsmaking the Council more accountable to the generalmembership. Resistance from a few  whose own claims tobeing major Powers are becoming increasinglyunpersuasive  should not be allowed to stand in the way ofchange. The issue is not one merely of enlarging thepermanent membership but is one of enhanced participation.As the Council is unrepresentative  the first step towardsreform must be to increase the numbers of non-permanentmembers. The veto  a creation of the power politics of thepast  must be part of the total reform of the Council.The United Nations still represents the best recoursefor developing countries to advance their interests in globalaffairs. Hence  we cannot allow the present uncertaintiesabout the structure and role of the United Nations to remainunresolved. The United Nations  despite financialproblems  cannot be allowed to become a mendicant of thepower brokers at the expense of the principles of theCharter.The United Nations is the only institution capable ofproviding the vehicle for a comprehensive and integratedapproach to peace and development. A revitalizedEconomic and Social Council has the potential tocoordinate and  it is hoped  harmonize policies emanatingfrom separate bodies such as the G-7 and the BrettonWoods institutions. In this regard priority must beaccorded to an Agenda for Development which wouldprovide the new framework for international developmentcooperation  the basis for a truly global partnership.The United Nations must also spearhead the struggletowards total and complete nuclear disarmament. Themajor Powers must not slacken the momentum towardseffective non-proliferation and comprehensive test-bantreaties  critical to our collective resolve to halt the armsrace and eliminate the utilization of weapons of massdestruction.Malaysia is prepared to make an early commitment tothe goals of true globalism and  with a genuine mechanismreposing in the United Nations  to a new world system forinternational peace  security and development. We willcontinue to participate actively in the work of themultilateral system.International society has grown fourfold since 1945.The world is heterogeneous and multicultural. Meaningfuldiscourse cannot be limited by the narrowness ofparameters or an overbearing sense of cultural supremacy.We must strive to overcome and transcendunproductive polarizations. We all need to purgeourselves of the arrogance and myopia embedded in theold mind-set. We must learn to honour diversity ofopinion and the multiplicity of world views andperspectives on life and society. None the less  they mustnot impede efforts to seek and implement genuinesolutions for our common good and shared problems.We must accept the new realities  particularly thefar-reaching systemic transformations in the globaleconomy. The growing economic strength of East Asiaand the newly industrializing countries will invariablybring about a new equation of power and responsibility inglobal affairs.We are fully aware of the many shortcomingsinherent within East Asia; its remarkable economicperformance is far from miraculous. Nevertheless  itsexperience portrays the path of change towards thequalitative search for excellence. Political stability wasappropriated to garner efforts for economic growth whichultimately became the means to empower the people. Itsstrength  as in the case of Malaysia and other South-EastAsian countries  is to accept and to experience theproposition that development and democracy are notmutually exclusive; and the exercise in responsible libertyby the ordinary people and their participation in publiclife does not necessarily result in social indiscipline andpolitical instability. Development is enriched bymulticulturalism where the practice of tolerance andmoderation has turned religious and ethnic diversity frombeing a source of conflict into an ingredient for success.In a world torn by ethnic and religious passions andcultural prejudices  the experience of South-East Asia inmulticulturalism may provide some clues for devising themeans for peaceful coexistence and productive partnershipamong citizens of the global village.Dag Hammarskjöld  when reflecting on the state ofthe world almost 40 years ago  was perhaps lessexuberant than we are at the prospects of globalism.With the memory of war still fresh  he said:“We must serve our apprenticeship and at everystage try to develop forms of internationalcoexistence as far as is possible at the moment.”That apprenticeship has now been served. TheUnited Nations must innovate and renew itself to addressthe challenges of the twenty-first century. It mustprogress and transform itself from being a theatre for the14concert of a few powerful nations into an effective andrepresentative vehicle for global governance. And  beyondthat  it must be animated by the spirit of justice and a biastowards compassion. In short  the very legitimacy of thisinternational body hinges upon its realizing the ideal ofbecoming the conscience of the global community."
"122",5012,"NAM",49,1994,"On behalf of the Namibiandelegation  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on yourunanimous election as President of the General Assemblyat its forty-ninth session. As a distinguished diplomat andpublic servant with long experience  you bring to youroffice an outstanding record of wisdom  excellence andindustry. Côte d’Ivoire and Namibia have maintained closerelations of friendship and cooperation. On a personalnote  I take great pride in your brilliant election and extendbest wishes to you.During his term of office  your distinguishedpredecessor  Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana introduced practical steps aimed at enhancing the work ofthe General Assembly and promoting further our commonendeavours towards peace  partnership  development andprosperity. We commend him for all this.Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our illustriousSecretary-General  has always kept his plate full in theservice of our Organization and its Charter. He has also on a continuous basis  kept intensifying his tireless effortsin furtherance of world peace and security and  not least development and regional conflict management andresolution. The Secretary-General’s report ""An Agenda forDevelopment"" is an important and timely complement to""An Agenda for Peace"". Together they reinforce GeneralAssembly resolution 48/165 on the ""Renewal of thedialogue on strengthening international economiccooperation for development through partnership"". I canassure the Secretary-General that he can count onNamibia’s support in the discharge of his mandate.Following our independence  the Government and thepeople of Namibia strongly felt that the decolonization ofour country was not complete because parts of our nationalterritory still remained under colonial occupation. In 1991 from this rostrum  I called on the international communityand  particularly  the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil to live up to their commitment  collectively andseverally  by ensuring the early reintegration of Walvis Bayand the Offshore Islands into Namibia  in accordance withSecurity Council resolution 432 (1978). Since then  I havekept the international community abreast of thenegotiations to this end between the Governments ofNamibia and South Africa. In 1992  I reported on theestablishment of the Joint Administrative Authority  andlast year I announced the agreed date for thereintegration.It is with pride and satisfaction that I am now finallyinforming the General Assembly and the worldcommunity as a whole that  on 1 March 1994  WalvisBay and the Offshore Islands were reintegrated intoNamibia. Security Council Resolution 432 (1978) hasthus been fully implemented. On that emotional butindeed solemn occasion marking the second independenceof Namibia  Mr. Sam Nujoma  President of Namibia proudly declared that at last Walvis Bay and the OffshoreIslands were forever liberated and reintegrated intoNamibia and he thanked the people of South Africa fortheir role in making this possible. A huge and tumultuouscrowd of Namibians and friends from abroad who weregathered there confirmed this truth with their loud cheers.In the end  diplomacy has triumphed over confrontation.I would like to place on record Namibia’s gratitudeto the Secretary-General  as well as theSecretaries-General of the Organization of African Unityand the Commonwealth  the member States of the SouthAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the front-line States  as well as many other good friends whorendered support and encouragement to Namibia in thenegotiating process.At this point let me reiterate what I said then  that asuccessful resolution of this issue will not onlyconsolidate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ourcountry but will also create enormous opportunity foreconomic integration  community- building and prosperityfor the SADC region. New vistas for trade  transport andcommunication would be opened up throughout southernAfrica. And this will further stimulate free movement ofgoods  services and people in the area. Walvis Bay willgreatly complement other ports in the region.It is a truism that peace  democracy  politicalstability and good governance are among the basic pillarsfor development. The southern African region presents agood example of transformation from war  conflicts economic destabilization  political instability  socialdisintegration  suppression and denial of human rights tothe new situation of peace  democracy  stability  regionalcooperation and hope for a more prosperous future for usall. The former Southern Africa DevelopmentCoordinating Conference (SADCC) vigorously sought tocounteract the destabilization and subversion of the17countries of the region by the apartheid regime of SouthAfrica. The front-line States  with vigour anddetermination  also pursued the fight for liberation  peace political stability  democratization and promotion andprotection of human rights. Now  with the eradication ofapartheid in South Africa and the installation of the firstdemocratically elected Government  the struggle forfreedom and political emancipation in southern Africa wascrowned with a gigantic victory.The people of South Africa finally triumphed over theapartheid system. The epoch making inauguration ofPresident Nelson Mandela  on 10 May 1994  was a victoryfor humanity and a vindication of the untold sacrifices ofthe South African people. The international community and in particular the countries and the peoples of southernAfrica  celebrated this joyous event  confident in theconviction that peace had finally come to our region. Wein Namibia are particularly gratified to welcome the newSouth Africa into the fold of the community of nations.Just as we struggled together during the apartheid era  welook forward to strengthened partnership for developmentand prosperity for our people and the region.The time for reconstruction and economic cooperationin the region has finally dawned. We are convinced thatthe transformation in 1992 of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Coordinating Conference into the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) will furtherconsolidate regional economic cooperation and all-rounddevelopment for the prosperity of all our people.This will indeed serve as a formidable building-blocktowards the realization of the goals of the AfricanEconomic Community  especially in the field of inter-Africatrade  investment  capacity-building and human resourcedevelopment. In this context  Namibia welcomes withappreciation President Clinton’s announcement yesterday inWashington that the United States Government will makea substantial financial contribution to reconstruction anddevelopment in South Africa  as well as in other countriesin the region. It is good news for us that a friend ofAfrica  Ambassador Andrew Young  will coordinate thisprogramme.Let me mention here the recent first-ever meetingbetween Foreign Ministers of the European Union andSADC held last month in Berlin. The meeting was historicand elevated the interaction and cooperative relationsbetween the two regions to a higher political and economiclevel.The past four years have seen throughout Africa aprocess of free and fair elections  multi-party democracy the protection of human rights  press freedom  the rule oflaw  and market-oriented economies. This process hastaken a firm direction and produced positive results insouthern Africa and in other parts of Africa. In 1989 successful independence elections were held whichculminated in a free and independent Namibia in 1990.In 1991  democratic elections were held in Zambia; in1992 free and fair elections were held in Angola  thoughregrettably UNITA refused to accept the results andrestarted the fighting; Lesotho held multi-party democraticelections in 1993; and this year  South Africa and Malawiunderwent democratic transformations. In October Botswana and Mozambique will hold democraticelections. Multi-party democratic  presidential andparliamentary elections are scheduled in Namibia inDecember this year. Likewise  1995 will see multi-partydemocratic elections in Tanzania and general elections inZimbabwe. This would mean that the vision fordeepening democratization  peace  prosperity and truepartnership in SADC will be greatly boosted.In the emerging world order resulting from the endof the cold war and the victories scored by the forces ofliberation  the front-line States decided that the time hadcome to transform themselves into a mechanism forpolitical consultations  conflict resolution  peace andsecurity in the SADC region. The new body which isnow being put together is intended to augment theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) mechanism forconflict resolution and peace-keeping  and will serveprimarily as the political and security arm of SADC itself.The countries of SADC  through this mechanism  arecommitted to defend and protect constitutional order andthe rule of law. Through their common vision for peaceand development  a task force of three Heads of Staterecently succeeded in peacefully redressing the attemptedoverthrow of the democratically elected Government ofLesotho. It was a first major test  and the SADC leadersrose to the occasion and defused what was potentially anexplosive situation with serious consequences for thewhole region.Africa needs to produce similar success stories through concerted regional initiatives  in other conflictsituations such as Rwanda  Burundi  Liberia  Somalia  theSudan and others. Naturally  we welcome the seriousefforts which are being made by neighbouring AfricanStates in and relating to each one of these trouble spots.To this end  Africa and the international community alikeshould heed the appeals for contributions to the OAU18Peace Fund. In Namibia  we believe that once givenadequate financial and human resources Mr. Salim AhmedSalim  the OAU Secretary-General  and his staff arecapable of implementing expeditiously the relevantdecisions of the succeeding summits of African leaders.In Angola  it is our strong expectation that theprotracted negotiations currently under way in Lusakaappear poised for an imminent and successful conclusion.The Government and the people of Namibia are indeedawaiting the successful resolution of this bloody conflict.In their own modest way  the Government and the peopleof Namibia will continue to play a constructive role tohasten this process. The statement made last week fromthis rostrum by the Foreign Minister of Angolademonstrated once again the flexibility and genuinegoodwill of the Angolan Government to reach a peacefulsettlement in the interest of the suffering Angolan people.UNITA  it is sad to say  continues to obstruct progress andwage war. It should be made to heed the urgent warningsof the Security Council. The United Nations should  in themeantime  keep itself in readiness to increase its personnelin Angola as soon as a cease-fire is restored. The ever-increasing peace-keeping missions of the United Nationsneed sound financial support  if indeed peace is to beachieved and preserved. I therefore urge the StatesMembers of our Organization to heed theSecretary-General’s call in his current report for adequatefunding for peace-keeping operations.Namibia is very much encouraged by the recentconclusion of an agreement between the Governments ofthe United States of America and the Republic of Cuba onimmigration issues. It is our fervent hope that the signingof this agreement will serve as the beginning of seriousnegotiations to resolve all aspects of the long-standingdispute between them  in the interest of peace  trade development and good neighbourliness. I made the sameplea last year from here  and the latest development helpsto keep my hope alive. Namibia enjoys excellent friendlyand productive relations with both countries. It is in thisspirit that we advocate rapprochement between them.We consider that in both elections and governancepopular participation is a prerequisite for development andprosperity. At independence  however  Namibia inheriteda dual economy that was based on an unequal distributionof wealth and disparity of income resulting from apartheid.As a result  the majority of the population has incomes thatare far below the national average. To redress theseimbalances  the Government has been pursuing prudenteconomic policies aimed at improving the lives of themajority of our citizens. The direction is clear  althoughthe road ahead is replete with pitfalls. However  I mustsay that the Government’s will and determination tosucceed cannot be doubted.In 1991  Namibia sought least-developed-countrystatus to redress imbalances in education  health  housingand employment. The granting by the General Assemblyof the ""as if"" least-developed-country option to Namibia if not the full status of least-developed country nonetheless allowed us to lay the foundation for thereconstruction of our economic and social structures.In spite of the Government’s best efforts in thesecritical areas  imbalances persist in our society.Provisional figures from the ongoing 1993-1994 NationalHousing  Income and Expenditure Survey provide clearevidence of skewed income distribution. Using privatehousehold consumption as an indicator  preliminarysurvey estimates show that 50 per cent of the pooresthouseholds account for about 13 per cent of the totalconsumption. The richest 10 per cent of the householdsconsume about 33 per cent.The low literacy rate  the low level of manufacturingindustry and the extremely skewed distribution of incomeare a result of institutionalized social inequality over longperiods. These social and economic sequels of the oldapartheid order continue to bedevil the Government’sdevelopmental efforts. In accordance with our current ""asif"" status  and with the assistance of the World Bank  theNamibian Government is at present preparing a publicexpenditure review. The findings so far point to dramaticincome disparities  in spite of the efforts by theGovernment that I alluded to earlier.It is in this context that Namibia wishes to appealonce again to the States Members of our Organization foran extension of the ""as if"" least-developed-country statusfor an additional number of years. This will be anenormous contribution to our determined efforts toimprove the quality of life for disadvantaged Namibians.We thank those States and agencies that haveimplemented resolution 46/204  on ""as if"" least-developed-country status and appeal for their continuedassistance  which will strengthen the foundation we havelaid for development and further consolidate ourdemocracy.19The United Nations is centrally placed to address themajor global problems facing us. Its focus  however should not be limited to the issues of peace and security.The other critical issues  reconstruction and development must be given the same serious attention. The WorldSummit on Social Development  for example  must be aforum for us to renew our commitment and political will toeffectively address the diverse social and economicproblems. We must come away from Copenhagen to act;the international community this time will need to summonmore courage in order to translate into action the bolddecisions we shall take. There is a linkage between thePlan of Action and follow-up mechanisms adopted at theCairo population Conference and the goals of theCopenhagen and the Beijing Conferences in 1995. Thisrequires greater and systematic coordination  so as to ensureeconomy  efficiency and the achievement of goals we allshare.The continued marginalization and exclusion ofwomen from many spheres of life are a challenge to us all.The platform for action to be adopted at the Fourth WorldConference on Women  to be held in Beijing next year must therefore assure the full and equal participation ofwomen at all levels of society. Namibia’s Constitutioncalls for affirmative action and enlightened policies toeffect positive change in this area of human endeavour.Namibia is an active member of the Zone of Peaceand Cooperation of the South Atlantic and will continue topursue the vigorous promotion of trade in the SouthAtlantic region  including the development of fisheries andmarine resources as well as tourism on a sustainable basis.The South Atlantic region comprises a great expanse ofwaters  which the countries of the Zone are committed tokeep nuclear-free. Similarly  African countries are about tosign a treaty for the denuclearization of the continent.In recent weeks  important meetings of Ministers andofficials of the African and Latin American countries havetaken place in Punta del Este  Uruquay  and Brasilia  Brazil to further advance dialogue and cooperation on issues ofcommon interest. It was in this spirit of South-Southcooperation that Namibia supported the establishment of theSouth Centre  towards whose operations we have alreadymade a significant contribution.I should now like to state Namibia’s position on theoverall reform of the United Nations  and in particularequitable representation on and increase in the membershipof the Security Council. Namibia does not believe that thepresent decision- making machinery of the SecurityCouncil will effectively serve the international communityin the twenty-first century. Change towards a morerepresentative Council would enhance its legitimacy credibility and effectiveness.Representation on the Security Council must reflectthe phenomenal numerical growth in the membership ofthe General Assembly. In line with the principle ofgeographical and equitable representation  Africa isentitled to an appropriate representation of no fewer thantwo permanent seats on the Security Council. For us Security Council reform means more than merely addingtwo or more industrialized permanent members. What isrequired is democracy  transparency and fair play.Namibia reiterates its position that the veto power isoutdated and undemocratic and should be abolished.Equally  the General Assembly should not be allowed tolose its authority  competence and relevance in the reformprocess. Rather  it too needs further strengthening in allaspects.Namibia is of the strong view that the UnitedNations  and Africa in particular  should leave no stoneunturned to ensure that the people of Western Sahara arenot left to face their fate alone. The decolonization andpolitical emancipation of Africa cannot be declaredcomplete without self-determination for them as wellthrough a democratic referendum jointly supervised by theUnited Nations and the OAU.With regard to the dispute between two of ouresteemed friends  India and Pakistan  on the question ofJammu and Kashmir  Namibia urges them to pursuepeaceful dialogue and promote bilateral negotiationswithout public confrontation.On another issue  we are encouraged by Libya’sacceptance of Security Council resolution 731 (1992) andits expressed willingness to resolve the Lockerbie crisiswith the three Western Powers. Dialogue and diplomacyshould be placed on the front burner.Next year the Non-Proliferation Treaty review andextension Conference will be held. Namibia is asignatory to the Treaty. It goes without saying that theConference will provide a golden opportunity for review assessment and extension of this vital Treaty  which hasso far helped to prevent nuclear war. There is also aproposal by Zimbabwe  a proposal that we fully support to seek an advisory opinion from the International Courtof Justice on the legality of the use and threat of use ofnuclear weapons.20Other critical issues  such as general and completedisarmament  nuclear technology  nuclear-weapon-freezones and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  also need tobe discussed and resolved. Once there is consensus onthese and other related concerns  the extension of theTreaty  limited or unlimited  can be resolved to thesatisfaction of both nuclear and non-nuclear States parties.The peace process in the Middle East continues togain momentum and wider acceptance in the region andbeyond it. For us  the centre-piece of this peace process isand must remain full realization of the right ofself-determination of the Palestinian people  led by thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  which must leadto complete nationhood.In conclusion  as we approach the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations and are about to usher in a newmillennium  it is time for the world to take stock. Theworld leadership of today comes largely from a generationthat saw violent conflicts  the untold devastation of societiesand families and shattered hopes and dreams. We can  onthe whole  visualize peace  though it is not yet assured inall regions. However  the vision of peace prevails over thevision of conflicts  and we must be determined to defend it.It is the vision of peace that we must bequeath to the nextgeneration. That should be the gift of our time to the nextcentury."
"123",5057,"NER",49,1994,"Your election to the presidency of the General Assembly atits forty-ninth session  Sir  is a source of pride for thewhole diplomatic community  for Africa and for yourcountry  Côte d’Ivoire  and constitutes a just reward foryour dynamic guidance of your country’s diplomaticactivities. Those of us who already know your work at theUnited Nations and at other international meetings canalready foresee the success of the work of the forty-ninthsession; we know your enormous talent  wisdom andpatience. Your election also reflects the internationalcommunity’s confidence in your country  Côte d’Ivoire  acountry with which Niger maintains diversified relationssolidly rooted in the history and geography of West Africa.Finally  your election is a posthumous tribute by theinternational community to the work carried out over halfa century by the late President Félix Houphouët-Boigny inthe service of human dignity  peace and social progress.Permit me  therefore  to congratulate you  Sir  and throughyou the people of Côte d’Ivoire and its President  Mr. HenriKonan Bedié  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session.I wish also to congratulate the other Assemblyofficers; I am sure they will spare no effort to renderingvaluable assistance as you carry out your tasks.Niger thanks your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Samuel Insanally  for his tireless work; he fulfilled hismandate methodically and ably during one of theOrganization’s busiest years.I also convey my greetings to the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and thank himfor the dynamism and far-sightedness with which he iscarrying out his mandate in this period of important change;we hail him for his firm commitment to international peaceand security.The annual convening of the General Assemblygives Niger the opportunity to renew its faith in thepurposes and principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations  signed at San Francisco nearly half a centuryago. On 28 September 1993  the President of theRepublic of the Niger  His Excellency Mr. MahamaneOusmane  here outlined the views of Niger and its peopleon the problems of our time. In his statement he stressedthat the solution to some of those problems lies first andforemost in the establishment of democracy. Indeed  it isthrough democracy that mankind will find the path offreedom  the path of the love of work and the path of theshared happiness of citizens.Niger is firmly committed to this path of democracy;it has already found the path of freedom for its children.Today in Niger  no one is molested because of hisphilosophical or religious ideas; since the establishment ofthe Third Republic  freedom of the press is complete andis guaranteed by the Constitution. Freedom of associationtoo is complete and guaranteed by the Constitution  anda number of political parties  associations and tradeunions now play to the full the role that is properly theirsin every democratic society.It is in that context that the people of Niger isengaged in rediscovering the path of the love of work which alone can generate wealth. Manynon-governmental organizations have been founded andare working in close cooperation with foreignorganizations.The Government of Niger is aware of itsresponsibilities in this area  and is doing everything it canto ensure that every man and woman of Niger feels fullyinvolved in development issues and can make even amodest contribution to building a society founded onprosperity  justice and freedom.Niger is a Sahelian country confronted with theinexorable advance of the Sahara Desert; we welcome theconclusion at Paris last June of the InternationalConvention to Combat Desertification in those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification particularly in Africa. Niger invites all Member States tosign that important Convention so as to permit it to enterinto force as soon as possible. We hope that theinternational community will finally be able to act on itscommitment to give countries suffering from this scourgethe ability to lay the foundation for genuine  sustainabledevelopment.25Like other developing countries  Niger is facingnumerous difficulties  the most important and mostformidable core issue for us is rainfall  whosecapriciousness is feared by our authorities and our peoplealike. Sometimes too meager  sometimes excessive  therainy season is an ongoing concern in Niger. Last yearthere was not enough rain; this year  however  there wererains such as Niger has not witnessed in more than twodecades. They caused considerable damage but did notgratify our people or our Government with an adequateharvest.Niger wants to free itself from the vagaries of theheavens in order at last to save its children from hungerand thirst. That is why our Head of State  His ExcellencyMr. Mahamane Ousmane  has initiated a major campaignin which the people are participating in building the first-ever dam on the Niger river.To this end he called on all the citizens of Niger tomobilize the resources needed to build the Kandadji Dam.From this rostrum  I should like to invite allorganizations and countries which wish to aid my country to give particular attention to this project. For Niger  thisis a question of ensuring the conditions necessary for thesurvival of the present and future generations.My country has accorded food self-sufficiency toppriority in its campaign for economic development. Itkeenly hopes that with the assistance of the internationalcommunity it will achieve this objective before the end ofthe present decade. Here  Niger hopes that the nationswhich share the same ideal of prosperity and happiness willextend it the same solidarity.Since he took office in April 1993  PresidentMahamane Ousmane has vowed to devote his full energyto the return of peace in the troubled regions in the north ofour country. He has made that question a constant matterof concern for the Government of Niger.By the grace of God  and following the recentnegotiations held in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso  theGovernment of Niger signed a peace agreement with theCoordination of Armed Resistance  thereby opening theway for a cease-fire and the drawing up of legislative textsdesigned to provide more harmonious management of theregions.On behalf of the Government of Niger  allow me hereto extend our warm gratitude to Algeria  Burkino Faso andFrance  whose mediation made it possible to arrive at thisfortunate conclusion.The Ouagadougou Agreement  which was signedlast Sunday  9 October 1994  and which entered into forcetoday  11 October 1994  will allow the people of Niger todevote itself to the critical issues of development in acalm atmosphere. It opens the way to nationalreconciliation among the sons of the same geographicalregion  united by history and inspired by the same will -that of living together.The Government of Niger will  for its part  engagein implementing this Agreement by submitting a draft lawto the National Assembly as soon as possible.It hopes that the international community will assistby providing material and financial resources to ensurethe return and integration of the refugees.Niger is also expecting consistent support from theinternational community to ensure its economic recovery.Thus  since the devaluation of the CFA franc  myGovernment has been continuing negotiations with theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.It has concluded an agreement with the BrettonWoods institutions on economic recovery  andnegotiations are now under way for the conclusion of anagreement on the facility for strengthened structuraladjustment. The Government of Niger has taken thenecessary preliminary measures to ensure that the presentnegotiations lead to the signing of this agreement at anearly date.On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the foundingof the United Nations  it is gratifying to be able to noteall that has been accomplished  in particular over the lastfew years  in areas as complex as peace-keeping disarmament  security  the establishment of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.The development of the situation in the Middle Eastwhich led to the establishment of the Palestinian authorityin Gaza  like the logic of peace and dialogue which nowprevails between Israel and the other Arab countries  ispart of this new dynamic.We cannot fail to mention here  with legitimatepride  the process which led to the establishment in SouthAfrica of a democratic regime which is being guided withwisdom and determination by President Nelson Mandela26and which has allowed this founding Member of theOrganization to regain its rightful place in the communityof nations.How can we fail to be gratified that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will soon arrive on Haitian soil after threelong years in forced exile?These are indeed major events which encourage us tohope that we will see a rapid return of peace wherever itmay have been shattered or wherever it is threatened.The recent negotiations held in New York betweenCuba and the United States  the negotiations between theAmerican and North Korean authorities  as well as thewithdrawal of the last foreign troops from Germany andsome of the Baltic States  show how much we haveaccomplished in the five years since the collapse of theBerlin Wall.Throughout the world - in Africa  in Asia and inAmerica and in Europe - the last vestiges of the cold warare fading away to open the way for a fruitful partnershipamong nations.The United Nations has made its contribution to theachievement of this new atmosphere but here and therehotbeds of tension continue to exist which attest to thefragility of the present balance.Among these conflicts  some of which are ravagingAfrica  I would mention first of all the conflict in Rwanda where a fratricidal war has caused the deaths of hundredsof thousands of men  women and children  left thousandswounded and sent millions of refugees into exile.How can we have allowed such a tragedy to take placewithout having used all the means and resources availableto the international community in time to prevent  if notlimit  the unprecedented massacres which were perpetrated?Because it is aware that nothing lasting can beconceived and realized in Rwanda without peace and unityamong its sons Niger made its modest contribution to therestoration of peace in Rwanda by participating in theUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR).In this country which has been torn apart  Niger hopesto see the provisions of the Arusha Agreement enforced sothat the hardworking people of Rwanda may be able at last and once and for all  to turn its attention towards the tasksof reconstruction and development.Niger expresses the same hopes for peace andstability in neighbouring Burundi and welcomes thesignificant progress made recently  which has resulted inits acquiring authorities who can pursue the work ofconsolidating the peace.Quite close to Rwanda  peace is making great stridesalso in a country which has been engaged in war andsuffering since its independence  namely  Mozambique.Niger keenly hopes that the changes which took placerecently in South Africa will have a very positive effecton the elections to be held there on 27 and 28 October.The situation in Angola is a matter of concern formy delegation. Niger welcomes the fact that  thanks topressure from the international community and the effortsmade by President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia andPresident Nelson Mandela of South Africa and thanksalso to the joint actions of the special representatives ofthe Secretaries-General of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity  UNITA has finally agreedto the signing of a peace agreement  a prelude to ageneral cease-fire and the establishment of a lasting peacein Angola.Nor must the international community and  inparticular  the United Nations turn its attention away fromSomalia  that other fraternal country that has beenravaged. Indeed  it must do all in its power to maintaina significant United Nations presence  which alone canguarantee lasting peace in Somalia.The process of settling all these conflicts hasrevealed the need for greater coordination between theefforts of the United Nations and those of the regionalorganizations within the framework of safeguarding peaceand international security.Niger thanks all the countries which  on a bilateralbasis  made their valuable contribution to the resolutionof certain African conflicts and appeals to theinternational community for continuing support for themachinery of prevention - machinery established by theOrganization of African Unity for the management andsettlement of conflicts - to allow it to be moreoperational.My country is gratified that  after 46 years ofhostilities  Jordan and Israel agreed to sign a peaceagreement on 25 July 1994 - this less than a year after thesigning of the agreement between the Israelis and thePalestinians.27Niger hopes that the logic of peace which has beenestablished in this region will lead to the signature ofsimilar agreements between Israel and Lebanon on the onehand and between Syria and Israel on the other  so thatonce and for all fraternity will prevail between the sons ofthis part of the world  the cradle of centuries-oldcivilizations.Niger thus appeals to the Iraqi authorities to ensurethat the actions they undertake fit within the spirit and letterof the Security Council resolutions  that they recognize theinternational borders of Kuwait and refrain from any actionlikely once again to inflame the Gulf region in a fratricidalconflict with incalculable consequences.Clearly  the world today has gone from a period ofconfrontation to one of cooperation.It is clear that our Organization over the years  with itspresent membership of 184 States  is aspiring towards theideal of universalism enshrined in its Charter. However  itis up to the United Nations to devote particular attention toother regions and other peoples which  through their vitalityand economic dynamism  could also contribute to theimplementation of the ideals of the Charter.It is moreover in this spirit that Niger regrets that theGeneral Assembly was not able to put on its agenda theitem entitled ""Consideration of the exceptional situation ofthe Republic of China in Taiwan in the internationalcontext  based on the principle of universality and inaccordance with the established model of parallelrepresentation of divided countries at the United Nations"".Niger is keenly concerned at the continuation of theconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the efforts andthe patience of the member countries of the Contact Groupand the Organization of the Islamic Conference  thenumerous resolutions of the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly  and the many actions undertaken by theinternational community.The most recent events in this conflict havedemonstrated to those who still had doubts that the war inBosnia and Herzegovina is deliberate and is supported bythe leaders of the Serbian community who have made forcethe primary basis for their actions.That is why  while welcoming the political couragedemonstrated throughout this crisis by PresidentIzetbegovic  Niger supports the proposals which he madehere on 27 September of lifting the arms embargo which ispreventing Bosnia and Herzegovina from exercising itsright to legitimate self-defence in accordance with theCharter of the Organization.At the risk of seeing many States lose their faith inthe system of collective security  the Security Councilshould make the Serbs respect the relevant resolutionswhich it has adopted. It is high time for the SecurityCouncil to take the measures required by the situationconcerning the Serbian aggressors.The end of the cold war and of the East-Westconflict has not yet fully liberated mankind from all itsanguish; nor has it allowed it to remove the heavyburden posed by the build-up and improvement in arms.While it is true that risks of armed confrontation betweenthe super-Powers have today disappeared allowingunimaginable progress in the area of disarmament  thishas not led to that strengthening of security which wewere entitled to expect.A producer of uranium  Niger has ratified the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and willsupport  during the negotiations to take place next year its extension and the universal nature it must acquire.The signing last year in Paris of the chemicalweapons Convention  as well as the unilateralmoratoriums proclaimed by the nuclear Powers are todayalso important constructive steps.Other efforts should also be made to controlconventional weapons and  in a general fashion  toestablish confidence-building measures among States.It is indeed horrendous to see colossal sumsabsorbed in the manufacture of ever-more sophisticatedweapons of destruction and in mortgaging the security ofouter space while in vast regions of the world millions ofmen  women and children are languishing in the mostabject misery  engaging in a daily battle against hungerand illness. How many savings could have been madefrom the resources allotted to peace-keeping if theminimum had been allotted to development?I am tempted to say here: give economic and socialdevelopment that which is its due and there will be lessto worry about concerning peace.Indeed  as you so eloquently pointed out on 20September last after your election  Mr. President  theeconomic and social situation at the international level is28experiencing alarming developments marked by the stampof uncertainty and adversity for the developing countries and for Africa in particular.In the course of this century that is coming to an end mankind has experienced unprecedented turns that improvedthe conditions of the lives of individuals. However  inseveral regions of the world peace is threatened not byarmed men but by millions of hungry human beings indistress who see no prospects for improvement of theirliving conditions.In this regard  Africa for two decades now has seemeda desperate case  despite its abundant natural wealth. To besure  progress has been made economically and socially but in comparison with the rest of the world such progressseems insignificant  and in certain respects entire areas havebecome settled in a situation of non-development.Thus  while certain countries in Asia are experiencingexpansion with trends of accelerated growth  Africa’seconomic prospects continue to remain mediocre. Today more than 350 million Africans are living in abject poverty more than half of them women and children.Paradoxically  Africa also shows the signs of a vibrantcontinent capable of the greatest economic prowess  as longas the international community gives it the opportunity andthe means to achieve its potential.Indeed  how can we speak of a continent on its wayto ruin when along with its natural resources Africa has ayoung generation determined to meet the challenges ofhistory? How can one sideline Africa when its contributionto the global economy throughout past centuries hasallowed for the industrialization of the other continents?Here the industrialized countries bear a heavyresponsibility. I should like to recall Niger’s position on aparticular aspect of this responsibility  namely  the debt. Aslong as the developing countries  and in particular those ofsub-Saharan Africa  continue to devote the greater part oftheir income to paying off the foreign debt they will neverbe able to lay down the basis for a genuine economicrecovery. Thus  Niger urges the developed countries tocancel the debts of the developing countries and ifnecessary to give priority to the least developed countries.In so doing the industrialized countries will have answeredtheir own appeal as made by the Group of Seven mosthighly industrialized countries at the Naples Summit in July1994.Along with the debt the continued deterioration ofthe terms of trade is a subject of great concern for Niger.The purchase price of the products these countries offeron the international market is falling year by year whilethe prices of manufactured products which the samecountries are buying are continuing to rise.To be competitive  some of these countries havedevalued their currency by half  despite the difficulteconomic  social and political consequences. Quiterecently in Morocco the developing countries renewedtheir faith in the rules governing international tradethrough their active participation in the agreementestablishing the World Trade Organization. We hopethat  in return  this organization will be able to fill thegaps in the text of the agreement by taking courageousdecisions and adopting measures in favour of thedeveloping countries  in particular those of Africa.For many of the developing countries internationaltrade is  first of all  trade in commodities. That is whyNiger attaches great importance to the establishment ofthe commodifies Fund and  in so doing  appealsdiversification to those countries still reluctant to do so tobecome involved in the dynamic process under way inthis area.But what the developing countries  and especially theleast-developed countries  need most is the establishmentof a genuine fund for development assured of lastingresources. It is recognized today that the Bretton Woodsinstitutions have reached their limits in developmentmatters. The conditions attached to World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) loans are often agenuine impediment to attaining the developing countries’purpose in negotiating the loan agreements.In his report ""An Agenda for Development""  theSecretary-General rightly notes that peace is thedevelopment; the economy is the engine of progress; theenvironment is a basis for sustainability; and social justiceis a pillar of society.My delegation hopes that the consultations to be heldon this document will result in a fleshing-out of the initialoutline and that the final report will take into account thevital concerns of the developing countries. We hope thatit will put forward concrete ways and means to ensureimplementation of the development programmes andstrategies adopted by the General Assembly over the lastfew years.29The forthcoming major international conferences - theWorld Summit for Social Development  the Fourth WorldConference on Women and the Second United NationsConference on Human Settlements - provide opportunitiesfor us further to enrich this Agenda.In conclusion  let me reaffirm Niger’s faith in theideals of the United Nations and in its ability to find thanks to the solidarity of all its Members  the rightanswers to the new challenges we face."
"124",5103,"NGA",49,1994,"On behalf of the Nigeriandelegation  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. Your election is a tribute not only toyou personally and to your great country  but to Africa asa whole. As a representative of Côte d’Ivoire  a countrywith which Nigeria enjoys excellent and brotherlyrelations  you have our full confidence in your ability tosuccessfully discharge the responsibilities of your highoffice.I wish to express our sincere appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana  for theadmirable and effective manner in which he conductedthe business of the forty-eighth session.Let me also commend our esteemedSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for thepurposeful manner in which he has discharged the dutiesof his office.My Government heartily welcomes South Africaback to the General Assembly. For decades  the policy ofapartheid kept that great country from participating in thework of the Assembly. Happily  apartheid has now beenconsigned to history. We salute all those who identifiedwith  and contributed to  the long struggle to eradicateapartheid and racism in South Africa. A special tributemust be paid to our brothers and sisters in South Africawho were the direct victims of that evil system and wholed the struggle for its eradication.We commend the vision and statesmanship ofPresident Nelson Mandela for his effective leadership inmanaging so skilfully the transition of a once-dividedsociety to a united  non-racial  democratic nation. Wecommend the courage and the untiring efforts of hisGovernment and the entire people of South Africa to healthe wounds of the past and launch their country on thepath of economic growth and prosperity on a foundationof justice and equity for all its citizens. We are confident11that the new South Africa will contribute positively to thework of the United Nations.In the last few years we have witnessed rapid andprofound changes on the international scene. Not only havecomplex challenges arisen  but also new opportunities forthe United Nations to redouble its efforts and contributionsto the quest for peace and security and to build a worldcharacterized by cooperation and an internationalcommunity nurtured by a common concern for humanity.It is a matter of serious concern that the peacefulworld expected to be ushered in by the end of the cold warhas not materialized. The world continues to face some ofthe worst forms of conflict and new threats to internationalpeace and security. Violent conflicts arising from resurgentnationalism and religious intolerance between and withinStates have proliferated. The unresolved situations inRwanda  Liberia  Somalia  Afghanistan  Cambodia  parts ofthe former Yugoslavia and parts of the former Soviet Unionhave caused wanton loss of life and destruction to propertyand have given rise to humanitarian crises of immenseproportions. We must find early and lasting solutions tothese conflicts  as they constitute continuing threats toregional stability and to world peace.Against this backdrop  the United Nations  as the focalpoint of international cooperation  should seek to redefineits role and establish new structures and mechanisms thatcan respond effectively to the challenges of crisismanagement and conflict resolution. The United Nationsmust retain its primary responsibility for taking the lead inaddressing these problems. The Secretary-General’sAgenda for Peace provides a novel and imaginativeframework towards this end.In the emerging world order Africa must not continueto remain a continent beset with crises and dependent onothers for resolution of its internal conflicts. In realizationof this  the Organization of African Unity (OAU)established in 1993 a Central Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Resolution and Management. However  it isevident that the OAU’s capacity to effectively mobilize therequired financial and logistic resources for this purpose isseverely limited. There is  therefore  a necessity for theinternational community and the United Nations toencourage  through increased financial and logistic support Africa’s efforts at peaceful settlements of disputes throughregional and other arrangements  in accordance with theUnited Nations Charter. We urge the internationalcommunity to contribute urgently and generously to theAfrica Peace Fund  established by the Organization ofAfrican Unity.The capacity of the United Nations to respondpromptly and effectively to the demands made on it forpeace-keeping operations depends on the willingness ofMember States to accept that there is a primary role forthe United Nations and that they be ready to contributethe necessary resources to enable it to fulfil such a role.Since our admission 34 years ago  Nigeria has been anactive participant in global efforts at peace-keeping conflict resolution and crisis management. Ourexperience over the years has convinced us that there isa clear need to re-examine and reorient the peace-keepingefforts of the United Nations. Since initiating in Liberiathe Economic Community of West African States MilitaryObserver Group (ECOMOG)  a subregional peace-keepingforce  Nigeria has become Africa’s and  indeed  theworld’s largest troop contributor to internationalpeace-keeping operations. Even though one or twoMember States may choose not to recognize itscontribution  the records at the disposal of thisOrganization will clearly show Nigeria’s significantcontribution to the shared responsibility of global peace-keeping  with its attendant sacrifices  including loss ofNigerian lives.That is why we are concerned at the incessantharassment  kidnapping and killing of peace-keepingpersonnel in various theatres of conflict. As anencouragement to other countries to participate in thesecostly and often dangerous operations  the United Nationsmust develop a capacity of effective deterrence againstsuch attacks and adopt appropriate measures to provideprompt and adequate compensation for the victims.One of the disturbing consequences of theproliferation of conflicts is the increasing incidence ofrefugees and displaced persons. It is our firm convictionthat Governments must create structures and suitableconditions which will enable peoples to live in a secureand safe environment in full enjoyment of their humanrights and fundamental freedoms. Regrettably  Africa hasthe largest number of refugees and displaced persons inthe world. This imposes additional and enormousfinancial  material and social burdens on the alreadydistressed economies of receiving States. We commendthe efforts of the international community in addressingthe refugee problems through the provision ofhumanitarian assistance. We call on all Governments toeradicate the root causes of the existence of refugees anddisplaced persons and to create the appropriate conditions12for facilitating their voluntary return to their variouscountries.Despite the end of the cold war  nuclear weaponscontinue to pose the greatest threat to international peaceand security. Consequently  the need to reduce substantiallyand ultimately eliminate them must remain our primarygoal. Recent reports of a rising trend of trafficking innuclear materials represent a disturbing new dimension tonuclear proliferation which must be checked as a matter ofurgency.Next year’s review and extension conference of thenon-proliferation Treaty  which has so far served theinternational community rather well  must be pursued withvigour. The review and extension of the Treaty must beconsistent with objective reality and the basic expectationsof Member States.Questions of peace and security are inextricably linkedto issues of development. We therefore welcome thepresentation by the Secretary-General of ""An Agenda forDevelopment"" (A/48/935)  which is a fitting complement tohis earlier proposals in ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277).In ""An Agenda for Development""  the Secretary-Generalhas identified five strands: peace as the foundation fordevelopment; the economy as the engine of progress; theenvironment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a pillarof society; and democracy as good governance. Nigeriawelcomes these presentations because we believe that thepeople must be at the centre of all governmental activity including the goals of development  peace and security.Global efforts in addressing the crisis of developmenthave  over the years  reflected a dichotomy of perceptionbetween the industrialized countries of the North and thedeveloping countries of the South. We must recognize thatdevelopment  like peace  is indivisible. It is therefore ofvital importance that the North and the South should seecooperation in development in terms of mutuality of interestand partnership. The expectation that the end of the coldwar would make more resources available for development especially in developing countries  has regrettably remainedunfulfilled. In the circumstances  the internationalcommunity should initiate bold and imaginative measuresto bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poornations. Affluence in the midst of poverty provides neitherpeace nor security either to the rich or to the poor.Africa continues to face grave economic difficulties at the heart of which is the debt crisis. The perennialproblems of declining investment  capital flight and fall incommodity prices remain. The response of theinternational community has been feeble and ratherinadequate. The United Nations Programme of Action forAfrica’s Economic Recovery and Development(UNPAAERD) did not achieve its desired objectives. Itdoes not appear that the New Agenda for Africa’sDevelopment in the 1990s will meet with much successeither. It is therefore imperative that Africa should beenabled to make a fresh start to address these problemseffectively through an imaginative solution to the debtcrisis and the diversification of its economies.For our part  we recognize the need for crediblemacro-economic policies  as well as for fundamentalreforms of our political institutions and processes  and weare taking measures in this regard. However  there is aneed to evolve new mechanisms and strategies forinternational cooperation and partnership.In the wake of the efforts made in structurallyreforming our economy and the democratizion of ourpolitical institutions  Nigeria  like many other Africancountries  has come to grips with certain realities  theramifications of which are usually misconstrued and needto be fully understood.Political pluralism  as a facet of democratization  isso deeply ingrained in our national way of life that overthe years we have tried to evolve appropriate democraticinstitutions and values arising from and responding to ourspecific national experiences  circumstances andaspirations. We remain committed to this process  whichis on course  despite its difficulties and challenges.Too often the process of democratization in Nigeriaand  indeed  in several other parts of Africa  has not beencorrectly presented to the international community.Recent advances in information technology and our lackof resources and capacity for information delivery havehampered our ability to objectively project developmentsoccurring in our societies. For instance  in Nigeria  wecontinue to make impressive progress in rebuildingsustainable democratic structures and institutions. AConstitutional Conference whose members were largelyelected and representing a wide spectrum of our societyand diverse interests  has been working assiduously tocreate an environment conducive to mutual trust confidence and common purpose among our people. Theobjective of the Conference is to establish appropriatemodalities  institutions and frameworks for a viabledemocratic order  by laying down the ground rules for theformation of political parties  and for conducting free and13fair elections at all levels of government. TheConstitutional Conference will complete its work byNovember 1994. Following the progress made so far political activities have already commenced and full-fledgedpolitical party activities leading to general elections willcommence early in the new year. The resolve andcommitment of the Nigerian people and Government todemocracy remain firm and unshakeable in the fullrealization that the task of democratization is primarily ourresponsibility and is for the good of our people.The United Nations has no doubt distinguished itselfsince its inception as an indispensable forum forharmonizing the actions of nations. We are confident thatit will continue to serve in the years ahead as a platform forgalvanizing and channelling our collective efforts towardslasting peace and justice. This is especially so if we lookinwards with a view to revitalizing and strengthening theOrganization itself. The Government of Nigeria endorsesthe view of the Secretary-General in his report ""An Agendafor Peace"" to the effect that to meet the challenges of a newera  the United Nations must reinforce its capacity torespond as well as to reorient its approach to issues whichconfront it. We subscribe to his recommendation thatMember States provide the necessary political commitmentand financial resources to enable the Organization toexpand  adapt and reinvigorate its work.The reforms undertaken by our Organization so farhave been essentially piecemeal and incremental. We havemade it clear on several occasions that the time was ripefor a fundamental restructuring of the United Nationssystem. The present composition and the decision-makingprocess of the Security Council do not adequately reflectcurrent realities brought into sharp relief since the end ofthe cold war. As an instrument for multilateral cooperation the United Nations must be transparent  efficient anddemocratic.The Security Council  as the most important organ ofthe United Nations  should embody the global quest fordemocratization in its structure  composition anddecision-making processes. In this regard  Nigeria attachesparticular importance to the work of the Open-EndedWorking Group on the question of equitable representationon and increase in the membership of the Security Council.It is our expectation that the recommendations that willemerge will make the United Nations more responsive tothe needs of the international community. We also expectthat the criteria for permanent membership of the Councilshould include such considerations as population  capacityto contribute to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  and a track record assessed over a period of timein international peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts.All permanent members should enjoy the same status andprivileges and assume the responsibilities incumbent onmembership. No less important is the imperative ofequitable geographical representation  which must includepermanent membership for Africa in the Security Council.In this connection  it is appropriate that I reconfirmNigeria’s offer to serve the international community as apermanent member of the Security Council.In this last decade of the twentieth century  twoissues have preoccupied the United Nations: thepromotion of peace and security and the intensification ofinternational cooperation for development. On bothissues  the United Nations has responded to our collectiveaspirations with varying degrees of success. As weapproach the twenty-first century  we must dedicateourselves anew to the full realization of these core goalsand objectives of our Organization so that mankind canenjoy peace  freedom and prosperity."
"125",5148,"NIC",49,1994,"I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to occupy the presidential chair of the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations onbehalf of Africa.Despite the great difficulties we are experiencingtoday  we can see encouraging signs for the future. Thegreat progress made during the preparatory work for theWorld Summit for Social Development and the WorldConference on Women gives rise to new hope for thecreation of a new international order.Our countries and our Organization face newchallenges that require creative and innovative responses ifwe are to make progress and avoid the danger of reversingthe headway that has been made since the end of the coldwar.When I began my term of office in 1990  I faced theenormous task of rescuing my country from war andrestoring faith in democracy to thousands of Nicaraguans.I had a great dream: that we the peoples that had been ableto free ourselves from dictatorships of one kind or anothercould unite and help one another  reconstructing democracyin our countries  and that all of us together could then begina great march away from totalitarian and authoritarianforms of government towards democracy.In July my dream became reality when the SecondInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracieswas held in Managua  with participants  observers  specialguests and international organizations from more than 70countries from four continents.In the Managua declaration  representatives to thisSecond International Conference expressed theirconviction that democracy is the only system that allowsfor a free  firm and steadfast union of nations for peace.We also agreed that the consolidation of democraticprocesses was a key factor in guaranteeing peace andinternational security.The Managua declaration clearly establishes theessential ties between democracy and social and economicdevelopment  and between democracy and citizenparticipation.It should also be stressed that the ManaguaDeclaration states the following: that the future of thenew and restored democracies as well as the future ofpeace are linked to the international community’sresponse to such matters as external debt  protectionismin developed countries  insufficient concessional fundsavailable for development  poverty  and the impact onlow-income groups of economic adjustment processes.The plan of action approved by the Conferencepromotes modalities for cooperation that take into accountthe particular features of the new or restored democraciesand the promotion of internal commitments in eachcountry to strengthen democracy. In Nicaragua we havealready created a permanent forum for democracy andpeace in which wide sectors of the civilian populationparticipate.On behalf of the new or restored democracies  Iwould like to take this opportunity to make a request ofthe United Nations Secretary-General that  in accordancewith the established procedures and during this session ofthe General Assembly  a decision be taken to undertakea study on the ways in which the United Nations couldsupport the efforts of Governments to consolidate new orrestored democracies.I would like to appeal to the countries representedhere to give special attention to the difficulties we arenow facing during this fragile transition process  as weare attempting to consolidate democracy; we appeal tothem to support our efforts and the commitments made inour plan of action.We cannot allow our dreams and the great sacrificesand suffering of millions of people who struggled forliberty to be in vain.9It is with great sadness that we see the gap betweenrich and poor countries dangerously increasingly rather thandiminishing. According to the United Nations report onhuman development  more than one billion people in theworld are still languishing in abject poverty. In 1960  therichest 20 per cent of the world’s population had an income30 times greater than that of the poorest 20 per cent. By1990  the gap had deepened: by then the richest20 per cent had incomes 60 times greater and 20 per centof humanity receives 80 per cent of the world’s income.As pointed out in this year’s report on humandevelopment  in places where world trade is entirely freeand open  those benefiting are in general the strongest.Developing countries enter the market as unequal partnersand end up with unequal rewards.A large percentage of the new or restored democraciesare to be found among the poorest countries. As aconsequence  they are excluded from the benefits ofdevelopment. We must all work together to change thissituation.Today Central America is one of the best examples ofthe new wave of democracy. Democracy is nowestablished is all of our countries. In less than a year  wehave had four free elections in our region that producednew Governments. Respect for civil and political rights hasbeen strengthened; conditions which enable more people toenjoy economic  social and cultural rights have been createdand civil power is prevailing over military power. Respectfor and protection of human rights is increasing. We aregradually becoming a region of peace  liberty  democracyand development.Next October  the Central American countries willsign the Alliance for Sustainable Development. ThisAlliance is a major effort at the political  social  economicand environmental levels to create a new and improveddevelopment model which can preserve the resources andway of life of future generations in Central America.Once again  I would like to thank organizations andcountries that have provided continuous and valuablesupport to Nicaragua and Central America. They havemade resources available  and have helped find new andefficient solutions for establishing and consolidating peacewhile achieving sustainable human development. We arecertain that this spirit of cooperation will be manifestedonce again at the International Conference on Peace andDevelopment in Central America  to be held in Honduras.Last year  before the General Assembly  I made adetailed presentation on the political and economicsituation of my country  and about our real prospects.My country has made great efforts to attain amacroeconomic balance and at the same time establish afirm foundation for sustainable development.We have made substantial progress in the last fouryears in improving public finance. We have significantlyreduced inflation  re-established relations with foreign-debt holders and multilateral agencies  and implementedstructural adjustment reforms.The success of this difficult programme and theattainment of sustainable development will depend  to alarge extent  on our ability to promote production andinvestment  to increase employment and improve thequality of life for our people  and on the quality of theinternational support we receive.In order to consolidate and deepen the democraticprocess in Nicaragua  this September I approved the lawon military organization. This new law clearly establishesthat the armed forces are subordinate to civil power. Thearmed forces have now been transformed into a small non-partisan  efficient body  appropriate to the transitionperiod in Nicaraguan society.In compliance with the General Assembly resolutiondeclaring the celebration of this year as the InternationalYear of the Family  we have established a nationalcommission to coordinate the efforts of differentgovernment and social agencies to support the family asthe main nucleus of society and the main agent for thetransmission and development of values such as thecommon good  equality and mutual respect.Within the framework of the strengthening of thefamily  I wish to reiterate once again our commitment togiving the highest priority to the protection anddevelopment of children. We made this commitment atthe World Summit for Children in September 1990.Also  taking into account our commitment to respectfor  and to the observance of  human rights  myGovernment will create an office of ombudsman inNicaragua.As we approach the next millennium  humanity stillfaces critical questions that threaten our societies and ourdevelopment. We cannot  however  deny that substantial10advances are being made to remove the main sources ofconflict that linger in various continents.For this reason we welcome with great satisfaction thesigning of the agreements concluded between theGovernments of Israel and of Jordan and between Israeland Palestine. This will help to improve security andstability in the Middle East.At the same time  we welcome the efforts being madeto reach a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.Nicaragua rejoices greatly in the inauguration of thenew democratic and non-racist Government in South Africa.This augurs well for a new era of prosperity and peace forthe whole population of that brotherly country and forsouthern Africa.We support the strengthening of democracy inMozambique. Thus Nicaraguans will participate in theUnited Nations mission to observe next October’s elections.It is still necessary to promote new internationalinitiatives in the search for a definitive political solution tothe situation in the former Yugoslavia and to the sad eventsin Rwanda that continue so to shake the world’sconscience. This requires wider and stronger mechanismsfor humanitarian protection  as well as for regional security.I should like to make special mention of the crisis inHaiti. Nicaragua welcomes with satisfaction the diplomaticway out and the negotiated solution to the Haitian crisis.All available peaceful means should be used to guaranteereconciliation among the long-suffering people of Haiti  aswell as and the re-establishment of constitutional order.Finally  we believe that  within the new internationalorder  it is necessary for the United Nations to recognizethe rights of the Republic of China in Taiwan  within theframework of universal participation and respect for humanrights.I feel sure that the future will not conceal from us thegreat difficulties that humanity still faces. We must worktogether  with what we have at hand  to make this world amore dignified place for all of us  regardless of race  creedor political belief  to live in.Next year we shall celebrate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe founding of the United Nations. We hope that theSecurity Council  at its summit meeting of Heads of Stateto be held in New York on that occasion  will adopt someimportant decisions  particularly with regard torestructuring of the Security Council to provide forequitable geographical representation and an increase inthe number of members.I wish  on behalf of the people of Nicaragua and onbehalf of the new or restored democracies thatparticipated in the conference in Managua  to reaffirm ourdeep commitment to contributing to the development ofa world society inspired by progress  liberty  democracyand peace."
"126",5195,"NLD",49,1994,"First of all  Ishould like to extend congratulations to the President onhis election.My colleague Foreign Minister Kinkel  on behalf ofthe European Union  has just given a broad overview ofour approach to the United Nations. The great challengeswhich the United Nations faces today are wellsummarized in his statement.The idea that the world is divided into a North anda South with greatly diverging interests is being replacedby a growing awareness that the fundamental problemswe face are common  global problems - to ensuresustainable development  to protect our environment  tosolve the population problem  to prevent social20disintegration  to uphold justice and to protect the dignityof the human person.The United Nations will have to play a central role inour common efforts to find answers to these globalproblems. There is a need for coherent  integrated policiesfor problems which have so far been treated largely asseparate questions - problems of peace and security development  trade  democracy and human rights  theenvironment. The United Nations ""Agenda for Peace"" andits agenda for development are closely connected.By building on its comparative advantages the UnitedNations can play its role as the primary institution forglobal international cooperation which is envisaged in itsCharter. We  the Member States  will have to enable theUnited Nations to do so.Are we really providing this body with the necessarymeans to live up to expectations? It has becomefashionable  when expectations are not met  to blameshortcomings on the United Nations itself. I tend to take adifferent view. Member States are to be blamed at least asmuch as the Organization which struggles as our faithfulservant. Rather than making the United Nations ourscapegoat  Member States have first of all to make anhonest and serious effort  through timely and full paymentof financial contributions  to provide it with the means toplay the role we expect it to play.But we need a change in attitude as well. Asinhabitants of the global village  we can no longer remainindifferent to the fate of our fellow human beings  even ifthey live on a different continent. CNN brings theirproblems right into our living rooms  visible  immediate inescapable. Rwanda  Haiti and former Yugoslavia  Gomaand Vukovar - tragedies such as these touch the conscienceof citizens in all parts of the globe.How do we respond to this? The prerequisites forsuccessful action by the United Nations are credibility andlegitimacy. To put it differently: the United Nations mustbecome an institution in which all peoples of the world arefairly represented and have a fair say in decision-making.There must be a balance between burdens and benefits forall and  most importantly  there must be an awareness at thelevel of both Governments and individuals that the UnitedNations can make a difference.The paradox is that the distance between decision-makers and those represented seems to grow  in spite of theincrease in the speed and volume of communications. Thisdoes not affect solely the credibility - and therefore the legitimacy -of the United Nations. The credibility of State structuresat the national level is equally at stake.Everywhere in the world  including in what used tobe called the first  the second and the third worlds  we seea profound cynicism about government and Governments.This is partly due to the fact that certain expectationscannot any longer be met. The power of Governmentshas been diminished because many important activities especially in the economic sphere  have moved fromGovernment into private or corporate hands. They arenot quite outside the sphere of direct action ofGovernments and  for that matter  of the United Nations.However  a substantial part of this widespreadcynicism stems from the perception of a lack of commondecency  from the feeling that Governments andinstitutions work for their own good in the first place andthat the interest of the people whom they are supposed toserve comes second.In this respect I think we can take heart from thesuccess of the International Conference on Population andDevelopment held recently at Cairo. That success wasbuilt on a formula that essentially amounted to commondecency  namely  to face the population problem notthrough coercion and discrimination but by giving peoplethe means to follow  freely and responsibly  the path oftheir own choice. This should serve as an example for usas Governments with regard to other matters as well.If we apply the criteria of fairness and decency tothe United Nations  then it is clear that major adjustmentsare needed. In some fields work on this task has startedand a number of preliminary steps have been taken - forinstance  the appointment of an inspector general. Weshould not deceive ourselves  however  into believing thateverything is therefore well. Good bookkeeping isessential  but fraud never constituted the core of theUnited Nations problem. Even good management immensely important though it is  is only a necessarytool.Let me mention some of my priorities for an agendafor a revitalized United Nations. The tremendousincrease in peace-keeping operations clearly signals achange in the role of the Security Council. The emphasisis more and more on cooperative crisis management resolution and prevention in various regional conflicts.The permanent members of the Council are expected totake a leading role when countries are requested to21contribute the means needed to implement the Council’sdecisions. In this new era the yardstick for great-Powerstatus is no longer the number of nuclear bombs but nowthe concrete contribution that a country is prepared and ableto make to the cooperative effort to stem the tide of war misery and poverty in the world.For this reason the Netherlands is in favour of theadmission of Germany and Japan to the Security Council aspermanent members. Both countries have an impeccablerecord as Members of the United Nations. They haveexpressed their willingness to shoulder a larger part of thecommon burden  and they have the power and the means todo so. Their permanent presence on the Security Councilwould therefore significantly strengthen the authority andcapabilities of the United Nations as a whole. The questionof equitable representation of various geographical regionswill also have to be addressed for the sake of the Council’slegitimacy in the eyes of the world at large. All in all  webelieve that it is possible to achieve consensus on anexpansion to a total number of seats somewhere in the lowtwenties. This would indeed be a most significant steptowards improving the credibility and legitimacy of theUnited Nations.At least as important however is enhancedtransparency and closer coordination between the SecurityCouncil and the United Nations membership at large. Myown country’s position may illustrate this point. TheKingdom of the Netherlands is de facto the eleventh highestcontributor to the budget of the United Nations. We are intenth position in terms of the numbers of military personnelcontributed to peace-keeping operations  yet we are notinvolved in the Council’s decisions in which the mandatesand modalities of these operations are laid down.As in government  there should be no taxation withoutrepresentation. The members of the Security Council haveto remember that they exercise their authority on behalf ofthe entire membership of the Organization. For thatpurpose they need the confidence of the General Assembly.The Council can no longer operate as an exclusive club.Therefore the Netherlands is in favour of the creation of asubsidiary organ of the Council  where all aspects of peace-keeping operations could be discussed with major troopcontributors.Moreover  we join those who call for systematic andindependent reporting and evaluation of peace-keepingoperations. The reports should not end up  labelled""Confidential""  in the desks of the United Nationsbureaucracy. Those who contribute and the people whomthey represent have a rightful claim to this information.On this score as well  the principle of accountability musturgently be introduced in the interest of the overallcredibility of the United Nations.Another area with important potential for improvingthe working of the United Nations system is that of theregional organizations. Together with Germany  theNetherlands has argued for a more active role for theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE) as the regional United Nations arrangement forEurope. I strongly believe that the United Nations shouldapply what the European Union calls subsidiarity. Thisprinciple means that the higher level should not deal withmatters that can be dealt with satisfactorily at the lowerand more specialized level. Responsibility should beexercised as close as possible to the grass roots.European countries should try to solve their ownproblems in the framework of the CSCE before droppingthem into the lap of the United Nations. This  however remains a matter for voluntary regional cooperation  andin no way detracts from the primary responsibility of theSecurity Council.In Africa  we see encouraging signs of adevelopment in the same direction. In the framework ofthe Organization of African Unity  as well as at regionaland subregional levels  efforts are being made to developa regional peace-keeping capacity. These initiativesdeserve our wholehearted support. On the other hand  theNetherlands shares the concern of these countries thatself-reliance in this domain should not cut them off fromassistance and active involvement by the internationalcommunity through the United Nations.In Rwanda  for instance  African countries arecontributing most of the personnel for the operation of theUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda(UNAMIR). Other United Nations Members haveprovided equipment  logistical and financial support andtransportation. The Netherlands has made a contributionin matériel to match the deployment of a peace-keepingcontingent by Zambia. This may provide a model formore permanent  structural means of practical cooperationbetween countries in the region and those outside - a kindof mutual adoption arrangement.Much has been said about the need for an enhancedearly-warning capacity. In fact  in most cases theinformation was available before crises erupted intoviolence. But  as the former Yugoslavia hasdemonstrated  early warning is not sufficient if States are22not willing and ready to undertake early action once apotential crisis has been identified.A similar remark can be made about the UnitedNations system of stand-by forces. This is an excellentidea  and the system may serve as a useful database for theUnited Nations. But it is no guarantee of greater efficiencyin all circumstances. In connection with Rwanda  thesystem was put to the test for the first time. The results ofthat test were extremely discouraging. None of thecountries that had indicated possible contributions werewilling to provide troops for rapid deployment. What is theuse of an instrument if the political will to use it is lacking?Regrettably  lessons are drawn mostly when it is toolate. The human tragedy in Rwanda will always remain ashame for the international community. Collectively  wemust acknowledge that we had ample warning of impendingdisaster and that we could have done more to prevent thegenocide. In this context I have been struck by the wordsof a high-ranking United Nations official:""A mechanized brigade deployed in Kigali within 7 to14 days might have stabilized the situation.""If this is true  then the moral dimension of our failure toprovide the United Nations with the necessary meansbecomes all too apparent. If deploying a brigade couldhave prevented the indiscriminate slaughter of manyhundreds of thousands  what prevented us from doing so?Let us face it: the reason for our inaction was neitherlack of means nor lack of time. The reason was that  underthe circumstances  no Government was prepared to risk thelives of its citizens. The physical danger was consideredtoo high.How can we resolve this dilemma? Hand-wringingwill not absolve us from our responsibility in a situation ofgenocide. Either we act upon our feeling of horror andindignation  or we stop moralizing. If Member States arenot in a position to provide the necessary militarypersonnel  will it then not become unavoidable for us toconsider the establishment of a full-time  professional  at alltimes available and rapidly deployable United Nationsbrigade for this purpose - a ""United Nations Legion"" at thedisposal of the Security Council? Such a relatively small international  all-volunteer ""fire brigade"" may enable theUnited Nations to save lives in situations such as Rwanda.Its establishment could help to solve the dilemmas that we Governments  face when trying to come to grips with thephenomenon of the failed State.Of course  the preferable way to deal with conflictsis by preventing them. In Europe  the discreet activitiesof the High Commissioner for National Minoritiesappointed by the Conference on Security and Cooperationin Europe  and those of other actors  have undoubtedlyplayed a crucial role in defusing potential crises in theBaltic and other regions. It is a fact of life in politics thatsolutions and happy endings quietly achieved do notattract the same attention as failures and disasters.Trusted and respected personalities could play a similarrole in other regions. As Minister Hurd said last year:for the expense involved in the deployment of onebattalion of peace-keepers  the Secretary-General can senda great many personal representatives.I also wish to say a few words about the aftermathof conflicts that could not be prevented: the punishmentof those responsible for crimes against humanity. It is ofthe utmost importance not only that these terrible crimesbe condemned by the international community but alsothat those responsible for these crimes  as well as theactual perpetrators  be prosecuted. Strangely enough  thiswas done only at the end of the Second World War. Butnow at last we see the establishment of an internationaltribunal for crimes committed in the former Yugoslaviaand the start of a broad discussion on a future tribunal forRwanda.Punishment of war criminals and ethnic cleansers isnot a matter of revenge. It is a matter of justice and alsoa matter of deterrence. Impunity encourages futurecrimes against humanity. We therefore strongly supportboth tribunals; as well as the early establishment of aninternational criminal court that will exercise jurisdictionwith regard to serious crimes of international concern.With the introduction of a draft statute for such aninternational criminal court  a major step forward hasbeen made.In closing  let me emphasize my fundamental point:the credibility of the authority exercised by Governmentsand by the United Nations. In the former Yugoslavia andelsewhere  the world community has failed to stop thebreakdown of civil society and the descent into barbarity.Such failures undermine people’s belief in the authorityof the United Nations  in the authority of regionalorganizations  in the authority of Governments  andindeed in public authority as such. The authority of anational Government does not depend only on its owncredibility; it also depends on the credibility of the widerinternational authority in which it participates. Therefore it is in our own national interest to uphold that wider23authority. We can only do this if we provide the UnitedNations with the tools it needs to face its daunting task."
"127",5240,"NOR",49,1994,"It is an honour for me tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to yourhigh office.As the United Nations approaches its fiftiethanniversary  its global agenda is more comprehensive thanever before. Norway welcomes this. We need andsupport an even stronger United Nations role in thepeaceful settlement of disputes; preventive diplomacy andpeace-keeping; the advocacy of human rights  includingwomen’s rights; and humanitarian aid  sustainabledevelopment and environmental protection. We wish tosee this forty-ninth session of the General Assembly maketangible contributions towards improving theOrganization’s performance in all these important areas.As we assemble this year  we can look back onconcrete results in several areas following years of strongUnited Nations involvement. In particular  it is with deepsatisfaction that we now welcome the newly electedGovernment of South Africa to this year’s session of theGeneral Assembly. This is a historic moment  both forSouth Africa and for the United Nations. I would like totake this opportunity to pay tribute to the South Africanpeople. They have put a painful past behind them andhave charted a new course.Without the strong support of the United Nations the democratization process in South Africa wouldundoubtedly have been slower. Norway’s political andeconomic support for the democratic forces dates back tothe 1960s and 1970s. We will continue to support theSouth African people by working with the democraticallyelected Government. A democratic  prosperous SouthAfrica will have a positive impact on the whole Africancontinent. Common security and cooperation can nowreplace front lines and confrontation. We hope that SouthAfrica will be in a position to contribute substantially toconflict-resolution and peace-keeping.16The historic developments in South Africa have beenparalleled in the peace process in the Middle East. Twoweeks ago we observed the anniversary of the signing byIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) ofthe Declaration of Principles  following talks in Oslo.During the past year the peace process has been furtherconsolidated. It was a source of great satisfaction to usthat  one year to the day after the signing  and once againin Oslo  the parties were able to iron out certain differenceswhich had been obstructing the peace process. I would liketo compliment both Israel and the PLO on theirdetermination to follow through on the commitments theyhave made.However  the commitment of the parties alone is notenough. The international community must shoulder itsresponsibilities  and I appeal urgently to Member States forcontributions  especially to meet the short-term needs of thePalestinian Authority. In our capacity as Chair of the AdHoc Liaison Committee  we shall continue to work bothwith donor countries and with the parties themselves toensure that the peace dividend benefits Palestinians in theirdaily lives.In our view  the United Nations should take on newresponsibilities with respect to channelling economicassistance to the Palestinians  especially to the Palestinianpolice force. The General Assembly must also address thenew relationship that has developed between Israel and thePalestinians. Our deliberations and decisions on MiddleEast matters must reflect the new reality created by theparties themselves.In Guatemala the peace process has now reached aturning point. The very active and constructive role playedby the United Nations has led to significant advances at thenegotiating table this year. Norway  as a member of theGroup of Friends  would like to commend the Governmentof Guatemala  the URNG and the Guatemalan people onthe important agreements signed in Puebla and in Oslo.We now urge the parties to keep up the momentum of thenegotiating process. Norway will contribute to the humanrights verification Mission to Guatemala. It is our hopethat this Mission will encourage the parties to resume thepeace negotiations without further delay.In the former Yugoslavia the tragedy continues. Yetanother chapter in the endless human suffering caused bythe war is unfolding. Thousands of Muslims are beingforced to leave their homes in Serb-held territory innorth-eastern Bosnia  adding to the countless numbers fromall groups that have been displaced during this conflict.Reports tell us of detention  rape and plunder. We appealto the parties to the conflict to stop this senselessbrutality  and we welcome last week’s Security Councilresolution which strongly condemns this practice. Whilewe continue to press for a political settlement  we mustkeep up the humanitarian relief efforts for the victims ofthis meaningless conflict.A lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina can beachieved only by political means  not by military force.The Contact Group’s proposal has our full support and theBosnian Serbs must be persuaded to accept this packagedeal. The decision made by the authorities of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to severall political and economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs isa step in the right direction. We welcome the initiativetaken by the co-chairmen  Lord Owen and ThorvaldStoltenberg  to deploy an international mission on theborder between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina. Norway has already contributed personneland is also involved in the logistics of this operation.Security Council resolution 943 (1994) of 23 September1994 on sanctions demonstrates  therefore  the resolve ofthe international community to press for a politicalsettlement.As we press for negotiated solutions both in Bosniaand Herzegovina and in Croatia  it is also incumbent onthe outside world to do nothing that can prolong theconflict or cause it to escalate. The flow of arms into theformer Yugoslavia must be halted. The arms embargomust not be lifted now  for this could have unforeseeableconsequences and would certainly endanger theUNPROFOR troops and jeopardize humanitarian reliefefforts.Peace-keeping activities constitute the mostimportant tool at the disposal of the United Nations forresolving conflicts and promoting peace. Norwayadvocates strengthening such functions. As MemberStates  we must be willing to enable the United Nationsto do in the field what we profess to support in theconference rooms. Nearly 1 per cent of the entireNorwegian population has participated in peace-keepingoperations.It is important that the Organization’s capability ofconducting peace-keeping operations be continuouslyenhanced. At last year’s session of the GeneralAssembly  the Nordic countries presented an initiative tostrengthen United Nations command and control17capabilities in peace-keeping operations. I feel encouragedby the progress made on various related issues during thelast 12 months. However  there is room for furtherimprovement. These matters should be treated with someurgency.Proper communication between the Security Counciland the troop-contributing countries is particularlyimportant. While we acknowledge the improvementsalready made in this respect  we still feel that furtherprogress is needed. I propose that regular consultations andinformation-sharing be instituted between members of theSecurity Council  the troop-contributing countries and theSecretariat of the United Nations.A new role for regional organizations in conflictresolution and securing peace is emerging  not only inEurope but also in other parts of the world. In Europe theEuropean Union is playing an increasingly important roleas it develops its political and economic contacts in anall-European context. Nothing could be more worthwhilethan transforming Europe  the cradle of two world wars into a continent with a solid framework of political economic  social and cultural cooperation across the olddivides. Hence  the European Union is shaping the futureof Europe in a significant manner - and is indeed alsomaking important contributions in a global perspective.These are two major reasons why Norway is seekingmembership in the European Union.Regional organizations should take on moreresponsibility for peace-keeping in the future. Nevertheless we must not confuse the growing need for regional actionwith the fundamental role of the Security Council as themain guardian of international peace and security.Nowhere have peace and security been moresystematically set aside during the last year than in Africa.The genocide we have witnessed in Rwanda has shockedthe entire world  and has brutally reminded us of thehorrifying behaviour such conflicts may generate. We aredeeply committed to the principle that those charged withcrimes against humanity must be brought to trial.More than ever  Africa needs our support to overcomethe prevailing crises. I welcome the increasingly importantrole played by the Organization of African Unity. Norwaystands ready to support regional processes to encouragecloser cooperation among African nations with a view toaccelerating economic growth and democratization.Social and economic problems are closely linked toconflict and unrest. A global perspective is needed ifsolutions are to be found and progress made. No otherorganization has the potential of the United Nations toprovide such a perspective. Development-relatedeconomic and social issues must remain high on theUnited Nations agenda. I therefore welcome theSecretary-General’s preliminary report on an Agenda forDevelopment. The five dimensions of developmentsingled out in the report provide a useful framework forthought as well as action. Peace  economic growth  theenvironment  justice and democracy are indeed the keyparameters in our common drive towards a better worldfor all.We are now looking forward to the Secretary-General’s supplementary report  which we hope willinitiate a debate on the appropriate role of the UnitedNations in global efforts for development  based on thecomparative advantages of the Organization.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo will be looked upon as a turningpoint in the history of population policy as it relates tosocial development and women’s rights. The conclusionswill have a wide-ranging impact on democracy-building educational policies  health-care programmes and thestatus of women. Both that Conference and next year’sWorld Summit for Social Development and the FourthWorld Conference on the Status of Women representmilestones in the effort to renew our commitment tofulfilling basic human needs.At the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development in 1992  we pledged to commitourselves to fulfilling the challenges of Agenda 21.These include strengthening efforts to change presentunsustainable patterns of consumption and production particularly in the industrialized world. I should like toemphasize the importance of this issue. Norway willcontinue to promote the efforts of the Commission onSustainable Development in this respect.Over the years  the United Nations has taken on anincreasingly important role in the field of human rights.For us  this remains a high-priority issue. The close linkbetween democracy  human rights and development hasbeen brought home to us once again by the tragedy ofHaiti. Norway fully supports Security Council resolution940 (1994) and will contribute to restoring democracy andhuman rights in the troubled country of Haiti.18The establishment of the post of High Commissionerfor Human Rights was warmly welcomed by the NorwegianGovernment. All countries must now cooperate fully withthe new High Commissioner. Regrettably  the past year hasonce again seen unacceptable violations of human rights inmany countries  resulting in untold human suffering. Weurge all States to ensure that minimum standards for theprotection of basic human rights are observed at all times even during internal conflicts and disturbances.Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right.My Government remains deeply concerned by the continuedthreat voiced against Salman Rushdie and all thoseassociated with his works. We repeat our call to theIranian authorities to remove this extra-territorial andintolerable threat.For years disarmament and arms control have beencentral to our deliberations. Today we are facing newchallenges in this field. The need for a comprehensive banon all nuclear testing is indeed a top priority issue. Weexpect all nuclear Powers to refrain from testing during theongoing negotiations. Substantial results should beachieved before the 1995 Non-Proliferation TreatyConference. This would facilitate the indefinite andunconditional extension of the Treaty  which is another itemof the utmost importance on our arms control agenda.The increased risk of proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  of nuclear and chemical material  associatedtechnology and means of delivery is a major securitychallenge that we must take steps to eliminate. The recentattempts to conduct an illegal trade in nuclear material arealarming and demand immediate action.Increasingly  our security is threatened by theenormous deposits of nuclear waste on land and at sea. Wemust do everything within our power to counter this risk.The Nordic countries and Russia are planning aninternational conference on nuclear waste management  incooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA). In order to deal with these problems  substantialfinancial and technological resources will be required. Tothis end  Norway has proposed the establishment of aninternational action plan for nuclear waste management matched by an international fund similar to the nuclearsafety account in the European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment. We call upon the international communityto mobilize the resources necessary to deal effectively withthese problems.Before concluding  I would like to draw attention toa matter of great concern to Norway: the necessity toensure a rational  responsible exploitation of marineresources. This should indeed be a matter of importanceto all countries  whether they are coastal States orlandlocked. Norway is deeply concerned by theincreasing problem of excessive exploitation of straddlingand highly migratory fish stocks through unregulatedfishing on the high seas. The effectiveness ofconservation measures is thus being eroded  and therecovery of stocks is being halted or even reversed byStates claiming free access to such stocks. The situationcalls for urgent and effective legally-binding measures tocounter the threat to important fish stocks and the coastalcommunities directly dependent on them. Therefore  theoutcome of the United Nations Conference on StraddlingFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks will becrucial in this respect. All of us  coastal and fishingStates alike  share the responsibility for ensuring that theConference succeeds in establishing a solid foundation forthe long-term conservation and sustainable use of thesefish stocks.In closing  I would like to emphasize thefundamental importance of a sound financial basis for theUnited Nations to perform its work. It is incumbent onall of us to do what we can in this respect. As weapproach next year’s anniversary  we owe it to thefounders to ensure that the Organization they created -our most important custodian of international peace andglobal security - is in the possession of the necessarymeans to discharge all its obligations."
"128",5286,"NPL",49,1994,"It is a special pleasure for meto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy  ForeignMinister of Côte d’Ivoire  on his unanimous election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. We are confident that under his able leadership thedeliberations of this session will come to a fruitfulconclusion. My delegation extends its full support to himin carrying out his important duties.I should also like to express my delegation’sappreciation to His Excellency Ambassador Samuel R.Insanally  the Permanent Representative of the Republicof Guyana to the United Nations  for successfullypresiding over the General Assembly during its forty-eighth session. I also take this opportunity to express myadmiration to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the dedication  commitment and insightwith which he has been serving the United Nations.Since the end of the cold war the world communityhas faced many developments  both encouraging anddisturbing. As a Vice-Chairman of the SpecialCommittee against Apartheid — now dissolved — Nepalfeels particularly happy about the end of the apartheidregime in South Africa. As President Mandela said in hisspeech earlier in this session  it was one of the ironies ofour age that it was only so late in the twentieth centurythat such a regime came to an end. The United Nationsrole in the establishment of a united democratic andnon-racist South Africa has been gratifying to all of us.The end of apartheid represents progress on the part ofmankind in its history of civilization. The statesmanshipof President Mandela can be a source of inspiration forthose who are in search of freedom  peace and justiceelsewhere in the world.Nepal also welcomes the progress in the MiddleEast peace process and looks forward to the establishmentof comprehensive peace in the region. We hope that suchachievements will inspire peoples in conflict with eachother elsewhere to end their hostilities  and to start similarpeace processes.There are also disturbing areas of conflict. TheNepalese people are grieved at the enormous loss of lifeand the extensive material devastation in Rwanda. It isour hope that with the active support of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) in conflict resolution  the UnitedNations peace-keeping efforts will facilitate the process ofrestoring normalcy and a peaceful civil society inRwanda.Nepal also appreciates the role played by the OAUin Burundi in terms of conflict prevention  managementand resolution. We hope that the OAU mechanism willbe applied effectively to other troubled parts of the regionsuch as Somalia  Angola and Liberia  in order to restorenormalcy.Nepal is also deeply distressed by the tragedy which despite the Security Council’s resolutions  continues21unabated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We would like tourge all the parties concerned to seek peace throughdialogue and negotiation rather than through violence.Nepal also looks forward to an early restoration of thedemocratically elected Government in Haiti  which alonecan ensure full respect for human rights in that country.We are meeting on the eve of the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations  which will be a time for us to reflecton the past five decades and plan for the next 50 years.Born as a result of the Second World War  the UnitedNations has over the past five decades ceaselessly deployedefforts to prevent a third world war. Disarmament especially nuclear disarmament  has therefore been one ofits major concerns. The United Nations also made constantefforts to bring peace to the Middle East and to put an endto apartheid in South Africa  and it remained engaged inmany other areas of conflict. However  the last fivedecades  characterized by the cold war  almost paralysedthe United Nations.The East-West divide seriously hampered the UnitedNations efforts in most conflict situations. A number ofimportant agreements were reached and many peacenegotiations were held outside the United Nations.Nevertheless  those achievements were in conformity withthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations  and theUnited Nations provided an important global forum fordiscussion  which helped defuse major global catastrophes.Thus  in the ultimate analysis  the United Nations hasundoubtedly made significant contributions to internationalrelations. Moreover  the United Nations and its specializedagencies and other related bodies  such as the UnitedNations Development Programme  the United NationsChildren’s Fund  the World Health Organization  the UnitedNations Population Fund  the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations and many others  havebeen engaged in improving social and economic conditionsaround the world.Since the cold war  whose enormous cost adverselyaffected the lives of billions of people  is now over  we atthe United Nations  standing — as it were — at thecrossroads of history  can now define the Organization’srole and work for the next 50 years.With such rapid changes taking place in internationalrelations  particularly in recent years  the United Nationsneeds to be restructured and revitalized. The restructuringof the Security Council has assumed a particular urgency.Nepal strongly supports an increase in the membership ofthe Council to reflect  not only the increase in the generalmembership of the United Nations  but also the reality ofthe present world. A review of the Council’s membershiphas also to take into account the contributions of MemberStates to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. We attach a high priority to greatertransparency and openness in the Council’s work  andalso attach great importance to the principle of equitablerepresentation  which would give all United NationsMembers — large or small  rich or poor  powerful orweak — a reasonable opportunity to contribute to thework of the Council.We hope that the work of the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Security Council and related issues will befruitful in due time. Our delegation considers that thereform and expansion of the Security Council should alsoinclude measures geared to reforming its workingmethods and procedures. In addition  there is a need toenhance the relationship between the Security Council andthe General Assembly  in accordance with the relevantprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations.The changed context of international relations andthe United Nations preoccupation with peace-keepingoperations should not be allowed to deflect attention fromefforts to achieve general and complete disarmamentunder effective international control. Rather  thepropitious climate now prevailing calls for strengtheningthe role of the United Nations in arms control anddisarmament. In this context  I wish to recall theunanimous political support expressed by the GeneralAssembly at its last session for the decision of theConference on Disarmament to give to its Ad HocCommittee on a Nuclear Test Ban a mandate to negotiatesuch a ban. To this end  the Non-Aligned Movement  ofwhich Nepal is a founding member  has called for aspecial session of the United Nations General Assemblyon disarmament in order to undertake a comprehensiveassessment of progress towards global disarmament.Like the rest of the international community  Nepallooks forward to the early conclusion of a comprehensivetreaty prohibiting nuclear tests in all atmospheres. A non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable test-ban treatywould have a positive impact on the success of theConference on the review and extension of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which is dueto be held in 1995.In addition to pursuing confidence-buildingmeasures  the United Nations role in arms control anddisarmament needs to be effectively strengthened. In this22context  the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace andDisarmament can play an important role  as they providemuch-needed forums for the exchange of views. The UnitedNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament inAsia and the Pacific has already held several meetings topromote such a process of dialogue and interaction.Nepal is firm in its conviction that peace-keepingoperations  though extremely important  especially in thispost-cold-war period  are no substitute for the peacefulresolution of conflicts through political dialogue andmediation. Application of Chapter VII of the Charter of theUnited Nations in the restoration and maintenance ofinternational peace and security should be invoked by theSecurity Council only as a last resort  fully respecting theprinciples of impartiality and non-selectivity. Nepal hassupported fully the Secretary-General’s initiative inexpanding preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution.We have consistently committed our troops to the peace-keeping operations undertaken by the United Nationsthrough the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon andthe United Nations Protection Force.Besides serving in Cambodia during the critical stageof democratic elections there  Nepal has also sent civilianpolice monitors for electoral assistance in Mozambique.Nepal has also sent troops to Somalia  despite the heavyloss of life and casualties suffered by our young men. Wewould like to pay tribute to those Nepalese soldiers and tothe others who gave their lives in the relentless pursuit ofinternational peace and security. Prime MinisterGiri ja Prasad Koirala  in a recent statement to theroundtable on United Nations peace-keeping operations inKathmandu  stated:“While the Government (of Nepal) has raised itsvoice at the United Nations and in appropriateinternational forums for more effective mechanismsfor the safety and protection of our personnel  theGovernment reaffirms its commitment to continue toparticipate in such operations with a sense ofresponsibility and solemn obligation.”Since peace-keeping operations have become morecomplicated and more expensive in recent years  there isgreater urgency to make those operations cost-effective andefficient. Peace-keeping contributions must be paid in fulland on time so that the troop — contributing countries maybe in a better position to maintain the most critical elementin peace-keeping operations — the troops. My Governmentholds the firm view that the death and disabilitycompensation to all troops should he based on equity. Wehope to review the current guidelines on this matter inorder to arrive at a standard compensation packageapplicable to all.Every peace-keeping operation should be devisedwith a clear mandate  a realistic time frame and a correctassessment of the situation. Furthermore  we would liketo reiterate that timely consultations with troop-contributing countries are essential elements for theenhancement of the peace-keeping capability of theUnited Nations. Nepal welcomes the Secretary-General’sinitiative on stand-by arrangements for peace-keeping.We are studying the proposal seriously  especially in viewof current events that highlight the need for theestablishment of such an arrangement.Since the threat to security lies  inter alia  innon-military sources such as the lack of economic andsocial development  Nepal stresses the need for timelyimplementation of Agenda 21 for ensuring thesustainability of the planet for present and futuregenerations. The Commission on SustainableDevelopment has made a good start. It must not beallowed to falter or to be turned into a discussion forumonly. The Commission should build a bridge between theNorth and the South to enable the developing countries tofollow the path of sustainable development. By providingadditional financial resources and transferringenvironmentally sound technology to developingcountries  the international community can surely reachthe goals set in Agenda 21. In our view  the level ofconsumption and wastage in most industrialized countriesalso needs to be moderated if we are to achieve the goalsof sustainable development.The success of population and socio-economicdevelopment programmes hinges on the fullempowerment of women. The focus given to theempowerment of women in decision-making  especiallyin planning the size of a family  at the recent InternationalConference on Population and Development is a mater ofsatisfaction to my delegation. However  the success ofthe Plan of Action as adopted requires increased financialresources. The developing countries  despite their severeresource constraints  have been committing significantamounts in population activities at the cost of otherimportant areas that are required for economic growth anddevelopment.That important conference will be followed by theWorld Summit for Social Development  the fourth WorldConference on Women and the 1996 United Nations23Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II). This yearalone  we have participated in many important conferences:on natural disaster reduction  on the sustainabledevelopment of small island States  on combatingdesertification and drought  and on population anddevelopment. A question remains outstanding: that of theavailability of the critical resources for the successfulimplementation of the recommendations of theseconferences. The developing countries find themselves inan exasperating situation  trying to cope with theirresponsibilities  as outlined in previous agreements andresolutions  without the necessary actions from theindustrialized countries.Nepal fully shares the Secretary-General’s view thatan alternative to the United Nations in the field ofdevelopment simply does not exist  especially in the lightof the new vision of development as inextricably linkedwith peace and security. We reiterate our view that theremust be close cooperation and coordination between theUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. Themain objectives of the proposed agenda for developmentshould he directed towards ensuring successfulimplementation of existing programmes for the alleviationof poverty. The agenda should be an instrument that looksafter the most vulnerable and the weakest nations of theworld.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the signingof the agreements at Marrakesh undoubtedly constitute ahistoric breakthrough in the international trade regime. Thewindow of opportunity is now open for many developingcountries to enhance their trade and development. Onceagain  the least developed countries will be left out  in spiteof this tremendous opportunity now available to many. Thelack of basic physical infrastructure and the absence of amanufacturing base will prevent the least developedcountries from taking advantage of this new opportunity.The least developed countries  including my own country have suffered for decades. These handicaps  however  havenot deterred us from our determination to cooperate fullywith the international community by instituting structuraladjustment programmes and economic liberalizationpolicies  including privatization.Structural adjustment programmes lacking dueconsideration for social safety nets have pushed a largesector of the world’s population towards more misery anddiscontent. Economic liberalization programmes withoutadequate institutional and organizational set-ups have notyielded the desired results in many countries. The majorpurpose of the privatization programmes undertaken bymany developing countries — the efficient and productiveuse of resources — has yet to be fulfilled. At the sametime  it may be appreciated that these inadequatemeasures  resulting in higher inflation  a distorted marketsystem and increasing unemployment  may result ingreater social tension.We are happy to note that in the context of thefollow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action an open-ended Working Group of the Third Committeehas been established; we hope it will review the mandatesof existing human rights machinery  taking into accountthe balanced emphasis between civil  political  cultural economic and social rights  as well as improving humanrights on the basis of the principles of impartiality objectivity and non-selectivity.Violation or suppression of human rights within anation’s boundary have consequences outside itsboundaries as well. People unable to live in conditionswhere human rights are suppressed are forced to flee theirown homelands and take refuge elsewhere. UnitedNations agencies such as the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World FoodProgramme  and international and non-governmentalhumanitarian organizations  are well aware of this. Mydelegation would like to commend the work of theseUnited Nations agencies. We also feel that the agenciesmust be mandated to serve all the people in such difficultsituations.The Constitution of Nepal enshrines the principle ofuniversal human rights. We believe that the right todevelopment is an integral part of human rights. Nepalis now party to 14 international human rights instruments including all the major Conventions and Covenants. Anational action plan on human rights is being prepared inline with the final document of the Vienna Conference onHuman Rights.Nepal is also consolidating the multi-partydemocratic system that was restored by the peoplethrough a popular movement in 1990. Nepal participatedactively in the Second International Conference of Newor Restored Democracies  at Managua  Nicaragua  in Julythis year. The Conference provided us with anopportunity to share each other’s experience of nascentdemocracy. In November this year the people of Nepalare participating in our second general elections on thebasis of adult franchise. We are confident that thisexercise in democracy will give an impetus to the long-term economic development of our country.24The Charter of the United Nations captures the highestideals of mankind. However  much remains to be done toput those ideals into practice. We look forward tothe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations as theoccasion to work for instituting dynamism and efficiencyin the United Nations. My delegation is fully confidentthat our vision of the United Nations as a symbol ofpeace  security  human rights and development will berealized if Member States demonstrate the political willand provide the necessary financial and material supportto the Organization."
"129",5350,"NZL",49,1994,"I should like  first to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on hiswell-deserved election as President of the General24Assembly at its forty-ninth session and to convey to himour good wishes for every success in his work.The general debate is our chance  as Members of theUnited Nations  to undertake together an annual review ofthe Organization’s work - its successes and its failures -and to identify collectively the issues we want to focus on.With the fiftieth anniversary next year  there is a pressingneed to do so. That will be the occasion to chart our newpriorities for the twenty-first century.Our responses to some of today’s challenges andtragedies have ranged from excellent but oftenunder-reported to woefully inadequate and  consequently defiantly reported.The peoples of the world want to believe in the UnitedNations and what it should achieve. If  however  withinsome parts of the Organization we are bereft of purposeand intentions this golden anniversary threatens to be lessjoyous and more muted than many of us anticipated.New Zealand has a strong vested interest in the UnitedNations success  as do most small States. The NewZealand people have always believed in the United Nations in a collective approach to the resolution of global andregional problems. This has been demonstrated by strongsupport for the United Nations by successive Governments.From our experience of - and I do not hesitate to saythis - a turbulent two years on the Security Council and asa committed founder Member of the Organization  I wouldlike to take this opportunity to offer some observationsabout the problems we see as players in the collectivedecision-making process.When New Zealand took part in the founding of theUnited Nations we and many others saw our primarypurpose as providing for a system of collective security.Until very recently that was little more than a vision. Withthe end of the confrontation between two super-Powerblocs  the goal of ""the organized common peace""  of whichPresident Woodrow Wilson spoke so eloquently threegenerations ago  presents itself. We must not let it slipfrom our grasp this time. It will  however  take real effortand real determination.Collective security  or working together  is thecornerstone of the security of small States. Today they arethe overwhelming majority of the membership of thisOrganization. New Zealanders recognize that peace isindivisible  that remoteness is certainly no safeguard: aproblem in any part of the world can ripple to the Earth’sfarthest corners. While we are the country probably mostdistant from the Balkans conflict  we have sent anenhanced company of soldiers to help in efforts to easesuffering and  I earnestly hope with the will of the partiesinvolved  one day bring peace throughout the formerYugoslavia.For the same reasons  our defence personnel can befound engaged in peace-support operations in Africa  theMiddle East  Asia and most recently Haiti. And there areNew Zealand nurses  firefighters and aid workers spreadaround the globe in support.Against this backdrop  however  New Zealanders arepuzzled at times by the way in which the United Nationscarries out some of its important tasks. In Bosnia  despitethe employment of what is by any standards a large  well-armed and well-trained force  people see on theirtelevision screens nightly the frustration of the UnitedNations Protection Force by small groups of irregulars  asingle policeman or even small groups of non-combatants.In Haiti they witnessed a boat full of Blue Berets turnedaway by a small group of pistol-toting thugsunconvincingly called ""attachés"".And what can one say about the appalling tragedy inRwanda? How can so much hatred have been unleashedso viciously  killing hundreds of thousands? What wewatched with horror on our television screens wasdestruction on a scale we thought only megaton bombswere capable of. The systematic slaughter of men women and children simply because of their ethnic originleaves us all outraged.There are no easy answers. But the first key tounlocking the possibilities for a genuine collectivesecurity must be the proper application of the UnitedNations Charter. We have to decide at exactly what pointthe United Nations should get involved in thepeacemaking operation. Do we recognize a problem  and if we do  is the preventive diplomacy that we so firmlybelieve in occurring?In my view  we have to follow the intention of theCharter. First  at the outset of a crisis  or even the signsof a crisis  we have to make more serious efforts throughthat preventive diplomacy to resolve problems andconflicts by negotiation. Efforts must be made at an early25stage to address the root causes of conflicts by the SecurityCouncil’s exercising all its responsibilities under Chapter VIof the Charter.However  on some occasions  in these days of modernmedia technology  we face the dilemma caused by thedivergence between what the public perceives as happeningand what is the reality. Extensive media coverage putspressure on for immediate response. In the case ofRwanda  that was appropriate. In other circumstances  themedia oversimplify and ignore the fact that conditions onthe ground are chaotic and United Nations resources areover-stretched.A second area where the Charter could be morecarefully applied is when disputes are first placed beforethe Council. I believe it should give affected States anadequate hearing before addressing the problem behindclosed doors. Our experience on the Security Councilsuggests the investment in openness that would be achievedby developing a practice of collectively hearing directlyfrom the parties involved would be worthwhile  even if itwere done only informally.In the same vein  the Charter specifically contemplatesthe involvement  without vote  of troop-contributingcountries in significant decisions. New Zealand has pressedthis issue for some time  but so far with limited success.The time is coming  in fact  when the General Assemblywill have to address the question if the Security Councildoes not respond adequately to the concerns that have beenraised.Under the Charter  much is expected of the Council’spermanent members. There is no doubt that they can anddo contribute greatly to the work of the United Nations.Leadership and sacrifices by the large Powers were  forexample  instrumental in successfully challengingaggression against the small State of Kuwait three-and-a-half years ago.I emphasize again  however  the importance of thecollective nature of decision-making in the SecurityCouncil. Making distinctions between the views of the""P5"" and the rest is not really healthy. The Council is ateam of 15. It must work together  and by that I meangiving full weight to the views of all its members. Thestrength of the Security Council is enhanced each year bythe vigorous enthusiasm brought by new members on 1January  testing what may have become an acceptedsecond-best.I would remind the Assembly that the Charterclearly envisages that the norm for operations to maintaininternational peace and security will be United Nationsoperations. National operations are not ruled out  ofcourse. I wish therefore to highlight and question recenttrends toward coalitions under national command  and theimplications for the collective security needs of small anddistant countries where no strategic interest is involved.However  the Security Council will be judged on itseffectiveness. Successes  hopefully  will outweighfailures  but we all have an obligation to improve thesuccess rate. I am an enthusiastic supporter of improvingour success rate  but much of that will come down to theway in which issues are managed. And it is that questionof the management of issues that I wish to address.In our experience  the key is to use managementtools based on proven modern public- and private-sectorexperience. This is very valuable. What are these tools?And how do we apply them to the conduct of peace-keeping operations?I would suggest that there are six critical elements:first  a sustainable financial system; secondly  atransparent political accountability; thirdly  clearobjectives that incorporate regular reviews; fourthly  aclear  unambiguous command and control structure;fifthly  a credible legal regime that guarantees the securityof United Nations personnel; and  sixthly  the availabilityof resources so that objectives can be met quickly andefficiently.Let me go back to that first point  a sustainablefinancial system. There is no doubt that the Organizationis facing a financial crisis that cannot be ignored. Wehave had serious problems with reserves and we havesignificant debt to contributing countries. The largestcontributor has indicated that it will unilaterally reduce itsshare of funding from October next year. The situationis not sustainable. It requires urgent action.Why do we have this crisis? There are some simpleanswers. Some members cannot pay; others will not pay;and some are arguing the legitimacy of their assessment.The General Assembly  this body  must confront thisissue. The United Nations must stop extending credit tonon-payers. There is enough evidence emerging tosuggest that there may be serious inequities in the presentsystem.26Some countries with extraordinarily strong growthover the past 5 to 10 years appear in the revised scaleissued by the Committee on Contributions with a constantor even reduced contribution level. That is not acceptable.It must be remedied.We do not want a hollow celebration on the fiftiethanniversary with a cash crisis hanging over theOrganization. We must make a commitment to resolve thiscrisis before the conclusion of the forty-ninth session.The next point is the need for political accountability.There is in my view a parallel priority to develop andimprove the Organization’s capacity for undertaking itscollective security responsibilities. To do that we need toput in place more transparent procedures throughout theOrganization. The management of peace-keepingoperations is allocated to the Secretariat. This is necessaryand appropriate in the same way any Government delegatesresponsibility for a complex operation to its public service.However  and I speak as a politician and as a Ministerresponsible for the management and oversight ofGovernment departments  the days are long gone when apublic service mandarin could run a department or majoroperation without detailed political oversight. This is nota promotion of micro-management  nor am I implying anycriticism of the Secretariat staff. But as any politicianholding executive office in today’s democracies knows  theclassic recipe for a failed project is for those who arepolitically accountable to lose track of implementation or tolose the game plan.We saw that all too clearly in the past year inSomalia. Ironically  the Security Council had  in resolution814 (1993)  already foreseen the need in the case of theUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for adetailed political accountability and provided for acommittee to follow the operation closely. But thecommittee was never established.New Zealand has proposed in the Security Councilthat a committee or an ad hoc working group should beestablished to fill this gap and enhance the accountability ofthe Organization to its politically responsiblerepresentatives. I certainly remain hopeful that progresscan be made in this area.The third point I draw to the attention of members isthe need for clear objectives with regular reviews. Clearermission objectives must be developed and kept underreview. I am delighted that some progress has in fact beenmade. The Council is now identifying more closely theterms of mandates for United Nations operations  and itis becoming usual to build a specific review cycle into itsmandates. But there are still two areas of weakness.First  there is a great deal of mythology about andvery little sound analysis of the circumstances in whichforce should be used by United Nations operations. Manybelieve this is governed by the use or non-use of thewords ""Chapter VII"". This could well be a falseconclusion. The rules of engagement rather than abstractreference to the Charter are much more likely todetermine actual behaviour in the field.I am not alone in believing that there is a need todevelop greater commonality in military doctrine forUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. This isespecially relevant when so many peace-keepingcontributors are regularly placed side by side in the field.It is  however  particularly urgent in the face of new-styleoperations of the intra-country type where the use of forceby factions  not necessarily Governments  is the challengefor this body to overcome.It is clear that common principles are necessary toguide peace-keepers on the appropriate use of force whenthey take part in operations in pursuit of an agreed UnitedNations strategic objective. As for the review  whilethere are plenty of mid-term reviews there is  as yet  nosystematic process of review at the end of an operation.The budget of every peace-keeping operation shouldinclude provision  as a principal line item  for thepreparation of a comprehensive review of the operation’sachievements relative to the mandate set.Such reviews should be separate from the financialperformance review and should address the substance ofthe operation and seek to identify all relevant lessons forthe conduct of future operations.I address now the question of command and control.There is a weakness in the command and controlstructures and they do need attention. It is true thepersonnel of national defence forces which contributeforces to the United Nations legally remain in theircountry’s national service. But as I see it  parallel to theallocation of responsibility to the United Nations ForceCommander must be a recognition that the nationalcommand structure will not seek to direct their forces inoperational matters. If the national command authorityhas serious difficulties  then the appropriate course ofaction in all cases - except an emergency - is for the issue27to be resolved with United Nations Headquarters. Ifresolution is not possible the unit should be withdrawn.I come to the question of the safety of peace-keepingpersonnel. A major requirement for effective collectivesecurity is that countries contributing troops and civilianpersonnel should have confidence that their personnel in thefield will have the best possible support to ensure theirsafety and security. That is an issue which  as manymembers know  New Zealand has pursued relentlesslyduring its time on the Council. It bears on the level ofequipment with which the forces are outfitted and there isplenty of room for improvement.In addition  the legal regime under which peace-keeping operations are conducted needs to reflect theextraordinary personal risk which United Nations personnelare undertaking on behalf of us all in carrying out collectivesecurity operations. It is right that such personnel shouldbe differentiated from soldiers in an armed conflict and thatthere should be a higher standard of legal responsibility foranybody who attacks them. I urge all members of theAssembly to support New Zealand’s initiative on this issuecurrently in the Sixth Committee  that the necessaryflexibility be shown on outstanding issues and that we makea really determined effort to complete work on the draftconvention this year.The question of resources is always before us. In mysixth point I would say that a critical tool for effectivecollective security is a strategy for resource availability.The situation we all saw recently in Rwanda is a classiccase. Human resources were available but they lackedtraining and they lacked equipment. But there is also theneed for a capacity in all peace-keeping operations for aforceful response in self-defence. There are importantlessons to be learned from the troop losses in Rwanda lastApril and again I draw attention to the linkage betweenmandates  rules of engagement  doctrine and planning.The United Nations will have to go beyond the currentwork being done on stand-by forces to address thisproblem.We believe that there is a case for redirecting asubstantial portion of bilateral military assistance into formsof training that would better assist defence forces with therequirements of peace-keeping operations.There is also a role for the United Nations maintainingthe physical equivalent of the peace-keeping reserve fundthat it is supposed to have on the financial side now. Aquick start-up capability  with owned or leased equipmentimmediately available to the United Nations  would havemade a significant difference in the Rwanda situation.This is a practical and feasible step that can be taken toensure that future collective security can in fact rise to thechallenge.I have spoken about the factors that need to be takeninto account in managing peace-keeping operations. Inow wish to address the terms of their engagements.The United Nations should not be expected to takeresponsibility for a situation of up to 30 years because theparties to a conflict are unable or unwilling to summon upthe necessary political will to reach a settlement. Therecomes a point when the parties must take their fate intheir own hands rather than the Council avoiding the harddecisions just by rolling over the mandates.At the same time  a range of different considerationsshould prevail when the United Nations reaches the endof a successful peace-keeping process. The UnitedNations cannot simply walk away when a perceived endpoint - such as an election - has been achieved  becausethere may still be outstanding issues that need theongoing support of the operation  such as humanitarianoperations or local capability-building programmes to helpprovide the required sound administration.The United Nations deserves congratulations on itsachievements in Cambodia  for example  but the futurethere is still not certain  and the United Nations mustmaintain its responsibilities. Rehabilitation in that countrymust continue.Another example of a situation in whichpeacemaking and peace-building have to be seen as acoherent whole is in the area of demining. This is acritically important humanitarian function. NewZealand’s military forces have had a lot of experience inhelping the United Nations with demining in Afghanistan Cambodia and  most recently  Mozambique.The Security Council Mission that visitedMozambique about two months ago reported its dismayat the delays and at the state of the programme generally.At the request of the United Nations  New Zealandstepped in early in August and began the rescue effort forthe programme. The wheel should not have had to bereinvented. It is a concern that lessons learned fromearlier operations such as Afghanistan and Cambodia donot appear to be retained. Having seen firsthand the28effects of mines in Cambodia  I do believe we should movemore expeditiously than the speed of the presentperformance.New Zealand certainly looks forward to working withother delegations to improve performance in this area  andI would certainly add that my Government was mostinterested in the comments President Clinton made hereyesterday about the proposal for the elimination of theworld’s 85 million anti-personnel land-mines. This is anurgent task. No one who has seen firsthand the human costof mines can offer anything less than full cooperation tothis end.Finally  when we look ahead to what would reallyenhance proper use of the collective security powers  wehave to conclude that reform of the Security Council is amajor task waiting to be fulfilled. Many of the things Ihave discussed today require reforms by the SecurityCouncil  or at least in conjunction with it. But I cannotescape the conclusion that even if all of these wereaccomplished  the political legitimacy of the SecurityCouncil could still erode over a period of time. Ultimatelyit could lose the credibility vital to the role it carries out.Collective security requires the Council to begenuinely representative of the entire United Nationsmembership. We have  of course  as many others havedone  followed the debate on Security Council reform in theOpen-ended Working Group set up last year. We hear thecase made for additional permanent members. We alsohear overwhelming support for expanding the number ofnon-permanent members of the Council. There are shadesof difference on the numbers for the total membership  butconsensus does seem to be emerging around five or six newmembers. We consider that a limited expansion of thenumber of members  paying regard to an equitablegeographical participation  is still a priority for the healthof the Organization. It is time to do what is achievable andwhat benefits most Members. Given the need for 122ratifications  we are aware that even a simple expansion hopefully adopted next year  will take several years to comeinto force. It would not be unrealistic  therefore  for theyear 2000 to see the first meeting of the expanded Council.There is no worth in being critical of some aspects ofthe United Nations without believing  as I do  that theproblems can be cured. We  all 184 of us  are its doctors and we need to act quickly. We need to apportion ourcosts fairly and systematically. We need to share peace-keeping tasks  peace-keeping funding and peace-keepingsupplies. We need to accept the democratic decisions ofthis Organization. We also need to adjust to the morecomplex and interrelated United Nations agendas of thefuture.I therefore leave with the Assembly New Zealand’sassurance of a renewed commitment to this unique andessential body and of our willingness to work in thatspirit to ensure the continued relevance of the UnitedNations for the next half-century."
"130",5395,"OMN",49,1994,"Mr. President  please allow me at the outset to congratulateyou on your assumption of the Presidency of the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. Your unanimous electionto this high office attests to the respect accorded by theinternational community to your friendly country  Côted’Ivoire. We are confident  in view of your qualificationscredentials and diplomatic skills  that you will steer thework of this session to a successful conclusion which willfurther the noble causes and principles of the UnitedNations  which are aimed at bringing peace and prosperityto the world. I would like to assure you of my delegation’scooperation with your endeavours to achieve this commongoal.I should like also to take this opportunity to expressour appreciation to His Excellency Samuel R. Insanally the Permanent Representative of the friendly country ofGuyana  for the exemplary manner in which he presidedover the work of the previous session of the GeneralAssembly. Furthermore  on behalf of the Government ofthe Sultanate of Oman  I should like to pay special tributeto the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedicated andcontinued efforts aimed at resolving complicated conflictsby peaceful means.This forty-ninth session is being held amidincreasing prospects for and optimism about the creationof a world in which atmosphere of peace  interdependenceand peaceful settlement of disputes will prevail. OurArab region is currently witnessing radical and importantchanges where hatred and animosities between the Arabsand Israel are slowly vanishing and giving place to a newclimate of understanding  dialogue and coexistence.We are totally convinced that there is no alternativemeans by which the Arabs and Israel may resolve theirdifferences other than negotiation. While some promisingand positive results have been achieved  we are still at thebeginning of a long process and we have a long way togo towards resolving deep-seated differences. Wetherefore appeal to the international community tocontinue to lend its support to the efforts aimed atbringing peace and security to the region.In South Africa  my country has participated withmany other countries of the world in the inaugurationceremony of President Nelson Mandela. That historicevent could not have taken place were it not for thecourageous policies of both President Mandela and VicePresident de Klerk in their approach to power-sharingbased on equality.Thanks to the positive steps taken and the wisepolicies pursued by President Mandela in forming aNational Coalition government that embraces variouspolitical parties  South Africa has been able to resume itsrightful place in this Assembly  and can now play itsnatural role in regional and international forums.In Mozambique  the peace process is makingsignificant progress. Moreover  we are witnessing anincreasing normalization of relations amongst Asian16countries. We also witness more integration andinterdependence in the economic relations in Europe and inNorth America. And last but not least  we note withsatisfaction the peaceful resolution of conflicts in LatinAmerica and the unprecedented tendency of its peoples toopt for peace  development  and social and economicbetterment in their countries.We have to cover a lot of ground before we achievethe building of the world envisaged by the Charter of thisOrganization. The prevailing climate of concord affords usan opportunity to enable this Organization to face up to thechallenges and unresolved problems and to address suchproblems in the light of the new realities.My country views with satisfaction the steps that havebeen achieved so far on the Palestinian-lsraeli track. Wehave always called for a just  lasting and peaceful solutionto the situation between the Arabs and Israel through directnegotiations. Therefore  my country has welcomed theoutcome of the Palestinian-lsraeli negotiations whichculminated in the signing of the Cairo Agreement on theimplementation of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.This Agreement is now being implemented  the PalestinianAuthority is now a concrete reality and is exercising itsdifferent functions in such areas as education  health taxation  tourism and social affairs. There are otherfunctions stipulated in the Agreement which  we hope  willbe exercised at the earliest possible time  by the PalestinianAuthority. The expansion of the competence of thePalestinian Authority to other Palestinian areas in the WestBank will undoubtedly strengthen the peace process andcontribute positively to security and stability in the area.Such significant steps could never have been achievedhad not the Palestinian Liberation Organization honoured itsobligations under the Declaration of Principles signed inWashington and under the Cairo Agreement. In order toachieve peace and enable the Palestinian people to takeadvantage and reap the benefits of the vigorous effortsexerted in this context  the international community shouldextend the necessary assistance to the Palestinian Authorityso that it may be able to discharge its many responsibilitiesand rebuild the infrastructure  which has been severelydamaged. Support for the Authority will not only serve thecause of security and stability in the self-rule areas alonebut in the region of the Middle East in its entirety.The desired just and lasting peace will prevail onlythrough complete withdrawal by Israel from the entirety ofthe occupied Arab territories  in accordance with SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and425 (1978)  and in application of the land-for-peaceprinciple.My country has followed with interest anothersignificant step in the peace process  namely that on theJordan-lsraeli track  which was highlighted by the signingby His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan and the IsraeliPrime Minister of a declaration that ends the state of warbetween the two countries and masks the movementtowards the establishment of a comprehensive peace. Mycountry has supported these positive and important steps.Mindful of the fact that comprehensive peace is anaspiration of the present and future generations  weemphasize the critical importance of a complete Israeliwithdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territories. Webelieve that it is crucial for Israel to demonstrate thenecessary flexibility to reach an agreement on thequestion of water in order for both countries to moveforward towards the long-awaited lasting peace.We look forward to similar positive and importantsteps in the peace process on both the Syrian-Israeli andLebanese-Israeli tracks. We are confident that the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process as well as theparties concerned are fully aware of the fact that unlesssignificant and substantive progress is made on those twotracks  the peace process will remain incomplete and willmake the region’s peoples prey to suspicions  mistrust andinstability. Therefore  efforts must be made in thecoming phase  to achieve concrete progress in thisdirection. Israel must declare its readiness to withdrawcompletely from the Syrian Golan Heights and from theLebanese territories it now occupies. We are confidentthat if Israel were to take such an undoubtedly positivestep in the peace process  the peoples of the Middle Eastwould be able to work together towards the consolidationof peace and the promotion of economic development ona large scale in the region.Mindful of the need to support the peace process andgiven the awareness that national and regional security areinseparable  the Sultanate of Oman has activelyparticipated in the meetings of the five working groupsemanating from the multilateral negotiations. Althoughthe latter are no substitute for bilateral negotiations  theyconstitute a significant tributary that has the potential ofgiving a rather significant boost to the process in thedirection of the desired just and comprehensive peace inthe Middle East.17Given the pivotal importance of water resources forthe future security and peace of the Middle East  theSultanate of Oman accords a very high priority to thediscovery and development of new water resources side byside with the promotion of sea-water desalinationtechnology in order to make such technology more costeffective. Within the framework of multilateral negotiationsin the Middle East  my country hosted the fifth meeting ofthe Working Group on Water Resources held from 17 to 20April 1994. The meeting resulted  inter alia  in theendorsement of the Omani proposal to establish in Muscat the Omani capital  a regional centre for the research aimedat the development of desalination technology.Given the great significance we attach to theestablishment of that centre  as it will have a decidedlypositive impact on the economic development of the Statesof the Middle East  we look forward to the cooperation ofall in this regard in order to make the transfer of water-resources technology cost effective to the region so as tohelp in raising the standards of social and economicdevelopment and  thereby  in consolidating the peace andstability of the region.We in the Gulf region are committed to theachievement of the highest level of stability  cooperationand development in all our countries and to thedevelopment of our multilateral and bilateral relations. Thisnaturally embraces the settlement of all bilateral differences.Consequently  we view with satisfaction the agreementbetween the State of Bahrain and the State of Qatar to haverecourse to the International Court of Justice with regard totheir differences over the disputed islands and the maritimeborders. We also hope that the Islamic Republic of Iranand the United Arab Emirates would settle their differencesregarding the islands of Abu Moussa  the Greater Tumb andthe Lesser Tumb as soon as possible  in an amicable andpeaceful fashion. This could include having recourse tointernational arbitration in view of the mutual interests thetwo countries share in various spheres. There is no doubtthat such regional efforts will contribute to theconsolidation of regional security and serve the cause ofinternational peace.We have noted recently that there has beenconsiderable progress in Iraq’s implementation of theresolutions relating to the destruction of weapons of massdestruction  particularly the agreement on the installation ofa long-term monitoring system  which should now be putinto effect for a suitable period. In the meantime  theSecurity Council should proceed to make the necessarycontacts with both Iraq and Kuwait to implement itsresolution 833 (1993) regarding the demarcation ofinternational borders between the two countries throughthe acceptance and legal ratification by the parties inaccordance with established international norms andpractices in matters relating to international borders.We believe that it is an opportune time to take morepositive steps to enable Iraq to perform its regional andinternational role in a peaceful context and to help thebrotherly Iraqi people to put behind it the years ofembargo and to make up for what it has lost in terms ofsocial and economic development.The future of the region should be based on theconviction that it is imperative for States to develop andfurther their relations and to overcome their outstandingdifferences in a manner that safeguards the interests of allparties.The interdependent nature of today’s world makes itimpossible for States to pursue an individualistic approachthat disregards the interests of others. We thereforebelieve that the peaceful conduct of relations and thepursuit of constructive political dialogue are the bestguarantees for present and future security and stability inthe region.We aspire after a more stable  more developed worldthat would be totally free from ethnic and regionalconflicts  a world that would be able to ensure theprogress of mankind towards a better way of life bychannelling the disposable economic resources to thefinancing of scientific research which may benefit socialand economic development. While we are fully aware ofthe fact that the international community has made realprogress in changing to the better in many importantareas  it is nevertheless regrettable that there remain manyfactors which make other parts of the world prey topolitical  ethnic and regional conflicts. It is nowabundantly clear that the United Nations is losing itsability to address all these crises. While we sympathizewith the sufferings of many peoples that are victims ofsuch crises  we believe it is high time the internationalcommunity set up a new and unambiguous rule thatshould be followed in dealing with such problems. It isevident that the present mechanisms available to theUnited Nations and other international organizations areno longer able to perform their humanitarian role. It isnot possible for the United Nations to go on feedingwhole peoples indefinitely  and it is  therefore  high timefor the leaders of countries immersed in such tensions andconflicts to realize that the United Nations will not be18responsible for their actions towards their peoples  and thatthe States of the international community are no longer ableto rebuild for them what they themselves have destroyed.Funds should not be made available to rebuild countrieswhich destroy their own infrastructures with their ownhands. All peoples should contribute effectively to thedevelopment of the world economy rather than be a burdenon it.The United Nations cannot play a peace-keeping rolein each and every conflict that erupts in the world. Peace-keeping forces should not be dragged into regional conflictsexcept to the extent to which regional organizations andStates are willing to shoulder their full responsibility in thisregard. If deemed necessary  this should take place onlyfollowing the consent of the parties to conflict and on thebasis of clear goals and mandates linked to a definite time-frame.Regional organizations have a vital role to play in theresolution of the disputes that exist in many parts of theworld. Although that role parallels and is complementaryto the efforts of the United Nations  we have noted that regardless of how important and necessary it is  it is almostnon-existent in the political arena. While we value theefforts of the peace-keeping forces in Somalia  we believeit would have been possible to avoid the negative aspectsthat became evident in that operation had full use beenmade of the Organization of African Unity  the competentregional organization qualified to bring about nationalreconciliation and the establishment of national authority.The United Nations could have lent a helping hand byproviding expertise and advice  as well as political financial and humanitarian support.Regional arrangements  whether in Asia  Africa or inany other continent  in no way detract from the role of theSecurity Council as the principal body responsible for themaintenance of international peace and security. Rather such regional arrangements could help lighten the Council’sworkload and instil a sense of partnership and a spirit ofcaring into international affairs.As the possibility of the failure of some peace-keepingoperations cannot be ruled out  it is necessary to face thefacts and to draw object lessons from them if the UnitedNations is to avoid sliding into the repetition of the samemistakes.Tragic events are taking place in Rwanda as a resultof the continuing political and ethnic strife that has led tothe outbreak of violence  to the horrendous massacres which claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives and to the destruction of the infrastructure of thatcountry’s economy. Great numbers of Rwanda’s peopleare now living in refugee camps in neighbouring countriesunder unimaginably tragic circumstances. Hunger anddisease claim the lives of hundreds daily. In view of thishorrendous suffering  my country calls upon theRwandese parties to stop the bloodshed and work towardsnational reconciliation in accordance with the ArushaPeace Agreement so that peace and stability may berestored in Rwanda.The mediation efforts undertaken so far to bringabout peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven to beinsufficient  due mainly to the imbalance of powerbetween the Bosnian parties. The main cause ofimbalance in this regard is the denial to the people ofBosnia and Herzegovina of their right to fight for theirexistence through the imposition of a comprehensive armsembargo on that small State  in total disregard of its rightof self-defence enshrined in Article 51 of the UnitedNations Charter. The arms embargo should be imposedon the aggressor. And who is the aggressor in theBosnian case? All the facts available to the UnitedNations and its agencies regarding the situation inSarajevo and in other Bosnian cities prove that the Serbsare the aggressors  and in the most inhuman terms.While my country welcomes the structural reformsundertaken with a view to ensuring the optimumutilization of the resources available to the United Nationswith the greatest degree of efficiency and flexibility  itfeels that the ability of the Organization to discharge itsduties and perform its role depends to a very large extenton the willingness of the Member States to live up to oneof the main responsibilities of membership - the promptpayment of their financial contributions  including theirprompt contribution to peace-keeping operations.As we approach the second summit meeting of theSecurity Council  we ought to accord due attention to theissue of the expansion of the Council’s membership inaccordance with the different trends prevailing in theworld  while constantly preserving the principle ofequitable geographic balance without prejudice to thelevel of decision-making in the Council. We thereforesubscribe to the view that no hasty decision should betaken in this respect and that more time should be givento the regional groups to expound their views in thisregard.19My country has noted with satisfaction the successfulconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the long-rangeGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994 and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization. This hashelped prevent the world economic order’s turning into ahotbed of tension and strife between the various regions.However  my country and the developing countries ingeneral  some of which have acceded to those agreementsor are in the process of so doing  request that theirparticular circumstances be taken into consideration whenimplementing the new agreements.It is expected that our developing countries will haveto make sacrifices in order to support the world economicorder arising out of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade  particularly in the short and medium terms.Therefore  we hope to find support from the new WorldTrade Organization that would be proportionate to what wehave to offer. We are particularly interested in thedevelopmental aspect of these agreements  as we areinterested in strengthening and developing the service sectorin our countries through the assistance offered by theadvanced economies and the international organizations.In the area of disarmament  we hope that theinternational support to the Convention on the Prohibitionof the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on their Destruction will giveimpetus to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva todraft a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would be animportant step towards ridding the world of nuclear terror.In this context  we support the efforts aimed at establishingnuclear-weapon-free zones  particularly in the Middle East which is one of the world’s most sensitive regions.At present  thanks to the prevailing spirit of concordand the ending of the cold war between the East and West we witness a robust movement towards the consolidation ofpeace and security. The world is beginning to realize thata climate of concord and harmony is the most viable meansof establishing an international community characterized byconstructive cooperation and mutual benefit  and that sucha development will be in the interest of mankind and itswell-being.Today  on the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe founding of the United Nations  we hope that theoutcome of this session will be more compatible with theprinciple of international partnership and solidarity so thathumanity may be able to lessen and cure the ailments thatsill undermine the twentieth century and thus ensure thatthe twenty-first century will be a century of hope  peaceand security for all human beings wherever they may beon the face of the Earth."

We areconfident that under your able stewardship this Assemblywill succeed in advancing the noble aims and objectives ofour Charter.I wish also to record my delegation’s profoundappreciation for your predecessor  Ambassador SamuelInsanally of Guyana. He presided most ably over theAssembly as well as over the important Working Group onSecurity Council reforms.The principal purpose of this world Organization is""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".The United Nations must ensure that the twilight of thetwentieth century is not as bloody as was its dawn. Wemust act resolutely to end the series of regional conflictsthat currently threaten international peace and stability.The civil war in Afghanistan has compounded thesuffering imposed on its people during the long andvictorious struggle against foreign occupation. The worldcommunity should not forsake the Afghan people. Wemust continue to demand an immediate end to thehostilities. We must promote a new political consensusfor the future governance of Afghanistan. To facilitatethis  we must commence reconstruction in the peacefulparts of the country.We welcome the temporary truce in Tajikistan.Pakistan hopes that the preliminary steps agreed will beimplemented by the parties.

A holocaust has taken place before theeyes of the world. Two hundred thousand Bosnians mostly Muslims  have been killed. Of them  30 000 wereinnocent children. Forty thousand Muslim women havebeen systematically raped by the Serbs. Millions ofMuslim men  women and children have been ejectedforcibly and brutally from their homes.While the aggression was going on  the majorPowers went through the motions of promoting peace.The Security Council adopted 50 resolutions  but it hasyet to implement them. Mediators appointed by theUnited Nations and the European Union advocated peaceplans that rewarded the aggressor and penalized thevictim. Even the right to self-defence has been denied tothe Bosnians. The United Nations Protection Force has10supervised relief but failed to stop the war or protect theBosnian people. It was only when the North AtlanticTreaty Organization carried out - belatedly - the threat ofair strikes that the Serbs halted their onslaught againstGoradze and Sarajevo.The Bosnian Serbs have rejected the peace plan  whichis  in truth  unjust to the Bosnian Muslims. It does notentirely reverse ""ethnic cleansing"". It does not punish theaggressor. It does not ensure the territorial integrity of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia should beoffered peace with justice  otherwise peace will not endure.Pakistan and other Islamic countries are appalled at theSecurity Council’s recent decision to ease the sanctionsagainst Belgrade - the root cause of the aggression againstBosnia and Herzegovina. This will not stop the flow ofmilitary supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. It will merelyencourage Serbian intransigence.The Bosnian Muslims must be allowed to exercisetheir right to self-defence. Pakistan and other Islamiccountries fully support the demand for the immediate liftingof the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Weregret the threats by certain countries to withdraw theirtroops from the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) if the embargo is lifted. The Islamic Stateswill be ready to contribute their troops to UNPROFOR tocompensate for any shortfall created by such withdrawals.We call for vigorous steps by UNPROFOR to effectivelyprotect and provision Sarajevo and other safe areas. Wealso urge the creation of exclusion zones around all safeareas.If expansionism is not stopped in Bosnia  if genocideis not punished  the virus of war will spread to Kosovo  toSandjak and perhaps to the entire Balkans. A widerconflict in this volatile region could have the most seriousconsequences for peace and security in Europe and theMediterranean.A grim and bloody struggle is also going on in Jammuand Kashmir. As in Bosnia  it is an unequal struggle -between the defenceless Kashmiri people and an Indianoccupation force that now numbers 600 000. In Kashmir as in Bosnia  the principles of the Charter  of internationallaw and of international morality have been violated withimpunity.The struggle of the Kashmiri people is just andlegitimate. They were promised by the United NationsSecurity Council - and by India and Pakistan - that theywould decide  through a United Nations-supervisedplebiscite  whether they wished to join India or Pakistan.On 26 June 1952  the late Prime Minister of India Mr. Nehru  stated in the Indian Parliament:""If  after a proper plebiscite  the people of Kashmirsaid  ’We do not want to be with India’  we arecommitted to accept that ... we will not send anarmy against them"".But India has gone back on its agreement. It refusesto implement the Security Council resolutions. It has sentits army against the people of Kashmir. It has chosen tocrush the Kashmiri freedom movement by brute force.Over the past five years  40 000 Kashmiris have beenkilled; thousands more are in Indian jails. Thousands ofKashmiri women have been raped by Indian soldiers aspart of a policy to break the spirit of the Kashmiri people.Whole villages and neighbourhoods have been put to thetorch. Torture is routine; disappearances are common;and summary executions are standard practice in Kashmir.India’s massive violations of human rights have beenwell documented by impartial organizations andobservers  such as Amnesty International  Asia Watch  theInternational Federation of Human Rights  theInternational Commission of Jurists  Physicians forHuman Rights and many others. The world knows aboutIndian barbarism in Kashmir. It is unfortunate that theworld has remained silent so far.When faced with the possibility of censure by thisAssembly last year  India offered to resume talks withPakistan on Kashmir. In the talks held last January  Indiadisplayed no desire for a settlement. It repeated thefiction that Kashmir was an integral part of India. TheIndian Foreign Secretary told us that India had the rightto use as much force as it wanted to prevent Kashmirfrom breaking away. When the issue was raised at theCommission on Human Rights  India offered cosmeticconcessions to prevent the dispatch of a United Nationsfact-finding mission to Kashmir. Thereafter  it denied ithad made such a deal.On the ground as well  India escalated its repressionas soon as international pressure was eased. The dayafter we agreed to resume talks  India conducted amassacre in Sopore  killing 50 Kashmiris. Once Indiahad concluded that the major Powers would overlook itshuman rights violations because of the lure of trade andprofits in India  the repression against the Kashmiris andthe rhetoric against Pakistan sharply escalated.11Let me quote from the conclusions of the latest reportof Human Rights Watch/Asia  entitled: India: ContinuingRepression in Kashmir (August 1994  vol. 6  No. 8)""As this report amply illustrates  the humanrights situation in Kashmir is getting worse at a timewhen international pressure on the Indian Governmenthas all but ceased. Indeed  it could be argued that theincrease in deaths in custody and other abuses overthe last six months is not unrelated to the signals sentby India’s one-time critics  notably the United States:that human rights would no longer feature prominentlyin bilateral discussions"". (p. 20)I have seen the statement made here yesterday by theCommerce Minister of India. While I can fully subscribeto the high ideals which he has propounded  I find myselfin the same situation as the distinguished philosopher thelate Mr. Bertrand Russell  when he observed that""When one observes that the high idealism of theIndian Government in international matters breaksdown completely with the question of Kashmir  it isdifficult to avoid a feeling of despair"".India preens itself and postures on the issue ofterrorism. Terrorism is the use of indiscriminate violenceagainst innocent people. This must be condemned. By thisyardstick  India is guilty of daily and systematic acts ofterrorism against the Kashmiris. On the other hand  toresist a foreign invader  to repel an army of occupationengaged in murder  torture  rape and arson is not terrorism.It is the exercise of self-defence. Self-defence is a right asold as history; a right recognized in the United NationsCharter. Distinguished representatives: If your son waskilled  and his body was thrown on your doorstep  howwould you respond? If your daughter was gang-raped bythe soldiers of an occupation army  what would be yourresponse? The Kashmiri people have the right - underinternational law  under our Charter  under our resolutions- to resist the Indian army of occupation by all the meansat their disposal. Their heroic struggle cannot be dismissedas terrorism. It is a valiant freedom movement whichdeserves the full support of the international community.Pakistan is a party to the Kashmir dispute. Our peopleare incensed at India’s brutal killing of our Kashmiribrothers and sisters. We have  nevertheless  acted withrestraint. We have extended moral  political and diplomaticsupport to the Kashmiris.We have refrained from extending military help to them.The Indian allegations of Pakistan’s support for theso-called militants are designed to explain away theresilience of the Kashmiri freedom movement  to erodeinternational sympathy and support for the Kashmiris and more ominously  to create perhaps a casus belli for a newaggression against Pakistan.The Kashmir crisis poses a growing threat tointernational peace and security. On India’s independenceday this year  Prime Minister Rao demanded all ofKashmir. In recent months  Indian politicians andgenerals have threatened to launch attacks across the Lineof Control. India’s violations of the cease-fire haveescalated. During August alone  the United NationsMilitary Observer Group for India and Pakistan(UNMOGIP) recorded 142 complaints from Pakistan ofIndian cease-fire violations. Indian firing across the Lineof Control is specifically aimed at civilians. In the pastfive years  over 600 civilians have been killed on our sideof the line. Pakistan’s self-restraint should not bemisunderstood. Indian aggression will have disastrousconsequences.There are three priorities in addressing the Kashmirquestion: first  to avert the threat of a conflict; secondly to ameliorate the suffering of the Kashmiri people; and thirdly  to open a credible diplomatic process designed toachieve a just and peaceful solution to the Kashmirdispute.To arrest the threat to peace  I have addressed aletter to the President of the Security Council proposingthat the United Nations Military Observer Group for Indiaand Pakistan should be substantially enlarged from itspresent size of 35 observers. UNMOGIP should beallowed to perform its mandate of patrolling both sides ofthe Line of Control. This would help to stem cease-fireviolations  lower tensions and avoid the danger of aconflict. The enlarged United Nations Observer Groupcould also ascertain the veracity of India’s allegations thatPakistan is providing military assistance to the Kashmiristruggle. I hope that the Security Council will approveour proposal. I hope that India will allow the UnitedNations Observers to discharge their mandate of patrollingon both sides of the Line of Control.Secondly  to ameliorate the suffering of the Kashmiripeople  India should take some genuine steps to halt its12repression. We note with satisfaction that concern aboutopinion at this Assembly has convinced India to release atleast two of the imprisoned Kashmiri leaders. This is avictory for the Kashmiri freedom struggle. These aging andailing leaders will  we hope  be allowed to proceed abroadfor medical treatment. Shabir Ahmed Shah  who  likeNelson Mandela  has spent 20 years in prison because ofhis commitment to freedom  has not been released. Theworld community must demand the release of this prisonerof conscience.There is no evidence that India has given up itsrepressive strategy in Kashmir. This will become visibleonce India lifts the Draconian emergency laws operative inKashmir  releases all the Kashmiris detained in Indian jails withdraws a part of its huge force from Kashmir  andallows human rights organizations and humanitarianagencies free access to the occupied Valley of Kashmir.And we hope the international community will not forgetthe victims of Indian atrocities. As in Bosnia and Rwanda the human rights violations which have been documentedand reported by impartial agencies must be investigated byan international tribunal  and those who are found guiltymust be punished.Finally  the efforts to promote a political settlement ofthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute must take into accountthree realities.First  the Kashmiri freedom struggle cannot be crushedby force. New Delhi’s forecasts of imminent success aredesigned to deceive the Indian public and world publicopinion. The Indian army is caught in a quagmire.Secondly  despite India’s assertions about Pakistan’sinterference  the Kashmiri struggle is obviously indigenous.The Line of Control in Kashmir has 400 soldiers perkilometre. The Indians have wired and mined the Line.Nothing can get through. United Nations monitoring of theLine can verify this. No external force can convince theKashmiris to offer the kind of sacrifices being made byKashmiri men  women and children in the cause offreedom. For five years the Kashmiris have sustained theirstruggle. They will continue their struggle even if Pakistanwishes otherwise.Thirdly  no credible Kashmiri group or leader acceptsa ""solution"" for Kashmir within the Indian Union. Theso-called political process advertised by India is wishfulthinking. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference  whichgroups 34 Kashmiri political parties and organizations  hasrejected any settlement short of freedom from India.Arriving in Srinagar after his release two days ago Abdul Ghani Lone said:""Any elections to be held in Kashmir are to beunder the auspices of the United Nations and ... onlyfor the right of self-determination"".The other released Kashmiri leader  Syed Ali Shah Ghani said:""Elections are no answer to the problem in Kashmir.The people of the State do not accept anything shortof freedom. There will be no compromise in thefight for self-determination"".India’s attempt to organize another fraudulentelection in Kashmir will prove abortive. As the SecurityCouncil declared in 1957  such unilateral actions cannotbe considered as the basis for the ""final disposition"" ofJammu and Kashmir. This can only be done through aUnited Nations-supervised plebiscite prescribed by theSecurity Council. A final settlement of the Kashmirdispute will have to be based on the freely expressedwishes of the Kashmiri people. In a paper transmitted toIndia last February  Pakistan outlined the possiblemodalities for ascertaining their wishes.Pakistan welcomes the Secretary-General’s offer toexert every possible effort to ""facilitate the search for alasting solution to the Kashmir issue"" (A/49/1  para. 542).We hope India will also accept the Secretary-General’soffer of good offices  as Pakistan has done. Pakistan isprepared for talks with India on Kashmir. It was Pakistanwhich initiated the Foreign Secretary-level talks. Butafter six rounds of talks it is evident to us that India’sostensible desire for negotiations with Pakistan carrieslittle credibility while it continues the killing in Kashmir.Pakistan does not reject dialogue  but it must not be adialogue of the deaf.Kashmir is a dispute between India and Pakistan.Every dispute between two States is bilateral. It is alsoan international issue. The United Nations is obliged totake cognizance of such disputes  specially when theyinvolve violations of the United Nations Charter and thenon-implementation of Security Council resolutions.Kashmir is the key to unlocking the problems ofSouth Asia. Kashmir cannot be brushed aside any longer.The conspiracy of silence must be broken. A resolutionof the Kashmir situation is required to avoid the dangerof a conflict. A solution of the Kashmir dispute will also13enhance the prospects of conventional arms control andnon-proliferation in South Asia.My Government believes that to reduce the danger ofwar in South Asia it is essential to promote a balance inconventional arms between Pakistan and India  at the lowestpossible levels. India fields the third largest army in theworld. Almost all of it is deployed against Pakistan.During the past decade India was the world’s largest armsimporter. Even during the Afghan war  India’s armsacquisitions were over five times those of Pakistan.Pakistan’s defence capabilities have deteriorated furthersince 1990. Last year  while Pakistan’s defence spendingdeclined in real terms  India’s increased by 20 per cent.Pakistan has made several proposals to India forconventional arms control: negotiation of a mutuallyagreed ratio of forces; measures to prevent the possibilitiesof a surprise attack  adoption of agreed principles forconventional arms control in South Asia.Pakistan has no desire to expend more of its scarceresources on arms. Meaningful arms control andconfidence-building measures could also help to stem thedanger of a nuclear arms race in our region.Pakistan’s concern about nuclear proliferation in SouthAsia precedes the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Asearly as the mid-1960s Pakistan had warned the world thatIndia would misuse nuclear cooperation. The late PrimeMinister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto proposed the creation of aSouth Asia nuclear-free zone in 1972. In May 1974 Indiaexploded the bomb - ironically calling it the ""SmilingBuddha"". Pakistan made every endeavour to counterproliferation in South Asia. Apart from the nuclear-weapon-free zone  we advanced subsequent proposals: forthe simultaneous signature of the NPT by India andPakistan  for acceptance of full-scope safeguards  for jointrenunciation of nuclear weapons  for a bilateral test-bantreaty. All have been spurned by India. A proposal madeby the United States for a conference to promotenon-proliferation in South Asia  involving Russia  thePeople’s Republic of China and the United States  as wellas India and Pakistan  was also rejected by New Delhi.Pakistan has displayed responsibility and restraint inthe nuclear field. While we have acquired a certaintechnological capability  we have not manufactured orexploded a nuclear device. We have not deployed nuclearweapons. We have not transferred sensitive technologies.Twenty years after exploding its nuclear bomb  Indiais about to take another fateful step towards proliferation:the production and deployment of nuclear-capable ballisticmissiles. India is continuing work on its medium-rangeAGNI missile as well as on intercontinental ballisticmissiles. It conducted user trials of the short-rangePrithvi this year. The Prithvi is a mobile missile. Onceit is produced  Pakistan will have to presume that it hasbeen deployed.It is still not too late to prevent nuclear-weaponproliferation in South Asia. Pakistan suggests two criticalsteps to avoid this danger.First  we suggest an agreement between India andPakistan not to develop or deploy ballistic missiles.India’s production and deployment of the Prithvi willinvite a matching response from Pakistan. We haveadvanced the concept of a Zero Missile Zone in SouthAsia. This objective should be endorsed by the worldcommunity.Secondly  we suggest an agreement between Indiaand Pakistan not to manufacture or deploy nuclearweapons. We hope India will respond positively to thislongstanding proposal. We hope it will agree  as a firststep  to issue a joint declaration with Pakistan renouncingnuclear weapons.It is unfortunate that India and Pakistan have neversucceeded in solving any of their disputes throughbilateral negotiations. Agreements reached on two majorproblems - the Indus Waters Treaty and the Rann ofKutch Accord - were made possible by the intercession ofa third party.At this critical moment  when tensions are high andpeace is threatened in South Asia  the States Members ofthe United Nations have a fundamental responsibility tobring to bear their collective influence to promotesolutions to the interlinked problems of Kashmir conventional arms conflict and non-proliferation.14Pakistan desires good-neighbourly relations with India.We want our people to devote their energies to the vitaltask of nation-building. We want to banish from our midstthe spectre of rampant poverty. We want our people to livewith dignity. These goals cannot be attained unless weresolve the Kashmir problem and others and build a climateof trust and confidence in South Asia.Pakistan has embarked on a new path ofsocio-economic revival and growth. We have released thedynamism of our private sector. We have created aneconomic climate that is most hospitable to domestic andforeign investment  and the results have been mostgratifying. Agreements for foreign investment of $4 billionwere concluded 10 days ago with a delegation led by theUnited States Secretary of Energy. Additional investmentis likely in the energy  telecommunications  electronics andother dynamic sectors of the Pakistan economy.Today  Pakistan and all of South Asia have the chanceto break out of the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.We must not lose this chance. We must not let history passus by again.We meet on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations. The end of the cold war has released bothpositive and negative forces that were long suppressed.The principles of democracy  human rights and free marketshave triumphed. We have celebrated the entry into theUnited Nations of many new States  proud and free. Thevictory of democracy has been achieved in South Africa.The victory of peace may well be realized in the MiddleEast. Today  there is no threat of a global nuclear war.Unprecedented affluence has been achieved in parts of theworld. Momentous technological breakthroughs have beenmade. We now have the potential to achieve global peace address global problems and promote global prosperity.But even as we celebrate these victories  the triumphsof reason and statesmanship  we must confront the darkforces of aggression  racism  fascism and bigotry  whichhave again raised their head in many parts of the world.It is  perhaps  not surprising that once the restraints ofthe cold war structures were lifted  conflicts and disputes -between States and within them - should have erupted likean epidemic. The world community has been unpreparedto confront and repel aggression - witness Bosnia Azerbaijan and Kashmir. We have been unable to musterthe political will to stop genocide - witness Rwanda. Weare unprepared to pay the price to help the hungry and savethe deprived of the Earth - witness the Sahel.The principal task of this session must be to revivehope  to restore the confidence of our peoples  that we the States Members of the United Nations  actingtogether  can build peace where it is broken; that we canbring solace to those who are suffering; that we canuphold and enforce justice where this is needed; and thatwe can enlarge the horizons of prosperity to embracethose teeming millions who are imprisoned in poverty."
"132",5484,"PAN",49,1994,"First of all allow me to say how pleased we areat your election as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. Since you are such an eminentstatesman  we are certain that this session will be aresounding success. We hail the work accomplished byAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  who presidedover the recently concluded session of the GeneralAssembly. We are grateful to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary-General of the Organization  for the fine job heis doing  reflecting his constant concern with helping tobuild a more just and progressive world society on the basisof the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter.This past May  the Panamanian people completed anirreproachable electoral process. The results now make itpossible for us to undertake the democratic reconstructionof the State  with broad-based and cooperative participationby all of Panama’s various social groupings.This has made it possible for us to develop promisingnew relations of understanding and cooperation with theGovernment of the United States  grounded in a commonresolve to fulfil on schedule the timetable established by theTorrijos-Carter Treaties on the Panama Canal andassociated territories. Furthermore  we are seeking toextend our relations  as partners and friends of the UnitedStates  into fields that will facilitate the solution of regionaland world problems affecting the stability of areas ofcommon interest to both nations. With maturity  and anintense sense of dignity and patriotism  the Government ofPanama is embarking on a new era in our relations with theUnited States.Thus these Treaties today are becoming once more forour two nations what we intended them to be when theywere signed 17 years ago: the feasibility of a great Powerand a small country working together  peacefully  toachieve mutually beneficial results on matters thatpreviously gave rise to confrontation. Furthermore  this isin keeping with the principles of international law and givesus all new cause for hope concerning the new era the worldis now seeking to establish.Pursuant to those Treaties  the Government headed byMr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares intends in a responsiblemanner to put into effect the timetable of reversion toPanama of all the lands  waters and installations that formthe Canal and its contiguous area. Similarly  we intend toensure full demilitarization of the waterway and consequently  we are planning as of now the promptconversion of the foreign military installations there intoindustrial and trading posts of international interest  whoseoperations will be carried out just a few scant yards fromthe vessels that pass through day by day  heading towardsall points of the compass.The decisions we have taken will ensure that thisstrip of territory will become one of the most attractiveareas for investment in the Atlantic  the Americas  and thePacific Basin.Despite Panama’s intense economic and culturalenergy  it is a small country. Hence developing thisproject will require international cooperation. In the shortterm  the new Panamanian Government intends tocoordinate this cooperation in order to take the bestpossible advantage of a tremendous potential.In this context  we shall convene in 1997 the WorldCongress on the Panama Canal to commemorate thetwentieth anniversary of the signing of the Torrijos-CarterTreaties. This event will bring together the users of theCanal and the potential users of the associated facilities -shipbuilders  industrialists  financiers  technical experts planners and leaders of higher education - to consider thescope and orchestration of the entire development projectfor the Panama Canal and the Panamanian nation.This Congress will also be an arena for the displayof technology-  media- and communications-relatedproducts  as well as for interoceanic and intercontinentaltrade. It will therefore be of particular importance ingauging the scope of the new world trend which we nowcall ""globalization"". For this reason  we intend to planthis Congress with the cooperation of the United Nationsas well as that of the two countries which  in their time were engaged in the construction of the Canal - Franceand the United States.There is another facet to this situation  however. WePanamanians have convincingly proved our ability toefficiently administer and operate the existing Canal; weshall demonstrate this once again at the World Congress.Yet we wish to make further use of these skills  and thisdesire forms the basis for the projects tied in with thecurrent  final phase of implementation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties: by this  I mean the internationaluniversity conglomerate that we call the ""Ciudad delSaber""  ""the City of Knowledge"". In this area  and withthe excellent infrastructure facilities that will soon revert22to Panama  we can bring together  in the best possiblephysical environment  faculties and departments of themajor universities interested in studying subjects related tothe next century and its prospects - subjects such ascommunications and telecommunications  naval and airtransport  computer technology  international trade  theenvironment and sustainable development  as well aseconomic and business relations between our Americas andthe Pacific basin.Thus conceived  the City of Knowledge will replacemilitary bases and foreign soldiers with an internationalconglomerate of universities and a great army of studentsand teachers from all corners of the world. This will be thebest possible way to celebrate the end of the cold war andthe development of new world circumstances  while at thesame time making the new era accessible to manythousands of our young people. We are certain that thisproject will receive the necessary international cooperationand the support of the United Nations system.There is another issue of similar  worldwide interestthat deserves the attention of this forum. Although it is aninteroceanic passageway  the Panama Canal is fedexclusively by fresh water. For this reason  its existence the quality of its services and the possibility of expandingthem depend on the renewal of its forests and the attentionto the environment that is indispensable to feeding its basin guaranteeing the water supply and making it possible forthe Canal to operate.This basin has suffered disturbing deterioration  which should it continue  could jeopardize the services providedto the world by the Canal. Conscious of its responsibilities our country has begun a series of national and internationalconsultations with a view to devising a campaign thatwould secure the technical and financial resources neededto ensure the environmental conditions required for theimprovement and optimal use of the Canal. This campaigncould perhaps serve as a symbol of internationalcooperation in ensuring appropriate use of resourcesnecessary to mankind.Our country has recently rejoined the Rio Group - ofwhich we were one of the initial promoters - as a fullmember. With respect to foreign policy  we fully concurwith the purposes  declarations and agreements adopted bythis group.We Panamanians are sincerely resolved to expand ourpolitical dialogue and economic cooperation withneighbouring countries. To this end  we are pursuing theprocess of integration with the countries of CentralAmerica in all ways that can be mutually beneficial.Because of its history and traditions  as well as forreasons of geographical proximity and economic affinity Panama will be promoting links and integration with itsSouth American neighbours  with which it shares theideals of Bolivar.At the same time  the great trading opportunitiesafforded us as a result of the reversion of the PanamaCanal and its adjacent areas make it incumbent on us tostrengthen our links with the countries of the Pacificbasin  and to work together on projects and activities ofmutual benefit.For similar reasons  Panama  which already has aspecial relationship with the United States - a relationshipthat is taking on special significance today - intends toseek membership in the North American Free TradeAssociation  whose current members  Canada  the UnitedStates and Mexico  are certain to play a significant role inensuring the best possible use of the Canal areas that willrevert to Panama.In recent times  the international community hasnoted symptoms of repeated crises in certain parts of theCaribbean area. Indeed  on certain specific conditions Panama has offered parts of its national territory to helpprovide a temporary solution to the problem of theHaitian and Cuban raft and boat people. This gesture hasbeen motivated solely by humanitarian considerations without political or diplomatic implications. We shallcontinue to act in this manner  especially when it is usefulin providing a grace period during which a peaceful  andagreed solution to the underlying causes of theseproblems may be found.In the case of Haiti  my Government is particularlygratified that an agreement was reached which allowedfor the landing of multinational forces in accordance withthe relevant Security Council resolution and without thetrauma of an invasion by force. We believe  none theless  that Haiti’s problems will be solved only when allaspects of the Security Council resolution are fullyimplemented and  in terms of socio-economic issues provided the international community helps eradicate thecauses of the poverty and backwardness which persistthere.With respect to the situation in the fraternal Republicof Cuba  we believe that the causes underlying the23conflict must be addressed. For this reason  myGovernment favours reforms which  through the exercise ofself-determination  would guarantee the establishment of amulti-party democracy there. Furthermore  my Governmentis in favour of lifting the economic embargo that is such aburden on that country. Only by acting simultaneously onboth fronts will it be possible to overcome this crisis. Weare fully ready to assist the fraternal Caribbean nation ofCuba.With the conclusion of the cold war  the world isfocusing most of its attention on other problems  new andold  which now make up the world agenda - problems suchas the current restructuring of systems of economicrelations and international politics.It must be stressed that in the handling of thephenomena known as ""globalization""  it is vital to establisha new order which will take into account the realities interests  sovereign rights  and just aspirations of the smallcountries and the developing nations in general. Anydevelopment which  out of selfishness  indifference inattention  or the like  fails to meet this requirement  willinevitably condemn us to a world riddled with yet furtherimbalance  marginalization and instability.Mankind’s hopes for the twenty-first century will berealized only if together we are able to build a much fairer more equitable and more balanced future. This applies toall countries  be they rich or poor  weak or strong.Specifically  such a future requires that we embarkimmediately on a vigorous programme of common andcoordinated actions to eradicate mankind’s greatestproblem: poverty. Panama declares again today  before theAssembly  that it is willing to join the internationalprogrammes to combat poverty and promote solidarity andsocial equity  as well as those aimed at promoting a betterquality of life for the sectors that are most deprived andleast fairly treated. In particular  Panama will commit itselfto efforts to improve the social situation of the family andof women and children.In respect of this universal aspiration  women inPanama have already attained positions of relativeimportance in both political and professional arenas.Today  for the first time in the history of our Republic  thedeserving President of our legislative organ is a womanwho is a popular leader  while in our last elections anotherprominent female politician was a candidate for thepresidency of the Republic of Panama  and she now leadsthe major opposition party. We are also proud to seePanamanian professional women serving in the Cabinet ofMr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares and as judges on ourSupreme Court of Justice. In short  women in Panamaplay a leading and powerful role in all aspects of ourpolitical and private life  and they are often at theforefront of our technical  scientific and professionaldevelopment. For this reason we shall continue tosupport actions that make it possible for women toachieve full and effective equality of rights andopportunities in an increasingly competitive world.On another question  my country has decided totackle firmly and unequivocally the problems of drug-trafficking  money-laundering and terrorism. We arecurrently devising a strategy to combat these terrible evilsthat imperil the very existence of our nations. We favourthe development of joint  coordinated action on theinternational level. The community of nations faces agreat challenge in these grave problems  and we ferventlyappeal to the Governments and the peoples of LatinAmerica to create a powerful organization to combatthem.In another area  Panama is particularly attentive tothe discussions aimed at defining a new role for theUnited Nations and the corresponding structural reformsthis world Organization requires. With regard specificallyto the structure of the United Nations  Panama believes itis necessary to increase the representativity of its mostimportant decision-making bodies. In particular  mycountry believes that the Security Council must beenlarged. Panama wishes to reiterate that  whateverapproach is taken  Latin America’s participation in thatbody should be increased and Latin American countriesshould be given consideration as possible permanentmembers.I am pleased to state that the new democraticGovernment of Panama fully accepts the commitment tobolster and enhance its presence in international agencies where it is a Latin American and Caribbean voice thatremains faithful to the rightful aspirations of thedeveloping countries. This decision is reflected in thespeech delivered by Ernesto Pérez Balladares when hewas sworn in as my country’s President. He said:""This is the new face that Panama is showing to itsfriends abroad. We are no longer at the stage ofseeking solidarity on the Canal Treaty in order toregain the benefits of our geographic position. Nowwe want to begin our participation in the new worldthat is challenging us all and to make known the24potentialities of our geographic position  our desire totake advantage of all opportunities properly  fairly andrespectfully  in the pursuit of an aggressive foreignpolicy free of complexes and capable of helping ussurmount the challenges of the next century. We arefriends to all. We are foes of none.""We look with optimism on the development ofmankind and  in particular  that of my country. We willpass the baton to our young people on our country’s pathof progress  peace and justice.Finally  on this occasion I also take pleasure inwishing you  Mr. President  every success in your task ofleading the General Assembly."
"133",5531,"PER",49,1994,"I should like sincerely to congratulate Mr.Essy on his election as president over the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. His country and minemaintain friendly diplomatic relations and close linksstrengthened by the historic ties between Africa and LatinAmerica. I wish him success in his endeavours and offerhim the fullest cooperation of the Peruvian delegation.We live in an age that confronts the internationalcommunity as a whole  and the United Nations inparticular  with big challenges. Representative democracyand the market economy have spread throughout the world along with an intensification of integration processes andthe globalization of trade.Nevertheless  international peace and security have notyet been consolidated in all regions. We have witnessedevents such as the unexpected collapse of States that hadseemed to be solid  episodes of massive violence withinsome countries and the tragic and complex situations thatresulted  persistent aggression against a Member of thisOrganization and the exacerbation of nationalism in manyparts of the world. All these things challenge the presentcapacity of the United Nations to respond.Faced with such challenges  the United Nations mustreaffirm its central role as the indispensable leader in themaintenance of international peace and security and in thepromotion of world-wide development. This is its duty  notonly because of the universal character of the UnitedNations system  but also because of the contractualsignificance of the instrument by which it was established.In this respect  we must bear in mind that thepotential of the United Nations as the foremostinternational Organization can be reinforced by increasedand more efficient coordination with the regionalorganizations.By the same token  we attach special importance tothe General Assembly’s exercise of the powers assignedto it by the Charter  as well as to the expansion andreform of the Security Council. With regard to the latter we should seek to correct the imbalances in its presentcomposition  improve its decision-making machinery andmake its working methods more transparent  whilestriving to make its composition truly representative of allMember States of the Organization.As the Secretary-General pointed out in his reports ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) and ""An Agenda forDevelopment"" (A/48/935)  it now appears to be politicallyfeasible to respond to the multiple requirements ofinternational peace and security while encouragingcooperation in the social and economic field  because thecomplementarity of these elements is such that withouteconomic development there can be no peace or security.""An Agenda for Peace"" must therefore be complementedby an agenda for development. In this way the UnitedNations could lead the international community  inaccordance with the purposes and principles of itsCharter  and integrate the actions of our Organization withthe work of the Bretton Woods institutions  and above allthe World Trade Organization.In this regard  we share the concern of the Secretary-General  who has warned that the subject of developmentis in danger of vanishing from the United Nations agenda.We must therefore emphasize that the grave problemsrelated to development must be included in ourOrganization’s work and that developed and developingcountries must agree on the need to address  urgently andadequately  critical situations such as dire poverty.The coming World Summit for Social Developmentoffers us an opportunity that we must seize. Peru  whichtook part in the early stages of the process that led to thedecision to convene that Summit  will contribute to it thenational programme for social development that theGovernment of President Fujimori has been carrying out a programme that gives priority attention to the basic10services of health  education and the administration ofjustice  particularly for the poorest.In the same context  Peru believes that the internalefforts of developing countries in the vital spheres of socialand economic advance must be matched by high-prioritymultilateral and bilateral cooperation.I must also observe that in most of our countriessocial development also means stability. Therefore continuing democratization and modernization is largelydependent on the assignment of high priority to thisinescapable challenge.Along with the problems of development  the rapidlyevolving situation today presents us  as an internationalOrganization  with a number of particularly complexsubjects. Outstanding among them is the process ofreconciliation and peace in the Middle East  which willhave important effects on regional and world stability andsecurity  as well as on trade  regional cooperation anddisarmament. Peru supports this process  and believes thatresolutions adopted in the General Assembly must properlyreflect that reality and contribute to the maintenance of anappropriate political climate to advance the negotiatingprocess.We also welcome the new South Africa  whichembodies the fulfilment of the essential principles of theCharter and which is a possible factor for regional stability.It also provides an example of democratic change.The tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  whichhas made clear the serious limitations of multilateralorganizations  demands increased efforts by theinternational community to ensure an early and lastingpeace.I now wish to address a subject that we cannot ignore one that affects the international community as a whole andthat is particularly delicate for my own country: the drugproblem. Peru reiterates its resolve to continue to fightillegal drug trafficking  as well as its conviction that thisserious problem urgently requires the unwavering politicalcommitment of the international community. That alonewill make it possible to adopt concrete and realisticmeasures to stand up to this scourge in accordance with themandates of the Global Programme of Action adopted bythe General Assembly in 1990.International coordination and cooperation againstdrug-trafficking are indispensable. In that regard  I ampleased to point out that the recent Summit of Presidentsof the member countries of the Rio Group accepted theproposal of the President of the Republic of Peru  AlbertoFujimori  to coordinate legislation to penalize money-laundering  allow the confiscation of property linked todrug-trafficking  establish swift extradition procedures promote judicial and police cooperation on this matter andbolster cooperation for alternative development.My country also pays special attention to humanrights. Their promotion and defence constitute aninescapable obligation of the international community which must therefore reinforce and improve currentmechanisms of the system for the protection of humanrights  in order to increase their efficacy.We are pleased to note the growing recognition andsupport by this international Organization for thosecountries that  like us  are continuing to struggle to defendlife and civilized ways of coexistence against theunjustifiable and irrational violence of terrorism. For us this means that the international community has madeprogress  by recognizing that in countries such as Peruterrorist groups are the primary  the true  violators ofhuman rights.In the current context of renewal  we supported thecreation of the post of United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  in an effort to improveUnited Nations measures to prevent and monitorviolations of human rights  whether the violators begovernment agents or others. It is a matter of pride forour region that a distinguished Latin American diplomatis the first to fill this high office.Within this chamber last year  the President of Peruannounced that the leader of the bloodiest terroristmovement in the Western Hemisphere - caught as a resultof our successful campaign for national peace - hadacknowledged in writing the clear defeat of his totalitarianaims and his bloodthirsty methods. Today I am pleasedto confirm that Peru is swiftly progressing towardsreconciliation and peace. The Peruvian strategy  whichinvolves the State and civil society  has borne fruit  asevidenced by the mass desertions of terrorists as a resultof the ""repentance law"" passed on repentance and thereturn of peaceful villagers to their homes  with thesupport and backing of the State.My country  having guaranteed democracy andeconomic freedom  now has  after many years  excellentprospects. We have established a new national11environment by consistently applying economic  social andpacification policies. The results prove that we have takenthe correct path  as shown by the growth in gross nationalproduct - 7 per cent last year  and projected to be between9 per cent and 10 per cent this year  figures whichconstitute the highest growth rates in the hemisphere.This new situation will allow us  for the first time indecades  to give social issues the priority they deserve. Theeconomic policies followed in Peru have made possible asocial programme implemented through non-inflationaryinvestment  with our own resources. This programme hasthe technical backing of international financial institutionsand is in line with the conceptual approaches on socialdevelopment promoted by the World Bank  the UnitedNations Development Programme and a growing number ofnon-governmental organizations that share a belief inputting the human being at the core of development efforts.To do otherwise would be to make sustainable long-termgrowth impossible. This essential task for the whole ofPeruvian society requires the cooperation and support of theinternational community.My country’s contribution to change in the world hasbeen made possible by the efforts of our people  who haveenabled us to enjoy internal peace  security  stability andeconomic growth. The path we are taking leads the mosttenacious nation in South America  a people of long-provencreativity  on the threshold of a new millennium with theenthusiasm  the ability and the necessary tools for itsdevelopment."
"134",5578,"PHL",49,1994,"Please allow me tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the exaltedoffice of President of the General Assembly. Yourdistinguished career and your experience in internationalaffairs  together with your outstanding personal qualities assure us of wise and skilled leadership at the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly.As we approach the fiftieth year of the life of ourOrganization  let us look back to the first principles of itsexistence. Let us see how we can apply those principlesto the dynamic realities of our time and  to the extent thathuman discernment will allow  to the uncertaincircumstances of the next half century.Emerging from the unspeakable horror and devastationof untrammelled global conflict  the internationalcommunity brought forth the United Nations as aninstrument  above all  for preventing conflict and keepingthe peace. This mission was to be carried out  if possible through the encouragement of the peaceful settlement ofdisputes by the contending parties themselves or  ifnecessary  through the interposition of armed force by theUnited Nations.As with any human institution  the United Nationsrecord in this regard has been mixed. We find that theUnited Nations has been effective in keeping the peace inthose cases in which both the parties to the disputes and themajor Powers involved have turned — or have beencompelled to turn — to the international community toseparate the contending forces and allow them a respitefrom war. This we have seen in such places as Cyprus Angola  Mozambique  Liberia and certain parts of theMiddle East  including Lebanon.In recent years  a singular success was achieved in myown part of the world when in Cambodia  upon the resolveof the international community and the Cambodian partiesthemselves  the United Nations not only enforced the peacebut also managed the transition to a regime of peace andnational reconciliation.Contending with matters of war and peace hasengaged the greater portion of the attention andpreoccupation of the United Nations and of the internationalcommunity. However  our founding fathers recognizedfrom the very beginning that it is not enough to head offcrises and intervene in conflicts  but that the roots of warand peace lie in the human condition and the human mind.It is thus there  at their roots  that mankind must deal withquestions of war and peace.As we look back at this half-century  we see withextraordinary clarity that the enduring triumphs of theinternational community have come not with the impositionof outside force but when the deepest concerns of thenations and peoples involved are addressed and resolved.In the past year  two such triumphs brightened  like twincomets  the history of the human community  forcefullydemonstrating yet again this essential reality. Thesetriumphant achievements came in precisely those two areasthat had most deeply engaged the United Nations for thegreater part of its existence — South Africa and theMiddle East.In South Africa  national peace and reconciliation ina regime of democracy emerged victorious after decadesof struggle  led by the United Nations  against apartheidand on behalf of human dignity  racial equality  majorityrule and political pluralism. This happened only aftermost of the political forces in the country recognizedthese universal values as essential to the survival of theSouth African nation.In the Middle East  the dramatic breakthroughworked out by Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) has opened the doors of hope for anend to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This was made possibleby the tenacious insistence of the internationalcommunity  mainly through the United Nations  on theright of the Palestinian people to govern themselves andon the right of all States in the region to a secureexistence within internationally recognized boundaries. Itfinally occurred because the leaders of Israel and the PLOand other Arab leaders recognized the essential nature ofthese rights.Sadly  savage conflicts continue to ravage lives inBosnia and Herzegovina  Somalia  Rwanda and otherareas experiencing similar tragedies  mainly becausepeople of influence among the various ethnic groups tribes and clans have not accepted the fundamental truthof their common humanity.For a long time  the United Nations has advancedthe proposition that economic development — raising theincome of a nation as a whole — was vital to peace andstability in the world. The United Nations is certainlyright to emphasize this important reality. In many cases extreme poverty has led to despair and to a sense ofoutrage over the perceived injustice of living in penuryand deprivation in a world of affluence and profligateconsumption  of being inadequately compensated for theuse by others of one’s nation’s human and naturalresources  and of being doomed to a chronic inability toshake off an unpayable debt to foreign creditors.Fortunately  many developing nations — and thePhilippines is proud to take its place among them — havemade hard political decisions and adopted economicpolicies favourable to dynamic and sustained economicgrowth.19These are thus hopeful times for economic growth  atleast for those countries in a position to take advantage ofa more liberal international trading regime. However  asmany countries  and the United Nations itself  haverealized  economic development by itself is not enough.Raising the overall income of a nation is not enough. Alarger gross national product does not necessarily mean abetter life for the individual citizen. A bigger economy byitself does not satisfy the individual person’s aspiration tohuman fulfilment.Indeed  economic growth cannot be sustained for longunless the individual citizen and the individual communityhave a stake in that growth and unless they are mobilizedand empowered to take active part in the process ofdevelopment. Economic growth would be meaningless tothe individual who does not share in its benefits or whosecommunity is destroyed by it. Development is empty forpersons who are deprived of their individual rights andfreedoms. A society cannot find fulfilment in growth  andindeed the development process itself is severely hampered if it does not take adequate care of its vulnerable groups:women  children  ethnic minorities  the handicapped  thehomeless. Development cannot be sustained unless thenurturing qualities of the natural environment are conservedfor future generations.Care for citizens’ fulfilment as human beings  for theircommunity and for society cannot wait. It cannot wait fortotal peace to be achieved or for a certain level ofdevelopment to be attained. All these — peace development  and the quality of society and of humanlife — must proceed simultaneously.We in the Philippines have learned this lesson the hardway and are now applying it faithfully. We have securedpeace and national reconciliation through a peace processthat includes having sincere discussions with dissidentelements and extending a generous amnesty to them. Wehave granted a substantial degree of autonomy and self-ruleto our ethnic minorities  particularly the Muslimcommunity. We have devolved extensive authority responsibility and resources on local governments andcommunities  and we have restored the system ofdemocratic pluralism  through which the people and theirgroups can thrash out their grievances and advance theirinterests in peace and with civility.At the same time  we have pursued a purposefulprogramme of economic development through theliberalization of the conditions governing trade  investments and banking and finance  and through the privatization ofGovernment enterprises. We have provided infrastructurefacilities and generous incentives for domestic and foreigninvestors. These  together with the restoration of politicalstability  have placed us back on the road to economicrecovery and self-sustaining growth.Simultaneously  we have adopted a social agendathrough a broad national consensus. In accordance withthat agenda we have endeavoured to improve the qualityof life of our people  not only because such animprovement is their inherent right  and not only becausethe ultimate purpose of development  in our view  is thewelfare of the individual and his community  but alsobecause we know that the best way to spur economicdevelopment is to afford the people a stake in it andbecause we recognize that the people are an economy’smost vital resource.We are thus jealously safeguarding the individualFilipino’s fundamental rights and freedoms. Part of thiseffort is the importance that we place on human-rightseducation for all  including the armed forces and thepolice  a mission that is mandated by a unique provisionin our Constitution.We are expanding the empowerment of our peopleand their communities  particularly of the most vulnerablegroups. We have devoted attention and resources to theconcerns of women  including women workers  and ofchildren  particularly those of the poor. We haveprotected the rights and culture of our ethnic minorities.And we have allocated substantial resources to health andeducation for the development of our people as our mostvaluable asset.We in the Philippines believe that this simultaneousand balanced approach to peace  development and thequality of individual lives must be applied in theinternational community as well as within nations  in thefamily of man as well as in national societies.The expansion of the global economy is importantfor peace in the world and the progress of nations  but itis not enough. Each country must have a stake in thisexpansion and an enlarged share of it.Even this is not enough. The internationalcommunity must go beyond nations in its ministrations.It must devote greater attention to care and respect forpeople and to the recognition of the inherent equality ofall human beings — regardless of gender  of age  of race of religion  of language  of culture or of nationality.20We must all remember that the sources of conflict donot lie only in disputes over territory or resources. As weknow only too well  they arise also  and it seemsincreasingly  from intolerance of other people’s beliefs andcultures and from the less than human treatment of peoplefrom other lands.Mankind has made progress in advancing the truth thatthere are certain things that transcend national boundariesand are the common heritage  the common concern and thecommon responsibility of all nations and of mankind as awhole. Among these are the environment and the oceansand their resources.There is something else that transcends nationalboundaries and summons global responsibility  somethingthat is of infinitely greater worth than even the environmentor the oceans. I am speaking of the world’s mostvulnerable human groups. I speak specifically of migrantworkers  refugees  children  the aged and the disabled  andthe special concerns of the world’s women.The transnational migration of workers is anincreasingly prominent phenomenon of international life inour time. This is the result of supply and demand forworkers seeking equilibrium. Migrant workers  however are more than a commodity to be traded in the internationalmarket-place. They have the same dignity and rights asany of us in this Hall. Moreover  they make a vitalcontribution to the economies and societies of the countriesin which they live and work.And yet  many countries  including developingcountries  treat migrant workers as being less than thehuman beings that they are. At best  these workers are leftunprotected by the law governing labour and employment.The international community  the United Nations  cannotallow the abuse of these vulnerable and valuable membersof the human family to continue.We urge member States to ratify or accede to theInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights ofAll Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families as anexpression of their recognition of the common humanitythat they share with migrants and their families.The Secretary-General might form a group to submitrecommendations to the Assembly at our next session onimproving coordination of the various efforts of the UnitedNations on behalf of migrant workers. And I call upon theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to make the rightsof migrant workers one of his priority concerns.I reiterate the call for a global conference oninternational migration and development  which wassupported by many delegations at the recent InternationalConference on Population and Development  held inCairo.Natural and man-made disasters have createdlarge-scale flows of refugees around the world. While thedistinction between refugees and economic migrants hasto be resolutely made  genuine refugees must be given allthe protection that international conventions call for.Children  by their very nature  have a claim tomankind’s protection and care. That claim is special inthe case of street children  children coerced into drugaddiction  refugee children and children in the areas ofarmed conflict or natural disasters. National societies andthe international community must ensure that suchchildren are provided with adequate food  medical care shelter and education. We may need to draw up aconvention dealing with the sale of children  childprostitution  child pornography and the nefarious trade inbody parts of children.The rights  education and empowerment of womenaround the world are of special importance to the UnitedNations and to the world  as they have everything to dowith some of mankind’s most vital concerns — the healthand education of children  the advancement of theeconomy  the preservation of the environment and themanagement of the country’s and the world’s population.We in the Philippines look forward to the FourthWorld Conference on Women  and call for the inclusionin its platform of action of measures for the protectionand advancement of women’s rights  particularly ofwomen in positions of great vulnerability  includingwomen migrant workers  women refugees  and minoritywomen. We also call upon the Ninth United NationsCongress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatmentof Offenders to take steps towards making gender-basedviolence a crime  especially violence against womenmigrant workers and the victims of the traffic in women.Underlying the need to safeguard the welfare ofthese vulnerable groups is the fundamental issue ofhuman rights  the issue of respect for all people and theirrights  the issue of their inherent equality as humanbeings. The United Nations has adopted numerousinternational instruments on human rights  beginning withthe Universal Declaration. The Philippines is party to 21of these.21The United Nations must renew its commitment tofoster compliance with these solemn covenants  always withrespect for the sovereignty of nations. Since the concept ofthe inherent rights and equality of human persons resides inthe minds of people  United Nations efforts in this regardmust begin with education. As our Constitution proclaims human-rights education is itself a human right.Our delegation reaffirms its full support for a proposalintroduced last year for the declaration of a United Nationsdecade on human rights education. At the same time  theUnited Nations human rights machinery must bestrengthened  particularly the new office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for HumanRights.Even as we refocus our concerns on basic humanneeds  we should not lose sight of the continuing  and evenincreased  importance of peace-keeping in the mandate ofthe United Nations. We must  however  make sure that thepeace-keeping function does not divert resources fromeconomic and social development  is not used by the majorPowers simply to pursue their respective agendas  and iscarried out in a transparent and democratic manner.The Philippines fully supports an approach tointernational peace and security that is based on securingfriendly relations among peoples of different political cultural  ethnic and religious backgrounds  respect forinternational law  and the peaceful settlement of disputes.We believe that the maintenance of international peace andsecurity should not rest primarily on the use or threat ofsanctions  armed force  or other coercive measures. Norshould peace-keeping operations  important as they are  takethe place of the political settlement of disputes.In light of this  and because of the growing numberand complexity of United Nations peace-keeping operations we in the United Nations have to agree on a set of guidingprinciples for the establishment and conduct of suchoperations. Such a set of guidelines would not onlycontribute to the effectiveness of the peace-keepingoperations but also broaden the base of active support forthem. The maintenance of international peace and securityis a collective responsibility. The United Nations mustensure the international nature of all peace-keepingoperations if it is to maintain their credibility.It is in this spirit that we approach the live question ofthe reform of the Security Council. It is ironic that  in themidst of the rapid spread of democracy within nations inrecent years and the expanding membership of the UnitedNations  the Security Council remains unrepresentative inits size and in the geographic distribution of itsmembership and undemocratic in its decision-making andworking methods.Clearly  while the composition and methods of theSecurity Council must reflect the realities of political andeconomic power  we have to redress the imbalance in itscomposition and increase the participation of the generalmembership and other United Nations organs in itsdecision-making  if we are to enhance its effectivenessand its accountability. This would involve both enlargingthe Council’s membership and reforming its methods andprocedures.Specifically  we believe that the Council’smembership should be better balanced in terms ofgeographic distribution and increased representation of thedeveloping countries. At the same time  the SecurityCouncil has to improve the transparency of its workingmethods and decision-making processes  which  in turn would enhance its working relationship with the generalmembership and the other principal organs of the UnitedNations  especially the General Assembly. We lookforward to early action on this aspiration by the workinggroup of the General Assembly dealing with theexpansion of the Security Council and related matters.The General Assembly  for its part  must revitalizeitself if it is to carry out its functions and discharge itsresponsibilities under the Charter  including thosepertaining to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity in which it must assert its role as the onlyprincipal organ with universal membership. In the pasttwo years  the General Assembly adopted two resolutionsto this effect. Let us begin implementing their keyprovisions.Revitalization of the United Nations is demanded bythe new circumstances and challenges of today’s dynamicworld. Let us  at the very least  do our very best touphold and strengthen the principle of universality in ourOrganization.It is in the interest of revitalizing the United Nationsthat the effective management of the Organizationassumes enormous importance. The Philippine delegationwelcomes the creation by the General Assembly of theOffice of Internal Oversight Services. We suggest however  that the Assembly consider the possibleestablishment of an independent advisory group tooversee the work and receive the reports of this Office.22This would provide the checks and balances so necessaryin a large organization such as the United Nations.As the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsapproaches  we must ensure that the balance is maintainedamong the principal concerns of the Organization — themaintenance of peace and security  the promotion ofeconomic progress and the advancement of socialdevelopment.Because it has lagged behind the first two of thepreoccupations of the United Nations  I suggest that wenow pay closer attention and turn our efforts more to thethird of our Organization’s principal concerns — the socialcomponent of the basic needs of the human community andthe human person.As we approach this important milestone of theOrganization  it is altogether fitting that we focus the workof the United Nations on the human person and society whose interest and welfare  after all  are the ultimate reasonfor the existence of the United Nations and the finalobjective of its works."
"135",5638,"PNG",49,1994," On behalf ofmy delegation and Government and the people of PapuaNew Guinea I join previous speakers in warmlycongratulating Ambassador Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoireon his election as the President of the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly. My delegation is confident thathe will maintain the high standards set by hispredecessors and lead us skilfully through our importantdeliberations. I pledge my delegation’s cooperation in thedischarge of the responsibilities of his high office.At the same time as we welcome Ambassador Essy my delegation would also like to pay tribute to hispredecessor  His Excellency Ambassador SamuelInsanally of Guyana  who skilfully guided the work of theforty-eighth session.As consistent opponents of the vile doctrine ofapartheid and the unjust political system on which it wasbased  the people and Government of Papua New Guineatake particular pleasure in welcoming the readmission ofa new and democratic South Africa to the United Nations.We look forward to strengthening our relations with theGovernment and people of South Africa in a bilateral aswell as a multilateral setting.27With the end of the cold war  we are in a challengingperiod. Our collective resolve should be for the good ofhumanity. That calls for increased multilateral diplomacy especially of the nature espoused in the United NationsCharter.To that end  my Government values regionalcooperation and believes that such efforts would enhancethe basis for regional stability and internationaldevelopment cooperation. Papua New Guinea values itsmembership of the South Pacific Forum and the MelanesianSpearhead Group  just as it enjoys its association with theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as aspecial observer. These regional organizations have forgedmutual cooperation between member countries as well asenhancing the atmosphere for international cooperation.Such cooperation was evident during the recent SouthPacific Forum session held in Brisbane  Australia  wheresix countries - namely Australia  Fiji  New Zealand  PapuaNew Guinea  Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - were able toagree to work together towards a common approach onlogging and the export of timber. That positivedevelopment in a regional context is of definite value toongoing global endeavours for the environment andsustainable development.We believe that an increasing number of issues are ofglobal importance and must be addressed on a global basis.In this regard  the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro  theGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States in Barbados  and the recentWorld Conference on Population and Development inCairo  as well as the forthcoming World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing next year  suggest thatthese issues are extremely important and need concertedinternational efforts. While there is emerging consensus onthese issues  there seems to be a lack of commitment toproviding the necessary resources to achieve thoseobjectives.Is it worth the time and effort expended in adoptingvisionary resolutions and declarations when the requiredresources are not there to fulfil the programmes andobjectives of these world conferences? In that regard mydelegation is particularly anxious to see internationalsupport for the Barbados Programme of Action onSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates.The United Nations initiative on opportunity andparticipation focuses on the particular need of developingcountries in their efforts to maximize the participation ofall their citizens in activities aimed at sustainabledevelopment and an effective management of resources.In this regard I welcome the Secretary-General’sinterim report on this initiative  to be issued under item92 (j) of the agenda of the forty-ninth session. MyGovernment looks forward to the final report by the panelof distinguished experts  to be issued to coincide with thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.It is clear that these issues and others require both anational and a collective international approach particularly those relating to environmental and climaticchanges which transcend national boundaries. Agenda 21 adopted at the Rio Earth Summit  provides a good basisfor international cooperation and action.Consistent with the emerging international consensuson major global issues  my Prime Minister  the RightHonourable Sir Julius Chan  has emphasized the need fora global view to be taken of these concerns and for ourGovernment to take effective action nationally as well asregionally in pursuance of our foreign policy.In taking a global view we must not allow vaguegeneralities to substitute for practical action. Each of usmust contribute to resolving global problems where wecan be most effective.We must follow the thrust of recommendationscontained in the Secretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace""and an ""Agenda for Development"" prepared for ourguidance  and we must pursue those goals  starting athome and in our respective regions.As far as Papua New Guinea’s foreign relations areconcerned  we are giving renewed attention to the need towork the Pacific in a practical way. In doing so  we arenot turning away from mutually beneficial ties that havedeveloped over the years with countries and regionalorganizations such as ASEAN  but are trying toconsolidate and to continue diversifying our foreignrelations in a wider context.We remain just as emphatically committed tomaintaining - and where possible strengthening - PapuaNew Guinea’s long-standing links with other countries inthe Asia-Pacific region  Europe and elsewhere.28Even as we focus renewed attention on certaincountries and objectives  our basic approach to thedevelopment of Papua New Guinea’s foreign relationsremains one of active and selective engagement. Ourspecific objectives  including our efforts to work thePacific  will be viewed  and pursued  in a globalperspective.Despite the uncertainties that have arisen and theterrible conflicts that have erupted in various regions  theend of the cold war has  we believe  enabled Members ofthe United Nations to reconsider security on acomprehensive basis. My Government therefore commendsthe attention that reports of the Secretary-General and theUnited Nations Development Programme have given tonon-military threats  to security in the widest sense  and tomeasures to reduce threats to security by other - and morethan military - means. In a very real  and particular  sensethe end of the cold war enables the United Nations to returnto its roots.We are faced with a historic opportunity to pursue debate and take actions on issues of human welfare that arecentral to the purposes of the United Nations.Eighty-five per cent of the people in my country livein rural communities where the basic needs of food andshelter are secured on a sustainable basis. However despite the sustainable livelihood of our people  naturaldisasters can occur  as happened when unexpectedly highfloods destroyed houses  damaged crops and disruptedservices in much of my home province  Gulf  early thisyear.In the past 12 months  various parts of Papua NewGuinea have been afflicted by natural disasters such asfloods  earthquakes  landslides and volcanic activities which have placed a severe burden on our resources. Thesudden volcanic eruptions that caused more than 60 000people to be evacuated from the town of Rabaul andsurrounding areas of East New Britain Province more thanone week ago have considerably taxed our resources. Thevolcanic activity is still continuing.We appreciate the promptness with which variousGovernments  particularly those in our region  includingAustralia  New Zealand and the United States of America continue to respond when natural disasters occur in smallisland countries of the region  including my own country.I take this opportunity to register my Government’sappreciation for the positive responses we have receivedfrom various Governments  international organizations andnon-governmental organizations. We have yet to establishthe extent of the damage to property  crops and foodgardens due to the continuing volcanic activity. In thisregard  my Government would appreciate internationalassistance in its restoration and rehabilitation programmesin due course.Regarding the collective international commitmentwe all undertook at Rio de Janeiro  my Government is inthe process of instituting a national sustainable-development strategy. On a subregional level  we haveissued a joint declaration on cooperation in thedevelopment of natural resources with our fellowmembers of the Melanesian Spearhead Group  theSolomon Islands and Vanuatu. Among other things  itprovides a framework for exchanges of information onforeign countries that exploit and harvest our naturalresources in unsustainable ways and engage in transferpricing and illegal operations.We are party to agreements reached at the Brisbanemeeting of the South Pacific Forum to cooperate on awider basis in order to ensure the sustainable developmentof fisheries and forestry resources. We believedevelopment must be equitable if it is to be sustained.The ongoing failure to reduce environmentalpollution in advanced industrial countries undermines theglobal commitments made at Rio de Janeiro.The people and the Government of Papua NewGuinea are especially sensitive about the need for balancebetween equity and development. We are continuing toexperience the sad consequences that arose from the lackof proper balance among the immediate needs of people the environment and development in the area around thePanguna copper mine  in our province of Bougainville.Allow me to touch on an area of serious concern tomy delegation and my Government. This relates toallegations of human rights violations on the island inBougainville Province of Papua New Guinea. Theallegations of human rights violations have been undulyorchestrated through the Human Rights Commission inGeneva. This  I wish to assure the Assembly  is an ill-conceived attempt to discredit the Government and thepeople of Papua New Guinea.From the very beginning of its life as an independentstate  in 1975  Papua New Guinea has had embodied inits constitution human rights provisions as entrenched29basic and fundamental rights and freedoms of the humanperson.These cover all internationally recognized humanrights Covenants and more. They include the liberty of theperson  freedom from forced labor  freedom from arbitrarysearch and entry  freedom of conscience  thought andreligion  freedom of expression  freedom of assembly andassociation  the right to freedom of employment  the rightto privacy  freedom of information  freedom of movement and protection from unjust deprivation of property. Anhonest and objective assessment of the situation in PapuaNew Guinea should leave no one in doubt as to our goodrecord in the observance of and respect for human rights.My Government therefore sees no difficulty in meetingthe request made by the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights to provide a report on alleged human rightsabuses in Bougainville. Outsiders have been allowed tovisit and to report on what they see; Bougainville is neitherclosed nor shut off from all external contacts.The Bougainville peace conference is expected todiscuss human rights issues  including allegations of abuses.The Government intends to set up a human rightscommission to investigate  provide redress for and preventrepetition of human rights violations. We are confident thatthe report we are providing will deal with all legitimateUnited Nations concerns.The situation in Bougainville is not a colonialproblem. It is not a problem of human rights as such. It isnot a minority or indigenous people’s issue. The trouble inBougainville Province  stemming as it does from claims tocompensation for the use of tribal lands in the process ofdevelopment during a mining project  makes all separatistclaims that are being canvassed by some commentators ringvery hollow.Compensation claims are very common in all theprovinces of Papua New Guinea  which is a countryexperiencing a mining and petroleum resourcesdevelopment boom. The ownership of the land in which themineral resources are located is vested in groups of clansor tribes or other congregations of extended families  andin a very special way their whole being is wrapped up inthe land and the environment. Therefore the determinationof the legal rights of these groups to the benefits from anymining projects on their land becomes a very complicatedand sensitive affair indeed. This is the real basis of theBougainville problem  and it is a problem faced by theGovernment in just about every province in the country.A perfectly legitimate resource-benefit disputebetween the mining company and the traditionallandowners has taken advantage of by criminal elements whose activities derailed the negotiations for a justsolution on compensation for the use of land for thedevelopment of the giant Panguna copper mine  which atthe time was the biggest foreign-exchange earner for thecountry.In a vibrant democracy such as the one we have inPapua New Guinea  we cannot deny our people’sfundamental rights. The exercise of their rightsdetermines the Government that will take office. In ourcontinuing effort to find a resolution to the unfortunatesituation in Bougainville  my Prime Minister has recentlytaken an initiative to bring the conflict to a peaceful end.We have accordingly negotiated a cease-fire with allmajor parties to the crisis.I am pleased to add that preparations for aBougainville peace conference  planned to begin on10 October  are well in hand. A regional peace-keepingforce  made up of units from Tonga  Fiji and Vanuatu with Australian and New Zealand logistical support andthe cooperation  in particular  of the Prime Minister Deputy Prime Minister  Government and people of theSolomon Islands  is being formed to facilitate the peaceprocess. I am pleased to say that at this very moment astatus-of-forces agreement has been signed in Suva  Fiji between my Prime Minister and representatives from theparticipating countries to formalize the arrangements. Webelieve this peace-keeping operation now being put inplace is an example of regional self-help  and an approachworthy of endorsement and wider consideration andapplication.While we are attempting to find a peaceful solutionto the worst crisis faced by Papua New Guinea sinceindependence  my Government can only express its deepconcern at the continuing failure of people with mucholder national institutions to do the same  and ofGovernments elsewhere to act purposefully in their stead.We are deeply disturbed by the continuing violencein Bosnia and Herzegovina  the elusive cease-fire processand the paralysis of political will that has so far failed tohalt aggression. In the cases of Rwanda  Somalia andother trouble areas  I must say that the horrors beingrevealed to the world have caused the most profoundshock in my country. Can we  the Members of theUnited Nations  really do no more to end the violence  toreduce the suffering and to bring mass murderers to30justice? Can we not act faster? Can we be no moreeffective? These questions are especially urgent in an agewhere the complaint has sometimes been made that theUnited Nations is not balancing its attention and resourcesproperly between peace-keeping and development.Even as we regret the terrible situations in some partsof the world  we can only be heartened by developmentselsewhere. Thus my Government welcomes theconstructive steps being taken by the Government of Israeland the Palestinian Liberation Organization to build peacein one of the most troublesome parts of the world. Weapplaud the skilful  determined and unselfish diplomacy thathas facilitated the process and still continues to lend itsupport.Elsewhere in the world  developments to bring abouta political settlement in Haiti have given my Governmentcautious hope that diplomacy will continue to be aneffective means of securing peace in such a complexsituation. The cease-fire in Northern Ireland suggests thatall is never completely lost in even the most enduring andseemingly intractable conflicts.Closer to home  my Government is optimistic aboutthe prospects for securing peace through the RegionalForum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) and other efforts to enhance confidence-buildingin South-East Asia.We urge the Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea to desist from the development ofnuclear weapons.Firmly committed to maintaining and strengtheningrelations with the People’s Republic of China on the basisof existing agreements  my Government none the less seesthe developing dialogue between the People’s Republic ofChina and Taiwan as very promising indeed.Following the successful World Conference on HumanRights held in Vienna in 1993  the draft text of the Agendafor Development acknowledges that development is ahuman right. It also states quite rightly that developmentis ""the most secure basis for peace"". But development inan increasingly interdependent world involves more thannational will and resources. It requires internationalsupport  or at least an international environment that is notactively hostile.While the world must surely welcome the successfulconclusion of the Uruguay round of negotiations under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  peoples andGovernments in developing countries are entitled to lookfor more  particularly by way of measures to reduce andultimately remove completely barriers that obstruct ourcapacity to compete effectively in international trade.Successive Papua New Guinea Governments havebeen active participants in the deliberations of the SpecialCommittee on decolonization. We have been strongadvocates of the right to self-determination in NewCaledonia and of special safeguards for the indigenousKanaks. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum we remain firm in our support of the rights of theKanaks. Our vigilance in relation to the implementationof the Matignon Accords will be maintained until theultimate objective is achieved.With formal termination of the last United NationsTrusteeship mandate  over Palau  later this year  and withthe implementation of the Compact of Free Associationwith the United States of America  my Government looksforward to welcoming Palau to full membership of theUnited Nations in due course.In taking a global view from the perspective of thepart of the Asia-Pacific region where Papua New Guineais located  I have tried to relate immediate national andregional issues to wider international concerns. In doingso  I have been aware that other delegations  hearing ofevents and attitudes in my part of the world  have beenplacing us in a global perspective too.In the South Pacific  my Government seesworthwhile prospects for enhancing mutually beneficialcooperation in a number of areas that have not previouslyreceived the attention they deserve  including thepromotion of trade  investment and tourism  anddevelopment of the region’s vast natural resources.Papua New Guinea believes that the ongoingconsultations aimed at expanding the number ofpermanent seats on the Security Council and at therevitalization of the General Assembly are timely. Wehope that the process will reflect the current internationaleconomic and political climate. Thus  we are pleased tonote the progress being made in improving financialcontrols and in exploring options for further reform withinthe United Nations system. We hope that both processeswill contribute to further development of theOrganization’s capacity for effective achievement of itsobjectives.31As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  we should all re-commit ourselves to the purposesand principles of the United Nations Charter. An era ofcooperation and understanding has dawned. Let us notmiss the opportunity for peace  security and prosperity forhumanity."
"136",5684,"POL",49,1994," Let me express my greatpleasure at seeing Mr. Amara Essy presiding over ourdeliberations. I am confident that  given his experience andskills  this session will contribute to the furtherenhancement of the role of the United Nations. Let mealso thank the Secretary-General for the thoughtful andthorough review of the world situation  given in his annualreport - this in addition  of course  to our thanks for histireless work for the good of the Organization.I would like to follow the point made by our Dutchcolleague regarding the increased responsibility ofindividual Member States for the success of this institution let me say that the end of the cold war has been a sourceof and a sound reason for satisfaction throughout the entireworld community. A series of ""velvet revolutions"" inCentral Europe  the dissolution of the USSR andremarkable events in South Africa and the Middle Easthave shaken the entire post-war geopolitical pattern of""negative stability"" - frozen enmity. As expected  the endof the East-West confrontation and the disappearance ofcompeting blocs has proved beneficial to internationalrelations. The planet has become a safer place. Yet theeuphoria is fading  giving way to a sober evaluation ofevents. Indeed  have all the ""Berlin Walls"" or ""IronCurtains"" been dismantled - especially economic barriersthat separate countries on a global or regional scale? Is the""peace dividend"" actually being paid? Has the North-Southdevelopment gap ceased to widen and to undermine thenewly acquired  still fragile global stability?The old bipolar  confrontational world has gone. Weare not divided anymore. But we are not united either. Infact  many problems  dormant or concealed until now  havesurfaced with startling force: ethnic conflicts  nationalisms religious intolerance. The ""cold war"" may very well bereplaced by a ""cold peace"" or  even worse  by ""hot chaos"".Global cooperation will not come by itself. TheUnited Nations is best placed to lead its Members in aneffort to achieve it. However  are the nations ready for it?Is the United Nations properly equipped to cope with thetask?The question that should be asked first is not whatthe United Nations could do for us  but what we - theMember States - should do to unite the nations. Acontest between the two super-Powers no longer dictatesthe course of history. The international scene  bothpolitical and economic  has become pluralist  withmedium-sized and small countries emerging asincreasingly important actors. Previously  the role ofthese countries was  at best  that of a go-between orobserver  rather than an active participant. Now they arebecoming partners in the multi-country discourse.Multilateralism is becoming more important than ever.Multilateral arrangements in various domains provide bothinsurance of equal treatment and an opportunity to takepart  to contribute. Multilateralism increases the freedomof action of individual States and the degree of theirresponsibility.Let me set forth briefly the way in which Poland  amedium-sized country  perceives its role and duty - Istress duty - as a partner in the international effort tobring about global cooperation  to build a united world.First  we develop friendly relations with neighbours.The best testimony in this regard is found in the treatieswe have concluded with all our seven neighbours. Weregard those treaties as a great common accomplishmentby Poles  Belarusians  Czechs  Germans  Lithuanians Russians  Slovaks and Ukrainians. It was not always easyto reach an agreement: hard diplomatic work imagination and willingness to compromise were required to say the least. But the result was very much worth theeffort. The treaties constitute a solid block of durablerules based on international law  in a region of majorimportance for the security of the continent and the worldat large.Secondly  we are active in developing regionalcooperation. The Czech Republic  Hungary  Slovakia andPoland have formed a non-binding structure known as theVisegrad group. It is not an organization; it has nopermanent bodies  not even a secretariat - a true rarity forany international venture. The group did  however manage to work out a Central European Free TradeAgreement (CEFTA).Poland is also a partner in the Central EuropeanInitiative and the Council of the Baltic Sea States.Furthermore  we have recently reached out to our easternneighbours with a number of proposals to enhanceregional links.24Thirdly  we are impatiently and insistently striving tobecome members of institutions whose membership hasbeen determined by the logic of the divided world. We allagree they must not remain exclusive. It is ""one Europe one world"" that lies behind Poland’s efforts to join theEuropean Union  the Western European Union and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was in thiscontext that Poland responded with determination andconfidence to the Partnership for Peace programme. Byvirtue of its history  size and vital interests  Poland wantsto enter NATO not as a front-line State but  rather  as acountry furthering cooperation. We do not want to createnew divisions. On the contrary  we are striving toovercome the remnants of the past divisions which are stillwith us. It was also in this context that Poland entered intothe association agreement with the European Union  and itis in this context that Poland is actively preparing formembership. It is our strong desire to take part in theprocess of integrating Europe so that it becomes moresecure  cooperative and hospitable; and to participate in aneffort to overcome the irrationalities of history - rivalry imperial divisions and nationalistic stereotypes.Fourthly  Poland is a strong believer and a dedicatedparticipant in interregional and global actions. We are inthe forefront in promoting cooperation within theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).The CSCE is not only the symbol of the necessary bondsof security but also a forum for practical cooperation acrossthree continents. We support the CSCE as a regionalarrangement within Chapter VIII of the United NationsCharter.Poland is a time-tested participant in United Nationspeace-keeping operations. Over 2 000 of our troops arethere to uphold the ideas in the Charter  whenever called toduty by the Security Council.Poland  finally  is also active in other areas ofinternational cooperation: in the economic  social  cultural educational and health fields as well as in the promotion ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as stipulated byArticle 13 of the Charter.Medium- and small-sized States are potentially a greatasset of the United Nations; it has not so far beensufficiently recognized  let alone utilized. States such asPoland can play a stabilizing role and exert an importantbeneficial influence on developments in their immediate andmore distant neighbourhood  and tangibly contribute toglobal stability and security. In particular  they can beexpected to become nuclei of regional integration as theyshould not be suspected of seeking to dominate or toimpose their will on others.To act locally - that is  regionally - is practical andeffective. Medium-sized countries in consensus withsmaller States can  indeed  make a difference. However we should not allow a loose constellation of separatevillages to emerge. We need a global  united village.Therefore  we need a framework for subregional  regionaland interregional cooperation and discipline to ensurecoherence. This is of course the raison d’être of theUnited Nations. We are trying today to improve itsoperations. Let me here draw attention to two specificissues.First  the fundamental task for the United Nations isto maintain international peace and security. The role ofthe Security Council has been in recent years broadenedby more frequent recourse to action under Chapter VII ofthe Charter. On the one hand  that allows for a fresh lookat the security role of the United Nations  particularly inthe context of countries which do not enjoy soundsecurity guarantees. On the other hand  one cannotremain indifferent to the Council’s decisions in caseswhere sovereignty  democracy and human rights areviolated  or access to humanitarian assistance is hindered.For this reason  Poland consistently makes an effort torespond to the Council’s calls for action  be it in theformer Yugoslavia  Rwanda or  most recently  Haiti.Poland shares the view that the increase in themembership of the United Nations justifies theenlargement of the Council. There are differentsuggestions and ideas as to how this might best be done.The principal criterion continues  for us  to bepreservation of the effectiveness of the Council.Enlargement should be accomplished on a consensus basisand as a package. The interests of all United Nationsregional groups need to be respected in the process. Aseat on the Council  permanent or not  cannot beconsidered a matter of prestige. Indeed  it impliesincreased responsibility and the ability to discharge it.The Council’s decisions involving peace-keeping andpeace-enforcement measures  from sanctions to recourseto force  give rise to various risks and sacrifices by thirdcountries. They include potential risk to the lives andhealth of the troops and financial losses for which so far despite the provisions of Article 50  there is no adequatecompensation.25The security of the peace-keepers is of the utmostimportance. Work undertaken on a convention on thesafety of United Nations peace-keeping personnel should becompleted at the earliest date. There is also a need foractive dialogue between members of the Security Council the Secretary-General and troop-contributing States. Suchdialogue should be a standard practice in the case ofdecisions which may affect the security of these troops.Poland shares the view that: first  all United Nationsactivities in the four fields - preventive diplomacy peace-keeping  peacemaking and post-conflictpeace-building - must be fully mandated and better planned organized and financed; secondly  regional organizationsshould make a more significant contribution in the areas ofpreventive diplomacy and peace-keeping  but one fullyconsistent with the United Nations Charter; and  thirdly  aspecific mandate is to be sought when peace-keeping troopsneed to use force beyond the requirements of self-defence.Disarmament is yet another dimension of a globaleffort to strengthen international peace and security.Mankind is no longer held hostage to nuclear confrontation;the nuclear arms race has been halted and  it is hoped reversed. Post-cold-war cooperation between erstwhileadversaries has resulted in important nuclear disarmamentaccords. Poland is playing an active part in the ongoingmultilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmamentin Geneva for a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.Internationally verifiable  universally adhered to andeffective  such a treaty would put in place yet anotherbarrier to the spread of nuclear arms  which is in the vitalsecurity interests of each and every member of the familyof nations. These interests would also be served by anon-discriminatory  multilateral and internationally andeffectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissilematerial for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices.The window of opportunity is wide open. It must not beignored. We warmly welcome the renewed interest andinitiative on nuclear disarmament submitted yesterday tothis Assembly by President Clinton and President Yeltsin.We believe that further reinforcement of thenon-proliferation regime is imperative. We are alarmed byrecent reports of illicit trafficking in nuclear materialsacross frontiers. This is a threat to international securityand also a danger to innocent bystanders exposed toradiation. It also casts doubts on the efficiency andsufficiency of existing legal provisions and procedures. Athorough review of such provisions and procedures seemstimely.The overriding national security interests of Stateswould be served in particular by the universalization ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). We welcome the recent accessions to the NPT especially by some of our newly independent neighbours.We fervently hope that Ukraine will soon follow suit. Inthis connection  I wish to recall that Poland firmlysupports the unconditional and indefinite extension of theNPT. The forthcoming Conference to review theoperation of the NPT and to decide on its extensionshould strengthen the regime. It will benefit the entireinternational community. Coming as an aftermath to bothHiroshima and Chernobyl  it would be the most fittingstep to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the nuclear age.With the signing of the chemical weaponsConvention  there is a prospect of finally eliminatinganother category of weapons of mass destruction. Polandis actively involved in the work of the PreparatoryCommission for the Organization for the Prohibition ofChemical Weapons  and its ratification procedure is welladvanced.In conclusion  I would say this: more power to theregions; more authority to the Security Council; moreinitiative and involvement on the part of medium-sizedcountries. These are  in our view  the cornerstones andobjectives of the reform of the United Nations.Allow me now to address an issue to which Polandand a number of other countries attach particularimportance. I am referring to the provisions of Article107 and to parts of Article 53 of the Charter of theUnited Nations. I doubt that there is any delegation herethat would not agree that they have become obsolete - adead letter.For almost 50 years these provisions have not beenofficially invoked. Indeed  the States covered by thisso-called ""enemy clause"" have become not only aninseparable part of the democratic world but also a crucialelement of the United Nations system. It is impossible toimagine how the Organization and its system couldfunction without their political  economic and financialcommitment.Poland  the victim of the Nazi aggression that startedthe Second World War  considers it its moral duty to takea lead in closing this chapter of history for all time. Webelieve that the time has come to part with transitionalclauses born of the war  concerning States which were26then  50 years ago  enemies  but which have now becomepartners in our common work for the United Nations.I formally propose the removal from the Charter of theUnited Nations of the clauses referring to ""enemy States"".A political decision by the General Assembly on thismatter could be taken at this session. While  of course other modalities may be considered  the Assembly could for instance  request the Special Committee on theCharter of the United Nations to submit to it at its fiftiethsession a proposal for an appropriate legal solution thatwould not amount to a substantive revision of the Charter.Let me express the hope that this initiative will meetwith the unanimous support of the Member States."
"137",5710,"PRK",49,1994,"Mr. President  allow me first of all  on behalfof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  to conveyto you our congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. We hope that underyour presidency the General Assembly will bring its workto a fruitful conclusion.I wish to take this opportunity to express ourappreciation of the activities and efforts of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  tostrengthen the United Nations and enhance itsresponsibility and its role.Before I begin my statement  allow me also toexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General  to theSecretariat of the United Nations  and to the specializedagencies and other organizations in the United Nationssystem for the deep condolences they expressed on thedemise of our respected leader  Comrade Kim Il Sung former President of the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea.May I also take this opportunity to extend ourprofound thanks to the Heads of State or Government  tothe Governments and to the peoples of different countriesfor their messages of deep condolence and consolation aswell as for their arrangement of services of mourning forour great leader.Our respected President Kim Il Sung devoted hisefforts  throughout his life  to ensuring the prosperity ofour motherland and to the freedom and happiness of itspeople and to world peace and the progress of humanity.Our leader’s passing is a very great loss and profoundgrief for our nation. He performed immortal exploits which will go down in the annals of history through histireless and energetic activities from his early years to theadvanced age of over 80. Although the heart of our leaderhas ceased to beat  his great exploits will be rememberedfor ever. Our great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung willalways be with us.Despite the greatest loss that our nation has sufferedin its five-thousand-year-long history  our people havebeen able to turn their grief and sorrow into strength andcourage and they have been able to rise up again  becausethey have another great leader  Comrade Kim Jong Il who has inherited the ideology  the qualities of leadershipand the lofty virtues of our paternal leader.Our dear leader Comrade Kim Jong Il is the supremeleader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea andthe Supreme Commander of its revolutionary armedforces. A man of literary and military accomplishments 5of loyalty and filial piety  a man perfectly endowed withthe qualities and traits of leadership  Comrade Kim Jong Ilenjoys the greatest respect and the absolute confidence ofour people  who have entrusted him with their destiny andtheir future.Our society is characterized by the close unity betweenthe leader and the people in a socialist system centred uponthe popular masses  a system which they have chosen andwhich they have built on their own.Our dear leader Comrade Kim Jong Il remainscommitted to his life-long mission of carrying forward andaccomplishing the revolutionary cause pioneered by ourfatherly leader through generations and he is energeticallyleading the overall affairs of our party  State and armedforces. The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea is firmly committed to fully carryingforward and further building on the accomplishments of therespected leader President Kim Il Sung  and the lifetimeteachings of the leader remain the guideline for ouractivities. Our people will follow the wise leadership ofComrade Kim Jong Il  more firmly as they arm themselveswith the Juche idea  the revolutionary idea of the respectedleader Comrade Kim Il Sung  and defend  safeguard andglorify our socialism  which is their life and soul.The lifelong desire of the great leader Comrade KimIl Sung was the reunification of our country  and he workedenergetically until the last minute of his life for itsrealization. National reunification is the patriotic causerelated to the destiny of our nation and it is the supremetask of our nation and one that can be delayed no longer.It is indeed an intolerable tragedy that the division ofour nation that began in the 1940s has lasted until today  ata time when humanity is preparing to usher in the twenty-first century.The Government and people of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea  being desirous of nationalreunification  have long been exerting every effort toachieve reunification on the basis of the three principles ofindependence  peaceful reunification and national unity; theproposal for the establishment of a confederal State; and theTen-Point Programme for Great Unity of the Whole Nationfor the country’s reunification  serves as the commonreunification programme of the nation.As there exist different ideologies and political systemsin the north and the south of Korea  the establishment of aconfederation based on the concept of one nation and oneState  two systems and two governments  is the only wayto achieve reunification on the basis of the principle ofneither side conquering or being conquered by the other.This is the cardinal principle for reunification thatcorresponds to current reality existing in the Koreanpeninsula.The major stumbling-blocks to humanitarianexchanges  dialogue and contacts between the north andsouth are South Korea’s so-called “National SecurityLaw”  which defines fellow countrymen as enemies  andthe concrete wall  a symbol of division and confrontation.All the legal and physical barriers must be removed at anearly date if we are to achieve our consistent goals of freetravel and contacts  cooperation and exchanges betweenthe north and the south and if we are to realize nationalunity. This is not only the unanimous demand of theentire Korean people and the world’s peoples but also thetrend of the times.Our nation is firm in its will and intention to achievenational reunification in the 1990s. Our people willcertainly open the door to national reunification byachieving the unity of all Korean nationals in the northand the south and abroad on the basis of nationalpatriotism and a spirit of national independence  therebypromoting coexistence  co-prosperity and commoninterests  dispelling the fears of northward invasion andsouthward invasion and the fears of prevalence overcommunism and of communization and by workingtogether to establish an independent  peaceful  neutral reunified State transcending the differences in doctrinesand views.An important point in defusing the tensions andbringing about peace on the Korean peninsula is toreplace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peaceagreement and to establish a new peace arrangement toreplace the current armistice mechanism. The KoreanArmistice Agreement is a provisional step that envisagesthe suspension of any military actions between thebelligerent parties and its subsequent conversion into apeace agreement.The Armistice Agreement states  in paragraph 60 ofarticle IV  that  in order to help establish a lasting peaceon the Korean peninsula  a political conference of bothsides should be held at a higher level. However  such apolitical conference has yet to be convened and theunstable armistice has lasted so far.6Over the last four decades or so the Korean ArmisticeAgreement and the armistice mechanism have proved to benominal and insubstantial  failing to prevent or restrainarms reinforcement from outside Korea  a military build-upand large-scale military exercises. Moreover  it isanomalous in every way that the Armistice Agreementsigned in the 1950s should remain intact  even today whenthe cold war is over. These facts highlight the urgent needto replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreementand the existing armistice mechanism with a peacearrangement.In April this year the Government of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea made a detailed proposal to theUnited States that the two countries should beginnegotiations on an arrangement for a lasting peace toreplace the outdated armistice system. It subsequently tookthe practical step of opening the representative office of theKorean People’s Army in Panmunjom as our newnegotiating body. In late August this year the ChineseGovernment announced its decision to withdraw thedelegation of the Chinese People’s Volunteers to theMilitary Armistice Commission  in view of the urgent needto substitute a new peace arrangement for the KoreanArmistice Agreement  and in consideration of the currentstatus of the malfunctioning Military ArmisticeCommission.These measures were taken as innovative  goodwillsteps to make a breakthrough in establishing a new securityarrangement on the Korean peninsula  taking intoconsideration the recognized international practices underwhich some countries terminated their belligerency after theSecond World War and declared peaceful relationships.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea stillremains  in legal terms  in a state of belligerency with theUnited Nations  of which it is a dignified Member State.That is because the cease-fire has lasted so long. At itsthirtieth session the General Assembly  in 1975  adoptedresolution 3390 B (XXX)  urging the dismantling of theUnited Nations Command and the replacement of theArmistice Agreement with a peace agreement  but thatresolution has not yet been implemented. The UnitedNations should give due attention to the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea’s proposal for the establishmentof a new peace arrangement and fulfil in good faith its ownobligations in this regard  thus making amends for itsunsavoury past vis-à-vis the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea  a Member State of the United Nations  andimplementing its own resolution.Another very important element in defusing tensionsand establishing lasting peace on the Korean peninsulawould be a fundamental resolution of the nuclear issue.The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a politicaland military issue to be resolved bilaterally by theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates  in view of its origin and its nature and substance.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea hasmaintained its firm position that the nuclear issue on theKorean peninsula should be resolved through dialogueand negotiations between the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States. Thanks to thesincere and patient efforts of the Government of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea  the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States haveheld several rounds of bilateral talks  leading to the recentAgreed Statement by the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea and the United States  both of which are nowworking towards its implementation. This shows that ifthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and theUnited States work together to resolve the issue with trustin each other  and on the principle of impartiality andequality  they will bring about a good and fruitfuloutcome.To demonstrate the transparency of our nuclearactivities  we took the bold decision to replace theexisting system of graphite-moderated reactors with asystem of light water reactors  at the sacrifice of ourindependent atomic power industry. However  certainforces  which are not happy with a possible resolution ofthe nuclear issue  are still resorting to pressure and threatsagainst us  while peddling arguments about so-calledspecial inspections — arguments that are highlyprovocative to the Democratic People’s Republic of Koreaand have had a negative effect on the talks between it andthe United States. This is nothing but an attempt on thepart of these forces to wreck the talks by any possiblemeans as they enter a new stage  and to make thesituation on the Korean peninsula an extremely strained.The Korean people are strongly independence-minded  and independence means life for the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea. No threat or blackmail  nopressure or sanctions  will ever work on us. Our peoplewill never beg for peace at the expense of our nationaldignity and sovereignty simply out of fear of war  and theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will never sellout its supreme interests under pressure.The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is one tobe resolved by the Democratic People’s Republic of7Korea and the United States  and no other party is entitledto intervene in this bilateral process. Intervention by anyother party in their talks will only create difficulties andcomplications  and erect obstacles to the resolution of theissue  rather than help in its resolution in any way.Before the South Korean authorities talk about the“nuclear issue”  they should refrain from creating obstaclesto the progress of the talks between the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States  fromencouraging confrontation between North and South andfrom aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and theUnited States have now set out on the path of dialogue andnegotiations and are moving towards implementing theiragreements on the final objectives of the peaceful resolutionof the nuclear issue and other outstanding issues. Theworld welcomes this process and looks forward tosatisfactory results. The Government of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea will continue all its sincereefforts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsulaand to achieve the region’s denuclearization. I would liketo take this opportunity to express our profound thanks toState leaders  Governments and peoples for their supportand encouragement for the principled position and sincereefforts of the Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea to resolve the nuclear issue.Humankind now has the shared task of building anew  free and peaceful world  free from domination andsubjugation. In order to build the new world whichhumanity wants to see  we must eliminate  once and for all the legacies of the discredited cold-war era and realize thedemocratization of international society so as to enable allcountries and nations to exercise their sovereign rights onan equal basis in international forums.The most important element in this respect is thedemocratization of the United Nations. Among theMember States of the United Nations  there are  of course big and small countries  and there are also old MemberStates and new Member States. However  there cannot beany senior countries or junior countries  and there cannot beany dominating countries or countries to be dominated byothers. All United Nations Member States are equalMembers of the United Nations  and all contribute jointlyto world peace and security.There can be no place for individual Member States tohold privileged positions within the United Nations.Certain forces still try at international forums to trampleinternational justice and the principle of impartialityunderfoot. They are attempting to openly apply a doublestandard in dealing with the nuclear issue  human rights terrorism and a number of other issues. They arebringing unreasonable pressure to bear upon thosecountries that they consider to be offending them  makingslanders and false charges concerning the “nuclear threat” “human rights violations” and “terrorist States”  whilethey simply wink at the wrongful actions of thosecountries considered to be obedient to their directives.These phenomena still continue undiminished.This is a clear indication that there still remainoutdated concepts and the mentality of the cold-war era when the strong-arm actions and high-handed behaviourof a few countries were allowed to go unchallenged.Such unfair and unreasonable acts and behaviour shouldno longer be allowed any place in international relations.Restructuring of the United Nations is important  inorder to meet more actively the changed reality and newchallenges.The non-aligned and other developing countriesmake up a majority of United Nations membership. Fora fair and proper representation of their demands andinterests in the resolution of major international issues there is every reason why developing countries shouldbecome permanent members of the Security Council.We believe that  despite any need for enlargedmembership of the Security Council  no permanentmember seat should be given to any country that has stillfailed to wipe the slate clean with regard to its past as anation defeated in the Second World War. Japan is nowseeking permanent membership in the Security Council.It must first make a full and unambiguous apology  andprovide compensation  for its past aggression and warcrimes. This would be the proper behaviour for Japan.Disarmament — nuclear disarmament inparticular — is another task that must be undertakenurgently. People throughout the Earth have long wantedto live in a peaceful world free from nuclear weapons and they have been calling for the complete abolition ofsuch weapons. However  the nuclear-weapon States arereluctant to scrap their nuclear arsenals totally  even inthe current post-cold-war era. They still seek toperpetuate their monopoly in nuclear weaponry and tojustify legally the continued possession of these weapons.This is anachronistic thinking  which only spurs the8nuclear-arms race and blocks progress in meaningfuldiscussions on general disarmament.The extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons is now a matter of worldwide interestand concern. The existing Treaty defines the rights andobligations of the nuclear-weapon States and of thenon-nuclear-weapon States respectively on an unequal basis.If this Treaty is to be fair it should contain unconditionalnegative security assurances from the nuclear-weapon Statesto the non-nuclear-weapon States; a commitment by eachnuclear-weapon State not to be the first to use nuclearweapons; provision for a total ban on the use of theseweapons; and a timetable for the complete abolition ofnuclear weapons. These would be the first steps towardsrendering meaningless the existence of nuclear weapons onour planet.We are witnessing the disturbance of peace andsecurity in some regions of the globe. No small number ofcountries are suffering severe calamities. It is indeedheartbreaking to see how national sovereignty is trampledunderfoot and how regional conflicts and religious andethnic conflicts continue unabated  only to escalate intowars. It is our view that disputes between countries andnations should be resolved through peaceful negotiationsbetween the parties concerned  in the interests of thoseparties and for the sake of world peace.Social and economic development is an importantmatter directly related to international peace and security.It is common knowledge that social and economicdevelopment has been greatly hindered  and the worldwidephenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor gettingpoorer is becoming even more intense. A fair and justinternational economic order should be established to freethe people of the developing countries from famine  diseaseand disasters and to narrow the widening gap between thedeveloped and the developing countries.The United Nations should give priority to thedevelopment of the developing countries and strengthen itsown role in their economic and social development. Wehope that the Agenda for Development proposed by theSecretary-General will make a substantial contribution tothe economic development of these countries.The summits of non-aligned countries and other worldconferences have emphasized the need for the establishmentof a new  fair international order and have adoptedresolutions calling for practical measures to this end. Thenon-aligned and other developing countries are workinghard to achieve South-South cooperation and to establishthe South-South economic order  starting in the fields offood and agriculture  education and health  which arepriority areas in the drive to accelerate social andeconomic development and to shake off economicpoverty.The developed countries should pay due attention tothis matter. They should move to resume dialogue withthe developing countries and to join in establishing a fairinternational economic order  and should refrain from anyactions that would hinder the economic development ofthe developing countries.People in many countries are currently engaged in avigorous struggle to reject all foreign domination andinterference  to defend national independence andsovereignty and to achieve national stability andprosperity.We express our solidarity with the Cambodianpeople  whose cause is the promotion of nationalreconciliation and unity and the country’s post-warrehabilitation. We fully support the peoples of the Statesmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nationsin their efforts to secure peace in their respectivecountries and common prosperity  and all other Asianpeoples in their efforts to build a new  independent andprosperous Asia.We support the struggle of the Arab people for a fairand comprehensive solution of the Palestinian questionand other Middle East problems  and we support Libya’sefforts to secure a peaceful resolution of the Lockerbiecrisis through dialogue and negotiations  as well as theArab League’s proposal in this regard.We are gratified by the establishment of themultiracial  democratic Government in South Africafollowing the eradication of racist rule  and we supportthe African peoples in their struggle to achieve theindependent development of their respective countriesdespite their socio-economic difficulties.We express our firm solidarity with the just cause ofthe Cuban people  who are resolutely defending thesovereignty of their country and the gains of socialism and with the struggle of the Latin American peoples forpeace and prosperity in their countries.The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the Korean people will continue9their full support for and firm solidarity with all the peoplesin the world in their struggle to oppose all forms ofdomination and subjugation  to build a new society and topromote the common cause of mankind.Independence  peace and friendship have been theconstant cornerstone of the foreign policy of theGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.The concept of independence  peace and friendship as thecornerstone of our foreign policy  established by ourrespected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung during his lifetime reflects the unanimous desire and aspiration of our peopleand of peoples throughout the Earth to build a new independent  peaceful and friendly world. It is the principleby which the Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea  in its external activities  is constantlyguided.The Government of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea will continue to join with the world’s peoples whoare seeking independence  will strengthen the ties offriendship and cooperation and will undertake in good faithits own duties in the interests of the common cause ofmankind - the safeguarding of a just world peace andsecurity and the building of a new  independent andprosperous world.The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea will work sincerely with other delegations forsuccess in the discussion of the items on the agenda of thecurrent session of the General Assembly."
"138",5755,"PRT",49,1994," Itis with pleasure that I warmly congratulate Mr. AmaraEssy on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session. In his election I seea recognition of the role that Côte d’Ivoire  a friendlyAfrican country  has played on the international scene aswell as an appreciation of his personal qualities andexperience.A word of recognition is also in order for theoutgoing President  Ambassador Samuel Insanally  for hisdedicated and positive service during the last session ofthe Assembly.To the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  I renew my homage for the secure andcommitted manner in which he is carrying out hismission. As he already knows  Portugal can be countedon in the pursuit of the objectives of peace anddevelopment and in the consolidation of a substantialreform of the United Nations system.15My German colleague has already addressed theAssembly on behalf of the 12 member States of theEuropean Union  expressing positions to which Portugalfully subscribes. Nevertheless  I would like to reflect oncertain issues which are of particular importance to mycountry.The end of the bipolar era has created  somewhatperversely  greater unpredictability and uncertainty in thesystem of collective security  which has most visibly led toa rebirth of extreme nationalism and new focuses ofconflict. In this perspective  I would like to underline theimportance we attach to cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations and mechanisms. Suchcooperation implements the concept of complementaryactions and allows for more agile solutions adapted toconcrete circumstances.The road to stability and the progressive developmentof a new concept of security also passes through thestimulation of political institutions capable of guaranteeingrespect for universally recognized values. Similarly  greaterinternational control of the use of force will require notonly the best and most adequate means but also aconstantly renewed political legitimacy in order to wieldthem. In my view  this legitimacy is tied to the goal ofbuilding an international society based on ideals whichpromote peace  democracy and human rights.We must also keep in mind the socio-economicdimension of the issues that threaten international stabilityand security. More than ever  we need an integratedapproach within which the preventive dimension is givenpriority  both in its purely political and diplomatic aspectand in its development-aid aspect.In this context  we underline the importance of thecommitted participation of all nations in an Agenda forDevelopment  as the Secretary-General has invited us to do.Today more than ever  the portentous words of the Popering true: ""Development is the new name of peace.""In this regard  we need to rethink  not only the role ofdevelopment aid  but also the very concept of development.It should become more comprehensive  including respectfor democratic values and human rights as well as socialand economic issues and other issues related to thepreservation of the environment  demographics  theprevention of endemic diseases and the fight against thetraffic in drugs.Here we must also underline the importance weattach to helping countries that are truly committed toimplementing social and politico-economic reformsconducive to sustainable development. However  such aprocess must be complemented by an increasingly liberalinternational system and by a set of measures that seek toreduce the burden of external debt and create theconditions for a reactivation of private investment in theireconomies.In this context  I welcome the signing in Marrakeshof the Uruguay Round agreements and the forthcomingstart-up of the World Trade Organization  which willallow for freer trade  with the simultaneous strengtheningof rules and disciplines.As a member of the European Union  Portugalfirmly defends the enlargement of the Union and thestrengthening of ties with other countries of Central andEastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin. For theentire continent  the European Union is undoubtedly animmense consolidating force of democratic ideals stability  prosperity and respect for human rights.Other organizations  such as the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO)  the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  the WesternEuropean Union (WEU) and the Council of Europecontribute equally to the same ideals. If thedemocratization of Eastern Europe has created thepossibility of future adhesions to the European Union  ithas also led to a new relationship as regards security onthe continent.We understand the desire already expressed by manycountries of Central and Eastern Europe to join thedefence and security organizations  and we are ready toconsider  in due time  a gradual and balanced enlargementof NATO to include those States that share with us thesame democratic values and respect for human rights andthe rule of law. The question of the enlargement ofNATO to the east cannot  however  overshadow theessential transatlantic dimension which must remain thecornerstone of European security. On the other hand  anyincrease in the membership of NATO must not createnew divisions in Europe. Therefore  Portugal affirms thatall the possibilities of the Partnership for Peace  amechanism aimed at uniting countries of the Eurasianregion in activities of military cooperation  must bepursued.16Last year  I stated here that Portugal considers thenuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty fundamental forinternational security. As we approach the 1995Conference I should like to reiterate the intention of myGovernment to support all efforts that will lead to theunconditional and indefinite extension of that instrument.While referring to security  I should like to welcomeand support the initiative announced here yesterday byPresident Clinton to reach an agreement on reducing theproliferation of anti-personnel mines. Such an initiativecould not be more timely and  for our part  I can announcehere that Portugal is in the process of preparing legislationto outlaw the commercialization of those weapons and theirproduction.In the context of Europe  I cannot avoid referring tothe situation in the former Yugoslavia and  in particular  tothe terrible conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite allthe efforts applied towards bringing an end to that situation war goes on with its tragic fare of death  destruction andsuffering.The international community has demonstrated that itpossesses a common interest in the search for a politicalsolution to the conflict. We must  however  recognize thatthis progress is insufficient and that  without real politicalwill shown by all parties directly involved  a stable andlong-lasting solution will never be found.Portugal has actively participated in the efforts of theinternational community with both men and matériel  andwill continue to remain on the ground for as long as it isuseful and necessary. We are  in fact  reinforcing thePortuguese contingent in the area within the activities of theWestern European Union (WEU).Sub-Saharan Africa  to which my country is linked byparticularly strong cultural and historical ties  continues tobe the region of the planet with the most worrying levels ofdevelopment. Portugal has defended the idea that theinternational community should grant Africa first priority commensurate with the unparalleled magnitude of theproblems that need to be overcome. But firstly  Africansthemselves must prove that underdevelopment is notinevitable. And the greatest contribution that they canmake in this direction is a determined commitment tosearch for peaceful solutions to both existing and potentialconflicts  and a continued deepening of the process ofpolitical and social democratization on the continent  aswell as the adoption of indispensable economic reforms.The first free and democratic elections in SouthAfrica and the investiture of Nelson Mandela as its Headof State  as well as the formation of a Government ofnational unity  represent historic achievements not onlybecause they have left apartheid behind but also becausethey have proved the viability of finding in Africapeaceful solutions to complex situations. Portugal  whichactively participated in all efforts to support the processof democratic transition in that country  warmly salutesthe new South Africa  a country which is host to animportant Portuguese community. We believe that thehuman  economic and technological potential of thatcountry can undoubtedly constitute an important factor foreconomic recovery in all of southern Africa.In Mozambique also there are signs that the hopes ofits people with regard to the peace process will not bedisappointed. The completion of the cantonment anddemobilization processes  the formation  despite somedelays  of the new armed forces and the peaceful mannerin which the electoral campaign has been conducted areall crucial achievements to be recognized  and foretell thecoming elections of 27 and 28 October 1994 as being acrucial moment for the future of Mozambique.We appeal to the main Mozambican political forcesto find the forms of dialogue and understandingconducive to guaranteeing a true national reconciliationwith full respect for democratic principles.Portugal was an observer at the negotiations and isrepresented in all the commissions created by the peaceaccord  playing a major role in the formation of the newarmy  as well as participating significantly in the UnitedNations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).Portugal will remain committed to following thisprocess closely in the context of the accords and weconsider it important that the international communitysupport Mozambique not only during this particular phasebut also in what we hope will be the following stage ofnational reconstruction and reconciliation.In southern Africa  one of the longest  and surelydeadliest  conflicts the world has ever known rages on.Angola continues to be the stage for a war that hasalready claimed hundreds of thousands of innocentvictims.Portugal  as a member of the troika of observercountries  will continue to do all it can in activelysupporting the United Nations mediation in the person of17the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  whoseefforts I take this opportunity to salute  in the search for adefinitive solution to the Angolan conflict.The international community cannot and must notforget the origins of the current conflict  which frustratedthe hopes of the Angolan people created after the Bicesseaccords and the elections of September 1992. Beyondattributing blame  it is now more important not to give upthe efforts to bring this terrible conflict to an end.The Lusaka negotiations  which seek to promote -within the context of respect for the peace accords andrelevant resolutions of the Security Council - a genuinereconciliation in Angola  have reached a crucial stage.The complete acceptance by the Angolan Governmentand UNITA of the set of proposals of the mediation onnational reconciliation constitutes an important step.UNAVEM II must be given the necessary means tocomplete its mission. For this to happen  appropriate forcesmust be placed on the ground immediately following theinitialling of the accords and the correct dimensions of thatpeace-keeping operation must be defined.In any case  peace will not be possible unless there isa genuine will on the part of the Angolans themselves.I appeal here to the Angolan Government and UNITAto do all in their power so that this opportunity is not lost.I also appeal to the international community toredouble its commitment and support.Despite the continuation of the conflict in Angola  thehistorical changes under way in southern Africa offerpossibilities which must be consolidated and developed.Portugal has from the very beginning supported theproject for a dialogue between the European Union and thatregion of Africa  an idea that has just been expressed in therecent Berlin Conference between the European Union andthe Southern African Development Community (SADC).As was stated in the Berlin Declaration  the aim of thisdialogue is  inter alia  the promotion and development oftrade  investment and cooperation  in order to stimulate abalanced development of that region which may  in turn provide an engine for progress in the rest of the continent.The dramatic situation in Rwanda shows howimportant the role of the Organization of African Unity isin the prevention of similar situations  namely through theimplementation of its mechanism for the prevention management and resolution of conflicts created last yearon 29 July at the Cairo Summit. From the verybeginning  Portugal has supported the creation of thismechanism and  in conjunction with African and otherlike-minded countries  is prepared to participate activelyin the search for means that will permit the empowermentof such an instrument.I cannot end this reference to Africa withoutwelcoming the way in which the first democratic and freeelections were held in Guinea-Bissau and expressingsatisfaction at the peaceful and orderly climate that hascharacterized the campaign for the elections in Sao Tomeand Principe  to be held in a few days.One of the current priorities of our foreign policy isthe convergence of efforts with those countries whichshare with us the Portuguese language. With them we arebuilding a community which I am sure will come torepresent a new and exemplary political reality.We are also seeking to deepen the political dialogueand cooperation between Europe and Latin America.That cooperation is institutionalized in its ownmechanisms  among which I single out the dialoguebetween the European Union and the Rio Group as wellas the Ibero-American Summits. These in turn haveallowed open and profound discussions of politicalquestions of common interest to countries united by closehistorical and cultural ties and by shared sensitivities.This is what happened  once again  at the Summit inCartagena  Colombia.I am glad to be able to acknowledge here the clearevolution towards democracy and respect for humanrights that has occurred in all of Latin America and theCaribbean. That very positive evolution contrasts evenmore strongly with such shocking situations as that ofHaiti  a country where conditions are being created forthe re-establishment of democratic constitutional orderfollowing the intervention of a multinational forceauthorized by the United Nations Security Council.Portugal continues to devote special attention to theevolution of the situation in North Africa. To that end we have advocated a rapprochement with the countries ofthat area in accordance with the Lisbon Declaration of theEuropean Council  which  I recall  defined a new conceptfor a political  economic  social and cultural relationshipbetween the European Union and the Maghreb.Following the Corfu meeting of the European Council 18which attached particular importance to stability andsecurity in the Mediterranean  we reaffirm our dedication toa dialogue and a deepening of ties with the countries of theregion. Nor can we defend any other approach when weconsider the geographical proximity and close historical tiesthat unite Portugal and North Africa.In fact  it is important that the countries of both sidesof the Mediterranean deepen their dialogue so that we canavoid the spread of an idea which we reject - that ofconflict between civilizations. On the contrary  we shouldvalue the concept that countries with different politicalideas and whose populations espouse diverse religions areable to establish ties of trust and true cooperation.It is my opinion that we have today well-foundedreasons to believe that a comprehensive peace in the MiddleEast will be a reality in the not-too-distant future. Theaccords already signed between Israel and the Palestinianson the one hand and Israel and Jordan on the other testifyto their determination in seeking a comprehensive  just andlasting peace. The achievements already made willcertainly serve as a catalyst for new initiatives. From thisperspective  the decisions and resolutions of the UnitedNations should reflect the positive developments alreadyregistered.It is also necessary that the international community and in particular the countries of the region  support theefforts under way. We hope that progress in the peaceprocess  in both its bilateral and multilateral aspects foreshadows the capacity to generate a new era of stabilityand development in that part of the world.Universalism has always marked the ideas andbehaviour of the Portuguese. In Asia Portugal hascenturies-old ties with a number of countries which wewish to maintain and develop. It is with great admirationthat we look upon the development of some areas of thatcontinent. We are certain that the countries of that regionwill have ever-increasing importance in the determinationof the fate of our planet.Portugal attaches the greatest importance to respect forhuman rights  so much so that this respect can beconsidered to be a major pillar of its foreign policy. Ouraction has as a fixed reference point the results of theVienna World Conference on Human Rights  which rejectedany regression or reduction of the established norms. Wesupport the work of the High Commissioner and the Centrefor Human Rights  both of which should be granted thenecessary financial means for an efficient exercise of theirfunctions.We defend with particular commitment the principleof universality when applied to respect for human rightsand their indivisibility  and we oppose any attempt tosubordinate their strict observance to other objectives. Onthis issue  we cannot and must not yield. We believe thatdemocracy  respect for human rights and development aremutually reinforcing.We attach the greatest importance to theinternational conferences to be held in 1995: the WorldSummit for Social Development and the WorldConference on Women. We consider promising thepositive results recently achieved in Cairo by theInternational Conference on Population and Development which we welcome.In the context of human rights  among which thisOrganization has always included with special distinctionthe right to self-determination  I feel duty-bound to touchupon a question to which the international community hasbeen giving growing attention. I am referring to theNon-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor. I reaffirmbefore this Assembly that Portugal has no specificobjective concerning the question of East Timor beyondthe defence of the rights of its people and the conclusionof the process of decolonizing the Territory in accordancewith international law and with full respect for thelegitimate rights of the Timorese people. For this reason we remain committed to talks that  under the auspices ofthe Secretary-General  are being held with the IndonesianGovernment with the aim of finding a just comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution.Undoubtedly  progress has been slow and we havenot advanced on the substance of the matter. But  as areading of the progress report of the Secretary-Generalreveals - and I must express here a word of appreciationto him - some steps have been taken  not only through theso-called confidence-building measures  but also with theinvolvement of the Timorese themselves in the search fora solution to a problem in which they are the principalinterested party.East Timor has recently ceased to be an almostforgotten Territory. We sincerely hope that the growingattention that has been granted it will contributedecisively to an improvement in the concrete situation ofits people and to the adoption of a more coherent attitude19in the recognition and defence of their legitimate andinalienable rights.On 16 November the Convention on the Law of theSea will come into force  culminating a long and importantprocess which will open new and determinant channels ofaction and cooperation. The importance of this area willclearly justify the General Assembly’s adopting byconsensus the draft resolution of the Economic and SocialCouncil on the proclamation of 1998 as the internationalyear of the oceans. We are confident that its proclamationwill contribute in an effective manner to a wider debate anda greater enlightenment of world public opinion on theimportance of the problems which we face in this area  thusenabling the adoption of solutions that will permit theirresolution at a global level. Portugal actively participatesin this debate  seeking with the holding of LisbonExpo/98 - the last great exposition of the twentieth century the subject-matter of which is directly related to this area -to provide an important instrument for the achievement ofthe goals we have set.In conclusion  I should like to reflect upon theinstitutional reforms that are so necessary for adapting theOrganization to the new international context  its challengesand the greater possibilities of global cooperation. Thesereforms  which we believe to be essential and urgent should be carried out with transparency and on a consensualbasis. They must be realistic and be aimed at increasingefficiency.Although we are still at a preliminary stage  weconsider it useful to state here the aim of our thinking onthis matter. First of all  we believe that it is necessary toreinforce the efficiency and responsibility of the SecurityCouncil. We maintain that a third category of membersshould not be created beyond those of permanent andnon-permanent members. A pragmatic and reasonablesolution to ensure greater representation on the Councilwould be to increase the number of non-permanentmembers by one for each region. We are also of theopinion that the number of permanent members should beincreased  but such an increase should not be achieved atthe expense of the number of non-permanent members.Weencourage regional agreements which  through increasedrotation  will permit greater representation on the Council.It is crucial that permanent members of the Council shouldhave the ability and the political will to assume fully theresponsibilities that come with that status as regards themaintenance of international peace and security.Some States have declared themselves ready toassume greater responsibilities in regard to theachievement of the objectives of the Charter. ThePortuguese Government declares - here today - its supportfor the inclusion of Germany and Japan as permanentmembers of the Security Council. Both the unifiedGermany  a country that provided a notable incentive forthe construction of the European Union  and Japan  agreat Power of the Asia-Pacific region  are in a positionto make an effective contribution towards increasing theweight and the efficiency of the Security Council. Itwould however be difficult to comprehend if an increasein the number of the permanent members did not alsoinclude the southern hemisphere of our planet. In thiscontext  and among the eligible countries  we pointnaturally to Brazil  a founding Member of the UnitedNations  the largest country in Latin America and a Statethat has unequivocally abided by the principles of theCharter.Portugal is a candidate for a seat on the SecurityCouncil for the biennium which begins in 1997. Ourcandidature reflects a position of profound commitment tothe main objectives of the United Nations as set out in theCharter. It reflects also our desire to contribute fully tothe maintenance of international peace and security.Thus  Portugal reaffirms its commitment with regardto the objectives of the United Nations  which my countryhas supported with increasing responsibility as an activeparticipant in the different areas of the Organization and particularly  in the United Nations peace-keepingoperations.We are approaching the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations Charter. Portugal will seek to emphasizethis commemoration and to ensure that its significance isunderstood by the public at large and  in particular  byyoung people.In this celebration  we wish to contribute torenewing our ideals and sparking people’s conscience inorder to promote increased participation in the objectivesestablished by the Charter of the United Nations.In short  this means the creation of a greatersensitivity to the irreplaceable role of the United Nationsin the resolution of the major issues faced by humanity atthe turn of the century."
"139",5801,"PRY",49,1994,"I wish cordially to greet you  Mr. Amara Essy of Cote d’Ivoire  and to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I pledge the fullest cooperation of the delegation of Paraguay.Nor can I fail to echo the congratulations offered to Ambassador Samuel Insanally on the way he guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly.It is my pleasure also to hail the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and convey to him well- deserved congratulations on the excellent manner in which he has carried out his tasks. On behalf of the Government and the people of Paraguay  a founding Member of the United Nations  I pledge to him our full support for the Organization. It is our hope that he will visit our country as soon as he can; this would be further testament to our support for the United Nations and to our expectations as to what the United Nations can do to assist Paraguay in its current process of full democratization. That democratization has been under way in Paraguay since February 1989; it is now being consolidated under the Administration of Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy  President of the Republic.In this Hall one year ago  the President of Paraguay committed himself to consolidating the democratic process  with the support of the vast majority of Paraguayans from the different political parties and organizations that demonstrate the pluralism of our society  which is irrevocably determined to defend freedom  democracy and respect for human rights. Today  the name of Paraguay does not appear in the dossiers of human rights violations. Not a single United Nations or other agency of the international community has failed to note the undeniable progress in our country in every area connected with dignifying the human person  and the efforts we have made in the social sector.Hence  as I pledge on behalf of my Government and my entire society that we shall never  under any circumstances  diverge from the democratic ideal  I cannot fail to observe that problems remain in achieving a level of development with social justice; we shall keep trying to solve them resolutely  and in many cases with international cooperation.We shall not be satisfied until we secure for our inhabitants - Paraguayans and foreigners whom we have welcomed into our land - living standards considered adequate according to United Nations indexes. In view of the magnitude of the task  we again stress that the burden cannot be borne by one people alone. For us to be competitive  conditions in the international system must change: markets must be more open; credit must be more readily available  and at lower interest rates; and technology must be more accessible. We therefore believe in global solidarity  especially of the developed nations.The people of the developing countries cannot be asked to make greater sacrifices than they are already making unless they see a similar trend towards the transformation of the international community. If democracy and freedom are to exist and endure  peoples must enjoy development and better living conditions.I should like briefly to refer to our economic recovery  which began in 1989 and has produced veryfavorable results  even during a period of transition and major structural changes.Paraguay has been pursuing a policy of free trade and floating exchange rates  coupled with total freedom of movement for financial services and capital. The external debt has been reduced to $1.26 billion  almost the same as our current reserves of $1 billion. Paraguay offers a variety of tax incentives to both its own and outside investors for investment in production activities. These incentives place our country among those offering the best and most attractive terms in Latin America.Our privatization policy  which started with money-losing national industries  is already enshrined in our legal code. Furthermore  we project a growth in gross domestic product of 4.5 per cent this year.Education and training are a major priority of our Government  because it feels that accelerated development depends on well-trained people.As regards economic integration  the Treaty of Asuncion was signed in the capital of Paraguay in 1991  establishing the Common Market of the Southern Cone (MERCOSUR). At the recent meeting of the Presidents of the MERCOSUR countries  held in Buenos Aires on 5 August  they took a decisive step forward by agreeing by consensus to establish a common external tariff.In connection with this economic integration  we are pleased to confirm that Paraguay firmly and enthusiastically supports the negotiations on the entry into MERCOSUR of the fraternal Republics of Bolivia and Chile. Paraguay has suggested to its MERCOSUR partners the establishment of essential supranational machinery  such as the office of secretary-general and a court of justice. That would allow us to hold joint negotiations with the European Union  as has seemed feasible since its Council's Corfu meeting  and with the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement.The summit of American nations convened in Miami by President Clinton will be an event of great significance for relations in this hemisphere in our common search for ever greater understanding among countries of this continent on political  economic and trade matters.At the subregional level  only a few weeks ago we were able to set in motion the first of 20 turbines of the huge Yacyreta hydroelectric dam  built jointly by Paraguay and Argentina. The Government of Paraguay has worked hard to develop ties with the outside world in order to break out of the isolation arising from its landlocked condition and  until 1989  its deliberate marginalization by an authoritarian Government.In bilateral terms  though it may seem redundant to say this  it is appropriate to recall that Paraguay benefits from a vast hydroelectric capacity already in place: the Itaipu station  shared with Brazil  with an output of 12.6 million kilowatts; and that at Yacyreta  shared with Argentina  with an output of some 4 million kilowatts. There is therefore no question but that Paraguay is now  and will remain  an ideal place for major foreign and domestic investment and for implementing a policy of industrialization  based on our abundant  low-cost energy.It must be remembered  however  that Paraguay suffers a structural limitation that would appear to limit its development potential: its lack of a seaboard. We wish to turn this handicap  which has had a very negative impact on Paraguay in the past  into an advantage. I refer to the fact that Paraguay  being at the center of MERCOSUR  can act as a hinge or pivot par excellence  together with Bolivia  between MERCOSUR and the Andean Common Market.At the regional  Latin American level  I wish to refer first to Paraguay's involvement in the Fourth Ibero- American Summit of Pleads of State and Government. The presence of our entire Ibero-American community  together with Spain and Portugal  strengthened us all  because of the cultural  historical  political and other ties that bind us closely. I should like to stress that Paraguay regards this conference as an essential link in its ties with the European Union and as a major forum with great potential.Another important event this year  again at the regional level  was the Eighth Conference of Presidents and Heads of Government of the Rio Group  which ended a few weeks ago. Paraguay fully endorsed the Declaration of the Rio Group  particularly with regard to the situations in Haiti and Cuba and the problem of drug-trafficking.Paraguay actively participated in producing the declaration in regard to the fraternal Republic of Cuba  which expresses the strong hope that it will introduce significant political and economic reforms in accordance with the people's will  and stating that we respect the self-determination of peoples and the principle of non-intervention. Paraguay lent its fullest support to the Rio Group's decisions  including its declaration on lifting the embargo against Cuba.With regard to the new post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  Paraguay wishes to state that his great efforts with regard to individual rights must be complemented by the promotion of social and collective human rights.We have throughout fully endorsed the principle of the peaceful resolution of international conflicts  including the case of Haiti. In this  Paraguay is strengthened by its traditional commitment to peace. In 1923 we contributed to international law for the Americas with the Gondra Treaty of conciliation and arbitration  which has become one of the pillars of Latin America's juridical system.Along these lines of thought and practice  Paraguay enthusiastically welcomes the recent progress in connection with the United Nations Decade of International Law. Paraguay supports the codification of this branch of law; it will be one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations. In this connection  Paraguay has signed and ratified the main agreements that constitute the legal structure created through the United Nations.Paraguay is keenly following and promoting mankind's urgent demand for international cooperation for development. For it is just as important to build peace through development as to maintain it through law. Here I want once more publicly to express our deep thanks to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  whose timely and effective work we have seen at first hand. We also acknowledge the fundamental importance of the development work of the World Bank  the Inter-American Bank and the International Monetary Fund.We hail the Secretary-General's recent decision to seek better coordination within the United Nations system on technical cooperation and to make the Administrator of UNDP fully responsible for coordination system wide  including with the regional commissions and all other program. From this decision the United Nations will gain in efficiency and in the impact of its world-wide activities.Paraguay also backs the entire process for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and the opening of negotiations on international economic cooperation for development  which appears on the agenda of the General Assembly. Yet  in a spirit of honor and fraternity  I wish to repeat what I said here in New York at the June 1994 session of the Economic and Social Council - namely  that:""We feel that the distribution of funds for United Nations programs and projects world wide is imbalanced; as Latin Americans  we believe that the proportion allocated to our region  by UNDP for example  is unfair: only 8.66 per cent is allocated for programs in Latin American countries  while other regions are allocated 50.42 per cent and 40.67 per cent respectively"".UNDP contributes only 17 per cent to Paraguay's program; Paraguay pays the rest. But we appreciate and wish to continue to count on UNDP’s support.Paraguay looks forward with keen interest and commitment to the World Summit for Social Development  to be held at Copenhagen. We are preparing to participate in that conference and have high expectations about the positive results it can achieve. We have promised that the President of the Republic of Paraguay will attend that great event. Paraguay is so enthusiastic about the conference because the three basic items on its agenda are very closely connected with today's social problems: social integration  particularly of the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups; relief and reduction of poverty; and an increase in productive employment. As the draft agenda points out  all of this must be in the context of a propitious economic environment - and  we would add  with international cooperation. Here  Paraguay cannot fail to note that a characteristic of our times is economic growth without job-creation  a situation that must be corrected  since one of today's problems is indeed unemployment.Paraguay earnestly supports ongoing efforts  will support future efforts  developed by the United Nations in all areas of disarmament: nuclear  chemical and others.The Assembly should know that in the area of social development Paraguay has established a special commission to prepare for the Fourth World Conference on Women  to be held at Beijing. The commission brings together State and private bodies  which are drafting a final report on the situation of women in Paraguay.As a full member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  Paraguay hopes that the results of the Uruguay Round will have beneficial effects for us. We are convinced that the Uruguay Round is the beginning of a process of downscaling policies of subsidy and protectionism. Paraguay confidently looks forward to the follow-up to GATT and to the work of its complementary successor body  the World Trade Organization.Paraguay fully shares in the entire international community's anguish at drug trafficking  and at the evil effects of that phenomenon. Notwithstanding our meager resources  we are doing whatever is necessary to root it out wherever it is hiding  and to fight it head on. But  with the strength derived from reason  Paraguay affirms that the consumer countries  transit countries and producer countries alike must undertake an equal commitment to adopting vigorous measures. Unilateral efforts  however vigorous  to combat drug production and trafficking can never be successful without gradual shrinkage of the markets that give rise to production and trafficking in the first place.Linked with this universal scourge  which we condemn with all our strength and conviction  is the phenomenon of corruption  a human failing that is seen in varying degrees in all four comers of the Earth. Corruption spreads its tentacles as a reflection of a civilization that is prodigious in economic  financial  scientific  technical and industrial terms but is  we must admit  often found wanting in the firm ethical underpinnings and the genuine human values that strengthen and give vitality to a culture.Paraguay is following with great attention all United Nations efforts with respect to agenda item 142  ""Measures to eliminate international terrorism"". Recent grave events in certain parts of the world  indeed on our own continent  clearly show that the international community needs a new approach  through well-coordinated action  to overcoming this serious problem  which  as we know  sometimes links drug-trafficking mafias with terrorism.On the question of equitable representation on and an increase in the membership of the Security Council  Paraguay believes that in today's changing world we must attune the Organization to the requirements of the times and current circumstances. Hence  my country believes it just to democratize the representation of States on the Security Council  and for the Council's decision-making to be transparent. The world situation has changed  and the United Nations must adapt to those changes. We repeat what we said at the last meeting of the Rio Group - namely  that""because of its legal tradition and its contribution tothe cause of peace  the Latin American andCaribbean region must be considered in anyexpansion of the Security Council"".Paraguay also firmly supports parallel efforts to revitalize the functioning of the General Assembly.I want to mention and to highlight our great satisfaction at the obvious  sustained advance of democracy in Latin America  and at the consolidation of the various processes that are under way.We should like to reaffirm that the United Nations must continue to apply the principle of universality  making room within its ranks for all peace-loving States that meet the requirements as set forth in the Charter and that are prepared to honor its principles and purposes. We believe that the entry of the Republic of China as an independent country should be considered  along with the case of any other State that meets the conditions I have just mentioned.I should like officially to declare that  on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  Paraguay pledges even now to have its President take part personally in the session of the Assembly. The President of our Republic will make the voice of my homeland heard on that most welcome occasion.Meanwhile  my country has established an ad hoc commission on the commemoration of that major event.The environment  the subject of the magnificent 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  is a matter of the greatest concern to Paraguay  which is prepared to support any and all initiatives aimed at preserving the environment through sustainable development  as well as to enact any appropriate measures that do not undermine economic growth.By the same token  Paraguay declares its deep concern at the situation affecting the Pilcomayo River  which is an international waterway inasmuch as its source is in Bolivia and it forms the border between Argentina and Paraguay.We are now facing a major environmental problem since that international river springs from the mountains and is now growing shallower in its course because of sedimentation build-up. Moreover  the Pilcomayo  owing to works undertaken on Argentine territory  has had some 70 per cent of its volume absorbed in the territory of our neighbor. These facilities are doing a great deal of damage to the Chaco region of Paraguay  especially to its livestock and to the population.Paraguay hopes that matters will return to normal  that is  that the course of the Pilcomayo River will resume its balance  irrigating both border areas in an equitable way. We fully trust that we will manage to reach complete agreement with the Republic of Argentina to restore this balance at the earliest possible time.To that end  we will have to go to the very source of the Pilcomayo to seek a rational and comprehensive solution which  inevitably  will require a trilateral agreement in the form of a law governing the confluence of interests of Bolivia  Argentina and Paraguay in respect of the river's course.As Paraguay is a land-locked country  it has an especially keen interest in the Convention on the Law of the Sea  which our country ratified as early as 1986. The provisions of the Convention allow for the mitigation of disadvantages for those States that have no direct access to the sea and  for Paraguay  this will open up the possibility of sharing in the wealth of the deep seabed  or ""Zone""  which the Convention calls the common heritage of mankind. We view with optimism the entry into force of that Convention on 16 November this year. In the same context  Paraguay has signed the Agreement amending the Convention.All developing countries aspire to sharing in the scientific and technological progress of the modem world. It seems to me that  together with the other measures the United Nations has already taken or is preparing to take  serious thought should be given to creating a global fund for scientific and technological development that would deepen the relationship between the major research centers in developed countries and the universities and research centers in developing countries.I should like to express Paraguay's deep satisfaction at the demise of the apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and at the observance of human rights for all the ethnic communities of the country. Paraguay has not forgotten the sister nations in Africa  which are striving to overcome immense difficulties in their quest for sustainable development and which deserve wide international support.Paraguay is similarly disposed towards the sister Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  with which we enjoyfraternal ties. We wish its people peace and brotherhood  and will strive to commit the United Nations towards that end.We are very pleased to congratulate the State of Israel  the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Kingdom of Jordan on their having strengthened the foundations of fraternal and constructive coexistence in the region  initiated in the agreements between Israel and Egypt. We trust that  given the help of the United Nations and of other major actors  the peace and security process in that part of the world will make steady progress  with the cooperation of other major countries in the region itself.I should like to voice a few thoughts with regard to the recent Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Paraguay joined in the Conference Declaration and Program of Action  while clearly and explicitly placing on record its demand for the defense of life and agreeing  in broad terms  with consensual and voluntary family planning. For that reason  Paraguay lodged two reservations similar to those expressed by other countries that share our view.As I bring my statement to a close  allow me to voice a personal reflection that arises from my many years in international life. I have been active in diplomacy since 1936. Apart from some time spent in academia  I have served my country or the United Nations. I lived through the beginning and the end of the Second World War. My generation was indeed moved when the United Nations Charter was signed. We were filled with hope  and the world seemed to be on the right path in reordering its affairs. We have traveled a long way since then  but we remain all the more convinced of the crucial need for this world Organization.I have personally known each one of the Secretaries- General of our Organization. I have worked closely with a number of them and shared their problems  their fears and their concerns as we struggled for a more just world.It has been a privilege to be both a United Nations official and a diplomat accredited to this Organization. Now  in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs  I feel I have been granted an opportunity to renew the commitment of my nation and my own personal commitment. That commitment is genuine and unadulterated support for the effort to keep the peace through law and to build it through development.The United Nations ideal today compels us to adopt a new way of thinking and living. Indeed  we are not merely representatives of sovereign States or members of a world Organization. We are protagonists and agents who share the same planet  which is in many respects both very similar and very different.We have to show greater solidarity and regain our universal vision.As human beings  we all have an interest in whatever makes us more human  in all senses of the term. The vital force that springs from this vision helps us in our mission of saving our common home  the Earth.Mankind and the Earth:	therein	lies	the	keymotivation for our commitment and for our endeavors  beneath the majestic gaze of the Creator."
"140",5866,"QAT",49,1994,"I should like  at the outset  to express to Mr. Essy and tohis friendly country my Government’s and my personalcongratulations on his election to the Presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We areconfident that his abilities and skills will enable him todischarge his responsibilities in the best possible manner.I should like also to congratulate the members of theGeneral Committee on their election to that body.On this occasion I cannot fail to express theappreciation of the delegation of the State of Qatar  as wellas my personal appreciation  to Mr. Essy’s predecessor asPresident of the General Assembly  Ambassador SamuelInsanally  who represents the friendly Republic of Guyana for his excellent leadership and the work carried out duringhis tenure.It is also my pleasure to extend our congratulations tothose States that have recently joined our internationalOrganization. We look forward to their constructive andeffective participation in the activities of the United Nationsand to their defence of its principles.In that context  I salute the delegation of the Republicof South Africa and that country’s great leader  NelsonMandela  the first African President of the State  which  inthis new chapter of its history  will undoubtedly be a newMember representing the African continent and theinternational community. We are convinced that it willplay an outstanding role  for which it is eminently qualifiedby its stature  as well as by its expertise in all fields.I should like also to reaffirm the State of Qatar’s fullconfidence in and special appreciation of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hiscommitment and devotion in the service of this internationalOrganization and for his efforts to uphold the nobleprinciples of the United Nations and to promote itsinternational peace-keeping and peacemaking role in dealingwith international problems and crises. This is a role thatwill undoubtedly increase in importance.The General Assembly’s forty-ninth session is beingheld in the shadow of dynamic and rapid changes ininternational relations. These rapid dynamic changes havenot yet reached their culmination. We are in a period oftransition wherein new patterns of international relations areconstantly emerging. It is a period in which the so-callednew international order is being formed.The most important underpinnings on which thisnew order must rest are  in our view  respect for theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations and itsCharter  in particular  the principle of sovereign co-equality  the willingness of States to honour theircommitments in good faith  non-intervention in theinternal affairs of other States  the control by States oftheir natural resources  the non-use and the absence of thethreat of the use of force against the territorial integrity orpolitical independence of other States  and the resolutionof international disputes by peaceful means in accordancewith the principles of international law through mediation dialogue or through the International Court of Justice.With the ending of the cold war  a new era hasdawned in the United Nations. This internationalOrganization is now being resorted to increasingly andmore urgently. The United Nations mechanism is nowsquarely in the forefront of international efforts to face upto problems that in the past were intractable. Suchproblems are now being examined and debated in aserious manner in the United Nations and its specializedorgans and agencies with the aim of finding suitablesolutions thereto.In this regard  the State of Qatar believes that theUnited Nations and its specialized organs and agenciesare the most appropriate framework for deliberation onissues relating to peace-keeping and peacemaking  thepeaceful settlement of international disputes  questions ofdevelopment and the forging of just and balancedeconomic and social relations.Given today’s challenges  there is no doubt that thesolving of such problems should be the collectiveresponsibility of all States regardless of size  if thesolutions devised are to be compatible with the interestsof the entire international community. Therefore  theState of Qatar supports efforts to restructure thisinternational Organization and its bodies in order to makethem more democratic and dynamic so that they maybecome more suited to the task of satisfying newinternational requirements and dealing with the challengesof peace  development  the issues of international peaceand security  as well as economic and social issues.These issues are dictated by the radicaltransformations in the patterns of international relations.First of all  there must be a balanced relationship betweenthe General Assembly as the principal political body  theSecurity Council as the body responsible for questions ofsecurity  and the Economic and Social Council as the34body responsible for issues of economic and socialdevelopment.In addition  the General Assembly and its resolutionsmust be given a more effective role as a framework fordeliberations and negotiations and for the adoption ofresolutions on issues of international importance. This isfully in line with the commitment by all States to theprinciple of sovereign co-equality and the right of effectiveparticipation in the upholding of the common interests ofthe international community.No one State or group of States  regardless of statureor power  should monopolize the fashioning of the newinternational order in the absence of the United Nations which is the true representative of the internationalcommunity. Such a new order must be fashioned by allStates collectively through the United Nations  whosestature and efficacy must be enhanced and supported as theonly forum for international deliberations  the bodyresponsible for international peace and security and thebody that has the overall responsibility for economic andsocial development  the protection of the environment andof human rights as well as for combating drugs andterrorism.In this context  I should like to express my support forthe statement in the Secretary-General’s report ""An Agendafor Peace"" that democracy within the family of nationsrequires the fullest consultation  participation andengagement of all States  large and small  in the work ofthe Organization.I should like to refer also to the statement in the samereport that the employment of preventive diplomacyrequires prior knowledge of potential disputes  participationin peacemaking and peace-keeping  support for theagreements concluded and the taking of measures that aimat resolving the economic  social and political problems thatled to the dispute in the first place.We welcome the positive developments in the role ofthe Security Council and its ability to perform the rolemandated to it by the Charter  thanks to the new spirit ofcooperation that emerged between its members and enabledit to take collective measures in respect of some verydifficult and sensitive issues and to assume newresponsibilities such as the expansion of its authority inrespect of some peace-keeping issues through theadministration of some areas during periods of transitionand through the supervision of elections and the protectionof human rights. None the less  we have some fears thatthe Council may become an institution that is used toimpose the will of the strong on the weak.Therefore  we believe that the exercise by certainmembers of particular rights and privileges must not leadto hegemony by a limited number of strong States overthe course of events in the world. Thus we believe thatthe question of membership of the Security Council mustbe dealt with in a manner that takes into account the largeincrease in the membership of the United Nations whileputting some checks on the use of the right of veto.In addition  the international community must respectthe resolutions of the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. Political will must be mobilized to implementthose resolutions  to impose peace if conditions sorequire  or to negotiate peace if there is good faith and ifthe parties cooperate. We believe that this is theguaranteed means of protecting the new internationalorder and of ensuring its acceptability  credibility andstability.We hope that the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations will mark the rebirth ofa new  stronger and more democratic body. In thisregard  we are encouraged by discussions  within andoutside the United Nations  regarding the restructuring ofthe Organization and its various organs. These are veryconstructive  serious and objective discussions  and all theStates of the world are participating in them.The State of Qatar  proceeding from the wiseinstructions of the Emir  His Royal Highness SheikhKhalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani  and his loyal heir  HisRoyal Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani  hasalways participated by all means in the solution of issuesrelated to the Arab Gulf  as well as the Arab and Islamicnation. We have supported the Gulf Cooperation Councilbecause it serves the interests of the Gulf States and theirpeoples. We  as part of the region  believe that oursecurity is closely linked to the region’s. We havesupported stability in the region and rejected everyattempt to bring about regional changes by force. Webelieve that the security of the region requires cooperationamongst all its States on the basis of good-neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-intervention ininternal affairs and respect for international law. We holdthat all unresolved problems should be resolved bypeaceful means  through dialogue  mediation or theInternational Court of Justice.35Proceeding from this principle  the State of Qatarsupports the resolution by such means of the current disputebetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republicof Iran over the three islands of Abu Moussa and the twoTumbs.On the Arab level  the State of Qatar has continuallycalled for the airing of issues in the Arab world and forreconciliation  in order to promote Arab solidarity so thatthe Arab Umma may resume its role in history and in themarch of civilization.We have followed with the greatest concern theregrettable events in the Republic of Yemen. Since thedispute began  the State of Qatar has participated indiplomatic efforts to contain it. Despite the bloody andregrettable struggle  friendly Yemen has maintained itsunity. As you know  from the beginning we have stood onthe side of legality and unity in Yemen  and we have beeneager to abide by these two principles in dealing with theissue  proceeding from our faith in the need to maintain theunity of the Yemenite territory and people.As for the situation in Iraq  our position is that theunity of Iraq and its territorial integrity must be maintained.Iraq must commit itself to the implementation of allrelevant Security Council resolutions. It must recognize thesovereignty of the state of Kuwait and its territorialintegrity  as well as its internationally recognized borderaccording to United Nations Security Council resolutions.We also sympathize with the Iraqi people and call for thealleviation of their hardship  taking into account the acuteshortage of medicines and foodstuffs.Concerning peace in the Middle East  we support theprocess and hope that negotiations will achieve concreteprogress on all tracks  particularly concerning Lebanon andSyria. Last year  we welcomed the Palestinian-Israeliagreement as a landmark on the road to a just solution tothe Palestinian question. We now welcome the subsequentsteps taken  namely the early transfer of authority and theexpansion of self-rule  both of which are important stepstowards the achievement of a just and comprehensivesolution to the question of Palestine. We also welcome theJordanian-Israeli declaration as to the ending of the state ofwar between the two countries and the initiation of seriousnegotiations to resolve all problems  specifically thoseconcerning water and borders. This declaration is also alandmark on the road towards a just and comprehensivesolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  on the basis of theMadrid formula; Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973); the land-for-peace principle; the fullwithdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied territories(the Golan Heights  the southern part of Lebanon Jerusalem); the restoration of all inalienable rights of thePalestinian people  including the right to self-determination; and the creation of a State whose capitalwill be Jerusalem  as it is a symbol of peace and is partand parcel of the territories occupied since 1967. Duringthe transitional period  the situation in this territory particularly its demographic aspects  should not bechanged. I wish here to reiterate the need to put a stopto the process of Israeli settlement  which is illegal andconstitutes a major hurdle in the way of peace.Proceeding from this  the General Assembly shouldreaffirm  at its current session  all previous resolutionsregarding the question of Palestine and the Middle Eastproblem  and declare them unalienable.In order to push ahead the peace process in theMiddle East  we participated in the multilateralnegotiations. We indicated that those negotiations did notreplace bilateral negotiations but complemented them  andthat they would lead to nothing unless a just andcomprehensive peace was achieved in the region. In thisregard  the State of Qatar hosted  from 2 to 5 May 1994 the fifth meeting of the Working Group on Disarmamentand Regional Security in the Middle East  whichdeveloped from the multilateral negotiations.The position of Qatar was stated as follows. First support for all international efforts aimed at achievingagreement on disarmament on the regional andinternational levels  and support for the efforts of theDisarmament Conference in this respect. Second  thearrangements of arms control after the achievement ofpeace should be based on legally binding and co-equalcommitments by all parties under international law and inconformity with the United Nations Charter. Third  armscontrol efforts on the international level have achievedremarkable success  particularly between the RussianFederation and the United States as indicated by thesigning of START and all subsequent steps. Yet thoseefforts have not achieved any tangible progress in theMiddle East  since one State continues to retain itsnuclear capabilities. Fourth  all States are called upon toaccede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to agreeto abide by its safeguards and subject their nuclearfacilities to international inspections. The region must befreed from all weapons of mass destruction and theirdelivery systems. In this regard  we wonder how theGeneral Conference of the International Atomic EnergyAgency could decide to resume its technical assistance to36Israel  while Israel continues to reject the NPT and refusesto submit to its safeguards regime.We follow with great concern the situation in brotherlySomalia. We hope that national reconciliation willsafeguard the unity  independence and stability of Somalia.On this occasion  we wish to support the decision by theArab Foreign Ministers to set up an Arab ministerialcommittee that would monitor the situation in Somalia andwork towards the desired reconciliation alongside theSecretary-General of the League of Arab States.As for Afghanistan  we express our concern over thecontinuing violence and call upon all factions to halthostilities and work for a permanent and peacefulsettlement that would give precedence to the interests of theAfghani people.Since the Second World War  Europe has notwitnessed a tragedy such as that which is unfolding inBosnia and Herzegovina. The suffering imposed on theMuslim people through the atrocities of ethnic cleansing genocide and mass killings at the hands of Serb aggressorsconstitute crimes which far exceed all those committed inEurope in the course of the Second World War. Despitethe fact that the Serbs reject the international peace plandrawn up by the five States and accepted by Bosnia andHerzegovina  no disciplinary action has been taken againstthe Serb aggressors  while the embargoes are still in placeagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the very least  theinternational community should enable the Muslims toexercise the right of self-defence  a legitimate rightenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Once again together with other members of the Islamic world we ask why is it that there is all this procrastination in dealing withthe Serbs  and why are they allowed to hold on to the landthey have acquired by force and on which they continue topractice the atrocities of ethnic cleansing? The internationalcommunity is called upon to deal with this matter firmlywith no double standards and in a manner that wouldguarantee the independence and territorial integrity ofBosnia and Herzegovina and guarantee for it an economicsituation that may enable it to survive. This wouldcertainly contribute to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security in that sensitive region of the world.The State of Qatar reiterates its condemnation of thisaggression and reaffirms the independence of the Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina  its territorial integrity  itssovereignty and its unity with and its one indivisiblecapital  Sarajevo.While we welcomed the resolution adopted by theUnited States Congress and agreed to by theAdministration to lift the embargo against the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina  we have been surprised by thelatest resolution by the Security Council  which includeda relaxation of the sanctions imposed on Serbia andMontenegro  the State that stands beside the Serbianmilitias in their continuing aggression against the Muslimsin Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe that the saidresolution will have grave consequences as it rewards theaggressor and the forces that support that aggression andconstitutes a retreat in the face of aggression  massacresand continuing ethnic crimes.In this regard  we call on the Security Council not toreward aggression. We call upon it to discharge itsresponsibilities towards the protection of the Muslims inBosnia and Herzegovina by declaring the entire Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven. The Councilmust ensure that no military assistance is allowed to reachthe Serbs. The Muslims must be enabled to exercise theirlegitimate right to self-defence by the lifting of theembargo on their country. Once again  we emphasize thatthe war criminals in the former Yugoslavia must bebrought to justice and support the demand by theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) contactgroup on Bosnia and Herzegovina to be allowed toparticipate in all activities of the contact group of five.The world economy is slowly emerging from thestate of stagnation which has lasted for far too long. Anew period of varying degrees of growth has started particularly in the third world. Numerous elements hadcontributed to that situation. Foremost among thoseelements was the burden of foreign debt which is beingaggravated by the deterioration in prices of basic exportcommodities side by side with the paucity of foreigninvestments in the areas of production and the very highexpenditures on armaments. The time has come for theinternational community  in particular the developedindustrial States  to adopt effective measures that wouldmake it possible to devise a definitive solution to theproblems of indebtedness in the third world as a whole and in Africa in particular.The debt burden in Africa has had many graveconsequences which have affected the ability of thecontinent to grow and develop. Despite the many debtrescheduling agreements concluded over the past few37years  the servicing of debt continues to consume over22 per cent of all export earnings and continues to obstructinvestment and human development.In this context  the dialogue between the North and theSouth should be reactivated in a more effective manner inorder to find new means to achieve development in thethird world and to rid the third world of poverty andunderdevelopment. We believe that ridding the world ofpoverty and underdevelopment is an essential prerequisiteof lasting peace and the welfare of mankind.Undoubtedly  success in the dialogue between Northand South and productive cooperation between them willpromote efforts to reach a new more realistic and morebalanced international economic order. The developmentof the South is not merely in the interests of its States andpeoples alone  it is also in the interests of the North and itspeople.The developing world pins its hopes on internationaltrade as a means of achieving prosperity for all. Wetherefore welcomed the recent success achieved with regardto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)and hope that this success will result in the freeing of tradeand of unrestricted competition in the world.The threats facing mankind today  and which willcontinue to face it in future  are not all political or military.There are questions of the deterioration of the environment poverty  underdevelopment  drugs  the spread of life-threatening diseases  terrorism and violations of humanrights which become more grave with each passing day.These non-political issues require urgent solutions beforethey become intractable and threaten all mankind.Among the indications of the internationalcommunity’s concern with economic and social issues isthe large number of international conferences devoted tosuch issues. Over the past two years  the world witnessedthe holding of several such conferences  including theWorld Conference on Human Rights in Vienna  the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development inRio de Janeiro  and next year the World Summit for SocialDevelopment will be held in Copenhagen. Each one of theconferences that have been convened has achieved resultswith regard to the issues it has dealt with by means ofresolutions and recommendations and the internationalconsensus surrounding those resolutions andrecommendations.All we wish for here is that those issues should notbe used as a pretext to intervene in the internal affairs ofStates  to deal with States in a discriminatory manner  orto impose conditions on providing economic ordevelopmental aid.I refer in this connection to the idea of a carbon tax whether individual or collective  under the pretext ofprotecting the environment. This is purely an economicissue which will harm the economies of oil-producingStates  particularly those in the Gulf.The State of Qatar reaffirms its support for theUnited Nations efforts to deal with the issues I havementioned. The United Nations is the ideal institution toface up to international and world issues with all theirpolitical  humanitarian  economic and social dimensions.Inspired by the Charter  it can achieve success bybuilding a world based on relations of cooperation andmutual confidence  a world of justice and stability."
"141",5912,"ROU",49,1994,"Itis my pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you on your electionto the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. We are certain that your experience and your19diplomatic skill will lead to a very positive outcome for thework of this session.May I at the same time convey to the Secretary-General our profound appreciation of his tireless efforts toadapt the United Nations to the increasingly complexrequirements of a changing world.The structure of the international system  at the end ofthis century  is experiencing radical changes  particularlythe end of the post-war bipolarity  the fall of the IronCurtain and the end of the cold war. Many new peopleshave gained their right to self-determination and democraticdevelopment  long repressed by totalitarian regimes. Somesucceeded in accomplishing this by peaceful means; othershave had to go through tragedies and major conflicts  suchas those in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the territory of theformer Yugoslavia and the Trans-Dnestr  the Caucasus andCentral Asia  former territories of the Soviet Union. Todaythey are all sources of concern to the internationalcommunity because of their implications for regional andinternational peace and security.The revolutions in Central Europe  whose essentialpurpose was the restoration of freedom and dignity to thepeople in that part of the world and their return totraditional democratic values  with respect for fundamentalhuman rights and political pluralism  have inter alia  mademore politically homogeneous a part of the continent longmarked by ideological and political barriers andconfrontation between opposing military blocs.Europe is undergoing an apparently contradictoryevolution. On the one hand  there is a tendency towardsthe fragmentation of States and a reaffirmation of thenational identities and personalities of the central part of thecontinent and the former Soviet territories. On the otherhand  in the West there is a process of integration which istending to draw in new European States.Other continents are also undergoing historicallyimportant changes.The Middle East  thanks to the actions of a number ofpoliticians who were bold enough to take the greatresponsibility of rising out of the inertia there  and runningthe risks of peace  has entered a process of historicreconciliation which once seemed impossible.In Latin America  as well as in Asia and the Pacific dynamic economic zones have been created  thus destroyingfalse assumptions about the inevitability ofunderdevelopment in two-thirds of the world.In Africa  the abolition of the policy of apartheid the reorganization of the Republic of South Africa ondemocratic lines and the defeat of reactionary racialconcepts open up new prospects for cooperation anddevelopment for the entire continent.The dynamics of the world have changed. Thiscreates many questions for the international community Governments  politicians and political forces. So far theanswers have been few and inadequate. But life does notwait. States and people have concrete needs as well ashopes and ideals. Their natural tendency is to act inorder to fulfil them  whether or not there exists anorganized international framework for harmonizingdivergent interests.This is where international organizations and theUnited Nations in particular have a role to play. In theeffort to decode and evaluate the significance of thehighly dynamic and complex developments in theinternational political arena  several scenarios haveappeared in which these developments are viewed aspreludes to a new era of confrontation betweencivilizations. But freeing international relations fromideology does not and must not necessarily lead toconfrontation between civilizations. By definition confrontation is alien to civilization. Civilization ischaracterized  rather  by tolerance and open-mindedness.Of course  this does not exclude competition betweencivilizations  between the values they promote  betweentheir capacities to guarantee the free enjoyment of basichuman rights and the development of initiative and thehuman personality. But to establish the conditions ofsuch coexistence between civilizations a restructuring ofinternational relations is required if an optimal frameworkfor the affirmation and development of each people’sindividuality  as well as prosperity  are to be ensured.From this perspective  the role of the United Nations isessential.Next year we will be celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the end of the Second World War and  atthe same time  the establishment of the United Nations.Like other States in the region  Romania  against its will was dragged into a conflict that claimed millions ofvictims and wrought enormous destruction. However through the determination of all its internal democraticforces - the embodiment of our nation’s aspirations -Romania managed to break away from Hitler’s war20machine and join the coalition of the united nations on 23August 1944. The great human  material and logisticalefforts made by the Romanian people between 23 August1944 and the final victory of the united nations forces areengraved in the Golden Book of our national history. Eventhough the status of co-belligerent was not granted toRomania  no one has ever contested the strategic value andpolitical importance of these sacrifices.We support proposals that in 1995 - the year whichmarks half a century since the end of the war - theinternational community should concentrate its efforts onbuilding a climate of peace and giving a decisive impetusto the peaceful settlement of conflicts existing in variousregions of the world  thus making next year a trueinternational year of peace.In this framework  we believe that there is a need torethink the entire machinery and to adapt the structures ofthe United Nations to contemporary requirements. Indeed this rethinking process has already started  and this is to bewelcomed. The Secretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace""offers excellent material for reflection and action.In this context  we support the proposals  in our viewjustified  aimed at reviewing the composition of theSecurity Council in order to adapt it to today’s realities andensure a better representation of the great geographicalregions. In our view  such a limited increase inmembership would have to include Germany and Japanamong the permanent members of that the Council  takinginto account their potential  role and contribution to theactivities of the Organization. Certainly  this should notmean the establishment of a ""condominium"" of thepermanent members over the rest of the world. Rather  wesee it as a deeper commitment to their responsibility formaintaining international peace and security  which is themain task of the Security Council. In this way  a balancecould be achieved between the Council and the GeneralAssembly and the other main bodies within a context ofdemocratic decision-making procedures that would allow allcountries to act on a democratic and equal basis inprotecting their legitimate interests.Any rethinking of the structures of the United Nationsmust take into account the phenomenon of the globalizationof international problems  one of the features of today’sworld. Objective factors of development are increasing theinterdependence of States and regions of the world. In oneway or another  we are all affected by the tragedies thathave unfolded in  for example  the former Yugoslavia  theTrans-Dnestr region  the Caucasus  Rwanda and Haiti. Theworld economy shows clear trends towards integration ona global scale  a development which affects the interestsof all States. The ecological equilibrium of the planet isbecoming of vital interest to all regions and summons allStates to bear their share of responsibility.All these phenomena  typical of the late twentiethcentury  require us to develop an awareness of our planetas a veritable spaceship if our Governments’ actions atthe international level are to be both effective andconvergent. The United Nations system is best placed toencourage and sustain the development of such anawareness.Today  there is no greater threat to internationalpeace and security and no greater source of tension andconflict among nations than the widening gap betweenrich and poor States. The corrections already attemptedby the international community  including the Decades forDevelopment and various assistance programmes  havenot managed to put a halt to these negative trends. Thisposes a grave threat to the global balance  particularlythrough the inevitable phenomenon of massive populationmigration  which is impossible to control  from theunderdeveloped areas of the planet to much smaller zonesof prosperity in Europe and North America.It is in mankind’s general interest to prevent such aprospect and to preserve its diversity. This can beachieved solely through a determined and enlightenedeffort on the part of the international community toeradicate underdevelopment and promote the economicgrowth of the developing countries  thus turning them intothe truly equal partners of the developed countries  as isrightly emphasized in the Secretary-General’s Agenda forDevelopment. The United Nations system is the mostappropriate framework for launching on a global scale apartnership for development  the necessity of which isgrowing more apparent by the day.Clearly  such a development must first address theneeds and aspirations to progress of the developingcountries. At the same time  it should coincide with theinterests of the developed countries  which are facingmany difficulties today - not on the same scale  ofcourse - by offering them new opportunities to overcomerecession and chronic unemployment. The experience ofthe developed countries themselves demonstrates thateconomic development inherently leads to an increase inthe absorption capacity of national markets and in thedegree of economic interaction.21From this viewpoint the European continent is in aposition to engage in an experiment that has great relevancefor the world economy. Without coordinated action byEuropean States and institutions  the ideological andpolitical barriers characteristic of the period when Europewas divided into opposing military blocs may well bereplaced by a new iron curtain  economic in nature between developed countries and those in transition because of the gaps between them. Such risks could beeliminated by the ever-growing trend towards integration atthe continental level; the construction of a system ofeconomic relations based on equality between the countriesof the East and West on the continent  which will help topromote reforms in the Central and Eastern Europeancountries; and the realization of the necessary standards ofintegration. Those developments could also make a vitalcontribution to the achievement  in a similar manner  of apartnership for development.In this connection  international efforts to promote theeconomic growth of a particular area must not be viewed interms of competition or rivalry with other areas. Anyeconomic progress in an area that is lagging represents again for other areas. In this context  the United Nationssystem can play a moderating and balancing role inmanaging  as rationally and effectively as possible  apartnership for development at the global level.I have referred to some of the major challengescontemporary international developments present to theinternational community  and to the United Nations inparticular  developments with regard to which the latter isparticularly called upon to assume the role of organizingcooperation between States to harmonize and safeguardtheir common interests.As a democratic State aware of its responsibilities toits people as well as to international peace  security andcooperation  Romania intends to be part of the universaleffort to face these challenges. My country’s principalcontribution to this joint effort consists of consolidating thedemocratic process and domestic stability. Over the nearlyfive years since the Revolution of December 1989  thecountry’s face has radically changed. A new Constitution modern and democratic in nature  has come into force; thetotalitarian regime has been abolished and the foundationsof a State of law have been laid; the free exercise offundamental human rights  including the rights ofindividuals belonging to national minorities  is guaranteed.On that basis  we have created step by step an ever greaterdegree of domestic stability  which today makes Romaniaa stabilizing factor in the region. This is an especiallyremarkable achievement in that it was obtained underdifficult international conditions - in particular  thesituations of conflict in our immediate neighbourhood andabove all the extremely heavy burden which the embargoagainst Yugoslavia has imposed upon the Romanianeconomy  with no compensation whatsoever.To the extent that it can  Romania participates in theefforts of the international community to resolve regionalconflicts  primarily those in our own geographical area.We are ready to assume all our responsibilities and makeour contribution to peacefully settling those conflicts andensuring security and calm in a region traumatized bymilitary confrontations and with interests at stake that arenot necessarily the same as those of the parties engagedin combat.In that spirit Romania has fully associated itself withthe Partnership for Peace offered by the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) to the countries of CentralEurope and of the former Soviet Union. We believe thisnew form of interconnection with an institution thatconstituted a guarantee for the maintenance of peacethroughout the European continent will give a betteropportunity for peace in Europe and  implicitly  forinternational peace and security.Similarly  in a broader context  Romania supportsthe process of integration at the continental level. It isendeavouring to contribute to this by pursuing a policy ofgood-neighbourliness and by implementing regionalcooperation projects  particularly in the area of CentralEurope  the Black Sea and the Danube basin  all of whichshould accelerate the integration of the countries ofCentral and Eastern Europe into the structures of theEuropean Union  NATO  the Western European Unionand the Council of Europe.The priority Romania attaches to the European andEuro-Atlantic options  resulting from its history and fromgeopolitical factors  does not exclude traditionalrelationships established over the years with countries andareas outside the European continent. On the contrary  asthe country’s domestic political and social life hasbecome more stable and as its economy has begun toimprove  those relations have been renewed andexpanded. They are certainly valuable at the bilaterallevel  but they are also valuable multilaterally  since theystrengthen international confidence and trust and developa global awareness of the fact that the world is shrinkingall the time  in terms of both time and space  and that22each State shares responsibility for the tranquillity  peaceand prosperity of other States.The extremely complex situations in various parts ofthe world and the contradictory currents that exist  with alltheir attendant risks and uncertainties for overall peace andsecurity  demand a democratic vision of the newinternational order  which must be built  and abandonmentof prejudices in relations between States inherited from thecold-war period. But that is not all. I believe that todaywe need a vision of the management of internationalrelations in which realism and pragmatism predominate.Unfortunately  the after-effects of ideological outlooks stilllinger in political thinking  distancing us from reality andinevitably influencing policy making. In certain conditions this can have extremely serious consequences for States andpeoples by marginalizing them or even by isolating themfrom international cooperation. In the medium and longterm  such political decisions can only have harmfulconsequences for international peace and security.Because of its vocation and its Charter principles  theUnited Nations is the ideal forum for determining anapproach to international problems free from stereotypesand prejudices. To the extent that the United Nationssucceeds  all Member States stand to gain - eachindividually and the international community as a whole.Romania is prepared to participate in this joint effort tobuild a world of international peace and cooperation  freefrom conflicts and prejudices."
"142",5958,"RUS",49,1994,"At thevery outset I would like to congratulate you  Mr. AmaraEssy  on your election to the high post of President of theGeneral Assembly at its current session. I view this as asign of recognition of your country’s authority in theinternational community.The United Nations is approaching its fiftiethanniversary  and the entire world has grown older alongwith it. What is the world like nowadays? Has it becomebetter? Has it become wiser? And  most important  whatwill the present generation leave behind to its successors?No State  no people can be indifferent to thesequestions. Here in the United Nations we must findanswers to them. This is particularly important forRussia. We are trying to understand what kind of worldwe want to live in  and exactly what kind of world weshould spare no effort to build.The new Russia was born in 1991 as a democraticState. Its birth was witnessed by the entire world.For several years now we have been engaged in atremendous  and painstaking task  the essence of which isto remove the legacy of totalitarianism and the cold war.Freedom has come to Russia. The people haveobtained fundamental civil rights long denied them.Profound economic reform is in progress in Russia. Afree market economy is being put into effect. Thus  eachof our new success stories reinforces Russian democracy.Russia has decisively drawn a final line under theSecond World War. Our forces have been withdrawnfrom Germany  Central Europe and the Baltic States. Ofits own accord  and at great effort  Russia has removedany threat to the security of other States.Furthermore  our country  through its own efforts has promoted the end of confrontation in Europe  settingup new security structures there  not only for a selectnumber  the chosen but for all. The Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) shouldbecome a powerful driving force in that process.1We expect there to be more understanding on the partof our partners with regard to the problems of security inRussia. We count on their ability to overcome the oldsuspicion inherent in a world divided into blocs  suspicionthat is now unjustified.Russia is undergoing changes and regaining itsidentity  but in every respect it remains a great Power.Russia is ready for equal cooperation within the frameworkof the international community  which should in turn acceptan active  open Russia.We would like nuclear weapons and other kinds ofweapons of mass destruction to cease to exist. Efficientcontrol over the non-proliferation of the technologies fortheir production is imperative.Russia needs a world without wars and armed conflictsand without environmental calamities. We favour thedevelopment of international economic ties withoutdiscrimination. Russia stands for a world capable ofcombating terrorism  drug-trafficking and other types ofinternational crime.To make such gigantic changes possible  efforts by allthe Members of the United Nations will be required. Thereis no room for either soloists or supernumeraries.Naturally  we cannot do without new relations betweenthe two major nuclear Powers. I am convinced that theentire world has a vital stake in the establishment of astrategic partnership between Russia and the United States.I am ready for a serious and fruitful dialogue with PresidentBill Clinton  who today gave an optimistic forecast of ourinteraction.Russia’s economic and foreign-policy priorities lie inthe countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS)  the former Republics of the Soviet Union. Russia’sties with them are closer than the traditional relations ofgood-neighbourliness; we have  rather  an extraordinaryblood relationship. In virtually all the CIS countries todaythere is a growing desire for closer cooperation and agenuine  rather than merely proclaimed  integration. Itsfoundation will be good will and mutual benefit.Attempts to use the contradictions between the CISStates for selfish ends are extremely short-sighted.Conflicts in a number of CIS countries threaten not onlythe security of our State  but also security at the regionaland global levels.We are acutely interested in the active participationof the world community in settling these difficultproblems. However  the main peace-keeping burden inthe territory of the former Soviet Union sits is beingborne by the Russian Federation.Our efforts have not been fruitless. A solid trucehas already been established in Moldova. The peaceprocess in Georgia is developing; hope of stopping thebloodshed in Nagorny Karabakh is already emerging andinitial agreements on Tajikistan have also been reached.Everybody knows how difficult life is for millions ofRussians in newly independent States; it is not a time forcomplacency. Once they were in their own home  butnow they are guests - and not always welcome ones.We cannot remain indifferent to the fate of ourcountrymen. I an not referring to special rights orprivileges. But the people in Russia will not understandif I do not state here and now that the democratic Stateshave to prove through their actions that guaranteeinghuman rights is indeed the cornerstone of their foreignpolicy. And in this area neither a selective approach nordouble standards are permissible.Two years ago the General Assembly adopted theDeclaration on the rights of national minorities. At thissession we propose to come to an agreement on theprinciples of that Declaration being embodied in thelegislation of all United Nations Member States.Russia makes no distinction between settling itsproblems and the problems of others. That is why weparticularly highly value what is done within the UnitedNations.The world is now at a crossroads. The tragedy ofthe struggle of two opposing blocs is finally over. Thedelicate balance based on power  fear and mutualintimidation has disappeared for ever.But the world is still not stable. The changes thatare taking place entail not only hopes for a better future but also profound anxieties.It is not only Russia that is trying to respond to theemerging challenges. To a certain degree  the unitedGermany  Japan  the United States and other countries ofthe West face the same problem. The same appliesequally to many countries in Asia  Africa and LatinAmerica.2The fundamental changes in international relations areaccompanied by the emergence of new problems. Moreand more countries see strengthening the effectiveness ofinter-State structures as the solution. At the same time  thisdoes not always prevent an increase in the activity of thosewho hold separatist and nationalist aspirations.A veritable floodgate of regional and local conflicts national  tribal and religious enmity and economic  socialand political confrontations has been opened wide. Thebleeding wound in Bosnia has not healed. It is a tragicparadox that in the wake of the cold war in Europe hotbedsof war have flared up there anew.The unprecedented tragedy in Rwanda resoundspainfully in the hearts of all people. This has proved to bea defeat for us all.But let us look around. Are there not other parts ofthe world where more refined and civilized unlawful actionsare being taken against national and cultural minorities?Are their rights and their security not threatened? Haveracism and anti-Semitism disappeared? Is there no longerany discrimination against those who are categorized asnon-indigenous?When aggressive nationalism is made into State policyit is a grave danger for all mankind.These problems are all the more urgent today becausethe threat of local conflicts has not waned.Each of these conflicts could cause a veritableavalanche of geopolitical changes all over the world.The cold war is over  but its material infrastructure -the mountains of arms and the military-industrial complexesof the developed countries - still remain. The spread ofnuclear weapons could make them into instruments ofterror. Huge amounts of weapons have been dumped ontointernational markets. Unfortunately  vested interestsfrequently prevail over the awareness of the danger implicitin this process. In fact  this is nothing but an arms racethat has simply been transferred to the developing countriesthrough the market.The worsening ecological crisis and the proliferationof AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and otherdangerous diseases are also realities at the close of thistwentieth century.The lessons of history can be learned only with greatdifficulty. Obsession with the idea of supremacy isextremely dangerous. The pathological failure to acceptsomething different has time and again resulted innumerous ethnic and religious problems and conflicts.The fear of open political territory wind up once againwith a ""cordon sanitaire"" or ""iron curtain"".Let us be honest: equality  partnership  mutualbenefit and cooperation still remain  to a large extent words used to cover State egotism. Such a situationindicates an urgent need to develop a solid system ofsecurity on the basis of principles and mechanisms ofcooperation on the part of everyone  and a need for thereform of international institutions. Such a system shouldbe in keeping with the new conditions that now prevailand should function under the auspices of the UnitedNations.As a specific contribution towards the establishmentof such a system  I would propose the followingmeasures.First  we must speed up the negotiations on theconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.Russia advocates the signing of this treaty next year when we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. We should also give thought to further steps tolimit Russian and American strategic nuclear weapons inorder to make it possible eventually to renounce theinherited ""balance of terror"" based on mutual nucleardeterrence.Secondly  we must extend non-proliferation measuresto cover weapons of mass destruction. Next spring  whenthe Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons takes place  it isessential to adopt a decision to the effect that the treatyshould be open-ended and of unlimited duration. No onehas the right to deny this. In this context  we believe thatthe non-nuclear-weapon States will need to be givenadditional and more precise security assurances. Wepropose the holding in the near future of a specialmeeting of the Security Council  at the Foreign Ministerlevel  to coordinate and adopt a new resolution onso-called ""positive"" security assurances.Thirdly  we should launch a multilateral debate onthe issues with regard to the regulation of theinternational traffic in weaponry and military equipment.Moreover  there is an urgent need for all nuclear-weaponStates to participate in the process of the control and3limitation of nuclear weapons. We propose that a treaty onnuclear security and strategic stability be elaborated by thefive nuclear-weapon States. Such a treaty could provide forcessation of the production of fissionable materials formilitary purposes  for prohibition of the recycling offissionable materials for weapons purposes and for furtherelimination of nuclear weapons and the reduction of theirmeans of delivery.Fourthly  it would be advisable to open discussions onregional programmes to strengthen peace and security.Regional security systems are being formed even now: Iam thinking particularly of the treaty on collective securitybetween the members of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS) of the former Soviet Union. We believe thatat the present stage that the United Nations could direct itsefforts towards coordinating the process of building upregional security systems.Finally  the experience of recent years demonstratesthat the renunciation of the arms race is a complicated andhighly expensive process. Conversion of the militaryindustry gives rise to extremely difficult economic andsocial problems that have to be dealt with  particularly asthey relate to the elimination of chemical andbacteriological weapons. In this context  it is important topool the efforts of the international community. Suchcooperation among States would help to enhance the levelof mutual trust. In 1996  it might be possible to hold aconference  under the auspices of the United Nations  oninternational cooperation in the field of conversion.Implementation of these measures will enable us tosubstantially stabilize the situation in the world. However from the long-term point of view  these measures will notbe sufficient.The former purely military understanding of theconcept of ""security"" has today become obsolete. Therange of problems faced by mankind is much wider than itwas. The modern definition of security is inseparable fromthe notion of stable development.The world is urgently in need of a strategy for thetwenty-first century - a strategy of mutual responsibility.The most important points of reference for such a strategycould be defined as follows:- Stable economic and social development  notonly for individual regions and States but indeed  for the entire planet as a single entity.People themselves must assume theresponsibility of carrying out this immense task;- The renunciation of diktat by the powerfulvis-à-vis the weak. Any country  whether largeor small  should be aware of its responsibilityfor the maintenance of order based on law andmorality;- The unconditional recognition of human rights including the rights of national minorities. Inview of the great diversity of cultures traditions and the historical experience ofcountries and peoples  fundamental humanrights are a universal value and we cannotpermit them to be devalued;- Strengthening the ecological security ofmankind. The world is now facing a mostserious crisis because of the deficit ofresources  deterioration of the naturalenvironment  and many other negative trends.Common sense and the instinct for survival tellus to stop exploiting our depleting resources tothe detriment of nature  society and mankind.Russia supports the programme on Globaleducation and observation to preserve theenvironment. Moreover  this programme isentirely consistent with the strategy of sharedresponsibility. We intend to participateactively in its implementation.At the same time  I should like to emphasize thatonly a profound understanding  on the part of eachparticipant in international cooperation  of his or herindividual responsibility can engender a common sense ofresponsibility for the world situation.To paraphrase a well known expression we couldsay that the United Nations is a good idea whose time hasfinally come. I should like in particular to note the greatpersonal contribution of the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to the cause ofadvocating peace and settling regional conflicts.If the United Nations is to achieve maximumeffectiveness in the twenty-first century  it must undergoa well-thought-out reform.Obviously  changes will be required both atHeadquarters and in the functioning of the specializedagencies. Also  it will be impossible to avoid changes in4the Security Council  which should remain sufficientlycompact and an effective functioning body. This isespecially important because  according to the Charter  theSecurity Council bears primary responsibility for supportingand maintaining world peace and security.We have to strike a new balance of law  morality andforce in world politics. The United Nations could play adecisive role in these efforts in accordance with the Charter.Russia stands ready  as provided in Article 43 of theCharter  to enter into an agreement with the SecurityCouncil to make available national military contingents forUnited Nations operations. If a sufficient number of otherStates follows this lead  then it could be possible to goahead with the realization of the concept of United Nationsstand-by forces.The Military Staff Committee has already beenformally in existence for several decades. According to theCharter its function is ""to advise and assist the SecurityCouncil on all questions relating to the Security Council’smilitary requirements"". Let them finally do just that.The pertinent task now will be to work out a strategyof peace-keeping  conflict and crisis prevention and  ifnecessary  operations on peace enforcement.Through specific actions  Russia has shown supportfor United Nations efforts aimed at setting up efficientmechanisms of response to humanitarian emergencies. Westand ready to cooperate with all countries anxious toreinforce the capability of the world community to producea rapid humanitarian response.Because the problems we are increasinglyencountering are multifaceted  they require adequatesolutions. The question is not about who should enjoymore rights - the United Nations  the regional structures orStates. The future world system can be truly durable onlyif it is possible to find efficient and effective mechanismsto address problems at all levels - national  regional andglobal. Sharing responsibility will make it possible for theUnited Nations to remain flexible and a pragmatic andeffective structure and enable it to focus its efforts on thesolution of the genuinely key problems faced by mankind.Russia believes that these are all fundamental issuesthat have a direct bearing on the fate of the worldcommunity. Both the authority of the United Nations andthe future of world politics as a whole will depend on theway these issues are dealt with.People have always sought stability  happiness andprosperity. But history provides evidence of the fact thatthese goals cannot be achieved with the help of bruteforce alone. Once again we become acutely aware of thisfact now that we are approaching a sacred date formankind: the fiftieth anniversary of the end of theSecond World War and the restoration of peace.Let us remember with gratitude those who gave theirlives for this great victory. Let 1995 become theuniversal year of commemoration of the victims of theSecond World War.For the sake of those living and those who have notyet been born  we must preserve peace and establishstability on our planet. Mankind should finally feel thatit is at home  a home which is both kind and reliable.Our civilization has always been varied. It isprecisely in the variety of cultures  traditions and valuesthat the possibility of development is basically found.At this time  we have reached a stage when differentinterests and aspirations of peoples can be achieved onlythrough cooperation among them.The world community should make every possibleeffort to ensure that its policies are embodied in the newthinking about the influence of States  national pride andpatriotism.The United Nations is a child of the world. Fiftyyears ago when the Second World War was in progress it became abundantly clear that the future of mankind isto be found in the realm of cooperation and tolerancerather than aggression and hatred.Cooperation and tolerance are prerequisites for thenext century.This is the most important condition for there to bea worthy future for our planet.This is a unique opportunity that has been given tothe human race.I believe that the United Nations  in fulfilment of itsgeneral responsibility  will not allow us to pass it up  andI hope that the great dream of peace to which all peoplesand States aspire to will take its due place in the life ofour planet."
"143",6005,"RWA",49,1994,"Like those who have preceded us in addressing theAssembly  we wish first of all to offer you  Mr. President our warmest congratulations on your election to preside atthis session  which attests to the trust and esteem youreminent qualities and competence inspire in theinternational community. Your election also constitutes asolemn tribute to your fraternal  friendly country Côte d’Ivoire  for its important role in the concert ofnations and its firm determination to contribute to thesteady strengthening of cooperation. We wish to assureyou that the Rwandese delegation will spare no effort tomake its modest contribution to the success of your task.We also wish to avail ourselves of this opportunityto pay a heartfelt tribute to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana  for hiscompetence  wisdom and diligence in guiding the work ofthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.In addition  we would like to thank the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  forhis tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the UnitedNations as an instrument for the promotion of peace andsolidarity among peoples.Finally  we warmly welcome the Republic of SouthAfrica as a new Member of the vast family of the UnitedNations. That country has honoured democratic ideals byabolishing the odious system of apartheid. To be sure the arrival of a united  democratic and non-racial SouthAfrica by means of free and democratic elections deservesto be hailed from the rostrum of this Assembly.This forum of nations gives us a timely opportunityto expound on the problem of Rwanda  which has been inthe news day in and day out.One cannot talk about the Rwanda problem withoutmentioning the role the United Nations has played andcontinues to play in the history of our country. Thehistory of our links is well known. It will be recalled thatjust after the beginning of this century Rwanda wasplaced under the mandate system and  later  under thetrusteeship system  which then led to its independence.This history  as has been witnessed by theinternational community  is riddled with unfortunateevents  the most recent of which is the genocide Rwandahas just experienced. This genocide  which rivals theNazi holocaust of the 1940s  is somewhat paradoxicalbecause since the end of the Second World War theinternational community has tried to build a civilizationon the foundations of respect for the fundamental rightsof human beings.While the international community was pooling itsefforts to put an end to racism and racial discrimination particularly apartheid in South Africa - whoseparticipation in the forty-ninth session is a felicitous turnof events - at the same time an ideology akin to apartheidwas evolving in our country. That ideology  which waspublicly professed by the public authorities - more3precisely  by the National Revolutionary Movement forDevelopment (MRND) and the Coalition for the Defence ofthe Republic (CDR) parties of the late PresidentHabyarimana - cleared the way for genocide. Plans forextermination were being openly prepared for a long time with no trepidation whatsoever  since the power structurehad long before institutionalized the violation offundamental human rights. This is why armed opposition in the form of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) confronted the regime beginning in 1990. Some oppositionparties also emerged in 1991  thanks to the pressure exertedby the RPF.Under the aegis of the Organization of African Unity the countries of the subregion initiated a peace process which the United Nations  together with a number ofWestern countries  later joined. We take this opportunityto thank all for their tireless efforts to ensure that theArusha negotiations would succeed.For more than a year the Rwandese negotiated theArusha Peace Agreement  the principal conclusions ofwhich addressed the establishment of a State of law inRwanda  respect for human rights  power-sharing  theestablishment without discrimination of a national army  theconstruction of a society based on respect for democraticprinciples and on national reconciliation  and the return ofrefugees banished from their country for more than 35years.The international community witnessed theintransigence of the MRND-CDR regime  which  describingthe Agreement as a mere scrap of paper  hatched a plan forextermination  now recognized by the whole world asgenocide. The international cameras trained on thisbarbaric crime revealed moments of rare cruelty. Themilitia  trained by the MRND and the CDR and supportedby the presidential guard and by other sectors of the army slit the throats of women  elderly people  men and children.The Rwandese countryside was strewn with corpses. Ourrivers swept thousands of dead bodies downstream.Churches and schools became veritable slaughterhouses and even now they smell of human flesh  the flesh ofthousands of innocent people who had hoped to find refugethere. Piled into common graves  the victims of April’smadness number thousands upon thousands.The killing in our country was intended to disintegratethe Rwandese people  and it succeeded. Now we mustmake a fresh start in rebuilding the Rwandese nation. Wemust ensure that the various sectors of the population cancoexist. We must give them a common hope and acommon destiny  which  after all that has happened  hasbecome a difficult yet indispensable task.We have already requested the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees to help ourGovernment in the effort to teach the Rwandese newvalues based on respect for fundamental human rights.There would have been no genocide if the MRND-CDR system had abided by the spirit of Arusha. But theycould not embrace the spirit of Arusha because thoseRwandese Nazis were proponents of the final solution:extermination. They flouted morality  common sense  thevalues everyone in this Assembly believes in and  aboveall  the prescriptions of Arusha. Yet some who areinsensitive to our suffering have asked that those Naziparties still be allowed to hold power.Never in history has such a scandalous privilegebeen sought for the organized perpetrators of similar casesof genocide. Such requests make light of our dignity ashuman beings. We cannot agree to these requests  whichfly in the face of the spirit and the letter of the principlesunderlying this institution - that is  fundamental humanrights.By discouraging impulses towards revenge and inanticipation of justice that will be clear to everyone andthat is supported by the international community  ourGovernment has been able to contain a situation marked -understandably after such tragedy - by tensions andrancour. Contrary to disparaging allegations that arecompletely unfounded  our Government is not showingweakness; it is not just sitting on its hands whenever thereis an infraction of the law.Our Government continues to cooperate closely withthe United Nations Force  and to facilitate its work. Withscanty means  our Government has undertaken to rebuilda country that has been socially splintered and morallyand physically ravaged. The humanitarian task of theUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda(UNAMIR) continues to be an indispensable asset in ourefforts at rehabilitation.This unspeakable barbarism  this genocide wascarried out before the very eyes of the internationalcommunity. We are grateful to those countries thatgenerously put their troops at the disposal of UNAMIR as well as to the African contingents of the Group ofneutral military observers. We would express our sincerethanks to them for the spirit in which they made their4contribution. Rather than presiding over peace andharmony among the Rwandese  the troops  misled by theauthors of the apocalypse - the Rwandese authorities at thetime - were  alas  forced to serve as witnesses to thecarnage. We regret that their mandate prevented them fromacting effectively at the moment of the tragedy. Based onthis experience  we encourage the United Nations to furnishthe international tribunal to be created in Rwanda with themeans to function as it should  in order to spare us furtherdisappointments and tragedies.In accordance with Rwanda’s request  and followingMr. Degnisegui’s report  as well as that of the Commissionof Experts established by Security Council resolution 935(1994)  of 1 July 1994  it is absolutely urgent that thisinternational tribunal be established. It will enable us toprosecute in a completely open setting those responsible forthe genocide. Since most of the criminals have foundrefuge in various corners of the world  what we seek is atool of justice that knows no borders. Moreover  the verynature of the events - considered to be crimes againsthumanity - warrants the international community’s joiningforces to prevent their reoccurrence.That is why we continue to urge the adoption of aSecurity Council resolution that would facilitate the arrestand trial of those responsible for the genocide who are nowin refugee camps outside our borders. We would remindthe Assembly that most of these camps are primarilymilitary camps where troops and militia  still in possessionof heavy and light weapons  hold hundreds of thousands ofpersons hostage. This resolution should be based onChapter VII of the United Nations Charter and shouldinclude a request to  an authorization for  States Membersof the United Nations to detain individuals on their territorywho are suspected  on solid grounds  of having participatedin acts of genocide  and authorization for them to do so.The construction of a new society based on socialjustice and respect for fundamental human rights will bepossible only if those responsible for the Rwandese tragedyare prosecuted. It is now six months since the first crimeswere committed  and action must be initiated. The delay instarting trials causes understandable frustration on the partof victims who are already losing hope that there can be ajust society and who tend to view the relative impunity ofthe criminals as indicating approval of their crimes.Another thorny problem which faces our country andupon which we would like to shed some light is that ofrefugees.The Rwandese refugees can be classified into twocategories: the former refugees to whom the dictatorialpower had refused to grant the right to return to theirhomeland  and the more recent ones who fled Rwandafollowing the events to which I have already referred. Itis our Government’s policy to encourage all refugees without distinction  to return to their country.In this respect  we are addressing countless appealsto our citizens outside our borders to rejoin us and helpus build a new Rwanda. Thousands of them have alreadyreturned to their homeland  but many others remainabroad. We are also calling upon the soldiers to comeback and  if they still desire to do so - to continue theircareers in the Rwandese army. For Rwanda is theircountry; it belongs equally  and unquestionably  to all ofits daughters and all its sons  with its limitations and itshistory  including this most recent tragedy which we mustall bear.Our Government has made the choice to act withtransparency. The unrestricted deployment of UNAMIRas well as other human rights observers should reassurethe world  and especially the refugees  of ourGovernment’s determination to respect the state of law.We urge the United Nations to contribute toeliminating all the obstacles to the return of refugees  andespecially to stop the violence in the camps against  inparticular  those who wish to return home  and to breakthe stranglehold exercised by the former army’s militiaand other perpetrators of genocide on the rest of thepeople. This is why we beseech the internationalcommunity to assist us in surmounting all the challengesentailed by the return of the refugees.Concrete steps have been taken  but much remainsto be done if the world is to be completely rid of theseweapons which in the past caused serious tensions invarious parts of the world that degenerated into armedconflicts.Even though the relaxation of East-West tensions hascontributed greatly to the resolution of certain conflicts particularly in Indo-China  Latin America and the MiddleEast  elsewhere - in the former Yugoslavia and someAfrican countries - the fires regrettably continue to burn.Rwanda fully supports the international community’sefforts to ensure compliance with commitments related tothe peaceful settlement of disputes and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of5mass destruction. Our country is a party to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and we reiterateour full dedication to the international community’s goalswith regard to disarmament and arms control.The attainment of these goals - eliminating the risk ofwar  limiting destruction in case of war  stopping war at anearly stage  strengthening international security in order toensure economic prosperity  channelling the funds freed asa result of disarmament towards the developing countries -will allow all nations to thrive.Although genuine progress has been made in the areaof disarmament  the new world order remains compromisedby the constantly growing gap between the poorer andricher countries.In the light of the two United Nations publications onthe world economic and social situation for the years 1993and 1994  current economic trends in the world point togloomy forecasts in the short and medium term  particularlyfor many third-world countries.The Rwandese delegation hopes that this forty-ninthsession will reaffirm the importance and the still currentvalidity of the Declaration on International EconomicCooperation  in particular the Revitalization of EconomicGrowth and of Development of the Developing Countries.We solemnly invite the forty-ninth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly to address thefundamental right to development  as stated in the ViennaDeclaration and adopted by the World Conference onHuman Rights  as well as the link between peace anddevelopment. Respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms and development are interdependent and mutuallyreinforcing. Rwanda and Africa as a whole look to thepromise of the establishment of the United Nations agendafor development and of the speedy implementation of theamendments proposed to the plan of action - amendmentswhich will undoubtedly enable us to restore the economiesof our countries.It is imperative for the United Nations - whose mainobjective remains the promotion of peace  security anddevelopment - to devote itself to activities in keeping withthe attainment of peace  security and development.In the fifty years since the signing of the SanFrancisco Charter  the world has undergone many changes.New Powers have arisen  the geopolitical map has shifted Africa and other third-world countries have emancipatedthemselves  the cold war has ended - hence we mustreassess our Organization to ensure that it can meet thenew challenges.It is in this context that Rwanda is concerned withthe demands of the new world geopolitical situation  aswell as with the new role assigned to the United Nationsto contribute to the advent of the new world order.In this connection  particular attention must be paidto the current restructuring of the United Nations system particularly of the Security Council.With regard to this very important organ of theUnited Nations system  the Rwandese delegationconsiders that membership  both permanent and non-permanent  should be expanded  with scrupulous attentionto equitable geographic representation and bearing inmind the desire to maintain efficiency.Similarly  the current restructuring of the UnitedNations system should allow small States to enjoy greatersecurity and to be able to occupy a seat on the SecurityCouncil without difficulty.One hopes that the new configuration of the SecurityCouncil will reflect the principle of equality among allMember States  and that this reform will respect the rulesof democracy and transparency.(spoke in English)May I conclude by stating before the community ofnations that members represent that the task we have setourselves is enormous  but the will and determination ofthe Rwandese people to build a new society isunflinching.To all those Rwandese who became victims of themachine of genocide and recent massacres  we share yourdeep wounds and reiterate our determination to bring theculprits to justice. To those Rwandese who were blindlymanipulated to join the bankrupt politics of division andsuppression  we call upon you to come back to yoursenses and join us in building a new society based ontolerance and reconciliation.To the international community  I pledge our resolveto ensure that never again shall Rwanda be a terrain onwhich is sown politics of denial of basic human rights toany of its citizens. Its role in helping us to pick up thepieces of the completely shattered fabric of our society6need not be emphasized. We share this moral duty  itbeing understood that the major part of the burden by farrests on the Rwandese people themselves."
"144",6050,"SAU",49,1994,"It is with pleasure that I begin this speech by conveying to you. Sir  our most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election not only reflects the trust placed in you personally but also bespeaks the regard of the international community for your country Cote d’Ivoire. We wish you success in the pursuit of your mission.I take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Samuel Insanally  on the effective manner in which he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its last session.I also wish to note the sincere efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to consolidate peace and to reduce the tensions that beset many parts of the world.It is with great pleasure. Sir  that I convey to you the best wishes of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud  and his hope that at this session the General Assembly will successfully deal with international developments  benefiting from the opportunities provided by the principles and other foundations upon which contemporary international relations rest.The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques has always been willing to play a positive role in the international arena  and to contribute to achieving our common goals of security  stability and prosperity. The principles and other foundations of our present international order derive their legitimacy and strength from the tenets of the United Nations Charter  which are inherent in international legality. The most important of these principles are:	respect	for	the	sovereignty andindependence of nations; the inviolability of international borders; the establishment of justice and equality between nations; rejection of the use of force in the settlement of conflicts; safeguarding human dignity; and ensuring security and prosperity for all mankind. Based on its adherence to Islamic shari'a  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to the principles of the United Nations Charter  and has endeavored throughout the Organization's history to implement those principles in practice.The Gulf Cooperation Council  whose current session my country has the honor of chairing  bases itself on the principles of the United Nations Charter. We are convinced that the international community's success in serving the cause of international peace and security will depend on the commitment by its members to the United Nations Charter and on the strength of their political will to apply the resolutions of international legality.While the firm unified international stand in confronting Iraq's aggression against the State of Kuwait in 1990 was vindicated when the aggression was reversed and international legality was restored  the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains unresolved. Serb aggression against the Bosnian people continues. This is because the aggression has not been dealt with in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the principles of international legality. It is incumbent upon this Organization  and in particular the Security Council  to move swiftly and effectively to demonstrate that aggression is bound to fail  whether in Kuwait  in Bosnia or in any other part of the world.Even a cursory glance at the current international situation would be sufficient to highlight the need for an effective United Nations role and for implementation of the Charter in order to deal with the chronic hotbeds of tension that are widespread and that continue to threaten security and stability in many parts of the world. This requires us to strengthen further the role of the United Nations as an effective vehicle for creating the proper conditions for world peace and stability.We in the Gulf Cooperation Council recognize the prominent role played by the Secretary-General in fashioning a new approach for the United Nations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international legality. We welcomed the Secretary- General's proposals in his ""An Agenda for Peace""  and we look forward to his agenda for development. The ideas contained in those two reports are bound to make an important contribution to the efforts of the General Assembly to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. Success in achieving this aim will rely to a great extent on the degree of support by Member States for the principles and principles of the United Nations. The most important of these are: the	maintenance ofinternational peace and security; peacemaking through the deterrence of aggression; the elimination of threats to the security  sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations; and the promotion of cooperation in the service of international development.Under the United Nations Charter  the Security Council  the body most directly concerned with the maintenance of international peace and security  has the primary responsibility for dealing with international problems. As we pursue reform of United Nations organs  it is therefore crucial that the Council be made more capable and better equipped to carry out its mandate under the Charter. The Gulf Cooperation Council attaches great importance to a number of regional and international issues. We greatly appreciated the important role played by the United Nations following the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. That role clearly reflected the international community's expectations regarding the responsibilities of the United Nations. It also highlighted the ability of the Security Council to confront aggression and reverse its effects. We hope that this solidarity will help guarantee that no repetition of this aggression can occur. This can be achieved only through complete and total implementation of all Security Council resolutions on the matter. The Iraqi Government continues to defy international legality and to attempt to deceive international public opinion through limited implementation of some of the requirements of Security Council resolutions 661 (1990) and 687 (1991) pertaining to the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The true objective of these Iraqi efforts is to circumvent Security Council resolutions  which contain a number of requirements accepted by the Iraqi Government and which together form an interrelated legal structure. In its last review of the sanctions imposed on Iraq  the Security Council decided to continue the application of those sanctions; this demonstrates that the efforts of the Iraqi Government to deceive the world community have not borne fruit.Iraq has yet to meet the essence of its obligations  which lies in full and irrevocable recognition of the State of Kuwait and of its borders. To do this it must officially accept Security Council resolution 833 (1993)  which demarcated the international borders between Kuwait and Iraq and provided international guarantees for those borders under the cease-fire agreements set out in Security Council resolution 687 (1991)  which was accepted by the Iraqi Government. And in view of the fact that the Iraqi Government has repeatedly violated its international and legal obligations  we feel it is necessary to insist that Iraq's recognition of Kuwait and its borders should be irrevocably stated  in conformity with the constitutional measures applied in Iraq and based on the international guarantees contained in the United Nations Security Council resolution 833 (1993). Furthermore  Iraq must comply with its commitment to release all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees. While we welcome Iraq's participation on the committee dealing with prisoners and detainees  we hope that its participation is a genuine attempt to settle this humanitarian issue and not merely a symbolic move to appease international public opinion.The Government of Iraq is also expected to pay full compensation for all the damage caused by its aggression. It must refrain from committing or sponsoring any acts of terrorism or subversion. All of the above requirements represent a series of interrelated international legal obligations  that must be complied with in their entirety.The States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  while reiterating their commitment to the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq  wish to voice their concern over the continuing suffering of the Iraqi people  the sole responsibility for which lies with the Iraqi Government which rejects the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991) which deal with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.The GCC States have actively participated in the Middle East peace process since its inception at the Madrid Peace Conference. The GCC States contributed to advancing the bilateral talks between the Arab States and Israel. They have also participated effectively in the multilateral talks. The Arab delegations' commitment to and participation in this process gave a clear indication of their sincere intention to work towards a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The multilateral talks are an integral part of the peace process launched in Madrid and complement the bilateral talks and not a substitute thereto.The signing of the Declaration of Principles between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli Government in Washington in 1993  raised hopeful expectations  since it represented the first step towards the achievement of a just and permanent settlement of the Palestinian problem. While the Gulf Cooperation Council notes with satisfaction the concrete progress made on the Palestinian-Israeli track and the important steps taken to expand Palestinian self-rule and to transfer institutions to the Palestinian National Authority  it calls upon the international community  and in particular on the co-sponsors of the peace process  the United States of America and the Russian Federation  to ensure that Israel places no more obstacles in the path of the Palestinian National Authority as it assumes its responsibilities.While we welcome the progress achieved on the Jordanian-Israeli track  we wish to voice our deep concern over the lack of clear progress in the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The issue of the occupied Golan Heights is clear and governed by the principles of respect for international borders. Security is not attained by the occupation of another nation's territory by force  but through the establishment of peace  which can only be realized in this situation by the total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. The Lebanese-Israeli track is governed by United Nations Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which clearly calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Lebanese territory. We call for the complete and unconditional implementation of the said resolution.The question of Al-Quds Al-Shareef is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict  and permanent peace cannot be achieved in the Middle East without a just settlement of this issue. The settlement must take into account the resolutions of international legality  and in particular United Nations Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which calls for Israeli withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967  and United Nations Security Council resolution 252 (1968) regarding Al-Quds Al-Shareef. Israel is thus required to refrain from taking any measures that would demographically change the status of the city of Al-Quds or prejudice future negotiations pertaining to its final status. Any permanent and comprehensive settlement must also address the issue of the return of Palestinian refugees and the issue of settlements erected by Israel in the occupied territories in violation of international law and the Geneva conventions.Concrete progress on the various bilateral tracks on the various aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict is bound to lead inevitably to similar progress with regard to the issues addressed in the multilateral talks and lay the groundwork for a just  comprehensive  and lasting peace in the Middle East.We in the GCC are convinced that the success of the Palestinian National Authority in implementing the Declaration of Principles depends on the support it receives from the Palestinian people  as well as on the political and economic support it receives from the international community. It was on the basis of this conviction that the GCC States participated in the international donors conference held in Washington  D C. in October of 1993 and pledged substantial financial assistance. The Gulf Cooperation Council States have also contributed financially to the establishment of a Palestinian police force and administration to enable it to assume its duties. We have also announced  along with our Arab brethren at the 102nd session of the League of Arab States  our full support for the Palestinian self-governing authority.In the context of their pursuit to help the Middle East region enjoy its legitimate share of security  peace and stability  the GCC States have focused great attention on efforts to rid the region of all weapons of mass destruction  whether nuclear  chemical or biological. To achieve this objective  we call on all countries in the region  including Israel  to refrain from producing  possessing or stockpiling any such weapons.The GCC States note with great concern the continued occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands - Abu Moussa  the Greater and Lesser Tumbs - by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The GCC States  motivated by a desire to have the best possible ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran  have repeatedly urged the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call of the United Arab Emirates to settle this problem by peaceful means through serious bilateral negotiations.The Government of Iran  however  has not responded to these calls so far. We therefore call for referring this matter to the International Court of Justice  which is responsible for settling disputes among nations.The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the plight of the Bosnian people is worsening as a result of the war of extermination and ethnic cleansing waged by the Serbian forces with the support of Serbia and Montenegro. In spite of the optimism generated by the Muslim-Croat agreement to establish a federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and their acceptance of the peace plan proposed by the international Contact Group  and welcomed by all of us the Serbian forces continue to challenge the international peace-keeping forces of the United Nations  in total disregard of United Nations resolutions. In so doing  the Serbian forces have been emboldened by the inability of the international community  and in particular the States of the European Community which have a special responsibility vis-a-vis this tragedy  to implement the necessary sanctions and impose the required punishment  to stop the Serb aggression. The Serb forces have rejected the proposed peace plan and escalated their attacks against Bosnia and Herzegovina  which makes it patently clear that their intention is to undermine all the peaceful efforts undertaken by the United Nations.We listened with keen interest to the speech by President Alija Izetbegovic  which gave a graphic description of the dangerous situation in his country. In the light of this we are concerned that the hasty adoption by the United Nations Security Council of its resolution 943 (1994)  which provides for relaxing the United Nations sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro  could preclude a just settlement and lead to rewarding the aggression. It is incumbent upon the international community  and the Security Council in particular  to take the necessary action to remedy this tragic situation. This action must include declaring the entirety of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven  and providing for the deployment of international observers equipped with a clear mandate  and sufficiently credible powers  in these safe havens and along the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They should also include the recognition of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Serbia and Montenegro before any consideration is given to the gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on them. United Nations forces must also protect the areas of safe haven and provide for their defense. The failure of the United Nations to provide the required protection for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes it necessary to lift the arms embargo so as to allow it to exercise its legitimate right to self-defense as enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.Somalia continues to be in the grip of a situation of instability and political chaos coupled with acts of violence and bloodshed. In spite of all the efforts deployed to extricate this nation from its plight  instability and lack of security still plague this troubled land. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which has tried on a number of occasions to contain the conflict in Somalia  to bring about national reconciliation between the various factions and which has provided humanitarian assistance and relief to the fraternal Somali people  calls upon all factions to listen to the voice of reason and logic  to put the interests of the Somali people above all else and to work towards national reconciliation.The feelings of optimism and jubilation triggered by the victory of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and the restoration of that country's independence and identity are now overshadowed by feelings of disappointment and bitterness as a result of the continued infighting between the various Mujahideen factions. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has endeavored  under the direction and guidance of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Fahd bin Abdulaziz  to put an end to the fratricide among our Afghani brethren. These efforts were crowned when all factions were assembled in 1993 at the House of God in Makkah  and an agreement was signed to restore unity  security and stability to the nation of Afghanistan. We continue to urge all factions of the Afghani Mujahideen immediately to put an end to the infighting by complying with the ""Makkah Agreement"" in letter and in spirit  so as to move in the direction of reconstruction and development and  thereby  to enable their nation to resume its proper place in the international community.The conflict over Jamu-Kashmir continues to cast its shadow over relations between the two neighbors  India and Pakistan  and represents one of the elements of instability in this part of the world. My Government continues to watch with concern the bloodshed there. We wish to voice the view that there is a need for a solution to this chronic problem. It has become clear that violence against the Kashmiri people  and the use of military force will achieve nothing but the further deterioration of the situation in Kashmir. It will also feed the flames of instability in the region. A peaceful solution to this problem lies in the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and in dialog and understanding. It is in that way that an end may be put to yet another hotbed of tension and instability in the world.Among the other conflicts in Central Asia  the conflict between two Member States of the United Nations  the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia  resulted at one stage in the occupation by Armenia of parts of Azerbaijan. As this occupation constitutes a violation of the principle of the inadmissibility of the use of force in the resolution of disputes  it is incumbent upon Armenian forces to withdraw from Azerbaijani territory and to transfer this issue to the negotiating table for the purpose of arriving at a peaceful and just settlement which would safeguard the legitimate rights of the Azerbaijani people.Such a review of the hotbeds of tension and crises in our world must not cause us to lose sight of the important and positive developments which the world witnessed over the past decade and which should give us cause for hope in a better future for mankind. We continue to have great expectations as a result of the positive developments in the aftermath of the cold war  and the emergence of solutions to pressing problems in Cambodia  the Middle East and Northern Ireland. The historic change in South Africa has brought down the curtain on the system of apartheid and brought forth a new South Africa based on justice and equality. We welcome these positive developments which are bound to contribute to the strengthening of the international tendency to move towards compliance with the principles of international law  respect for the resolutions of international legality  the renunciation of the use of force in favorfavor of dialog as a means for resolving problems and disputes.A general overview of international economic issues and the role played by the United Nations to strengthen international cooperation shows that the success of the Organization in dealing with economic issues and promoting international development  is also tied to the commitment of its Members to the United Nations Charter.The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is a commendable example of the international community's success in addressing a number of sensitive issues with unprecedented results. We are witnessing the emergence of the World Trade Organization  which we hope will embody our vision of an institutionalized global economic system. The Marakesh conference of the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has succeeded in fulfilling the aims of the Bretton Woods Conference.While we appreciate this important development  we must state our concerns over the increase in protectionism and the resulting tensions between trading partners. This development contradicts the premises of the Uruguay Round regarding the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs in a manner which allows nations to benefit from comparative advantages and from the optimal utilization of resources. This can only be achieved through serious international efforts to ensure free trade. We also wish to state our concern over the increase in protectionism in the guise of protecting the environment  and in particular the increased taxation on petroleum.At this point  I wish to emphasize the importance the Gulf Cooperation Council attaches to the protection of the environment  which is reflected in the adoption by our emerging industries of the highest standards of environmental protection. We are concerned that petroleum  which is our principal export commodity  is already heavily burdened by taxation  and yet it is now being targeted for further taxation while other  more polluting fuels are receiving subsidies from Governments. Coal is a case in point: according to studies published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Energy Agency  coal subsidies in industrial States amount to more than twice the cost of comparable energy provided by imported petroleum. Furthermore  according to the same sources  tax reforms that take into consideration the carbon content of fuel could produce more than double the reduction incarbon dioxide emissions targeted by the proposed carbon taxes without further taxation on petroleum.We  the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council  are convinced that imposing additional taxes on petroleum will not contribute to the environment but will instead distort international trade. This would adversely affect not only the economies of oil-exporting nations  but also those of oil-importing nations. It would also undermine the development efforts of developing countries.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sister States in the Gulf Cooperation Council have great respect for the United Nations Charter  for international legality and for the resolutions deriving therefrom. We have not  and will not  hesitate to work towards strengthening the role of the United Nations and enhancing its effectiveness to ensure international peace and security and promote international cooperation. We hope with all sincerity that all other Member States will share this view when dealing with the various issues before the Assembly at this session.We are confident that the opportunity to achieve success still remains before us and that what is required is to heed the words of God Almighty:""And say work; and soon Allah will observe yourwork  and his messenger  and the believer""."
"145",6087,"SDN",49,1994,"I salute Ambassador Essy and warmly congratulate him onhis unanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at this session. I express our happiness and thatof the sons of Africa on his assumption of that importantpost. It is our hope that during his term of office Africaand the whole of the international community will achievethe development and the consolidation of peace and securityto which our peoples aspire.I wish also to convey our compliments to Mr. SamuelInsanally of Guyana on his exemplary and able leadershipduring his presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.I should also like to salute the Secretary-General forhis tireless effort as leader of the Organization; we wishhim all success.On this occasion it is my pleasure to welcome thereturn of the sister Republic of South Africa to theinternational community as a democratic country  that isnow free from apartheid and that is governed by its ownnational will  to participate effectively in the developmentof Africa and of the world at large. In welcoming SouthAfrica  I reiterate our continued support for its people  justas we were devoted to their cause during the struggle forthe eradication of apartheid.Indeed  it is the destiny of people committed to thedefence of their freedom to have their will tested. That isexactly the fate of the people of Sudan which  since theNational Salvation Revolution came to power has decidedto have an independent voice in all regional andinternational forums on all issues and in all fields  inspiredby its principles based on its cultural heritage and itsregional and international affiliations.I have the honour of briefing the Assembly on anumber of the accomplishments my Government hasachieved despite the obstacles it has faced owing to itsadherence to the cultural choice of the Sudanese people.The Government of the National Salvation Revolutioninherited armed discord in the South  with all itsconsequences. From the start  it accorded the highestpriority to the achievement of a peaceful  negotiated  justand lasting settlement. It is the conviction of myGovernment that only a permanent solution will beacceptable to the people. During its five years in power the Government has engaged in a number of peace talkswith the rebel movement. These have taken placesuccessively in Addis Ababa  Nairobi and twice in Abuja;recently there have been four rounds of talks in Nairobi.The talks have taken place with the help of neighboursand brethren who share our belief that it is the sons ofAfrica who can find suitable solutions to Africa’sproblems. The Government  with earnest determinationto ensure the success of the peace talks  proposed a newmechanism to expedite the peace process. This calls forthe dispatch of personal envoys of the Presidents of themediating countries to engage in shuttle diplomacybetween the Government and the rebel movement.My Government  which is anxious to reach a justand lasting solution  not only entered into negotiations but has also adopted the federal system of governmentthat had long been called for by the southern Sudanese.It implemented the formula of power sharing and thesharing of wealth in the framework of Federalism. Asregards the relationship between religion and State  theGovernment proposed a formula that would enable themajority to choose whatever suits its cultural heritage without infringement on the rights of the rest of thepopulation  ultimately bearing in mind the need to respectevery citizen’s equal rights and the cultural diversity thatcharacterizes the Sudan and of which we are so proud.That is why the southern Sudan  where the majority isnon-Muslim  has been exempted from the application ofIslamic law.Given its conviction that those who joined the ranksof the rebellion and those who happen to live in therebel-held areas are Sudanese citizens who deserve  andare entitled to enjoy fully all their rights  the Governmentsigned the Operation Life-Line Sudan III Agreement toensure the delivery of food and medicines to whoever wasin need. Officials of the United Nations were candid andsincere when they described Operation Life-Line Sudanas unprecedented world wide. The allegation that the root32causes of the war in southern Sudan are religious or ethnicis refuted by the fact that the majority of displaced personsmoved northwards and to the national capital  while only afew migrated out of the country.Citizens of the south who had suffered the ravages ofthe lengthy war in the south took the initiative of conveningthe Juba Conference in May 1994. That Conference wasalso attended by a number of foreign Ambassadorsaccredited to the Sudan. Those who represented the southat that Conference reiterated the unity of the country andcategorically rejected the isolated agenda of the rebelswhich aims at fragmenting the country.Nations manifest wisdom when  in quest of nationalidentity and in search for an effective system ofGovernment that best suits their special conditions andhistorical background  they draw inspiration from their ownheritage. Our people have found this in the application ofthe shura  or consultation  as a system of Government toensure the universality of opinions free from the tribal andsectorial fanaticism that causes disunity amongst the sonsof the nation. This principle is exercised without atyrannical authority that deprives them of their will. Theshura is the overall vessel for political  developmental andsocial endeavour. To put the shura into practice  thePermanent Electoral Commission was founded inconformity with the electoral law enacted by theTransitional National Assembly  which is composed ofneutral personalities of professional integrity. Voterregistration was introduced to ensure an atmosphereconducive to fair and genuine elections that are scheduledto take place early next year  after the full participation ofall the people is secured.To enable all strata of the population to participateeffectively in administering and organizing themselves developing their resources and enjoying all their rights  thecentral power made way for 26 State Governments withinthe framework of the federal system. This minimization ofthe administrative authority was aimed at achieving theadvancement and welfare of the country through thedevelopment of its States.Our belief that almighty Allah elevated the human raceabove all other species is our guiding principle in the areaof human rights. My Government has translated that beliefinto action in all areas. In order to ensure the effectiveenjoyment by all citizens of their human rights  theGovernment established the Supreme Council for HumanRights and bestowed upon it full constitutional liberty. Itsecured the freedom of the judiciary and protected it againstinterference by the political authority. The justice systemwas reformed to guarantee freedom of litigation  equityand rule of law.The Government of the National SalvationRevolution strengthened the role of women in the Sudanand upheld all their rights. It enabled women to occupyhigh constitutional  judicial  political and economic posts while also upholding their social rights. Today  womenrepresent 50 per cent of the labour force in Governmentoffices  where they perform very ably. Statistics of theMinistry of Education revealed that 60 per cent of thestudents enrolled in universities and institutions of highereducation are female.The best example of the confidence of theGovernment in its performance in the area of humanrights is the fact that it opened its doors wide forrepresentatives of European Parliaments  including theBritish House of Commons and House of Lords  theItalian Parliament  and the United States Congress. Inaddition  human rights organizations  religiousassociations and other dignitaries have visited the country especially those areas where abuses of human rights werealleged to have taken place.As a manifestation of our tolerance  our country iscurrently hosting the Inter-Religion Dialogue Conference in which Muslim and Christian scholars from differentparts of the world are participating. This Conference isaimed at the enhancement of tolerance and peacefulcoexistence between religions in any one geographicalarea. The purpose is also to prove that religion is not  asalleged by others  mere fanaticism. The Conference isbased on the mutual conviction that ethics and morals arethe best guides for individuals and peoples. In thisregard  I would like to point out that the presentConference is the sequel of a previous one that wasconvened in Sudan two years ago  after which inter-religion dialogue continued inside and outside the Sudan.After this brief account  the Assembly may agreewith me that reports of violations of human rights in theSudan are nothing but malicious applications of politicalpressure to deter the Sudan from exercising its freedomto make its own decision and holding on to its culturaloptions. I need not state that those who continue to levelbaseless accusations against Sudan have not produced anyevidence whatsoever to support their allegations. This  asI said earlier  seems to be the lot of all nations thatchoose their own way.33Those who make unfounded allegations that Sudanharbours terrorism have not produced a single shred ofevidence to prove it. They never expected that Sudanwould prove its innocence by capturing the most dangerousand most wanted terrorist in history: Carlos  the Jackal.Guided by standards of conduct that condemn violence andbloodshed  and in accordance with its adherence tointernational conventions and ethical ideals  Sudan arrestedthat terrorist. By virtue of our doctrine of transparency andopenness  the doors of our country will remain wide openfor whoever wishes to see for himself that no terrorism isharboured in the Sudan.The rebel movement  which was hatched outsideSudan  has kept changing its skin  with differentprogrammes and ideologies  in order to gain support.Unfortunately  up to now the rebellion has received moral material and military support from those who do not wantthe Sudan to enjoy its freedom of decision. The rebellionthus became a pliant tool in the futile attempts to subjugatethe Sudan. The rebel leaders made themselves warlords indifferent to the plight of their own people and the bloodthey continue to shed. Before the eyes of internationalcommunity  the rebels commit the worst and atrociouskinds of violation of human rights: attacking andcommandeering relief barges and trains  killing reliefworkers  looting villages and abducting men and children.Leaders of the rebellion are now launching a repugnantliquidation of their opponents in the ranks of the rebelmovement. As proof of its defeat  very large numbers ofreturnees from the rebel movement came back home convinced that it lacked a proper objective and that it hadfallen prey to the influence of foreign powers.The crime of our time was that which was committedin the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Northern Kenya  whichaccommodates children who are Sudanese refugees. TheGarang faction kidnapped 5 000 children at gunpoint to jointheir ranks  undeterred by conscience or respect for theinternational covenants that govern the status of refugeesand provide for their protection. To our surprise  this crimewas met with indifference from the internationalcommunity  which did nothing to ensure the return of thosechildren to their families. From this rostrum we call uponall international agencies  the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committeeof the Red Cross to condemn this crime in the strongestpossible terms and to work effectively and decisively to putan end to the plight of those children and to work to reunitethem with their families in the Sudan as soon as ispracticable.The relationship of the Sudan with the UnitedNations has continued to exist on a basis of constructivecooperation. Within the scope of such cooperation productive developmental schemes and child-care projectshave been set up  in addition to the humanitarianoperations under the auspices of the Department ofHumanitarian Affairs and the appointment of a specialenvoy who played an effective role in coordinatinghumanitarian efforts. The United Nations alsosuccessfully raised from the donor community resourcesequivalent to 60 per cent of the required finances ofOperation Life Line for 1994.While we recall such positive achievements  we mustalso refer to certain negative aspects that accompaniedthat cooperation. In the field of relief distribution underOperation Life Line  statistics have confirmed that thegreater portion of relief is directed to the rebel-held areas which represent less than 10 per cent of the area ofSouthern Sudan  a situation which must be rectified.Also  while we appreciate the valuable role ofnon-governmental organizations working in thehumanitarian field  it is relevant to underline the negativeactivities of some of them  which go so far as to violatethe national sovereignty of Sudan  and provide support tothe rebels  thus prolonging the war and adding to thesuffering and distress of our people.As we look forward to the forthcoming celebrationsof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  we mustrecall that its inception was a product of a humanawakening  following two destructive world wars thatcaused devastation to mankind and the environment  andcrippled the progress of humanity. At a time when theuse of military power was the sole means to expandpolitical and economic influence  the establishment of theOrganization represented a hope for humanity toovercome its destructive tendencies  which were spurredby the possession of nuclear weapons and weapons ofmass destruction  and to strive for the horizons of peaceand development.It was saddening that the human awakening whichculminated in the inception of the Organization wasfollowed by a Cold War that continued until the 1990s.As a result  huge resources were drained away instead ofbeing invested in the areas of peace and development. Itis also saddening that the mentality of the Cold War stillprevails in what is conceived as a clash of civilizations.34It has been wrongly believed that the disappearance of oneenemy must be followed by the creation of a new one in anattempt to keep the cycle of war and conflict going. Whilethe world witnesses the emergence of new States and thedecline of apartheid  some are still trapped in that erroneousconception  which has given rise to various regionaltensions  such as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina andRwanda. Racial discrimination and xenophobia haveincreased in a number of western countries; the exodus ofrefugees and the flow of displaced persons continues.In the economic arena  and despite the world’s drivetowards a free-market economy we have neverthelesswitnessed a deterioration in economic and socialinfrastructures  especially in the developing countries. Thisdeterioration is a direct result of the unfair practices andcriteria that still plague international economic relations.Contributions by wealthier States and international financialinstitutions to assist developing countries have severelydecreased; selective non-economic conditions are oftenimposed in dealing with the developing countries.Moreover  economic performance is no longer the criterionthat is taken into account. Political considerations havebecome the sole basis of cooperation with the lendingStates and institutions.The problems of indebtedness and debt servicingcontinue to represent a huge burden on debtor States and inparticular  the least developed countries. The debt problemremains unresolved because the creditors insist on imposingconditions that related more to the political stances of thedebtor States and therefore  selectivity was resorted to inresolving the debt problem. We call upon this august bodyto adopt the resolutions and recommendations of the Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting held last August inJakarta  Indonesia  on resolving the debt problems ofdeveloping countries. The partial remission of debts is theappropriate starting point to resolve the debt problem instead of the re-scheduling process  which has alreadycontributed to multiplying the amount of debt service inexcess of the principal.The objective of establishing regional economicgroupings is to contribute to the creation of a free flow oftrade  investments and technology across national bordersand the integrated trading groups. The scale ofdevelopment in all countries  especially the developingcountries  must be stepped up and the politics ofprotectionism practised by the major Powers vis-à-visdeveloping countries for political reasons must end.When we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  we hope that the Organization will attaintangible achievements in eliminating the political economic  social and humanitarian distortions thatinfluence the international arena. Such achievements canbe attained only by translating the principles andobjectives of the Charter into real terms that reflect thevalues of justice  equality  and full participation by allMember States in creating a better future.In order to achieve such goals  the democratizationof the United Nations and all its organs must beaccomplished. According to the Charter  the GeneralAssembly has a role to play on an equal footing with theSecurity Council in the maintenance of international peaceand security  as well as in supervising the performance ofother organs of the Organization.Just as we fully support the call for increasing themembership of the Security Council to ensure theequitable representation of all geographic and politicalgroups in the Council  we also call for a reconsiderationof geographical representation by allowing Africa  Asiaand Latin America more opportunities to have permanentseats on the Council. We also call for the completeabolition of the veto power  as it contradicts all theprinciples of democracy and maintains the hegemony ofthe minority.Furthermore  we note a lack of transparency in thefunctioning of the Security Council  and believe that mostMember States are often unable to follow its work.While we appreciate the efforts made to improve theperformance of the Council  its persistent practice ofholding intensive informal consultations marginalizes therole of the majority of Member States in the maintenanceof international peace and security. Accordingly  rules ofprocedure regulating the Council’s procedures must beestablished to provide for a fair and objective guaranteeof the existence of the required transparency.As regards the Council’s resolutions  it is regrettablethat the practice of double standards and selectivity  asreflected in its resolutions and their implementation  hasgreatly affected its credibility  a problem which we hopewill be resolved.The Economic and Social Council  as a guardian ofeconomic and social rights should take more interest inmaintaining the right balance between political andeconomic rights in its resolutions and decisions  whichhave become more inclined towards political rights in35spite of the Vienna Declaration  which considered the rightto development a basic human right.The peace process has already started in the MiddleEast. In order for that process to reach the desired goals the peace that is hoped for in the regional should be basedon the pillars of justice and equality and the attainment bythe Palestinian people of all their rights and the withdrawalfrom the territories occupied in 1967. The withdrawal fromthe Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon should becarried out in full implementation of Security CouncilResolution 425 (1978). The withdrawal from Jerusalemand all the other occupied Arab territories will remaincritical in determining the real Israeli intention to establisha just and lasting peace.The recent conflict in the sisterly state of Yemenended with the victory of constitutional legality  whichpreserved the unity of Yemen; this incident should lead usto stress the need to refrain from intervention in the internalaffairs of other States that might find themselves in similarcircumstances.With regard to Somalia  which faces enormous hurdlesand internecine killings  we call upon all parties to heed thevoice of reason and to work together for the attainment ofa national reconciliation that would enable Somalia toresume the role destined for it at the regional andinternational levels.We must also pause here to consider the suffering ofthe Iraqi people  which is worsening as a result of theembargo imposed on it even though it has been admittedthat Iraq has shown full cooperation in implementing therelevant Security Council resolutions. We call for thelifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq as soon as possibleand we urge the members of the Security Council to renewtheir consideration of this issue.As regards the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  we aresurprised by the continuation of sanctions in spite of all thepractical proposals made by the Jamahiriya  through theLeague of Arab states  in order to finalize its dispute withsome Western countries over the Lockerbie incident in areasonable manner. The aforementioned treatment of Libyalacks any legal and humanitarian justification.The Bosnian peoples’ tragedy continues to be ashameful blot the face of humanity. Factors of religiousbias have greatly contributed to the creation and escalationof the Bosnian tragedy.As for the Security Council  it has pursued a clearpolicy of double standards in the case of Bosnia andHerzegovena. Not only did the Security Council rewardthe aggressors by granting them territories they do notown  but it has deprived the Bosnians of their legitimateright to self-defence as enshrined in the United NationsCharter  through an arms-embargo resolution. Bosnia andHerzegovena did not declare an intention to acquire thelands of others  but only wanted to defend itself and itspeople against aggression.As I conclude my statement  I should like to posequestions which  I believe  that are relevant to ourpreparations for celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations and the International Decade of Tolerance.Are we prepared to abandon the unilateral approach to thetackling of problems of international relations? Are weready to recognize now that this world accommodates usas distinct and diverse peoples and civilizations coexistingwith one another?It is our opinion that fostering regional andinternational peace and security does not mean theomission of the underlying causes of tension. Equally comprehensive development does not mean theentrenchment of the unfair economic and technologicalpractices existing in today’s world. Furthermore democracy in our opinion does not mean the impositionof the western model of democracy alone and omission ofother peoples’ practices and civilizations in the field ofgovernance and systems of government. Moreover universality of sovereignty does not mean disregard forthe national and geographic sovereignty of States. Also the universality of human rights  which enjoys our respectand commitment  does not necessarily mean cancellationof the religious beliefs of peoples and their moral values.In brief  the principles and values adopted by any onesociety are not necessarily or definitely fit for applicationby all other societies. By applying such a unilateralperspective  we will deprive civilization of the benefits ofdiversity and from its productive legacy and we will assuch deprive peoples of their right to opt for the politicalmodels and social conduct that are more compatible withtheir aspirations. Otherwise  we would only compound anew phase of undesired cultural conflicts and tensions.Let us turn a new leaf in international relations thatwould be founded on the rejection of conflict andconfrontation  based on the principles of mutual respectand non-interference in the affairs of others  withoutextremism  bias or radicalism.36In conclusion  let our deeds speak louder than ourwords in building up the tolerance with which we prepareto commence the international decade  and let us extendthis it to embrace all aspects of politics  thought economics  culture  and religion."
"146",6132,"SEN",49,1994,"The international community is meeting once again assembling the great diversity of the nations which are itsmembers  to consider the state of the world and to chart thepaths of progress for the 12 months that lie ahead.We give thanks to God for having inspired thedelegations here present in their choice of His ExcellencyMr. Amara Essy  Minister of Foreign Affairs of the sisterlyand friendly Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  as President of theAssembly at this session. His election is both an honour tohim personally and a tribute to his country inasmuch as theworld recognizes and acknowledges the great dedication ofCôte d’Ivoire to everything affecting peace andunderstanding among people. It does so thanks to thevision of the late President Houphouët-Boigny  whichcontinues to be carried on by his illustrious successor President Henri Konan Bédié.The personal joy and pride which I feel concerninghim as our friend and brother is shared by my entiredelegation as well as in Senegal which  since timeimmemorial  has had numerous ties of friendship andcooperation with Côte d’Ivoire. Hence  theacknowledgement of his merits by the internationalcommunity was received and hailed in Senegal with thesame intensity as in Côte d’Ivoire. The President can counton the support of the delegation of Senegal to contribute tothe success of his mission. The warmth of thecongratulations we extend to him today is equalled by thepride which we feel at seeing him preside over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.We pay a tribute to his predecessor  the PermanentRepresentative of Guyana  Ambassador Insanally  for theskill and authority with which he guided the work of theAssembly at its forty-eighth session.I should like also to repeat our gratitude to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for theenergy and dedication which he continues to devote to hisoutstanding mission at the head of our Organization  amission which he is carrying out with the same efficiencyin an ever more difficult global context.Finally  allow me to thank delegations for theunanimous decision to elect the Permanent Representativeof Senegal to the United Nations  Mr. Kéba Birane Cissé one of our most outstanding diplomats  as Chairman ofthe Third Committee. In so doing this mission isentrusted to Senegal  whose dedication to human rightsand to the other areas falling within the competence ofthis important Committee  is known to all. Mr. Cissé andall of us intend to dedicate ourselves fully  together withthe other countries represented here  to ensure that thework of the Third Committee is crowned with success.If there are years which the history of the worldcannot ignore  the twelve-month period that has justelapsed is doubtless among them. It has been extremelyrich in events of great political significance characterizedby the positive developments of the situation in SouthAfrica which saw the end of apartheid and which  only afew months ago  saw the advent of a democratic Power.It was also a period marked by the political andpsychological upheavals that have taken place in Arab-Israeli relations. In this context  we are gratified to seeSouth Africa now occupying its rightful place in thefamily of nations.The truth always wins in the end. It is in the nameof that inevitable reality - which is the token of theultimate objective of just causes - that the chronicproblem of the Middle East - at the heart of which is thequestion of Palestine - has  since the Declaration ofPrinciples of 13 September 1993 in Washington  seendevelopments marked by the continued collapse ofimportant panels of that psychological wall that has solong divided Arabs and Israelis.Thus  in the region which was the cradle of thesublime spiritual messages of the religions of the Book such developments now justify hope - the hope of finallyseeing the creation of a space for lasting coexistencebetween Israelis and Palestinians  between Israel and theArab countries  with genuine respect for the inalienablerights of the peoples and States of the entire region.They justify the hope of seeing the establishment between those States and peoples  of cooperation at allpossible levels  to manage  together  their vital supportsystems.It is only fitting that in mentioning those hopes wepay a tribute to all those involved in this positivedevelopment whose efforts have made possible theopening of this new window of opportunity on theconflict in the Middle East  especially the Palestinian andIsraeli leaders who  thanks to their political courage andsense of history  finally agreed to set out on this pathtowards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.21In again expressing to His Excellency President YasserArafat Senegal’s support and admiration for the courageand political farsightedness which led him to keep a firmgrip on that olive branch of which he spoke here in 1974 I should like on behalf of Senegal to formulate the hopethat as he takes the additional steps necessary to reach anoverall solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict all the otheraspects of this matter will be dealt with in accordance withthe positive trend of present developments  and that asettlement will be reached in keeping with the relevantresolutions of the Security Council.We also wish wholeheartedly to extend thesecongratulations and expressions of encouragement to theIsraeli Prime Minister  His Excellency Mr. Yitzak Rabin and to his Minister of Foreign Affairs  Mr. Shimon Peres for their sustained efforts to achieve a settlement of theMiddle East crisis. Such efforts must be pursued  steppedup and encouraged.However  the past year  although marked by suchpositive and historic events  was not free from reasons forconcern and even  at times  despair. Indeed  despite ourconstantly renewed efforts  a number of conflicts persistand are even sometimes becoming mired down in scenes ofhorror we had hoped never against to witness.From Angola to Bosnia and Herzegovina  from Liberiato Somalia  and recently in Rwanda  we have received theechoes and images and witnessed the piercing horror ofpersistent crisis situations that leave us no choice other thanto continue doggedly to strive for dialogue and concertedaction to find lasting solutions based on equity  based onjustice  based on law and based on the unshakeable will tolive finally in peace in a community made up of humanbeings.In the conflict situations on the African continent today  more than ever before  machinery for the prevention management and settlement of African conflicts must beimplemented through respect for the various peaceagreements that have been signed among factions that are sadly  continuing to kill each other; our continent of Africamust be committed once and for all to the only battle worththe candle  namely  the battle for democratic developmentand the advancement of human rights.The Organization of African Unity (OAU) hasdedicated itself to this task  and it has done so persistentlyand courageously. Today  it needs the support of the wholeof the international community.The question of Angola must be peacefully andfinally resolved in the spirit of the Lusaka negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations. After havinghailed the meritorious efforts undertaken by theauthorities in Luanda  we must launch another strong andconcrete appeal to UNITA to allow peace finally to reignin Angola.In connection with the problems in Somalia andRwanda  I should like to recall certain specific factsconcerning the position that my country  Senegal  hastaken on these questions of such concern to everyone.In Somalia  the peace so long sought by theinternational community can obviously come about onlythrough an overall political settlement that would dealwith all aspects of that fratricidal conflict. Moreover because he understood this at a very early stage  HisExcellency President Abdou Diouf - then the Chairman ofthe OAU  and also in his capacity of President of theSixth Summit Meeting of the Organization of the IslamicConference - speaking from this rostrum in 1992  putforward the idea of convening an international conferencedevoted to Somalia. The General Assembly at that timeresponded to the appeal by the Senegalese Head of Stateby adopting a resolution to that effect that is still highlyrelevant. Given the persistence of the problem ofSomalia  which today seems more than ever likely to takeanother tragic turn  it would appear that the time hascome to re-examine that initiative.In Rwanda  a human tragedy on a virtuallyunprecedented scale took place following the events oflast April. In this connection  I should like to note thatour country has been actively involved in the search fora solution to this conflict since 1992. Indeed  PresidentAbdou Diouf  then the Chairman of the OAU  presidedover the lengthy negotiations that culminated in theArusha Agreements. In addition  officers from theSenegalese national army were part of the Group ofNeutral Military Observers of the OAU entrusted withsupervising the cease-fire  a group that was as we knowreplaced in 1993  with the signature of the ArushaAgreements  by the United Nations Assistance Missionfor Rwanda (UNAMIR)  in which Senegal hasparticipated and continues to participate.Thus  it was quite natural that on 22 June of thisyear  faced with the inadmissible continuing massacre ofcivilians  the Security Council adopted resolution 929(1994)  which established a multinational force for22humanitarian purposes  and that Senegal decided toparticipate in it.With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina  need werecall that this is a United Nations Member State to whoseterritorial integrity and sovereignty the internationalcommunity is committed. This places full responsibility onthe community of nations  gathered together here  to settlethe conflict after identifying the aggressor.However  it is as though the Bosnian Serbs had beenactually authorized to defy with impunity and in an ongoingfashion the expressed will of the international community.The attacks against the personnel of the United NationsProtection Force (UNPROFOR)  the repeated violations ofsecurity zones  the rejection of the latest peace planproposed by the Contact Group of five Western countries are all part of a pattern of confrontation with which theinternational community must finally deal  firmly and withdetermination.In this connection  we believe that the adoption on 23September 1994 of Security Council resolution 943 (1994) which suspended the economic sanctions against the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)  is notonly premature but untimely  given the deterioration in thesituation.It is our opinion  one shared by the majority of Stateshere present  that the sanctions should be  if notstrengthened  at least maintained until favourable conditionshave been created - that is  the establishment of an effectivesystem of international monitoring of the border betweenSerbia and Montenegro  on the one hand  and the territoriesoccupied by the Bosnian Serbs  on the other; the lifting ofthe siege of Sarajevo; the sincere commitment by theBosnian Serbs to cooperate in reaching a comprehensivepolitical settlement of the crisis; the lifting  where theBosnian Government is concerned  of the arms embargoimposed by Security Council resolution 713 (1991) in orderto restore to Bosnia and Herzegovina the means for its self-defence as set forth in Article 51 of the United NationsCharter.It is also important that the international communitydedicate itself to the reconstruction of Bosnia andHerzegovina  a country that is today being battered anddevastated by blatant aggression.In our view  those measures represent the minimumwe should expect from the international community in orderto give credibility to the peace process being pursued inBosnia and Herzegovina. On this delicate issue  Senegal whose Head of State is also the current President of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  will continue toact within the framework of international law to ensurethat the Bosnian people  finally reconciled amongthemselves  may know lasting peace based on an equalityof rights and duties among its various components.The economic problems today are of such amagnitude that a new concept of world security has beengenerated. Today  indeed  the feeling of insecurityemanates more often from the vicissitudes of daily lifethan from any fear of global cataclysm. That is theconclusion reached in this year’s report by the UnitedNations Development Programme on human development.Job security  health security and environmentalsecurity are the forms that the global problem of securitytakes today. This development naturally raises thequestion of the definition of a new ""social pact""  whichmust give further priority to human solidarity - solidarityamong the communities of men - and it demonstrates thegreat importance that Senegal attaches to the Summit onsocial development that is to be held in Copenhagen nextMarch. On that occasion we shall have to restructure ourthinking about development  and it will be necessary tohighlight better the human aspect of development basedon greater international solidarity.It was in this spirit that  here on 30 September 1992 Senegal’s Head of State proposed to the internationalcommunity the conclusion of a general agreement onsolidarity - a gentlemen’s agreement on solidarity. It isa positive thing that this proposal has been largely takenon board in the United Nations Secretary-General’soutline  Agenda for Development  which is designed topromote a genuine culture of development that will takeinto account all aspects of the human condition.For the same reasons Senegal welcomes warmly thereforms of United Nations bodies that are under way - inparticular  those bodies that are responsible for questionsof economic and social development.We favour the formula ""Trade  not aid""  which hasoften been used to indicate that global trade is thegenuine driving force for economic progress - more sothan aid for development. It is beneficial that  alongthese lines  on 15 April last  in Marrakesh in theKingdom of Morocco  the representatives of 126 countriessigned the agreement that created the World TradeOrganization (WTO).23We hope that the birth of the WTO represents thecompletion of the structure that was conceived half acentury ago in Bretton Woods as international trade hasbeen raised to the same status as monetary policy andfinance for development. Thus  the Marrakesh Final Actopens the way for a new dynamic of concerted action  ofconsultation and solidarity  that will finally allow for thepromotion of a more just and more balanced systemdesigned to govern international trade.If it is to do so  its practical application will have toinvolve integration of the specific needs and specificproblems of the group of developing countries - such asgreater justice in the definition and application of newmachinery designed to govern international trade; regionaleconomic integration; immigration policies; professionaltraining; job creation; and the transfer of technologies tomeet the needs and aspirations of the countries of theSouth.In this regard  I must mention an event of greatimportance: the adoption  in Paris on 18 June 1994  of theInternational Convention to Combat Desertification inThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification  Particularly in Africa. Many of us hererepresent those countries.This is the outcome  in terms of action  of one of themajor recommendations to emerge from the United NationsConference on Environment and Development. As aninitiator of the Convention  our continent - Africa - cannotbut welcome the conclusion of this multilateral legalinstrument  which recognizes the existence of such aworrying environmental problem.It is desirable that there should be available to thisConvention  as to others of the same type  sufficientfinancial resources to enable it to halt and reverse theprocess of desertification  which is a real scourge for theAfrican continent.The changes of considerable scope that have takenplace on the world stage over the past few years confrontthe United Nations with new challenges and new missions.For example  how can the Organization deal with identityclaims  domestic difficulties and civil wars while respectingthe principle of the sovereignty of States  which is thecornerstone of the San Francisco Charter?In what way can it - must it - react when individualsand groups perpetrate all types of serious violations offundamental human rights  as happens in the case of theconflicts that prevail in the former Yugoslavia  Angola Somalia and Rwanda? What barriers can be erectedagainst terrorism and civil war in order to cope with thefragmentation of State entities  which are factors forpeace? In these difficult areas  as in others  ourOrganization will have to demonstrate its ability toengage in innovation and adaptation.The establishment of an international Tribunal todeal with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia; the planto set up an international criminal court; the deliberation begun last year  on reform of the Security Council and onbetter implementation of Chapter VIII of the Charter -these all demonstrate that the United Nations hascommitted itself firmly to that course.As regards the Security Council in particular  thereform that is envisaged should be carried out withconcern simultaneously for efficiency in the functioningof this body and for real representativeness in keepingwith the new realities of the world.The changes that have taken place in the worldduring the last few years have as their essence thefundamental aspiration of peoples to freedom  justice anddevelopment in a spirit of human solidarity. If it is tolast  the wind of democratization that they have created atthe national level requires parallel action at theinternational level. Indeed  we must all ensure the equalparticipation of all States in the establishment of newnorms that can give international life a more solidfoundation and provide better security for all. Suchsecurity can be founded only on shared confidence in theprinciples that govern our collective contribution to abetter future for the world - to the salvation of mankind.Therefore  on the eve of the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of our Organization  let us  hand inhand in a spirit of friendship and solidarity  behave insuch a way that the new era will shine with the radianceof justice  peace and solidarity so that we may bequeathto future generations a world of peace  justice andfriendship."
"147",6179,"SGP",49,1994,"First  it gives me greatpleasure to congratulate the President on his unanimouselection. Like other colleagues who have preceded me I am confident that he will guide us through this sessioneffectively. Allow me also to place on record ourappreciation for his predecessor  Ambassador Insanally who presided over a very hectic and productive session.The end of the cold war has not led us to the end ofconflicts. Instead  it has given rise to many internecine intra-State ethnic and religious conflicts  bringingdestruction  chaos and suffering in their wake. With themajor Powers preoccupied with their domestic economic political  social and other problems  the world has had nochoice but to turn to the United Nations for help. Firstly there is no alternative. Secondly  there is the expectationthat  freed of the past super-Power rivalry that hadimmobilized the United Nations  the United Nations willnow be able to fulfil the aims of its founding fathers tocreate a better world.In the last few years  with these demands for UnitedNations action increasing manifold  the United Nationshas had to grapple simultaneously with many troublespots around the world. In its first 42 years of existenceuntil 1988  the United Nations launched only 13 peace-keeping operations. But in the short space of the last sixto seven years  it has seen 21 peace-keeping operations.Peace-keeping expenditures have also risen dramaticallyfrom the 1986 figure of about $350 million to $3.4 billionprojected for 1994.International relations have for a long time beenconducted in an inter-State system  with the overridingprinciple being respect of the sovereignty of independentnations. The main focus of the United Nations Charter14was and is on how the international community can respondto threats to peace and security issues betweennation-States  as opposed to crises within a State. Theworld community and the United Nations in particular haverelatively little experience to draw upon in managingintra-State conflicts and intra-State peace-keeping. Thedilemmas faced by the Security Council in dealing withSomalia  Haiti  Bosnia and Rwanda  just to name a few demonstrate that the United Nations is still evolving itsapproach on how to respond to these challenges.These new challenges of dealing with intra-Stateconflicts  it would appear  will continue to be with us. The1994 United Nations Development Programme report on theHuman Development Index indicates that 79 of the 82global military conflicts since 1991 were intra-State innature. Can the United Nations  which represents theworld’s conscience  avoid getting involved in suchconflicts? On the one hand  the United Nations is criticizedfor not intervening in Rwanda in the earlier stages of thecivil war. It is argued that if it had  we could have avoidedthe immense humanitarian disaster we now see in thatcountry. On the other hand  others maintain that the UnitedNations is not ready to shoulder the implied responsibility after getting involved in intra-State conflicts  of nursing acountry back to the political stability and economic healthwhich is  of course  necessary to prevent a repetition offamine  chaos and other troubles.Member States are coming round to recognizing thatthere are political  financial and institutional limitations tothe United Nations. We cannot realistically expect theUnited Nations to resolve all forms of civil wars withinnational boundaries. For now  we have reverted to themore onerous but perhaps sensible approach of respondingto situations on a case by case basis. Inevitably  however the United Nations will need to establish guidelines andcriteria  either formal or otherwise  to decide where UnitedNations involvement will be necessary and when it will beeffective.The Security Council already appears to have takensteps in this direction. In a May 1994 statement  it agreedthat the existence of a threat to international peace andsecurity  and of a clear political goal reflected in a precisemandate  are factors which should be considered whenestablishing new peace-keeping operations. Other factorsshould include  inter alia  whether a cease-fire exists andwhether the parties have committed themselves to a peaceprocess intended to reach a political settlement.Significantly  the Security Council also asked that it beinformed of the likely availability of resources for the newoperations. These are but preliminary guidelines. It willbe necessary to build upon  refine and modify them tobest meet the evolving peace and security challenges ofthis new era.In many cases of intra-State conflicts  it is probablymore effective to address the underlying causes of conflictand provide a foundation for socio-economicdevelopment. The root causes of many conflicts aresocio-economic: the distribution of scarce resources andthe lack of development. Hence  we may do better toconcentrate on development aid  education  goodgovernance and basic infrastructure-building to lay thebuilding-blocks to create a civil society. Whereappropriate  these measures should be accompanied andsupplemented by preventive diplomacy. Peace-keepingoperations are a palliative  not a substitute for solving theroot causes of conflicts.At a time when the United Nations is called upon toundertake and adapt to new and complex leadership rolesin international peace and security  the persistent financialproblems faced by our Organization have clearly to beaddressed and overcome. The crucial point is that  havingdecided to launch a peace-keeping operation  MemberStates cannot allow it to fail  especially owing to lack ofresources. The very credibility of our Organization wouldbe questioned if we were to mandate the United Nationsto take on new peace-keeping operations  and then watchthem falter and fail because Member States are unwillingor unable to provide the requisite resources.Unfortunately  the Secretary-General had to againwarn the Presidents of the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly in July this year of the dire financialsituation of the United Nations  especially in peace-keeping. Unless we do something  these warnings will berepeated year after year. With the many multidimensionalchallenges facing the United Nations in the post-cold-warera  it is difficult to envisage how the United Nations willbe able to carry out its functions effectively if it has tolive from hand to mouth in this manner. It is timeMember States seriously addressed the issue of financialresources and tackled it firmly once and for all.There is only one solution to the financial crisis ofthe United Nations: Member States must pay theirassessments in full and on time. Without our payments the United Nations simply cannot function.Many Member States have failed to honour the legaland binding obligations that require them to pay their15assessments in full and on time. Obligatory and legitimatepayments are unconditional and incumbent on all MemberStates. In fact  individual Member States have no reasonto withhold or threaten to withhold contributions to theUnited Nations  as each Member State has the opportunityto present and argue its case for or against any UnitedNations activity. Each Member State also has the chanceto scrutinize the budgetary implications of each decisionand consequently to negotiate a consensus with otherMember States as is the practice for all budgetary matters.But this is by now a tired mantra. In order toencourage timely payments  Member States should considerproposals already being discussed in United Nations circles such as a system of charging interest on late payments though with due consideration for the difficult situations ofthe least developed countries. We would also like tosuggest that Member States use the symbolic event of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to clear theirarrears and start with a clean slate financially. MemberStates could undertake a joint commitment to pay up alltheir outstanding contributions to the United Nations beforethis symbolic day in 1995.The Security Council has a particularly critical role inthe United Nations. The Charter confers upon it theprimary responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. As spelt out in the Charter  themembership dues of a State Member of the United Nationsare one of the few and most basic of the obligations ofUnited Nations membership. Now  if a permanent memberof the Security Council cannot even meet this basicobligation  how can it meet the heavy and seriousresponsibility of maintaining international peace andsecurity on behalf of all Member States? We mustestablish the principle that the permanent members of theSecurity Council  with their privileged positions  should notbe in arrears. They should in fact set an example for therest of the United Nations membership in meeting theirfinancial obligations. For the same reason  permanentmembers must continue to bear special responsibilities inthe financing of peace-keeping.I hope Member States will consider our proposalsseriously. I believe these proposals can lead to concreteresults in improving the financial situation of the UnitedNations and even lay the basis for the United Nations betterto manage the difficult challenges of this new era.Singapore is fully committed to working together with theSecretary-General and Member States to resolve thefinancial crisis of the United Nations.It is expected that  with the rising costs for peace-keeping operations  one of the most heated arguments inthe years ahead will be the apportionment of peace-keeping expenses among Member States. Singapore willstrive  together with other Member States  to work outobjective political and economic criteria for improving thescale. It is clear that any ad hoc  arbitrary or voluntarymeasures in this regard will have little chance of successgiven the fact that this is a highly sensitive issue. Theremust be a process of debate and discussion  howeverprotracted it may be  before we can arrive at a consensuson a new scale. Singapore  for its part  is ready to paymore in peace-keeping expenses provided  first  that thisis the outcome of an overall reform of the peace-keepingscale and  secondly  that the problem of those who are inarrears is seriously addressed.We have come a long way since the founding of theUnited Nations 49 years ago. It is now time for us torededicate ourselves to the goal of creating a better world as envisaged by our Charter. What better time than now on the eve of our fiftieth anniversary  for us to place theUnited Nations on a sound financial footing and lay thefoundation for it to embark on its programmes andactivities for the next 50 years?"
"148",6212,"SLB",49,1994,"I wish  first of all to warmly congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session a responsibility he will discharge effectively with theproven diplomatic skills with which he has served hiscountry and his region so well. I take this opportunity alsoto applaud the good work and leadership of his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally  who presided overthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.It is appropriate that on the eve of the fiftiethanniversary of this Organization we enter a new era ininternational relations  an era untainted by the cold-warpolitics that held peace and positive change hostage for toolong. Opportunities now abound for change and lastingpeace. This new era demands that all Member States takea global view of how the Organization can best meet theobjectives set out in the Charter.President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsindemonstrated this new hope for peace at the opening of thegeneral debate  when both addressed the General Assemblyon the same day instead of on consecutive days  as was theold practice. In a spirit of cooperation  these two worldleaders described their intent to reduce their nation’sstockpiles of nuclear and other weapons of massdestruction. But disarmament must start from the heart.And I hope that this is the case with the step these twoPresidents have taken towards the betterment of allhumankind.Today  we would recall that peace and hatred comefrom within people - the mirror of a nation  the image of aregion and the living treasure of the global community. Inorder to build a peaceful and safe world for futuregenerations  our resolve to reduce nuclear and otherweapons of mass destruction must lie within the hearts ofour leaders and policy makers throughout the world. Wemust therefore seize this opportunity and work together tobuild a better world.In this regard  Solomon Islands welcomes thevarious peace initiatives that continue to bring hope to theworld community. The noble efforts of PresidentMandela to chart a new direction for South Africa mustbe commended. In his first address as the first Presidentof the new democratic South Africa  President Mandelaacknowledged the efforts of the international communityin this way:""The universal struggle against apartheid and itsfinal dismantlement was not an act of charity arisingout of pity for the majority of South African peoplebut an affirmation of our common humanity.""Progress towards a lasting peace in the Middle Easthas renewed the hope of the international community forstability in that region. The parties involved in thesenegotiations deserve our sincere acclaim and praise andour continuing support. Replacing guns with meaningfulhandshakes often takes leaders beyond their physicalnature and leads them to resort to their spiritualmindsets - a dimension that is often ignored but which isan essential ingredient in a recipe for conflict resolution.The cease-fire in Northern Ireland has changedpeople’s perception of the impossibility of the simplereality of living without guns and bullets. These aretelling achievements for our times  and their roots areembedded in the human spirit of love and kindness.Despite United Nations interventions to restoreintra-State and international peace and security  the worldis still riddled with trouble spots and endangered byhuman-induced threats such as the potential impact ofclimate change and sea-level rise. We witness withhorror the human suffering in Rwanda  Somalia  Angola Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Haiti. Solomon Islandscalls on the parties concerned to lay down their arms andresort to non-violent means of negotiating peace. Trueand real peace has to spring from within the warringparties  replacing animosity.Close to home in the Solomon Islands is the five-year-old crisis on Bougainville  a province of Papua NewGuinea. It spilled over into Solomon Islands and caused15a rift between the two countries. Nevertheless  through aprocess of mutual dialogue between the NationalGovernment of Papua New Guinea and the BougainvilleRevolutionary Army  several important agreements havebeen signed. These include the Honiara commitments topeace  the cease-fire agreement and the historicpeace-keeping agreement on Bougainville. The role of theSolomon Islands Government in this conflict has beenconciliatory  facilitating peace negotiations amongst theparties concerned. Solomon Islands supports theBougainville Peace Conference  expected to be convened on10 October. This reflects our commitment to restoringpeace and normalcy on Bougainville.Solomon Islands pledges its support and commitmentto the ideals of the United Nations. We believe it to be theonly world body capable of maintaining world peace andsecurity. Solomon Islands shares the views of NewZealand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of ForeignAffairs and Trade  the Right Honourable Don McKinnon whose statement at the general debate provided siximportant management issues that should be addressedwhile conducting United Nations peace-keeping operations.There is no doubt in my mind that all of us want aneffective United Nations - an Organization that meets theobjectives it sets out to achieve  an Organization whoseCharter is valid because its actions are reliable.Solomon Islands welcomes the current initiativesundertaken by the Secretary-General in reforming theOrganization and supports proposals made by otherMember States for further reforms. These reforms  in ourview  must also reflect the needs of small island developingStates such as my own  particularly the need to remove ""thefloor"" to enable Member States to meet their financialobligations. Some want to pay their assessed annualcontributions but do not have the capacity to do so; hencea relative and fair formula should be worked out.In his report (A/49/1) on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has identified peace  the economy the environment  justice and democracy as the fiveinterlocking pillars of development. These will provide thefoundations for the kind of development that will ensurehuman progress.""An Agenda for Peace"" paved the way forward fromthe dark ages of the cold war; the United NationsConference on Environment and Development was areawakening initiative to save planet Earth; the SecondWorld Conference on Human Rights sought to establishuniversal rights for all peoples throughout the worldirrespective of race  creed  political affiliation or sex; theInternational Conference on Population and Developmentsaw the need to control the soaring world population which now stands at 5.7 billion; and next year the WorldSummit for Social Development and the WorldConference on Women will address poverty unemployment  social integration and the empowermentof women to take their rightful place in society. Theseare efforts of Member States committed to the noblecause of securing a peaceful  safe and sustainable worldto live in. To achieve these noble goals  an effectiveglobal partnership is of paramount importance.Technology has made the world’s smaller economiesbecome more interdependent.Agenda 21  the outcome of the United NationsConference on Environment and Development  made aspecial case for small island developing States because oftheir peculiar vulnerabilities. The response to this callwas the convening of the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates in Barbados in April this year. The passage fromRio to Barbados  at least for small island developingStates  was a Programme of Action outlining national regional and international actions. Our collective supportis needed to implement this. If we agree thatdevelopment takes many forms and requires differentresponses  then our task will be made easier if we acttogether. Solomon Islands fully supports the BarbadosProgramme of Action and calls on the members of theinternational community to honour their commitments asspelled out in Agenda 21. The successful implementationof the Programme of Action will depend on thesecommitments.The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his ""Agenda for Peace"" report to the Security Council stressed that cooperation with regional arrangements andorganizations could be of great benefit to Member Statesif their activities were consistent with the purposes andprinciples of the Charter and governed by the provisionsof Chapter VIII. Some of those bodies have alreadygained observer status at the United Nations. This showsthe useful role these arrangements and organizations canplay in international affairs. Therefore  the strengtheningof regional arrangements and organizations that areworking closely with the United Nations is a criticalissue.In this regard  Solomon Islands strongly supports thedecision by the South Pacific Forum to seek UnitedNations observer status at the forty-ninth session of the16General Assembly. We acknowledge with gratitude therole of Australia  the current Chairman of the South PacificForum  in guiding this initiative through the United Nationssystem on the Forum’s behalf. We thank Member Statesthat have expressed support for this call and invite others todo likewise.As a member of the South Pacific Forum and theMelanesian Spearhead Group  Solomon Islands endorses theForum Communiqué issued following the meeting of thetwenty-fifth South Pacific Forum held in Brisbane Australia  this year. We are a party to the Joint Declarationon Economic and Trade Cooperation signed in SolomonIslands this year between Papua New Guinea  Vanuatu andSolomon Islands. Solomon Islands calls upon theinternational community to support our regionalarrangements and organizations from which our strength forcollective action is derived and which are responsible forour flow of communication.Forestry and fisheries resources remain my country’smain income earners. The Solomon Islands Government isgravely concerned about the unsustainable utilization andmanagement of these resources and has taken steps toensure sustainable harvesting and conservation measuresand to form a national policy. We are party to Agreementsreached in Brisbane at the meeting of the South PacificForum to cooperate on a wider basis in order to ensuresustainable development of fisheries and forestry resourcesin our region. Because of the fragility of our ecologicalsystem  our biodiversity resources  including forestry andfisheries and other marine living resources  are threatened.It is heartening to note that after 12 years ofnegotiations the world will witness the coming into force ofthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea inNovember this year. However  we strongly feel that furthercooperation is still needed from the distant water fishingnations regarding sustainable harvesting of straddling fishstocks and highly migratory fish stocks  includingnon-targeted species. We therefore urge distant-waterfishing nations to come to grips with the need to complete as soon as practicable  negotiations on a legally bindingagreement on proper conservation and management andsustainable utilization of high seas fisheries resources.Education is a priority sector in my country. It is akey to the effective management of my country’s naturalresources as well as a means of achieving the advancementof women to take their rightful place in society. There isa direct link between the education of women andpopulation control. We welcome the outcome of the CairoInternational Conference on Population and Developmentand look forward to the World Conference on Women  tobe held in Beijing in 1995.The World Summit for Social Development also hasprofound implications for capacity-building  institutionalstrengthening and the transfer of technologies and theirappropriate use. Human-centred activities  includingtourism development and skills training  are important forthe development of human resources. We endorse the1994 Human Development Report of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for its emphasis onhuman-centred development  an approach that has positiveripple effects in solving other social problems.Drug trafficking and the criminal activitiesassociated with it worry us in the Pacific  and we are notalone in this. We need international cooperation to stopthe movement of illegal drugs from one region to another.Solomon Islands supports the South Pacific Forumposition that the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) should beextended indefinitely. However  we would like to seefirm commitments from the nuclear-weapon States toshow the world a leadership role in reducing theirstockpiles. We also wish to see a rigid reviewmechanism set up to be a safeguard instrument as anintegral part of the indefinite extension agreement.It is encouraging to hear the United States  theRussian Federation and China speak in support of theNon-Proliferation Treaty and the comprehensive test-bantreaty. It is hoped that a level of harmony between theNPT  the comprehensive test-ban treaty and the cut-offconvention may be maintained to enhance the eliminationof weapons of mass destruction in an integrated manner.Solomon Islands urges the post-Forum dialoguepartners that have not yet done so to ratify the SouthPacific nuclear-free zone Treaty. Nuclear testing in thePacific is not part of our vocabulary.Consistent with our belief in a nuclear-free world waste dumping in the Pacific Ocean is not to beencouraged. We strongly oppose those who may violatethis natural rule. We also firmly oppose thetransshipment and transboundary movement of plutoniumin the South Pacific region.We need to see some further movement towards aspeedy implementation of the Matignon Accords. In thisregard  we request the Government of France and the17territorial authorities to increase their efforts to achieve realeconomic and social rebalancing.Solomon Islands welcomes the move to formulate anagenda and proposals to promote trade and investmentbetween the United States and the Pacific Islands  whichwill be the subject of a meeting at the East-West Centre inHawaii later this year.Apart from the other vulnerabilities that plague smallisland developing States  the potential impact of climatechange and rising sea levels poses a great threat to Pacificislands. There is overwhelming scientific evidence pointingto the danger we now face.In this regard  Solomon Islands supports the Allianceof Small Island States  which has submitted to next year’sConference of the parties to the Convention on ClimateChange an additional protocol aimed at securing a reductionof the emission of greenhouse gases to the 1990s level by2005  a protocol to which the industrialized countries wouldbe obliged to be parties.We in Solomon Islands firmly believe that theRepublic of China on Taiwan has much to contribute to thework of the United Nations and its specialized agencies interms of international cooperation and development. ThisRepublic  with a population more than 58 times that of myown country and highly technologically advanced  deservesto be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. Thefull participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in theimportant work of the United Nations would be anaffirmation of the Charter and of democracy and amanifestation of the human spirit’s pursuit of a betterquality of life for humankind. In my Government’s view a move as noble as the admission of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan would be not an obstacle to reunification  but acatalyst in the process. In our view  the Secretary-Generalshould use his good offices to encourage the establishmentof a committee specifically to facilitate and/or workprogressively towards the re-entry of the Republic of Chinato membership of the United Nations.President Ernesto Samper Pizano of the Republic ofColombia  speaking from this podium  described Colombiaas""a country searching for peace because it so loveslife."" (Official Records of the General Assembly forty-ninth session  Plenary Meetings  5th meeting  p.8)We in Solomon Islands  too  love life very much  and oursearch is for a better quality of life  which should flowfrom the wise and sustainable development of ourresources.Collectively  however  our search must be for worldpeace so that we can live up to our dreams  visions andGod-given potential. I believe that the answer to theproblem of bringing about world peace lies in our ownhearts  not in the barrels of guns or military might. Here in this great world Assembly  let our hearts enkindle anew torch to shine on the new path to world peace  fromthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and beyond."
"149",6258,"SLE",49,1994,"It is with great pleasurethat I congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to thepresidency of the current session of the General Assembly.His remarkable talent and consummate experience assure usthat we can feel proud and confident as he discharges hisnew functions admirably and with distinction. Hisleadership of the Assembly confers dignity on Africa  onWest Africa and on his country  Côte d’Ivoire  with whichSierra Leone happily enjoys excellent bilateral relations andshares a common West African identity. We extend to himan abiding wish for his success.To Ambassador Insanally of Guyana  his immediatepredecessor  I convey my delegation’s gratitude andappreciation for the commendable manner in which heperformed his duties as President of the forty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly.The approach adopted by the Secretary-General of ourOrganization since he assumed office has been exemplaryin many ways. He deserves high tribute for his untiringefforts over the past two years  especially in the realms ofthe maintenance of international peace and security and thepromotion of development.The world is still in transition. Although the outcomeof the process of transformation is not easy to predict withany degree of certainty  it is nevertheless clear that theworld will continue to be preoccupied in the next half-century with problems carried over from the last -problems concerning the promotion of development especially of the least developed countries; themaintenance of peace and security; and the consolidationand strengthening of the process of cooperation andintegration between nations. These are among the majorchallenges of our time.Developmental and political issues now occupy alarger part of our global  regional and national agendas and the past 12 months have been no exception. In somecases  these developments have been a source of joy andsatisfaction; in others  the stigma of shame and disgracehas loomed larger.On the economic front  the slow  uncertain andunbalanced growth of the economies of developingcountries generally has been a source of grave concern.This is evidenced by the alarming increase in the numberof peoples living in absolute poverty  stagnating resourceflows  dwindling direct foreign investment  reduction inexport earnings  excruciating debt crises  risingunemployment  especially among the youth  andenvironmental degradation.The persistence of these problems could easilyundermine the stability of the world economy and poseserious threats to international peace and security.Immeasurable work has been done to redress theeconomic stranglehold in which most of our countriesfind themselves. A lot more  however  needs to be doneby the developed countries and the international financialinstitutions to prevent many of the world’s poor countriesfrom being completely submerged by the heavy burdensimposed by the present international economic system.More specifically  new  additional resources  at both themultilateral and the bilateral levels  need to be providedby our development partners if any improvement in thelives of the teeming millions in the third world is to beassured.The situation is even more acute for my country which is in the throes of a rebel war and implementing asubstantial economic reform programme as well as apolitical transition programme — all three activitiestaking place simultaneously. Hardly any other Statemember of the Assembly shares this unique experience.Given the increasing interdependence and globalization ofthe world economy  the massively deteriorating economicsituation of the developing countries and  in particular  the20uniqueness of the plight of Sierra Leone deserve the fulland urgent attention of all the members of the internationalcommunity.Poverty and the decreasing living standards of themajority of our people are at the heart of our problems. Toalleviate these problems  my Government has embarked oncourageous  wide-ranging and far-reaching socio-economicreforms  including the deregulation of prices and exchangeand interest rates  and the reduction of fiscal deficit. Thepace and scope of these reforms  however  contrast sharplywith the very modest results achieved so far. Despiteconsiderable success in securing short-term macroeconomicstabilization  the reforms appear to have neither removedthe structural constraints facing the economy nor improvedsupply capacity. We are now resolved to ensure that futureadjustment programmes are designed and implemented ina manner that takes due cognizance of the special needs ofthe vulnerable groups of our society as well as the socialrequirements of development.Those are just some of the difficult tasks ahead. Theyare made no less formidable by the new challenges posedby the Uruguay Round agreements signed at Marrakesh lastApril. My Government welcomes the new agreements  butwould stress the need for continued evaluation of theirimplementation to ensure expansion of world trade for allcountries  improved market access and adequate protectionof the interests of the least developed countries inparticular. Any attempt  therefore  to impose newconditionalities  encompassing environmental and labourconditionalities in this context  must be strongly resisted.In the meantime  the observation is inescapable thatthe Marrakesh agreements pose a real danger to tradepreferences previously assured developing countries; thiscan lead to a loss in export market share and exportearnings. Moreover  countries that are net importers offood face the prospect of higher food-import bills arisingfrom the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector.There is therefore a need to address without delay thequestion of how the adverse consequences of the Marrakeshagreements can be mitigated through enhanced tradepreferences  assistance and compensation.The external indebtedness of developing countriesposes the biggest impediment to their development. Apermanent and comprehensive solution must therefore befound without further delay. That is why we commend theChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement  His ExcellencyPresident Soeharto of Indonesia  for taking the initiative toconvene in Jakarta last August a ministerial meeting ofnon-aligned countries on debt and development  with thetheme “sharing of experiences”. That high-level meetingon the debt crisis of developing countries  which Iattended together with Ministers from twenty-five heavilydebt-distressed  least-developed countries  endorsed anumber of general principles for debt reduction  whichrepresent a significant step in the search for a lastingsolution to the debt problem. We therefore urge theUnited Nations and the international community to adoptthe principles contained in the report of the Jakartameeting  submitted to the Assembly by Indonesia.Calling upon the international community to payspecial attention to the problems of developing countriesis not a proclamation of abdication of responsibility. InAfrica  for example  we have accepted that the key tosustainable development is in the hands of Africansthemselves. The African leadership must thereforedemonstrate a determination to stay the course ofappropriate economic reforms and improvement ingovernance. We do emphasize  however  that theinternational community must play a crucial supportiverole in the creation of the environment necessary toguarantee sustainable growth and development ofdeveloping countries in ways that include the provision ofadequate levels of concessional  financial and technicalsupport for infrastructure and national capacity-buildingon a continuous  predictable and assured basis.The issues I have raised will no doubt be on theagendas of certain conferences slated for the coming year.The World Summit for Social Development inCopenhagen  March 1995  will provide an opportunity forall of us to focus on such matters as socio-economicdevelopmental challenges  the adoption of a globalstrategy for poverty eradication  the generation ofproductive employment and the enhancement of socialintegration — in all of which the needs of people willoccupy centre stage. The situation of women and theneed to integrate them better in the development processas agents and beneficiaries of development will alsoreceive attention at the Fourth World Conference onWomen  to be convened at Beijing in September nextyear. This Assembly  for its part  is convening ahigh-level intergovernmental meeting to conduct amid-term global review of progress in the implementationof the Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries in the 1990s. Naturally  my delegation holdshigh expectations that the recommendations andconclusions of these meetings will make substantialcontributions towards creating the climate necessary for21enhancing the socio-economic conditions of developingcountries.In the same vein  my delegation commends the timelyinitiative of the Secretary-General in submitting “AnAgenda for Development” pursuant to the resolutions ofthis Assembly. It provides us with another historicopportunity to address the root causes of poverty andunderdevelopment of the developing countries in a holisticand comprehensive manner. We urge the Secretary-General to make concrete  action-orientedrecommendations for the enhancement of thesocio-economic conditions of these countries and to suggestpractical measures for their implementation.Turning now to the environment  my delegation isconcerned at the general response to the recommendations decisions and commitments of the Rio de JaneiroConference on Environment and Development  held overtwo years ago. True  some progress has been recordedsince that Conference. What is missing  however  is a clearcommitment on the part of the developed countries toprovide financial and other relevant resources for theimplementation of Agenda 21. We in the developing worldare committed to implementing Agenda 21  but thiscommitment will remain illusory unless it is complementedby adequate human  financial and technical resources.On the world political scene too  the picture that wesee concurrently inspires hope and engenders desperation.Without a doubt  the holding of the first pluralistic non-racial  democratic elections in South Africa  in Aprilthis year  and the subsequent installation of a Governmentof national unity  marked a major achievement not only forthe people of South Africa but also for this Organization.The patient and dedicated struggle of all peace-loving SouthAfricans to resolve peacefully the abominable policy ofapartheid  aided by the committed solidarity of the world atlarge  has been amply rewarded.In taking this opportunity  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone  formally towelcome South Africa back into this world Assembly  Iwish to reiterate our commitment to work together with thenew Government to make our continent a better place forall of us. Theirs has been a long and arduous journeythrough dark and difficult times that tested both courageand faith. The presence of the South African delegationhere today is a confirmation of man’s ability to rise abovethose conditions that threaten his survival and to resolvethem peacefully  though they may have originally appearedinsurmountable.There are at least three lessons to be learnt from theSouth African experience:First  with South Africa’s freedom  the non-whitepeoples of that country  and indeed everywhere  areenabled to regain their lost humanity. While apartheidexisted  its stigma touched many  even beyond thatcountry’s borders. Yet  with that policy’s banishmentfrom the South African landscape  this Organizationshould now rekindle its sense of purpose to continue thestruggle against racial discrimination and segregationwherever they exist.Secondly  the attainment by South Africa ofdemocratic values under a non-racial Government ofnational unity should demonstrate to all countries especially in Africa  that excuses for denying a similartransformation to our own societies are now untenable.Thirdly  the fact that such a man as Mr. NelsonMandela could emerge from 27 years of imprisonment onRobben Island and  setting aside any bitterness  preachand demonstrate accommodation and nationalreconciliation should in itself encourage our brothers andsisters in divided societies to forswear retribution andstrive instead for tolerance and harmony.These lessons have not been lost on us in SierraLeone. We have come to understand and appreciate fromthis exemplary South African political experience that where democratic principles are applied in full in thegovernance of any nation  there is every likelihood thatsolutions will be found to the political problems of thatnation  however intractable they may appear. Consciousof this fact  the Government of the National ProvisionalRuling Council of Sierra Leone  headed by HisExcellency Captain Valentine Strasser  has unveiled apolitical reform programme that will ensure theinstallation of a democratically elected government in ourcountry by January 1996.With that in view  an Interim National ElectoralCommission of eminent citizens has now been constituted headed by Mr. James Jonah  former Under-Secretary-General of this Organization. Furthermore  asa result of extensive debates on an initial WorkingDocument put together by a National Advisory Council the draft constitution has now been finalized and willsoon be presented to the people for final approval.Meanwhile  a National Commission on Democracy  whichwill undertake a programme of mass education to let thepeople appreciate the values of democracy and their rights22and duties as citizens  will soon be appointed. All thesesteps are designed to underscore the commitment of myGovernment towards the full restoration of democracy inSierra Leone by the end of 1995. Let me assure thisAssembly that the Government of the National ProvisionalRuling Council remains fully committed to the transitionprogramme  which continues to be on course. We lookforward to the cooperation and assistance of theinternational community in enabling us to realize theprogramme’s objectives.Allow me at this point to recall the adoption by theGeneral Assembly last year of resolution 48/196  entitled“International assistance to Sierra Leone”  and ourcontinued expectation for the full implementation of itsprovisions. We are appreciative of the assistance extendedto Sierra Leone so far by the international community especially in the humanitarian field  and look forward to itscontinuation and increase in the future.Yet  as promising as the nation’s prospects are  itshould not be forgotten that we are engaged in a rebel warwhose origins are inextricably linked to the Liberianconflict  and whose consequences are still visible in thelarge number of refugees and internally displaced SierraLeoneans  who now total an estimated 300 000 and 400 000respectively. Further  the untold devastation of thecountry’s economically productive areas continues toundermine an already fragile economy.My Government realizes that even though our meagreresources are now committed to bringing this rebel war toan end  we must necessarily look forward to thereconstruction of our country and its economy  a taskwhose success will be greatly enhanced throughcollaboration with the United Nations system  especially inworking out a programme for the rehabilitation of thedevastated areas and the resettlement of our refugees anddisplaced citizens. To this end  we have already laid thefoundations for the expeditious rehabilitation of these areasupon the conclusion of the war  by setting up a NationalRehabilitation Committee that will oversee our efforts inthis matter.While  as a Government  we continue with reluctanceto pursue the military option in prosecuting this war — andwe wish to record here our appreciation to all friendlyGovernments  particularly Nigeria  Guinea and the People’sRepublic of China  for their assistance in that effort — letme say here and now that no option is foreclosed. Weremain amenable to any option  military or non-military that will secure a speedy conclusion to this untenablesituation  thus ensuring the creation of an environmentconducive to the holding of the elections anticipated inour transition programme.The success of these undertakings and of others inmy Government’s transition programme depends largelyon the progress that is made in restoring peace to Liberia hence our deep concern about developments taking placeacross our border. It is in this connection that we renewour commitment to the Cotonou accords and reiterate thatthey contain the essential elements for the resolution ofthe Liberian conflict  namely the disarmament of thewarring factions  leading to the holding of elections.Drawing from the experience in Angola  it is clear thatwithout such disarmament  peace in Liberia will betenuous at best. We therefore call on the United Nationsand the international community to support the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)financially  logistically and otherwise in order toreinvigorate the peace process and ensure thatdisarmament gains renewed momentum.Given our own refugee situation  we are gravelyconcerned about the increasing flows in the world refugeepopulation  about half of whom are children  whose needsshould be met through appropriate measures of protectionand assistance. This International Year of the Familytherefore provides an excellent opportunity to focusattention on the essential needs of refugee children. Incontemplating concrete measures to be taken by theinternational community in addressing this phenomenon it is essential that the United Nations Convention on theRights of the Child be fully implemented.As crucial as these measures are for mitigating theglobal refugee problem  we remain convinced that  unlessand until the international community overcomes thescourge of poverty and political strife  this problem willremain constantly with us. It is our fervent hope therefore  that a renewed impetus will once again befound to prevent and eradicate this condition of boundlesshuman misery.Looking beyond the borders of our region  SierraLeone acknowledges the signing of the WashingtonDeclaration by Israel and Jordan  ending the state of warbetween the two countries. We see this as a continuationof the peace process that started three years ago and thatled to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements in the West Bank and theGaza Strip. It is a positive development  coming after theassumption of Palestinian self-government earlier this23year  and anticipates the eventual attainment ofcomprehensive peace among all concerned parties in theMiddle East.In this connection  my Government would like tocommend the role of the United States and Egypt for theirrelentless efforts in bringing together Israel and its Arabneighbours. We urge Israel on the one hand  and Lebanonand Syria on the other to intensify their efforts and displaythe spirit of accommodation that had underpinned successesin other areas  so as to make the important objective of acomprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle Eastrealizable within the shortest possible time — in the interestnot only of the people of the region  but of the world atlarge.With regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq we call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Kuwait in accordance with the termsof the resolutions of the Security Council.We would also hope that in other areas  such asSomalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina  there will beprogress in bringing to an end the present unacceptablestalemate. While the absence of progress may befrustrating  we nevertheless believe that it would be a tragicmistake even to contemplate disengagement from peace-keeping operations in Africa at this crucial stage.By far the most appalling situation that theinternational community has had to confront recently is thatin Rwanda. We will not readily forget those graphicimages of death  abject misery and destruction  or soonovercome the torment and challenges that our collectiveconscience has had to face. It is hard to explain and harderstill to understand how those dark days from April to Julycould have taken place in this century in full view of theworld. That such a tragedy occurred at all points to thefailure of existing international mechanisms for respondingto such devastating situations.Drawing from the Rwandan experience  the time hascome for all of us  but more so for us in Africa  to come toterms with the diverse nature of our societies and realizethat the denial by any group of the right of another groupor section to participate in the life of a nation isindefensible and ultimately self-destructive. Peacefulcoexistence of heterogeneous communities and power-sharing within a nation are great values we must all uphold.Further  we believe that painful admissions must bemade. A few years ago  when the Monitoring Group of theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOMOG) was deployed in Liberia  much criticism waslevelled against it. We were accused of harbouringulterior motives against that country and of encouragingintervention. Yet  looking back  none will deny todaythat by its deployment ECOMOG averted a similartragedy in Liberia. Concerted action by West Africansbrought that country back from the brink. Today ECOMOG represents Africa’s flagship in preventivediplomacy  peace-keeping  peace-building and peaceenforcement. We call on States in Rwanda’s region toreassert their lead role in the search for a peacefulsolution to the crisis in Rwanda. We believe that in therealm of maintaining regional peace and security  regionalarrangements have an important role to play  as envisagedin Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. This hasbeen recognized by the exemplary collaboration betweenthe United Nations and ECOWAS on the Liberiansituation.In this context also  the OAU mechanism for conflictprevention  management and resolution deserves thefullest support of the United Nations system and theinternational community. We are therefore deeplyencouraged by the positive resonance of some membersof the Security Council in that connection.We must at this point applaud the action of theFrench Government in Rwanda at a time when thisOrganization seemed completely paralysed. We believethat the French action  which undoubtedly brought aglimmer of hope to a situation that was palpably socatastrophic and which prevented a second Goma  isworthy of special mention by all peace-loving nations.We also commend the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity. What is now required to stabilize thesituation even further is the provision of full support forthe African and other troops that have been or are aboutto be deployed in Rwanda. We also call upon the presentRwandan Government to continue to take all measuresnecessary to restore peace and reconciliation to theircountry.Though we must all learn the painful lessons of theRwandan experience  it is essential that those who playeda part — any part at all — in visiting such horror on thepeople of Rwanda be held fully accountable for theircrimes. In this connection  my delegation fully supportsthe establishment of a special tribunal to bring to justicethose responsible for what can only be described asgenocide. We expect that the Commission of Experts24will continue to collect all available evidence to make fora speedy conclusion of this shameful episode.In a similar vein  we expect that the InternationalTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible forSerious Violations of International Humanitarian LawCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since1991 will soon begin the process of examining the availableevidence in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. Theinternational community has an obligation to ensure thatsuch callous indifference to human life and the deliberatecommission of acts of atrocity  wherever they occur  do notgo unpunished. The time has come for a strong message tobe sent to all who may presume that no consequences willfollow from such despicable behaviour simply because ittakes place behind national borders.I wish to declare here and now that my Governmentrecognizes that no true governance can endure if people areseparated from and denied the full enjoyment of theirfreedoms and liberties. Stemming from this recognition therefore  my Government has embarked on the major taskof ratifying  as soon as possible  the remaining-humanrights instruments to which Sierra Leone is not yet a party thus guaranteeing within our domestic law their applicationto all Sierra Leoneans.As conflicts go  none on our continent appears moreintractable than that in Angola  where more than twodecades of devastation have fostered a culture of violenceand war. The continuation of this conflict  which has costthe lives of countless thousands of peaceful Angolans remains a source of pain and anguish to my Government.Although not much optimism has been evinced  thereseems to be some progress in the Lusaka peace talks. Withthe acceptance by both the Angolan Government andUNITA of the comprehensive package put forward by theSecretary-General’s representative  there is now renewedhope that the talks will soon yield the desired result of adurable solution. My delegation welcomes thisdevelopment and would like to encourage both parties tothe conflict in Angola to allow the will of the Angolanpeople to prevail over the barrel of the gun.On the positive side  in a year that has been as volatileas this one  the knowledge that general elections will soontake place in Mozambique is cause for satisfaction. Wecall upon the people of Mozambique to seize thisopportunity to firmly demonstrate faith in their own abilityto resolve finally the many years of conflict they haveendured. Africans everywhere  I am sure  will give theirblessing as Mozambique embarks on the path to durablepeace and reconciliation.Among the many ills that afflict our world today few are more inimical to the common good than thealarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia. Ourconcern is heightened even further when we recall that itis scarcely more than 50 years ago that the worldwitnessed the worst manifestations of racialdiscrimination. Back then  passions were inflamed bythose who argued falsely that the presence of so-calledforeigners was injurious to the economic well-being of theState.Today  this nefarious argument is once again gainingground among bigots who see immigrants  asylum-seekersand refugees from other countries as targets for violence.Surely civilization has come too far to accept thissituation. It is for this reason  if for no other  that webelieve that the world community should intensify thepromotion of the Third Decade to Combat Racism andRacial Discrimination and to ensure the success of itsobjectives.To many of us it seems that the socio-economicwell-being of our world is under siege from conflicts inmany lands  far and near. In the Organization  ourapproach has been the traditional reliance on peace-keeping operations. Yet  recent experience has shownthat this is not always the best option. My delegationmaintains the view that the Organization would be betterserved by committing the greater part of its scarceresources to socio-economic development activities andpreventive diplomacy.Many questions will continue to be asked about thedirection that the United Nations must pursue as itsfiftieth anniversary dawns. Of vital importance is still theneed to encourage and provide for the full participation ofall Member States in the work of the Organization. Inmany ways  we are convinced that the growing incidenceof political instability worldwide is a strong advocate ofa more efficient  transparent and democratic SecurityCouncil — a Council cultivating a culture that frownsupon a few seeking always to wield dominion over therest.There is now a compelling case for the pursuit of thedemocratic ethic nationally. But it does not and shouldnot end there: it is equally relevant to the internationalarena. My delegation hopes that the deliberations of theOpen-ended Working Group  seized of the question of25institutional reforms  will gather momentum and will bringthese concerns to fruition as soon as possible.I have adverted at length to our problems  ourconcerns  our fears and our aspirations  which we believewe all share in this global village that is home to all of us.Over the years  we have striven together to find solutionsto a wide range of problems whose impact can no longer belocalized. If our journey through the decades has taught usanything  it is that blinding ourselves to the realities of ourtime  turning away from them  avoiding involvement orseeking solace in inaction provides only momentaryconsolation or comfort. The quantum leap in transport andcommunications makes us all our brother’s keepers. Nolonger is poverty merely the affliction of a distant cousin ina far-off land  nor can we successfully shield ourselvesfrom the trials and tribulations of those who may be lessfortunate than we are.The lesson to be learnt from all this is that  as humanbeings  we have a fate inextricably interwoven  whether welike it or not. Thus  our common endeavour to improve ourworld should be impelled by a much bolder vision — onethat brooks no compromise in combating injustice  be itpolitical  social or economic  and one that seeks tostrengthen the pillars of international cooperation  eradicatepoverty and address the causes of instability.These  then  are the challenges before us that a newand revitalized United Nations must pursue with vigour andcommitment. “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda forDevelopment” not only show that peace and developmentare inseparable twins but contain the essential ingredientsof a new vision of our one world. Let us now give thatvision the focus and direction of a better tomorrow."
"150",6305,"SLV",49,1994,"I wish  on behalf of the people and theGovernment of El Salvador  to express sincerestcongratulations to you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.It will certainly result in a positive outcome to theinternational community’s efforts to find a solution to themajor challenges of today’s world. We are certain thatyour skills and your diplomatic experience will enable usto realize the noble principles and objectives enshrined inthe Charter of the United Nations.We wish to express our appreciation to theAmbassador of Guyana  Mr. Samuel Insanally  for the11dynamic and successful work that he accomplished duringhis term as President of the Assembly at its forty-eighthsession.It is with particular pleasure that we reiterate ourgratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his work at the head of the Organization  andespecially for his efforts to cooperate with and to assist thepeople and the Government of El Salvador in the processof consolidating peace.May I begin with a brief personal reference. This isnot the first time that I have had the honour of being hereat the United Nations. We had the privilege ofparticipating in the difficult and fruitful negotiations thatculminated in the New York Accord at midnight on 31December 1991 which cleared the way for the signing ofthe Peace Accords in Mexico on 16 January 1992. Later in May of this year  as President Elect I had the opportunityto reiterate to the Secretary-General our total political willand firm commitment to complying strictly with all thepeace agreements before us. Today for the first time I amaddressing the General Assembly as President of theRepublic of El Salvador  pursuant to the mandate given bythe people of El Salvador  and this fills us with satisfactionand pride.In the field of international policy in recent years withthe profound changes that have taken place in EasternEurope and the end of East-West confrontation we arebeginning to structure a new international order which hasnot yet been consolidated. None the less  new trends havetaken shape at the global level in the political  economicand social spheres permitting great progress to take placewhich  in spite of the grave problems that persist  allow usto look to the future of mankind with optimism.With the end of the cold war the concept of securityceased to rest primarily on the arms build-up  and that hascurbed the rise in military expenditures. Democracy as apolitical system has been strengthened and continues toexpand and gain strength at the world level. The globalconcept of development has also been closely linked todemocracy  peace  respect for human rights  the protectionof the environment  development and human security.In the economic sphere changes have been gearedtowards the liberalization and globalization of the economy generating a trend towards privatization which will reducestate interference in the activities of society and will fosterthe efficient use of resources for the collective benefit.In the social sphere policies are being gearedtowards the training of human resources to foster personalfulfilment and combat the marginality in which a largepart of the world’s population lives. This situation isclearly reflected in the Human Development Report 1994.We consider it appropriate to make a brief referenceto the efforts being made by the world Organization inthe quest for solutions and in the establishment ofmechanisms to resolve problems of a general nature creating greater opportunities for integral developmentwhich can promote the greater well-being of the humanperson.In this respect the following are all events ofprofound significance and broad scope: the holding ofthe World Summit for Children  dealing with the rights ofthe child; the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development; the World Conference on HumanRights; the recent World Conference on Population andDevelopment; and the decision to hold in 1995 the FourthWorld Conference on Women and the World Summit forSocial Development.We support and are following with interest theseinternational gatherings because the subjects that havebeen examined in the past and will be examined focus ona profound analysis of the variables and concepts relatedto human development; their interrelationships; theobstacles in the way of the desired objectives; and theagreement of Governments to meet those objectives inaccordance with legislation  domestic programmes andnational resources.We cannot fail to mention the successes won by theUnited Nations in the search for international peace andsecurity. The dynamic participation in conflictresolution - resolution of conflicts of an internal nature including those related to the process of decolonization as well as conflicts of an international nature - constitutesclear evidence of the fact that when States have thepolitical will it is possible to arrive at rational solutions toexisting problems.In this respect we wish to affirm that  with a view todemocratic plurality and the principle of universality thatinspired the Charter of the United Nations  we reiterateour support for the admission of those emerging Statesthat accept and comply with the norms of thisOrganization.12As an example of the successful work of the UnitedNations it is possible to mention South Africa  which is inthe process of consolidating democracy under a multiracialGovernment; the solution of the conflict in our owncountry  El Salvador  which for a long time lived thetragedy of armed confrontation; the process of peacemakingin the fraternal Republic of Guatemala and theestablishment of the United Nations mission to supervisethe process that will restore harmony to the Guatemalanpeople; the fact that Mozambique is approaching theholding of free elections to choose  democratically  itsauthorities under the monitoring of the United Nations; thefact that Cambodia is now in a difficult period of transitiontowards the consolidation of democracy and reconstruction;and  in general  all those cases where the presence of theUnited Nations through peace-keeping forces means that thework of monitoring  observation and separation is beingdone to avoid military confrontation.We note with concern that in spite of the effort madeand resources devoted to promoting development at theworld level the situation in most countries has not improvedin the economic and social spheres and  in particular  indeveloping countries where extreme poverty  marginality deficiencies in health services and education  unemploymentand inequalities in income are  inter alia  the characteristicsthat prevail.We believe that the objective of universal peace toachieve a more human world will be possible only if wehave the conviction and the political will to establish a newmodel of development in which the ultimate goal must bethe improvement of the living conditions of the humanperson: a new concept of cooperation  based on thedemocratization of international relations  withoutpreconditions of any type  but with shared responsibilitiesfor the reduction of poverty  the generation of opportunities the creation of jobs  social integration and the openness ofmarkets.We are sincerely pleased by the continued compliancewith peace commitments signed by the Government ofIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization  and thesigning of the Washington declaration by Israel and Jordan which constitute vital advances in the peace process in theMiddle East.We hope that these events will constituteencouragement so that other States that are directlyinvolved and have interests in that region will become fullyinvolved in the peace process that has begun  in order toestablish a just  lasting and permanent peace for thebenefit of the peoples of the region.We wish to express our concern at the conflict thathas caused so much bloodshed to the people of Bosniaand Herzegovina and we sincerely hope that a negotiatedsolution will be found  involving respect for human rightsand peaceful coexistence among the different ethnicgroups of that important region.The grave situation in Rwanda is also of concern tous and we hope that the struggle of that people will soonfind a solution. We hope that that nation will findsolutions to the problems afflicting it and we urge theinternational community to give its priority attention tothat conflict.In Latin America and the Caribbean  we cannot failto make reference to the situations in Haiti and Cuba.Our Government welcomes the last-minute solutionreached by the United States and the de facto governmentof Haiti  which made it possible to avoid a major armedintervention that would have greatly harmed the Haitianpeople. Once more it has been demonstrated thatnegotiation remains the right way to resolve differences to ensure peaceful coexistence among peoples and topreserve international peace and security.In respect to the situation in Cuba  El Salvadorconsiders that it is the responsibility of that country’sGovernment to create the proper conditions so that theCuban people can freely exercise their individual politicaland economic rights. None the less  as a contributiontowards avoiding the deepening of the economic andsocial crisis and the increase in tension resulting fromimmigration  as well as making it viable for Cuba to bereintegrated into the American community of nations  webelieve that a frank and open dialogue between the CubanGovernment and the countries of the region that areinterested in helping resolve differences through politicalmeans should be encouraged.We welcome with interest the Cuban Government’sdecision to invite the United Nations High Commissionerfor Human Rights to visit the country  as well as theannouncement of its adherence to the Treaty theProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America.We would like to mention two important conferencesin the Central American regional sphere. As developingcountries  we understand social problems  especially thoseof us who have experienced armed conflicts  the result  in13part  of the lack of social opportunities and appropriateprogrammes to create them. We know that the dimensionsand the scope of sustainable development imply majorresponsibilities and make it necessary that there be greatersolidarity  cooperation and harmonization among thecountries of the Central American subregion.For this reason  next October  in Nicaragua  we willhold a Central American ecological summit in whichenvironment problems and the relationship betweenenvironment and development in our countries will be takenup. At the end of that month  we will hold  in Honduras an international conference on peace and development  atwhich we will evaluate the progress made and the obstaclesremaining in promoting the economic and socialdevelopment of our peoples. We are also considering theneed for the material and financial resources that areindispensable if we are to improve the economic and socialconditions of our peoples.In this connection  we are working to enhance andstrengthen our democratic institutions in order to guaranteecivil  political  economic and social rights  promoting thecreative participation of civil society in the developmentprocess. We are committed to promoting humandevelopment to meet the basic needs of our population andovercome critical poverty. The efforts are based on astrategy of sustainable development that gives priority toinvestment in the social sphere.In the Central American region  our fundamentalinterest is to raise the standard of living of our peoples inorder to consolidate the progress we have made in thefields of democratization and peacemaking. We areconfident that the international community  which is unitedin support of the peacemaking process in Central America will not fail to attend the conference and give us its supportand resolute cooperation so that Central America can be aregion of peace  freedom  democracy and development.Permit me to provide a summary of the specificsituation in our own country  El Salvador  to describe theadvances  the obstacles and the new challenges on thedifficult path towards consolidating peace and democracy.It is important to emphasize that our Government’sendeavours are firmly directed towards the implementationof the last stage of the agreements aimed at definitelyconsolidating peace  national reconciliation  thestrengthening of the democratic model and thereconstruction of our country.At the same time  we are focusing on resolving thenew challenges confronting Salvadorian society in thepost-war period  particularly with regard to public safety the struggle against drug trafficking and organized crime the eradication of corruption  improving and strengtheningthe judicial system in order to achieve prompt andcomplete justice  and full respect for human rights. Weare also adopting measures aimed at reducing extremepoverty  improving the education and health systems improving protection of the individual  protecting theenvironment and creating new opportunities. All this isbeing done in order to achieve greater well-being for theSalvadorian people as part of our major objective:achieving social peace.With regard to implementation of the peaceagreements  significant progress has been made this yearin the area of public safety. We have given resolutesupport to the national civil police  and we will continueto do so in order to strengthen its efficiency andeffectiveness by providing the necessary resources. Wehave also deployed the national civil police in all thecountry’s departments  and we need to increase thenumber of police in order to confront post-war problemsof public safety.In the field of human rights  we are able to pointwith satisfaction to a considerable improvement in therespect and enjoyment of the fundamental rights andfreedoms of Salvadorians. None the less  we mustrecognize in all honesty that  although some occurrencesmay be felt to have political underpinnings  mostincidents have been linked to common crime. This is asocial phenomenon that is on the rise in the post-warperiod.In connection with those cases that allegedly havepolitical motivation  we reiterate our Government’spolitical will to support resolutely the strengthening of ournational institutions that protect human rights  especiallythe attorney general for the defence of human rights  inorder that  before the mandate of the United NationsObserver Mission in El Salvador comes to an end  it willbe fully able to play its proper role in this field.During a recent visit of the independent expert of theUnited Nations Human Rights Commission  ourGovernment submitted to him a proposal on the needsand requirements of the various national institutions  inorder to improve the way they function in promoting andprotecting human rights. We hope that this proposal willbe supported by the members of that Commission.14In the field of the administration of justice  we wouldlike to underscore the election  by consensus among thedifferent political forces represented in the legislativeassembly  of the new Supreme Court  which is composedof judges who have nothing to do with or answer to anypartisan politics  thus ensuring its independence andimpartiality.The implementation of the commitments relating to thetransfer of land  for programmes to reintegrate formercombatants and for human settlements has not been broughtto a standstill  although there have been some delays owingto the lack of documentation and information on thepotential beneficiaries  as well as to financial constraints.I take this opportunity to recall that the internationalcommunity’s offer of assistance in support of the peaceagreements gave rise to great expectations in our country.A portion of the assistance has been provided  for which weare very grateful. But some of it has not yet materialized and this puts the Government in a difficult situation andcould cause unnecessary social tension.The Secretary-General is aware of this situation and inhis most recent report (S/1994/1000) to the SecurityCouncil on the situation in El Salvador observed that it wasimperative that the Government and the internationalcommunity find ways to finance the deficit of over $80million as soon as possible  in order to implement certainprogrammes stemming from the peace agreements and tocarry out outstanding commitments. Because of the delays the Government of the Republic and the FMLN agreed on19 May 1994 on rescheduling the most importantoutstanding agreements. This shows that the political willexists to continue and complete the fulfilment of the peaceagreements.In the social sphere  our objective as a Government isto create conditions that provide equal opportunities for all from the time of conception  to enable everyone to achievea higher level and quality of life. The strategy of our socialprogramme is simultaneous implementation of short- andlong-term programmes  combined with an economic policythat stimulates investment and job-creation. This stemsfrom our conviction that there can be no economicdevelopment without social development  and vice versa going hand in hand with steady progress in the fields ofpolitics  justice and public safety.Hence  in order to improve the living conditions of theneediest  we are carrying out social-support programmes forhuman development that include arrangements for rapidlybringing people into productive jobs. These programmescover training  production incentives  care for mothers children and the elderly  basic infrastructure environmental health  recreation and sports.We know that only long-term programmes can tacklethe root causes of poverty. The Government has decidedto undertake vast  profound reforms in the areas of healthand education  to make them primary sources ofinvestment in sustainable human development and socialmobility.We believe that these reforms  backed by greaterbudgetary appropriations for health and education  willmake it possible drastically to reduce infant mortality bring quality education to the remotest corners of ourcountry and reduce illiteracy to the minimum by the year2000.We are convinced that one cannot speak of healthcomprehensively without considering the environment;most of the diseases that affect the poorest people arecaused by contamination of the soil  aquifers and the air.Our Government is committed to the protection andrecovery of the environment  for there can be nosustainable development if we do not protect our naturalresources and halt the destruction of our environment.The Government’s social reforms include reform ofthe social security system; this seeks to create conditionsfor private participation in order to broaden coveragerapidly  with mechanisms by which individuals can payinto the system. We are improving social security toavert the suffering felt by many workers  who are doomedin their old age to being a burden on their families aftera lifetime of work.Since 1989 El Salvador has been making majorchanges to free and stabilize the economy  with notableresults. Economic growth has been more than 5 per centfor each of the last three years. Inflation will stand atabout 10 per cent this year and is estimated to fall intosingle digits next year. In the external sector  our currentinternational reserves equal more than four months ofimports  and the fiscal deficit  despite the demandsimposed by the peace agreements  will be around2 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1994.These encouraging results enable us to look to thefuture with optimism. Our goal as a Government isequitably to transform growth into economic development maintaining stability and generating trust in the productive15sector. Hence  through sound economic policy we areseeking to stimulate domestic savings; here  reforms in thesocial security system will play a crucial role in themobilization of resources.We firmly believe that our country is rapidlybecoming an attractive place for foreign investment. Animportant element in this connection was the adoption of anew labour code  agreed by workers and management andendorsed by the International Labour Organization. Thisrepresents fundamental progress.It is clear  then  that El Salvador enjoys peace anddemocracy and is engaged in dizzying change. Althoughthe progress has been great  we cannot deny that the roadahead of us is greater still. Progress makes us work evenharder to broaden our opportunities and create social well-being.This is an appropriate time to reiterate to theSecretary-General the gratitude of the Government and thepeople of El Salvador for the careful attention he has givento consolidating the process of peace in El Salvador. Wewish also to express our thanks to the internationalcommunity  which continues to stand by our side to bolsterour democracy and the process of reconciliation of theSalvadorian people.We can affirm with great satisfaction that ourcountry’s peace agreements are being implementedsatisfactorily in accordance with the aspirations of theSalvadorian people  and that they can be an example for thesolution of other conflicts. The achievement of peaceamong Salvadorians was the result of the unshakableresolve of our people  the support of the internationalcommunity and the effective work of the United Nationsand the Secretary-General.In conclusion  we want to express our confidence thatby the end of this forty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly the world’s peoples will have found formulas forunderstanding and cooperation  so that mankind  under thebanner of solidarity  will be successful in meeting the greatchallenges of the coming millennium."
"151",6330,"SMR",49,1994,"I wonder how historianswill judge the last decade of this century  and what futuregenerations will read about these years. My opinion isthat we are experiencing an exciting period of arduouschallenges and great expectations for peace.The installation of the administration of thePalestinian National Authority in Jericho gave us stronghope for a peaceful future.The excessive crises and wars that have recently andsuddenly broken out and the revival and intensification ofold ones in too many parts of our planet call for theinvolvement and intervention of the internationalcommunity. Let me also stress that not only should suchintervention be firm  but it should also be legitimate andcorrect. In the effort to restore peace  the internationalcommunity should act fairly  respecting the legitimatereasons and opposing the illegitimate ones  with all dueregard for man and human dignity.13General Assembly 22nd meetingFrom the top of our Mount Titano  on a clear day  onecan see the coast of the former Yugoslavia. In the fourthcentury  San Marino’s founder fled from that coast toescape religious persecution.Now  in this forum  on behalf of the people of SanMarino  I launch an appeal for peace for those tormentedregions  for Sarajevo  and for the recognition of the equalrights of all human beings  without distinction of any kind as well as for the dignity of those deprived of their right tolife.The public response to the important Conference onPopulation and Development  which brought representativesof many countries to Cairo in an effort to solve some of theproblems hindering the fair and balanced development of allpeoples  has now faded away. The decisions taken duringthat Conference  whose aims have been distorted andmisinterpreted  are only a small step forward. However  itis encouraging to see how it has been generally recognizedthat our common concerns cannot and must not lie only ina necessary reduction of rapid population growth. All theproblems related to this issue must be addressed  thusensuring all people’s rights to existence  to good health andfree development  and the disposal of their resources asthey see fit.The Republic of San Marino participated in theConference  which was held in Egypt  prompted by theconviction that it was its duty to offer a contribution. Myfellow citizens are well aware that a small country like ourswill never be in a position to play a substantial role in thechoices to be made and the decisions to be taken.Nevertheless  our foreign policy is clear  and reflects ourdeep-rooted historical traditions.In line with the policy adopted  we feel compelled tocall for respect for human rights and dignity. The latterimplies the right to make free choices  the right todevelopment  to democratic progress  equality  equalopportunities  and the right to live in peace.It seems that the United Nations has given to theCairo  Copenhagen and Beijing conferences the task ofoutlining a feasible solution to all the problems related tosocial development and the status of women.It is clear that in declaring 1994 the International Yearof the Family the General Assembly made a precise andwell-considered choice. By this decision the Assembly’saim was to celebrate an essential part of society  in theconviction that the family  the smallest democracy at thecentre of society  is the first and most important elementof any country’s structure and deserves special attentionby all States. In a national and international contextcharacterized by a disquieting crisis of values  byincreasing economic and social difficulties and by agrowing lack of models for young people  the family with its various historical  cultural and religiouscomponents  represents the last hope for mankind.Against this background  all Governments have theprimary task of formulating policies capable of helpingand supporting the family and its components whilerespecting its autonomy and specific features. TheRepublic of San Marino considers all family issues to beof the utmost importance  and it has recently taken newmeasures for the protection of motherhood andfatherhood  in addition to the laws already in force. Thewidespread development we all hope to achieve has itsroots in the family  in respect for it and within it  andmeans in practice gender equality and equal dignitybetween men and women.On the other hand  development and its equitabledistribution can be obtained only if our projects includethe safeguarding of the environment. It is a notoriousfact that too often protection of the natural environmentis sacrificed for economic and national reasons thatdamage the interests of other people and the commonwell-being. The richest and most industrialized countriesare regularly destroying the natural environment insideand outside their borders.Therefore  we deemed it necessary and fair toinclude the environment  along with peace  economicgrowth  social justice and democracy  as items on theAgenda for Development — the project proposed by theSecretary-General for the solution of the problems thatwill face our planet within the next century.In my country especially  where the protection of theterritory is of basic importance because of its small size public opinion in general and young people in particularare extremely sensitive to environmental issues and askthat choices be made that respect the interests of thecommunity and the individual in a spirit of true solidarity.In San Marino we have created the Foundation for theEnvironment  with very ambitious programmes  and wehope in the future to have the cooperation and support ofthe United Nations.14General Assembly 22nd meetingWe all share the opinion that economic developmentgoes hand in hand with social development. Therefore  itis high time for all States to adopt appropriate socialpolicies and develop structures in support of the poorest andweakest groups of the population. Unfortunately unemployment  poverty  the absence of economic securityfor the elderly  and exploitation of labour are still a verysad  indeed tragic  reality.My appeal to the world for solidarity is not justrhetorical. Solidarity is not only spiritual sharing but also and above all  the substantial support offered by the richcountries to the poor ones  the solidarity of the upperclasses with the lower classes  and even distribution ofwelfare  equal rights and opportunities. Solidarity not onlymeans substantial aid but also implies tolerance  a noblefeeling but one that is hard to achieve.We are still witnessing with amazement shameful anti-Semitic  xenophobic and racist attitudes  showing that aculture of tolerance  dialogue and respect has still to bedeveloped at all levels. The concept seems to me to bevery simple: all men are equal and no one can claim to besuperior. However  respect for others seems to be difficultto achieve  since it cannot be imposed by law or by aGovernment decision. This ambitious goal can be attainedonly through an educational process even if a long-lastingone — that involves future generations and calls uponnational and supranational institutions to carry out their ownresponsibilities.The United Nations is surely in a position to meetthese challenges and to offer the right and appropriatesolutions to the States. The role played by the UnitedNations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary — an eventwe are about to celebrate — confirms all that.International peace and security  the solution of manydomestic crises  the settlement of disputes  the beginning ofsocial and economic development  respect for human rights humanitarian help  decolonization and other legal rules ininternational relations are all fields in which the UnitedNations is working. However  continuous attention to allthe achievements of the United Nations is needed.The Organization  by adapting its structure to newcircumstances and needs  will be able to offer a strongercommitment and to be the authoritative and dynamic guidethe world needs for the future.Furthermore  San Marino gives particular importanceto a reform of the Security Council that will lead to anequitable distribution of its seats and to a greatertransparency in its work. The proper functioning of theSecurity Council  its close and coordinated relationshipwith the General Assembly  and the widest possiblerepresentation are the best guarantees that the UnitedNations will be able to carry out its tasks.In this context I believe it is appropriate toremember that small States  willing and capable ofmaking a contribution  must enjoy equal rights anddignity  since both the big Powers and the various smallcommunities are interested in the peaceful future of theworld  in the establishment of democracy and in thestrengthening of freedom.More than 50 years ago  in June 1944  the worldconflict brought death and ruin even to the neutralmountain of San Marino  which had no part in theconflict and where thousands of poor refugees  deprivedof everything except their lives  had sought shelter. Theappeal for peace launched almost 50 years ago by thesignatories of the San Francisco Charter is stilldramatically up to date. Some might think that a peacefulworld is a mere Utopia  and they might be right. But Iam firmly convinced that everyone must contribute to theachievement of this wonderful Utopia."
"152",6446,"SUR",49,1994,"Our world is moving into anew era which has not yet taken a permanent shape. Thisprocess of change entails profound transformations  someof which promote development  the rule of law  respect forhuman rights and care for the environment  while otherspresent a serious threat to life and to the world itself.During this process cultural  social and political principleswhich once seemed to be of eternal value are superseded bynew ones.In many parts of the world instability reigns  causingtragedy and chaos.In these challenging times  Sir  your unanimouselection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session merits compliments. Your election to thishigh office is a demonstration of the Member States’confidence in you. The Republic of Suriname isconvinced that under Your Excellency’s guidance ourdeliberations during this important year will producetangible results.We pay tribute to Ambassador Samuel Insanally ofGuyana for the excellent way in which he presided at theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.The vital  extraordinary and excellent manner inwhich Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali fulfils his mission asSecretary-General of the United Nations in these criticaltimes of intensified disputes  war and violence earns ourgratitude  admiration and respect. We wish to thank himmost heartily and  at the same time  congratulate him onhis important role in shaping the future of theinternational system.Events during recent years have confronted theinternational community with the reality that the demiseof the confrontational clash of ideologies did notautomatically usher in the stability and prosperity towhich we all aspire. Immense problems persist in thepolitical  social and economic spheres and at the national regional and international levels.We are witnessing the eruption  the continuation andthe spreading of severe national and ethnic rivalries  as inBosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. These conflictsand disputes have given rise to the emergence of a largenumber of displaced persons  who are subjected to theworst kind of harassment  starvation and deprivation.These manifestations are compounded by practicesthat once again leave a shameful blot on our civilization.The international community cannot close its eyes tothese practices or fail to act in the face of such horrifyingand unacceptable situations. Such crises  regardless of thevarious causes and motives from which they may ensue tend to have in common the fact that masses of innocentwomen  children and elderly people pay the price andbear the brunt of conflicts and wars.The real concern is not only the number of victimsclaimed or the scale of the destruction that may ensue butalso the possibility that the seeds of those conflicts willspread  both in the developed and in the developingcountries  in the absence of the attention of a world ordercapable of containing and addressing their causes.5It is legitimate for the international community toregard these problems as a shared burden and to strive fortheir peaceful and prompt solution on the basis of practicalcooperation. We should in the short term resort to suchmechanisms as are deemed practical to come to theimmediate rescue of those who are suffering. Furthermore we should increase our efforts to eliminate the deeprootedcauses of the unresolved national conflicts  to ensure thecivil and human rights of ethnic minorities and to promotepeaceful coexistence through respect for each other’s race colour  ethnicity  religion and sex. If we fail to do so  thesuffering will be prolonged and will threaten regional andinternational peace and security.As we discuss the issues now confronting our world we cannot but refer to the importance of building a newreality that aims at the full development of the people’spotential through the establishment of peace  the building ofdemocracy and the shaping of sound economies.We know that it is a difficult process to establishdemocracy  dependable democratic institutions and ademocratic culture. Notwithstanding the commitment orvigour with which our Governments strive to achieve thisobjective  the process is bound to be slow and full ofcomplications. Suriname is convinced  however  that wemust endeavour to reach this goal  led by the perceptionthat the core of democracy  as we see it  is not merelyadherence to an ideal system but one of the most importantprerequisites for a stable  united and integrated society thatcan swiftly settle its differences  realize its aspirations andenjoy and preserve its cultural  political and socio-economicachievements.The commitment of Suriname to the cause ofdemocracy is strengthened by the distressing experience ofthe rule of dictatorship under which its people had to livesome years ago. There are indeed tremendous effortsinvolved in bringing a democratic system back on track.Our involvement in the building of a new nationalpolitical reality establishes a link between us and theregional process of political renewal  in which Governmentsof the region are faced with the complex task of restoringand safeguarding democracy.Indeed  in Latin America and the Caribbean democracy has suffered some severe setbacks.The problems of Haiti are of particular concern to us.The violent and illegal interruption of the democraticprocess in this country has led to continued violations ofhuman rights  to increased poverty and to suffering forthe Haitian people  as well as to the flight of thousandsfrom their home country. It is against this backgroundthat my Government has granted a request to provide atemporary safe haven for Haitian refugees and haspledged its support to the multinational force.Furthermore  my Government decided to makemembers of the national army and the police forceavailable to the United Nations mission in Haiti  which within the framework of the implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 940 (1994)  will become operationalsimultaneously with the restoration of the democraticGovernment under the leadership of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.My Government’s decision to support and participatein the United Nations mission in Haiti was inspired by itsconception of regional and international responsibility tocontribute to the safeguarding of constitutional democracyin the region.We believe that our hemisphere is in need ofpermanent mechanisms to guarantee swift and directaction when democracy is threatened - for example  bythe unconstitutional take-over of Governments.The significant efforts made by the United Nationsand the Organization of American States  including thevarious resolutions adopted  the missions sent to Haiti andthe threat of an immediate military intervention  havefinally convinced the military leadership to step down notlater than 15 October.In a general sense  we are hopeful that currentdevelopments in Haiti  which are the result of initiativestaken within the framework of the United Nations  willlead to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Surinamewishes to emphasize that all efforts to restore democracyin Haiti will appear to have been in vain if the richcountries do not forthwith pool financial resources in afund for the reconstruction and development of Haiti.The developments in South Africa which led to thedemise of the abhorrent regime of apartheid and to theestablishment of a democratic and non-racist South Africahave led to the conviction that in the end the rightfulstruggle of people for justice  equality and majority rulewill meet with success. Indeed  the birth of the newSouth Africa last April has demonstrated that structuresimposed by force cannot survive the determination ofthose who seek justice.6The people and Government of the Republic ofSuriname wish to congratulate the people of South Africaand their leaders  especially President Nelson Mandela  onthis success  which will have a positive impact on the worldcommunity.We are all greatly indebted to the Special Committeeagainst Apartheid  which for 32 years played a vital role inglobal efforts to end apartheid. My country is confidentthat the new Government in South Africa will cope wellwith the new challenges it faces. We hope that theinternational community will not wait to assist the newGovernment in bringing about the necessary economic andsocial changes to build a future of security  stability andprosperity for the South African people.The many positive political changes and internationalbreakthroughs resulting from the end of the cold-war erahave had a profound influence on the problem of theMiddle East  especially the Palestine issue. The conflicthas taken a positive turn in line with those changes. MyGovernment wishes to record its satisfaction over thehistoric agreement signed between Israel and Jordan  whichfollowed the accord between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization in September 1993. The historicopportunity to achieve lasting peace has now materializedand the international community must guarantee that thisimportant momentum is not lost.The statistics of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the World Bank and the United Nations giverise to only one conclusion: that we live in a world besetby inequality  gross disparity and imbalance in thedistribution of wealth and resources  and urgent solutionsfor the economic situation of developing countries arerequired.The problem of economic imbalance is not limited toa few countries or to one region. It is a global issue - justas peace and democracy are global issues - and for thatreason this forum must deal with it as a matter of priority.No longer is it the nuclear nightmare that frightens us most:rather  it is the scourge of poverty  which continues toerode the foundations of our civilization.In Suriname  as elsewhere in Latin America  theCaribbean and other regions  bold but necessary reformshave been set in motion to eliminate obstacles todevelopment and economic competitiveness in order toadapt to new international realities. In this context  mycountry is endeavouring to rehabilitate and reconstruct thebeleaguered economy of our nation on a sound and solidfoundation.Within the framework of these economic reforms weconsider the development of human resources to be apriority issue. We consider it to be extremely importantto improve the living conditions and basic health andnutrition of our people. We are committed to these goalsbecause we believe that every human being has theultimate right to development.The austerity measures which were subscribed to bymy Government have not been easy to implement becauseof the weakness of the economy and the hardships andsuffering they impose on our people. Notwithstanding theprogress made so far  it is obvious that such anundertaking calls for the availability of vast resources which cannot be mobilized at the national level only. Wetherefore have called on the international community toprovide assistance to complement our domestic efforts.In particular  we have called on our historical partner tofulfil the agreements reached in this context and tosupport us in our attempts to create prosperity for ourpeople.We must add to this that it is our obligation to seeto it that our need for aid does not lead to therecolonization of our country.My Government shares the internationalcommunity’s concern for the fragile ecosystem in ourworld  which must be protected. Like other developingcountries  Suriname is confronted with the challenge tomeet its present development needs and simultaneouslysafeguard the environment and natural resources forgenerations to come. In trying to establish a soundbalance between development and environment myGovernment has committed itself to taking all themeasures necessary to protect and preserve theenvironment  in accordance with the guidelines adoptedby the Rio de Janeiro Conference  and has incorporatedthe concept of sustainable development in its nationaldevelopment programmes.If the international community does not have thepolitical will to deal effectively with the crises occurringin so many economies  the world will continue to lackstability and will remain vulnerable to upheavals andsetbacks that could undermine the foundations of thefuture.7In the context of the recently held InternationalConference on Population and Development and theforthcoming Fourth World Conference on Women  a WorldSummit for Social Development is therefore a timelyinitiative as it will provide an opportunity to embark on anin-depth analysis of human development in all its aspects.These international meetings should afford all of us theopportunity to address in an integrated manner the issues ofpoverty  unemployment and social integration.In Latin America and the Caribbean variousencouraging initiatives have been taken to deal effectivelywith the imperatives of economic and social developmentand to enhance the capability of the countries of the regionto respond to the pressing challenges ahead. Joint effortsaimed at the strengthening of regional integration andcooperation have been made.On 24 July 1994 in Cartagena  Colombia  we stood atthe cradle of the Association of Caribbean States  anassociation which brings together member States of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM)  the countries ofCentral America  Cuba  the Dominican Republic  Haiti Suriname  Mexico  Colombia and Venezuela. This isindeed proof of the growing awareness among theleadership in the region that closer economic and politicalrelations are tools to enhance our capacity to bringprosperity to our peoples. By joining the Association ofCaribbean States  Suriname has demonstrated that it is partof the region and wants to participate in the shaping of itsfuture.Suriname has also explored the possibility of joiningCARICOM as a full member since it believes that byjoining Suriname will both enhance its own capacity tointensify regional cooperation and bring to the CaribbeanCommunity its cultural richness and its economicopportunities.Our hemisphere  which includes both developed anddeveloping countries  is being challenged to take theopportunity provided by global changes to developinitiatives for the cultivation of international relationsconducive to prosperity for all on the basis of sustainabledevelopment  social reform and equity.In the light of these aims  my country welcomes theproposed Summit for the Americas  to be held in December1994  at which representatives of countries of the Westernhemisphere will come together to address these issues andto act as catalysts for the changes needed in thedevelopment patterns of both the countries of the North andthose of the South in order for them to reach theircommon goals.The United Nations Convention on the Law of theSea has on many occasions been described as one of themost important multilateral legal instruments of ourcentury. My Government participated actively in itspreparation  and I take great pleasure in congratulating theworld community on the coming into force of thisConvention on 16 November 1994.On behalf of my Government  I also wish to expressmy satisfaction with the agreement that has been reachedwith regard to the mining of minerals in the deep sea-bed as contemplated in the aforementioned Convention.All Members of the United Nations pledge theirsupport for the principles and initiatives of the UnitedNations. At the same time  the Member States arekeeping an eye both on the kind of support and on thelevel of assistance they can generate from thisOrganization. Suriname does so.For Suriname  many aid programmes from thespecialized agencies and other United Nations bodies havebeen hampered by the implementation of one of the maincriteria for assistance. Suriname was counted among thenet contributors of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme because our national per capita income wascalculated to be higher than $3 000. This figure is wrongbecause of an unrealistic official exchange rate. Now thatthe official exchange rate has moved to a realistic level which is more than 100 times the former rate  Surinameis looking forward to a readjustment of its status andsubsequently to a reclassification  and also to the aidprogramme that will follow this transformation.We are involved in an evolutionary process  withboth the world and the United Nations adjusting to newdemands with regard to peace  security and sustainabledevelopment. It is clear that a new international orderbased on the democratic participation of all States callsfor a restructuring and strengthening of the UnitedNations in response to its new responsibilities. Indeed the role of the United Nations has taken on morerelevance than ever before  and it is most urgent for theinternational community to restructure this Organizationin order to enable it to play the important role for whichit was created.The celebration in 1995 of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations will be a good occasion on which to8reflect on the new role of the Organization and theattainment of that objective  provided that the relationsbetween the General Assembly  the Security Council andthe Secretary-General are reorganized.My Government is committed to contributing to thesuccessful outcome of this endeavour."
"153",6470,"SVK",49,1994,"I should like to congratulateMr. Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election to the post ofPresident of the General Assembly of the United Nationsat its forty-ninth session. I wish him much success in thishighly responsible mission.At the same time  I should like to thank Mr. Essy’spredecessor as President  His Excellency AmbassadorInsanally  for his great personal contribution to thesuccess of the last session of the General Assembly.I also avail myself of this opportunity to expressdeep appreciation of all the work and effort of theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  as the head of the United Nations.Allow me to open my statement with a personalremark. During the past few years we have witnesseddynamic changes in world politics. The dynamism ofdevelopment in international life is reflected in mypersonal life. In the course of the past four years I haverepresented two States as their Ambassador to the UnitedNations. Today I am honoured and proud to representone of them - my native country  Slovakia - as itsMinister of Foreign Affairs. The fact that the PermanentRepresentative to the United Nations was nominated asthe Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country is yetanother manifestation of the respect that the UnitedNations enjoys in Slovakia.The fact that my country  less than two years afterits admission to membership of the United Nations became a full-fledged component of the community ofnations is confirmation of the credibility of our foreignpolicy  which is based on respect for international law andfor principles of democratic coexistence among nations.It is also a result of the implementation of our foreign-policy principles  which originate from the hierarchy ofvalues of Slovak society. These values are characterizedby respect for democracy  human rights and a free-marketeconomy.It is evident that Slovakia  as a small country in thegeopolitically sensitive central European region  musthave a transparent and clearly defined orientation in its20foreign policy. We therefore aim our activities at Europeanintegrationist trends and strive to join the stable  democraticand prosperous countries. Joining the European Union andparticipating actively in the elaboration of an efficientmodel of European security are among the main prioritiesof Slovak foreign policy.Our international contacts are  of course  much widerand are of a more multilateral character. We are interestedin the best possible relations with neighbouring countries.I am glad to state that we have recently managed to fulfilthis aim successfully. We believe that subregionalarrangements  such as Visegrad 4 or the central Europeaninitiative  also help to strengthen the stability of the wholeregion. Close contacts with western European countries -and these are being strengthened in respect of economic political and security matters - also contribute to thefulfilment of this objective.At the global level  the priority of the SlovakRepublic  which is part of the European region  is themaintenance of solid transatlantic relations through thedevelopment of intensive cooperation with the United Statesof America and Canada  both bilaterally and multilaterally.Further  we consider the development of cooperation withour eastern neighbours - Ukraine  the Russian Federationand other countries - as being especially important.Regardless of the fact that Slovakia is a small centralEuropean country  we strive to maintain and further developgood relations and cooperation with the countries of Asia Africa  Latin America and the Pacific region.Our tasks and goals are very demanding  and theirfulfilment depends on sufficient support from the publicand on the consensus of the major political parties. I amglad to state that in Slovakia there is wide public andpolitical agreement on the principal issues of our foreignpolicy. This is a positive signal for foreign countries which can count on Slovakia as a reliable partner.As I indicated at the beginning of my statement today’s world is defined by dynamic changes that are dueto the growing multipolarity of international relations.Many important events that occurred in the last yearadvanced the international community towards achievementof the goals of the United Nations - to guarantee thepeaceful coexistence of nations - but there have also beenevents that cannot fill us with optimism.One positive event has been the peace process in theMiddle East. Slovakia has supported this process from thevery beginning with the aim of reaching a comprehensiveand final peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.The conclusion of agreements between the State of Israeland the Palestine Liberation Organization on the provisionof limited autonomy in the zone of the Gaza Strip andJericho  and the Jordan-Israeli declaration on terminatingthe state of war  as well as on measures to settle mutualrelations  justified once more the peace efforts of theparties involved  as well as those of the internationalcommunity  which is convinced that peace can be restoredin this region.We also welcome the democratization of SouthAfrican society demonstrated by the elections in April ofthis year. Though South Africa is far from Slovakia  weput special emphasis on the continuation of thisdevelopment. The visit of the President of the SlovakRepublic to South Africa for the inauguration of PresidentMandela is evidence of this.On the other hand  even these positive examples willnot help us in successfully ending conflicts in other partsof the world. We are deeply concerned over thecontinuing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina that istaking place some 300 kilometres from our borders.Slovakia is among the countries that yearn for an end tothe continuing tragedy in that country. We wish tounderline the superiority of a political solution to amilitary one  which by definition cannot eliminate theantagonism between the opposing sides.The Slovak Republic  as a user of nuclear energy forpeaceful purposes  is a State without nuclear weapons.We therefore support a speedy signing of thecomprehensive test-ban treaty. We wish to emphasizethat such a treaty should apply to all tests withoutexception and for an indefinite period  including tests forpeaceful purposes. Sustaining the moratorium on nucleartests by all members of the nuclear club is considered bySlovakia to be the main precondition for concluding sucha treaty  and at the same time  it is a clear sign of the realintentions of the nuclear club members.We consider next year’s Review Conference of theNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to be closely linked to thenuclear-test ban. The NPT has been playing an importantrole in the history of humanity  and has managed to stopthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. We supportunequivocally the unconditional and indefinite extensionof the NPT.The Slovak Republic appreciates the stepsundertaken at the United Nations in the sphere of21transparency in armaments  whether conventional orchemical and biological. We welcome the first positiveuniversal step regarding conventional weapons: theestablishment of the Register of Conventional Arms.The verification level of the existing multilateraltreaties is in most cases either inadequate or incomplete.Many of the multilateral treaties on arms control do notcontain verification clauses - and if they do contain suchclauses  they do not make full use of verification  as in thecase of the NPT. I believe that the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destructionwill be a test case for a new type of multilateral treaty ondisarmament. The ratification of this agreement is amongthe top priorities in the agenda of our Parliament.I can assure the Assembly that Slovakia is fulfillingresponsibly and in a timely manner the obligationsconcerning confidence building  security  control ofarmaments and disarmament that have been undertaken atuniversal and regional negotiating forums. We firmlysupport all disarmament activities; hence we are well awareof the important role of the Conference on Disarmament inthis field. I would like to confirm the permanent interest ofthe Slovak Republic in resolving the issue of itsmembership in the Conference  since the formerCzechoslovak federation was a founding member of theConference. It is truly a paradox that a country in whicharms production decreased to 9 per cent of its 1989 level isnot yet a member of the Conference.We are aware of the need to improve existingorganizational structures and strengthen cooperationbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as a regionalarrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the UnitedNations Charter. The CSCE continues to adapt to the newrealities. Slovakia  however  is of the opinion that the basiccharacter of the CSCE should not change. It should remaina wide political forum and its basic principle - the adoptionof decisions by consensus - should be maintained.Peace-keeping operations are currently at a level thatis perhaps the highest that the international community canprovide and sustain. They drain our financial resources while not even sparing human lives. The originalenthusiasm for peace-keeping operations has graduallycooled down with the knowledge that there are manyobstacles that the United Nations cannot overcome. Thetragic situation in Rwanda  where even the presence ofUnited Nations forces could not avert a civil war andmassacres  is a clear example. The United Nations peace-keeping operation on the territory of the formerYugoslavia has also encountered serious problems. TheSlovak Republic has a contingent of 600 soldiers in theUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) -members of the engineering unit who among theirmilitary tasks provide highly specialized expert work andassistance in restoring that country  which has suffered somuch tribulation. Along with their efforts in themaintenance of peace  they have undertaken thedangerous task of removing mines from the country.Slovakia strongly supports President Clinton’s appealin his statement before the General Assembly on Mondayfor the conclusion of an agreement that would reduce thenumber and availability of anti-personnel land-mines. Iwould like to mention that Slovakia  in accordance withresolution 48/75 K  has already implemented  on 17 April1994  a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines for an indefinite period.In connection with United Nations efforts to resolveseveral problems that have arisen in the field of peace-keeping operations  the Slovak Republic welcomes thedecision to establish stand-by forces that can bedispatched on short notice and under the command of theUnited Nations. We have declared our interest incontributing to these units with engineers of the SlovakArmy. Such units need highly specialized and thoroughpreparation and training designed for specific purposes.My country is in the process of building such a trainingcentre and has already used it to train more than 1 200members of United Nations peace-keeping forces sinceMay of this year.Experience has shown that the traditional type ofpeace-keeping operation is no longer sufficient. If apeace-keeping operation is to succeed it should contain ahumanitarian element. Slovakia is of the opinion that inany operation under United Nations auspices and withUnited Nations coordination it is necessary to respect theprinciple of the priority of United Nations command.In connection with the increased number of attacksagainst United Nations personnel  the Slovak Republicappreciates the Assembly’s decision at its forty-eighthsession to elaborate an international convention dealingwith the safety and security of United Nations andassociated personnel. The next step the United Nationsshould consider is providing proper armament and othermatériel for members of peace-keeping missions so thatthey might be able to react more appropriately to22changing conditions and if necessary be able to defendthemselves.The Slovak Republic respects human rights andwelcomes all international initiatives which could bringresults in this sphere. We highly appreciate thecommencement of the activities of the High Commissionerfor Human Rights. We believe that this post will be anactive United Nations instrument to guarantee the protectionof human rights  especially where they are most flagrantlyviolated. At the beginning of 1994 we opened the SlovakNational Centre for Human Rights in Bratislava. In thisconnection  I wish to express our gratitude to theNetherlands for its assistance in establishing this institution.The gravity of the problem of refugees continues toincrease. I express the hope that the United Nations willnot underestimate this problem and that the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will nolonger have to fight financial problems in future.The Slovak Republic supports the reform of the UnitedNations. It considers the revitalization and restructuring ofthe Security Council to be one of the crucial issues. Wehope that the solution adopted will increase the efficiencyof the Security Council and will contribute to the overallstrengthening of the United Nations. We are of the opinionthat new permanent members of the Security Council musthave a global responsibility and be able to meet the ensuingfinancial obligations.When the mandate of the Security Council is fulfilledand sanctions are implemented  more attention should bepaid to possible adverse impacts on third countries. We areconvinced that effective mechanisms of assistance toaffected third countries should be seriously considered andestablished as soon as possible.Slovakia encounters many problems connected withthe transformation of society. It is crucial to solve theeconomic and social issues of a transition processunprecedented in scale and method. The United Nations with its organs and specialized agencies  has anirreplaceable role in assisting their solution.I should now like to give some facts on the economicsituation of the Slovak Republic. Now that the first  basicsteps of transformation have been taken  the main goal ofthe Slovak economy is to create permanent macroeconomicstability and conditions for substantial economic growth inthe years to come. My country  with 5.3 millioninhabitants and with exports about 50 per cent of grossdomestic product  can be considered a small  openeconomy. The Slovak Government is concentrating onspeeding up those reforms which should result in thequick transformation of ownership relations.Considerable progress has been made in macroeconomicstabilization in the first six months of 1994. Real grossdomestic product has increased by 4.4 per cent. TheState budget deficit represents only 3.8 per cent of grossdomestic product  and is considered a positive indicator.Thanks to cooperation with  and assistance from  theInternational Monetary Fund  the foreign currencyreserves of the Central Bank have increased. These dataare considered to be the first sign of economic revival.Economic cooperation and  within its framework international assistance are prerequisites for furtherdevelopment of economies in transition. United Nationsorgans and specialized agencies cooperate intensively withmy Government. Thanks to this cooperation  theeconomic situation is substantially better than had beenanticipated  and the Slovak Republic has become anaccepted international partner in economic cooperation.The Slovak Republic welcomes the increasedattention by  and efforts of  the United Nations aimed atbringing the issues of development and economiccooperation to the foreground. We hope that the agendafor development will initiate concrete steps in this sphere.We particularly appreciate the efforts of the UnitedNations in helping to resolve problems and difficultiesencountered by the countries transforming theireconomies  and we are of the opinion that within theUnited Nations framework there are more opportunities tofacilitate and speed up the integration of these economiesinto the world economy.In the past decade the number of least developedcountries has increased horrendously. This results in anurgent appeal to all mankind  but especially theindustrially developed countries. However  at the sametime we cannot avoid the primary responsibility of theleast developed countries for their own destiny. TheSlovak Republic offers assistance  within its own meansand possibilities  especially through the participation ofSlovak experts in development programmes - forexample  in education and health care. Slovakia isprepared to engage in organizational work for theInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty  1996.I should also like to emphasize the importance of therecently concluded International Conference on Populationand Development  held in Cairo. The fact that it23succeeded in reaching an agreement and adopting the FinalDocument is a signal that the international community isaware of its responsibility for global issues of humanity and that international conferences and discussions are theonly right battlefield for the solution of problems  no matterhow sensitive and complicated they may be.As can be seen from the facts I have set out  Slovakia as one of the youngest Members of the United Nations wishes not only to ""take""  but also intends to be activelyinvolved in United Nations programmes  and has thecapabilities. My country has much to offer developingcountries. Slovak experts  with their know-how andexperience  are prepared actively to participate in UnitedNations development programmes. Slovak products andtechnologies tested under demanding conditions couldcontribute to the efficiency of these developmentprogrammes. In the sphere of the development of humanresources  Slovakia  with a long tradition in this field  offersa variety of courses at universities.My country has a difficult task to carry out:transformation of the economy. The United Nations alsohas a difficult task; that of adapting itself to the newrealities and adjusting its structure and activitiesaccordingly. I wish to assure the Assembly that the SlovakRepublic is prepared to do its utmost to carry out the firsttask and to participate actively in the activities of theUnited Nations.I wish to conclude my statement by wishing muchsuccess to this year’s session of the General Assembly."
"154",6495,"SVN",49,1994," Please allow me tocongratulate you  Sir  and Côte d’Ivoire on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. Our deliberations under your presidency arecertain to be a success. May I also take this occasion tothank His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally  thePermanent Representative of the Republic of Guyana  forhis many contributions as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session.The economic and political changes currently underway have raised the hopes of all of us for a better future.Democracy has been restored to much of the world  thusnot only showing that it is the most suitable model ofgovernment  but also making possible a greater degree ofinternational cooperation  strengthening the rule ofinternational law and giving the United Nations a morepowerful role.In Eastern Europe  the process of democratic changeis now irreversible. Though much is made of the dangersof new ethnic conflicts and the rise of newultra-nationalistic and totalitarian forces  they become everless likely to succeed with each day that passes. Have wenot seen two of the most apparently intractable problems -the Middle East and South Africa - brought to a peacefulconclusion? The Middle East was a crucible of conflict;apartheid in South Africa was a disgrace to the entirehuman race. Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela showed bothpolitical wisdom and human tolerance in agreeing on atransition for the Republic of South Africa. South Africawill play a major role in future developments in theAfrican continent.Those are just some causes for optimism. Butoptimism does not mean expecting that all our crises willsimply resolve themselves without any action on our part.If our collective hopes and desires are to lead anywhere then the work must begin here at the United Nations where representatives from the entire world are gathered.The time has come when we can make this world a betterplace to live.Never in the history of the world has the awarenessof the global nature of the basic issues been as strong asit is today. Never has the desire for cooperation betweennations so clearly superseded the wish for the dominationof one nation by another. And never has man had somuch knowledge and technology at his fingertips as hehas today. All of these factors are predispositions for agreater role for the United Nations  and we must doeverything to ensure that the mechanisms of the UnitedNations work more effectively.We support the efforts for the reconstruction of theSecurity Council. The Security Council ought to enhanceboth its effectiveness and its efficiency  as well as itsrepresentational capacity. A measured  realistic expansionof the composition of the Council would be appropriate.Furthermore  Slovenia supports the proposal that Germanyand Japan become permanent members of the Council.An additional task in this regard relates to the needto enhance the transparency of the work of the Security11Council. The system of consultations should be developedfurther  so as to provide an adequate opportunity for theparticipation of United Nations Member States interested invarious situations dealt with by the Security Council.The General Assembly could also make a greatercontribution to the development of adequate approaches onthe part of the Security Council  as well as to less costlyand more effective methods of preventive diplomacy  andat the same time decrease the need for the Security Councilto intervene in armed conflicts.Furthermore  in recent years the General Assembly hastaken an important step in this direction through theestablishment of the post of High Commissioner for HumanRights.Last  but not least  it is important to do as much aspossible to strengthen the United Nations financially  eventhough the finance ministers in each and every Membercountry find that their contributions to the United Nationsare a significant component of their State budget. Sloveniais committed to the principle that contributions to theUnited Nations must be paid in full and on time. Theregular payment of contributions is an essential part of allefforts aimed at the financial reform of the United Nations.The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and the recentConference on Population and Development have broughtthis Organization into the public consciousness in a newway; they have shown that we are conscious of some of themost fundamental problems that face all of us  not justGovernments  but the people. Though some may besceptical about the results of these Conferences  my feelingis that they have contributed significantly towards a globalconsensus and have involved a whole new constituency inour work.The maintenance of international peace and security isenshrined in the United Nations Charter as the mainpurpose of the Organization. I believe that one of the mostimportant questions to be dealt with is dealing with theprovision of armed forces acting within the framework ofUnited Nations operations. The variety and complexity ofUnited Nations military and related activities havedeveloped far beyond what was once defined as""peace-keeping"". Careful reflection is needed on futuredirections to be taken. Slovenia welcomes the Secretary-General’s current efforts to develop a system of stand-byforces and is ready to participate in these efforts.The maintenance of international peace and securitymust be strengthened by effective measures in the field ofdisarmament. Slovenia is  like most other States Partiesto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  convinced of the need for indefinite extensionof that Treaty. Furthermore we are convinced of the needfor enhanced security guarantees  in particular negativesecurity guarantees. We also support the efforts toachieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing and otherdisarmament measures with respect to weapons of massdestruction. With respect to conventional weapons  wesupport the United States initiative for the conclusion ofan agreement to reduce the number and availability ofanti-personnel land-mines. In short  the issues ofdisarmament ought to remain high among the priorities ofthe United Nations agenda.The protection of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms is another of the highest priorities of the UnitedNations. For the Republic of Slovenia  it represents botha basic domestic task and a strong internationalcommitment. Slovenia actively participated in the WorldConference on Human Rights  held in Vienna in 1993 and in the subsequent efforts leading to the appointmentof the United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights.By the same token  we support the efforts for furtherdevelopment of the United Nations system in the field ofhuman rights. We are ready to contribute to the work ofthe Working Group of the Third Committee in its searchfor the appropriate methods of protection of human rights.Here again we believe that prevention is better than cure and that appropriate international action is necessary inorder to prevent situations characterized by violations ofhuman rights.The United Nations is confronted with a variety ofsituations involving the use of force. The armed conflictsin the Balkans are among the most difficult situations.Slovenia is the only successor State of thenow-disintegrated former Yugoslavia which is not directlythreatened by the ongoing conflict in that region. Nonethe less  Slovenia remains vitally interested in the stabilityof the Balkans. The horrors of war against ordinarycitizens  mass violations of human rights and breaches ofthe United Nations Charter first in the Republic of Croatiaand now in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovinacause serious concern to the entire internationalcommunity.I will not be telling Members anything new when Isay that the international community was not prepared for12the eruption of the crisis that occurred within the territoryof the former Yugoslavia. Unfortunately  the conflict thatwas subsequently to occur within Bosnia and Herzegovinahas seriously damaged the image and credibility of theUnited Nations. It is true that without the involvement ofthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR)  working in conjunction with manyhumanitarian organizations  the tragedy in Bosnia wouldhave been even worse. But humanitarian assistance alonecannot be considered as a substitute for effective policy.Such achievements as the Washington Agreement concluded between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats  do atleast raise some hope that appropriate internationalassistance can meaningfully influence the political aspectsof the conflict. Nevertheless  the continuation of themilitant behaviour by the Bosnian Serbs maintains the needfor the option of lifting of the arms embargo against thelegitimate Government of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina to remain on the agenda. This war  with allits consequences  is threatening to continue into a thirdwinter  and I am afraid that this certainly most risky andnegative of options will be the only one left if theinternational community does not prove able to bring aboutan end to hostilities and open the way towards a viablepeace with the necessary elements of justice.I would like to end this sad chapter of my addresswith a warning. We should by no means forget that theterrifying pattern of ""ethnic cleansing"" has been patented inthe conflicts that have occurred across the territories ofseveral successor States of the former Yugoslavia.Regardless of the final outcome of these conflicts in theBalkans  we must seriously consider all the means andmethods at our disposal that may prevent a repetition ofthis pattern of events occurring in other parts of the world.I speak for a country which has the good fortune notto be a problem  but a country which seeks solutions. Inthe less than two years in which our independence wasinternationally recognized  we have  under difficultcircumstances  achieved positive economic growth. Wehave managed to maintain a high level of social securityand stability. The transformation and reform of oureconomy has gone hand-in-hand with the rapid growth ofour democratic institutions. We are paying special attentionto the protection of human rights and of our ethnicminorities. Slovenia is a member of the Council of Europe;we have signed the Partnership for Peace and the Pact ofStability; Slovenia is a factor of stability in Europe andstrives to be an active part of Europe’s integration.I do not wish to imply that there are no obstacles tothe progress of that integration. Europe may have highlevels of prosperity and deeply rooted democracies and itmay be one of the most stable regions in the world  butthe ghosts of the past and leanings towards near-forgottenforms of nationalistic chauvinism are still with us. Theseare in direct contradiction to the very idea of acooperative and multicultural Europe; they endanger theprocesses of integration. Unexplained and unjustifiableimpediments have already been raised against Slovenia’sassociation with the European Union.In closing  allow me to express Slovenia’s greatsatisfaction that our proposal that the moral and ethicalaspects of social developments be considered at the WorldSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen next yearhas been widely accepted. We are particularly glad thatSlovenia will have the honour to host the United Nationsseminar on the ethical and spiritual dimensions of socialprogress and development  an event to which we attachgreat importance. If one thing is certain  it is thateconomic  scientific and technological views ondevelopment do not exist in a vacuum. The UnitedNations Charter calls for the fostering of the prosperity harmony and freedom of people both as individuals andas cultural entities. This ultimate objective should beborne in mind in all the United Nations endeavours.It is my hope that under your leadership  theAssembly will take positive steps in that direction."
"155",6540,"SWE",49,1994,"May I at the outsetexpress my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection to the important post of President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session.The loss of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea  wheremore than 900 people perished  brought disaster close toour shores. The shock still lingers in the hearts and mindsof all people around the Baltic. I am certain that this tragicevent will in the end bring the stricken peoples even closertogether. Let me convey our sincere gratitude for thesympathy and condolences that have been expressed in thisAssembly.Sweden’s commitment to the United Nations and itsprinciples and ideals is longstanding  firm and deep. To thenew Swedish Government this commitment is crucial. Thefiftieth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations isapproaching. It is perhaps the most important politicaldocument in the hands of humanity today. Its strength andpotential are immense and must be brought to fruition.In the spirit of the Charter  world leaders shouldmobilize a global civic spirit of solidarity to extend thescope of and respect for international law and tostrengthen global governance. The United Nations givesus an international system of law to avoid anarchy andthe rule of the strongest. The United Nations enables usto work together to thwart ruthless assertion ofself-interest and spheres of influence.Sweden wants a United Nations which reactseffectively against atrocities and mitigates humansuffering and through which we can tackle the majorquestions of global survival  together and in solidarity.Sweden wants a United Nations that not only is a forumfor the interests of States but that places the well-being ofthe individual at the centre. Solidarity does not recognizeborders. Let me quote from the statement of thePresident of South Africa  Nelson Mandela  in thisAssembly a week ago:""The millions across our globe who stand expectantat the gates of hope look to this Organization tobring them peace  to bring them life  to bring thema life worth living."" (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Forty-ninth Session  PlenaryMeetings  14th meeting  p. 10)These expectations and hopes are threatened by warand violence  by the suppression of human rights  and byracism and xenophobia. They are threatened bystarvation  poverty  disasters and environmentaldegradation. Peace and security  democracy  humanrights and sustainable economic and social developmentconstitute a cohesive entity. If we neglect any of thesevalues  we endanger the others.Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania are here among us inthis Assembly as democratic and sovereign countries fromwhich Russian troops have at long last been withdrawn.Diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East offer hopesfor a comprehensive and lasting peace. In El Salvador theUnited Nations has made a significant contribution toending the civil war. In South Africa  the apartheid hasbeen dismantled.Yet we are confronted with new conflicts and dangers.We must all learn from tragic events such as those inRwanda and Somalia. The inconceivable suffering inRwanda points to the need for preventive diplomacy  earlyaction and the coordination of United Nations efforts. InSomalia  the break-up of organized society and the ensuinglarge-scale violence and starvation underline the need forthe careful coordination of peace-keeping  peacemaking andpeace-building endeavours.While taking a forceful attitude to gain respect  theUnited Nations should avoid military enforcement otherthan as a very last resort and with a clear Security Councilmandate.In Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other parts of theformer Yugoslavia  efforts to end the conflict must beintensified and accepted by all parties. Pressure on BosnianSerbs has to be further increased. Only in peace can thetragic consequences of ""ethnic cleansing"" be reversed.Now is the time to work out plans for reconstruction andreconciliation.The Swedish Government is concerned aboutinformation on Iraqi military activity close to the borderwith Kuwait. We fully support the statement on thesituation made by the Security Council three days ago.In facing the challenges of the post-cold-warinternational system  Member States must give their fullsupport to the United Nations  but they must also activelypromote necessary reforms of the Organization. TheCommission on Global Governance  headed by the SwedishPrime Minister and by Mr. Ramphal  will present proposalsfor reform early next year.Let me mention a few areas where  in my view reform is urgently needed.The United Nations must be able to operate moreefficiently and according to modern principles ofmanagement  and new priorities have to be set.We need an enlarged and more effective SecurityCouncil  one that is both legitimate and representative.There is a need for increased transparency in the work ofthe Council. Countries in all regions must feel that theyare partners in its actions. The Council has to maintainpolitical control over the actions it authorizes. It must notbecome an instrument for dividing the world into spheresof interest  one in which the collective nature of UnitedNations action is not sufficiently safeguarded.Sweden has drawn experience from its participationin the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).Substantive consultations between troop contributors  theSecretariat and Security Council members on a formaland regular basis are necessary.There must be a particular focus on early warningand early action in conflict resolution. Preventivediplomacy should be further strengthened. Thousands oflives can be saved and costly relief efforts avoided ifaction is taken in time.The new Swedish Government is ready to establisha United Nations peace-keeping brigade. We do this inresponse to the Secretary-General’s proposal for stand-byforces set up by Member States  ready to be deployed incrisis areas without delay.The need for better and more uniform training ofpeace-keepers is urgent. Particular attention should bepaid to improved coordination between the militaryaspects of peace-keeping and civilian and humanitarianefforts. With this in mind  Sweden is prepared tocontribute to improved training of peace-keepers.Sweden would like to see closer interaction betweenhumanitarian programmes and peace-keeping operations.There is great potential for humanitarian action as a toolof preventive diplomacy  as well as for promoting apolitical climate that can facilitate the peaceful settlementof disputes at an early stage.The reluctance of Member States to pay their duesin full and on time is frustrating and must ceaseimmediately. When this lack of discipline affects thefinancing of peace-keeping operations  it puts anadditional burden on the troop contributors.2Sweden welcomes measures by the Department ofHumanitarian Affairs to coordinate the activities ofhumanitarian agencies and many non-governmentalorganizations.Human rights is another area of priority for theSwedish Government. Fortunately  there is a growing andwidening awareness among Member States of the role ofhuman rights and democracy for the development ofmodern societies. Binding norms protecting human rightsexist  yet violations continue. This is unacceptable.Governments must show the will and commitment to fullyimplement human rights norms.The Convention on the Rights of the Child was a greatachievement. It is indeed a great challenge to assure allchildren of care  protection  education and freedom fromhunger and from physical or mental violence  as providedfor in the Convention and reaffirmed at the World Summitfor Children. Governments which have ratified theConvention must live up to their commitments to thechildren of the world.Solidarity is fundamental in our efforts to overcomeglobal economic and social challenges  and  thus fundamental to prospects for peace and solidarity. TheUnited Nations has a unique and central role in thisendeavour.Sweden’s development cooperation will focus onsupport for the long-term  sustainable development of poorcountries  with special emphasis on democracy  popularparticipation and the rights of women and children.Sweden will continue to allocate a substantial amountof its assistance to operational activities in the UnitedNations. We will also continue our efforts to strengthen theUnited Nations function as a forum for normativediscussion and action and as a channel for developmentcooperation. The quality and effectiveness of UnitedNations activities in the economic and social field have tobe improved  while at the same a stable and predictableflow of resources is secured.Priorities and the allocation of responsibilities withinthe international community need to be discussed further.""An Agenda for Development"" (A/48/935) is a keyinstrument in this endeavour. We must use it to draw upa clear and strategic programme of action for the UnitedNations system in the development area.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment to be held in Copenhagen  and the FourthWorld Conference on Women in Beijing are all linked.They contribute to the achievement of human security ina broader sense.The Cairo Conference established that questions ofpopulation and development must be treated together.The starting-point must be the human being and the rightsand security of the individual.Agenda 21  adopted at the Rio Conference facilitates joint action to achieve sustainable developmentat both the local and the global level. All over Swedenlocal versions of Agenda 21 are now being activelypursued.It is imperative to stop wasting resources andthereby depriving future generations of their means oflivelihood. Patterns of consumption and production mustbe sustainable. In this regard  the developed countrieshave a particular responsibility. Ecological balance mustbe established also while we combat poverty.Disarmament and the non-proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction are central to the goals of preventingconflicts  promoting peace and fostering economic andsocial development. In recent years important progresshas been made. Agreements that were inconceivable onlya few years ago have been concluded. But signatures arenot enough. Agreements must also be ratified andimplemented if they are to contribute to peace andsecurity.Furthermore  the present momentum should be usedto strengthen and further develop well-establisheddisarmament regimes. The need to establish a verificationsystem for the Convention on biological weapons is acase in point.The non-proliferation Treaty is a key to both nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation. The Treaty is theonly multilateral agreement in which nuclear-weaponStates have committed themselves to nucleardisarmament. As long as nuclear weapons exist  we mustinsist that these commitments be honoured. It is not leastwith this in mind that the extension of the Treaty shouldbe pursued. Our common goal must be a world free ofnuclear arms.3On several occasions  Sweden has presented proposalsfor a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are gratified thatall States  including the nuclear-weapon States  are nowprepared to negotiate such a treaty. It is essential that thesenegotiations be concluded in the very near future.Sweden was one of the first countries to ratify thechemical weapons Convention. So far  almost 160 Stateshave signed the Convention  but only 16 have ratified it.We urge all States to take the necessary steps forratification  so that the Convention can enter into forcewithout delay.Some 100 million land-mines all over the worldrepresent both an acute and an impending humanitariandisaster as well as a threat to economic development  evenyears and decades after hostilities have ceased. Thelong-term solution is an international agreement to bananti-personnel land-mines. Sweden has proposed such aban.Regional instruments for preventing and dealing withconflicts are being developed. This should not deprive theregions involved of support from the internationalcommunity through the United Nations. The responsibilityof the United Nations  including the Security Council remains universal.The Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE) is a central and indispensable institution forconflict prevention and management. The endeavours ofthe CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities haveeffectively contributed to building security in Europe  ashave the CSCE missions in the field.The Swedish experience of cooperation between theCSCE and the United Nations tells us that global andregional efforts are not in contradiction but are mutuallyreinforcing.Sweden’s non-participation in military alliancesremains unchanged. This policy contributes to themaintenance of stability in the north of Europe  andimproves our possibilities of working for common securityin Europe and in the world at large.Sweden will actively contribute to the new securitypartnership in Europe by responding rapidly to requestsfrom the United Nations  and by contributing substantiallyto activities of the Council of Europe  the CSCE and thePartnership for Peace arrangement. We want to strengthencooperation with all our neighbours around the Baltic Seaand in the Barents Sea region. We look forward tocooperation in all areas with the new  democratic Russia.Sweden has applied for membership in the EuropeanUnion. In one month the people of Sweden will decideon this important question in a referendum. As a memberof the Union  Sweden would whole-heartedly support theUnion’s efforts to promote security and economic andsocial development  not only in Europe but on a globalscale. It is by looking outwards  by forging links andextending its cooperation to other regions  that theEuropean Union makes its contribution to global stabilityand solidarity. Let me emphasize that there is nocontradiction between European and global cooperation.Sweden will be an active member of the United Nationsand defend openness and international cooperation.Sweden has presented its candidature for a seat onthe Security Council for the period 1997 to 1998. TheSwedish candidature is based on our commitment toglobal security  on our will to promote international law and on our conviction that conflicts can and must besolved by addressing their root causes before they lead towar.Sweden’s support for the United Nations is afundamental national interest and a cornerstone in ourforeign policy  for reasons of peace  freedom  security democracy and justice. For these reasons  Sweden willstrongly promote the United Nations — a United Nationsbased on democratic principles  giving us all a voice inour common future."
"156",6578,"SWZ",49,1994,"I bring with me thegreetings and good wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III Her Majesty the Indlovukazi  the Government and peopleof the Kingdom of Swaziland to all our friends and fellowMembers of the United Nations.On behalf of Swaziland  may I begin by offering mysincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. We are confident that with your able leadershipour deliberations will be guided towards a successfulconclusion  for the benefit of the global community.Let me also offer Swaziland’s gratitude and praise toyour predecessor  whose wise direction ensured thesuccess of the deliberations of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.The past 12 months have presented many challengesto our Organization  in its pivotal role as an effectiveinstrument for fostering global peace and security  and asa dynamic forum for promoting a spirit of understandingand cooperation among the nations of the world.Clearly  significant progress has been made inmeeting these challenges  and my delegation recognizesthe role of the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose diplomatic skills anduntiring efforts have contributed so greatly to thecontinuing ability of the United Nations to achieve thesuccesses on which the whole world depends.In April this year  the eyes of the world werefocused on South Africa as the people of that countrywent to the polls to elect  for the first time  a Governmentthat would represent all South Africans  regardless ofrace  religion or creed. Today  in a triumph for the spiritof reconciliation  peace and compromise among all SouthAfricans  we welcome the new  non-racial and democraticSouth Africa back into the family of the United Nations.While congratulating the people of South Africa fortheir substantial achievement  the Kingdom of Swazilandalso salutes the role of the United Nations in bringing aboutan end to a regime it had long opposed. As a result themillions of South African people who had been denied avoice in this Hall will once more be heard. South Africa’striumph is therefore also a victory for the principle ofuniversality  on which the United Nations was founded.As neighbour  partner and ally  Swaziland  and theother countries in the subregion  have particular reason torejoice at the successful process of transition in SouthAfrica. Quite apart from the benefit of peace to the areabrought about by a successful political transformation  weall look forward to enjoying the fruits of closer economicand trade cooperation with the region’s most influentialcountry.Swaziland has been most impressed with the veryclear policy of His Excellency President Mandela  statedconsistently since he took office in May  on the importanceof close cooperation with others in the region.We have already welcomed South Africa into theSouthern African Development Community  and otherinitiatives are under way to forge closer trade and economiclinks between our newly liberated neighbour and the rest ofthe subregion  for South Africa cannot expect to stand onits own in the future. It is a fact that the economicdestinies of the nations in our subregion are inextricablybound together.Even as we celebrate the return of peace and stabilityin South Africa  our continent continues to provide some ofthe worst examples of people’s inhumanity to one another.Swaziland watched with horror as the tragedy unfoldedearlier this year in Rwanda. Many words have been spokenhere about the dreadful scenes we all witnessed  and ourhearts went out to the millions whose lives were shatteredby the effects of the civil war there. No other justificationis needed to spur on our efforts to address the issue ofconflict prevention and resolution than the loss of so manylives  so quickly  in Rwanda. We pray that a formula fortrue  lasting peace may be found  and that the two peoplesmay be able to find some way of living side by side witheach other.The situations in Burundi  Liberia  Sudan and Somaliaalso continue to give us cause for grave concern.Swaziland supports all peaceful efforts aimed at bringingabout negotiated settlements to the problems in thesecountries.Despite the many set-backs to peace on ourcontinent  the past twelve months have also seensubstantial progress among a number of countries -progress which owes much to the efforts of ourOrganization.I have spoken already of our admiration for thedevelopments in one of our neighbouring countries  SouthAfrica  which took the path of reconciliation and peacetowards the much-needed process of reconstruction anddevelopment.The same degree of respect applies to our otherneighbour  Mozambique  which  after so long a period ofbitter hatred amongst its people  has at last chosen to laydown weapons in favour of the ballot box. Swazilandjoins the world in praying for a peaceful election processlater this month  and calls on the leaders to allow thesame spirit of reconciliation and unity that brought an endto the war after so many years to continue after a newgovernment has been chosen.We appeal to the international community tocontinue to provide the financial  technical  moral andmaterial support that will be necessary for Mozambiqueto rebuild itself  and to give its people a chance to fulfiltheir high potential.The Kingdom of Swaziland warmly welcomes theagreement that brought about a peaceful solution to thesituation prevailing in our sister Kingdom of Lesotho.We welcome the opportunity presented now for theBasotho people themselves to address their concerns. Itis our fervent hope that the agreement will beimplemented successfully  without undue delay  so thatlasting peace and stability may come to the kingdom.The direct effects of developments on our continentare of obvious concern to the Kingdom of Swaziland.But in this day and age of global interdependence  thepotential effects on us of situations outside Africa are ofequal importance. Two recent developments provideparticular cause for hope in areas of long-running dispute.In the Middle East  the seeds of peace andreconciliation  sown last year by Prime Minister Rabinand Chairman Arafat  and encouraged by the UnitedStates  Norway  the United Nations and others  are at lastbearing fruit. Talk of trade and cooperation is replacing2the noise of gunfire  as the bitter rivalries of generationsgive way to a new order of peace in the region.Swaziland salutes all those who contributed to theprocess of peace in the Middle East; we appeal to theleaders of the region to join in the process and to allow itto continue without disruption  so that precious resourcesmay be directed towards worthwhile development goals.The Kingdom of Swaziland has long been concernedabout the spread of nuclear weapons  and the effect this hashad on world stability. We were therefore encouraged bythe recent initiatives on the part of the United States andRussia to substantially reduce the number of their weapons.We also support all efforts on the Korean peninsula where disaster has been pending  to bring about realprogress on the nuclear issue. This issue has been thefocus of major instability for the entire far-east region  andSwaziland fully supports all efforts to bring about apeaceful resolution to the problem.We look forward to the peaceful reunification of thetwo Koreas  and encourage all moves to bring this tofruition.Wars and conflict situations in Africa and around theworld continue to stretch our belief that people can everlive peacefully with one another. More and more  theresources of the United Nations are being overextended tomeet the challenges these situations present  and conflictresolution finds itself close to the top of the agenda foraction by this Assembly.Mercifully  the Kingdom of Swaziland has been sparedthe horrors of internal conflict  but no country can reallyfeel immune to the effects of war and confrontation wherever these may be occurring. Deciding on the bestway for the world to cope with conflict situations istherefore a problem we all share  and we in Africa areconscious of our particular responsibility for deciding onmechanisms to limit  prevent and cope with conflictsituations developing on our continent.This issue has been central during discussions atsubregional and regional conferences. Most recently important resolutions were adopted at the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) summit in Tunis  and at the SouthernAfrica Development Community summit in Gaborone which went some way towards deciding on the regionalresponse to one of Africa’s most pressing problems.But despite almost unanimous willingness for ourcountries to become involved more directly in thecontinent’s conflicts  it was clearly recognized that themajority of us lacked the resources to lend an effectivehand.The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore supports thegrowing call for an integrated approach to conflictresolution on our continent  which would bring closecooperation between Africa and the rest of the world byestablishing mechanisms to coordinate the resources ofboth in the most effective way. The OAU is clearly inthe best place to mobilize the efforts of its members - andmost important of all  to undertake preventive diplomacybefore a situation has the chance to develop - while theUnited Nations can continue to play its role ascoordinator of the international response.Many of Africa’s present conflicts could well havebeen prevented or contained if properly coordinatedmechanisms had already been in place. The Kingdom ofSwaziland welcomes discussion here so that a plan ofaction can be agreed upon quickly on this vitallyimportant issue.In this regard  and as a measure of Swaziland’sacceptance of her responsibility to the rest of the world His Majesty King Mswati III announced at the OAUsummit in Tunis this year that he would be taking stepsto decide how best the Kingdom’s small defence forcecould be used alongside other troops in multinationalforces for the benefit of global peace and stability.His Majesty has begun the process of investigatingunder what conditions the nation’s soldiers can beoffered  bearing in mind the small size of the defenceforce and our relative lack of appropriate weapons andequipment. Clearly  we cannot allow our soldiers to enterinto potentially dangerous situations without properprotection and without adequate training.These are some of the issues to be looked at beforewe can fully commit ourselves to taking this more activerole in global peace-keeping  and we will be approachingthe Secretary-General for consultations on this importantinitiative.This session of the General Assembly is entrustedwith the task of discussing ""An Agenda forDevelopment"". The focus of the world is on therequirement now to channel our resources towardsachieving lasting global stability through the sustainable3development of our countries  providing us with improvedstandards for all our peoples.The welcome end to the period of confrontationbetween the world’s super-Powers should mean thatincreased global resources can now be redirected toachieving a new and more balanced world economic order.Closer attention can now be given to the plight of alldeveloping countries  which continue to suffer the effectsof serious development neglect. This crucial point wasdiscussed at length at last weekend’s meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in Madrid  where theview of the developing world was made very clear.The continent of Africa contains the highest numberof the world’s poorest countries  and any agenda fordevelopment should take into account the specialcircumstances surrounding the inability of this region todevelop effectively.We in the region know ourselves  all too well  whatfactors continue to obstruct our progress. It is a familiarcatalogue  including resource constraints; inappropriatedevelopment policies; the slow pace of industrialization andtransformation into producers of processed goods;inadequate infrastructure; natural disasters; and a continuinground of armed conflicts.We know the problems  and we are trying our best toovercome them. We understand our responsibility to ourpeople to mobilize our resources in the most effective wayto overcome the obstacles to national development. Theneed is clear  and our resources and abilities are limited but we are trying hard. We also recognize that we cannothope to achieve long-term sustainable development without at least  the short-term assistance of the rest of the globalcommunity.Much of what we need is contained in the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the1990s  and our continent’s collective appeal is for the swiftand full implementation of its many programmes. But eachnation has its separate  distinct needs.Swaziland welcomes recent initiatives towardsstrengthening South-South cooperation  and we believe theywill result in real progress towards overcoming theeconomic challenges facing us all in that grouping.In trying to meet our national economic developmentobjectives  the Kingdom of Swaziland has adopted a broadand integrated approach aimed at achieving sustainable ""human-centred"" development  through policies that focuson the priorities of the reduction of poverty  universalaccess to primary school  and affordable primary healthcare.Recent United Nations initiatives also guide us inour Government policies. As a follow-up to the EarthSummit  for example  we have established a nationalenvironmental authority to ensure that environmentalconcerns are properly integrated into all stages of publicpolicy and national development strategy formulation.Swaziland welcomed the opportunity to address therecent United Nations Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo  and the adoption of theProgramme of Action constitutes a significant step in ourcollective aim. The Kingdom had already embraced theoption of acceptable child spacing as the cornerstone ofour population growth policy  and we have begun acomprehensive programme of education for our people inthe realities of and efforts to deal with overpopulation.These and all aspects of the economic developmentof the Kingdom will be debated by the whole nationduring the process of national economic consultation which was recently initiated by His Majesty the King.The process is designed to allow all Swazis theopportunity to be involved in deciding the future directionof the Kingdom’s economy  and will embody the nation’swishes for future priorities and strategies. These in turnwill form the basis of our request for future support fromour friends in the international community  and we will bekeeping the United Nations fully informed ofdevelopments.The process follows on from last year’s verysuccessful political reforms  resulting from a similarperiod of national consultation  which concluded lastOctober with direct elections to Parliament under a newsystem of secret ballot. The democratic elections weredeclared free and fair by the international community and more importantly  were what the Swazi people themselveshad chosen.Both processes - political and economic reform -show clearly Swaziland’s principle of rule by consensusof the people. We believe this principle is at the heart ofthe peace and stability we have enjoyed for manygenerations  and it has spared us the horrors of internalconflict suffered by so many on our continent.4I spoke earlier of South Africa’s return to theinternational community  as  among other things  a triumphfor the United Nations in upholding the principle ofuniversality. The Kingdom of Swaziland urges theAssembly to apply the same principle to investigate themerits of the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan.His Majesty King Mswati III joined a number of otherHeads of State in raising this issue at the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. His Majesty called forthe establishment of an ad hoc committee to determinewhether or not the Republic of China had a reasonable casefor rejoining our Organization. This call has been taken upby an increasing number of countries that support the ideaof looking into the issue in more detail.Quite apart from the principle of universality  there areother important factors for us to consider when reviewingthe case. The Republic of China in Taiwan has much tooffer to the world community. It clearly has the resourcesto be of more use to the rest of the internationalcommunity. More important  though  is the desire of theRepublic of China to be of use - and assistance - to the restof the world.The Kingdom of Swaziland  along with a largenumber of other developing countries throughout Africa Asia and the Americas  has had first-hand evidence of theRepublic of China’s willingness to offer generoushumanitarian and development assistance.As more and more worthy targets appear for theUnited Nations resources  we can surely ill afford to rejectthe call to investigate further whether that country’sassistance can be put to wider use through the agencies ofour Organization.At the heart of the issue  though  is the fact that 21million people believe that they are not represented in theUnited Nations. These people believe that they areexcluded from our founding principle of universality. Inconsideration of this right  which they believe has beendenied them  the time has surely come for us to listen totheir voices.The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes and supports theparticipation of the Republic of China In Taiwan in theactivities of the United Nations  and we therefore call oncemore for the establishment of an ad hoc committee toreview the case for their re-admittance to the Organization.The United Nations has a distinguished history of 49years of growth and achievement. The challenges wefaced almost 50 years ago  as the world emerged fromglobal conflict  have changed in substance but not inimportance.We have the opportunity now  in this forum  to laythe foundations for an agenda for development that willbring about the stability and peace we all desire.The Kingdom of Swaziland is proud of itsmembership of the United Nations and commends thework of all who have contributed to the many successesover the years. The nation is deeply indebted to theUnited Nations agencies  whose efforts are contributing somuch to the attainment of our development goals.On behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III  HerMajesty the Indlovukazi  and the whole Swazi nation  Ishould like to reaffirm my country’s full support for  andcommitment to  the Charter of the United Nations. MayAlmighty God bless these deliberations with the successthey deserve."
"157",6612,"SYC",49,1994,"Mr. President  may we congratulate Mr. Essyand wish him every possible success in exercising yourmandate.Seychelles would like to take this opportunity alsoto pay tribute to the Secretary-General for the timely andjudicious initiatives which he is constantly taking topromote peace  justice and development.We have gathered together to express the profoundaspirations of the countries we represent. We all haveour specific problems  our differences  our advantages andour handicaps. We all have many unresolved questionswhich stem from an international situation where thefactors of political and economic instability are becomingincreasingly frequent.The hesitations of a changing world tend to engendera feeling of pessimism  as we see contemporary historybeing made.Between the industrially developed countries andthose who are still marking time on the path todevelopment  considerable barriers are blocking the roadto sharing and to solidarity.We now see cruel dissensions arising among peoplesthat were previously bound by brotherhood.On the international scene  where we are witnessinga relentless confrontation between divergent interests what place do we now give to the human dimension inrelationships?31The end of this century is constantly being redefinedby shocks  upheavals and various types of aggression bornof negativism.More than ever  the success of our societies willdepend on their capacity to absorb these shocks and  whenthere is nothing or little left to reinvest courage determination and perseverance  in spite of sometimesterrible lack of understanding.But we also have to reinvest our capabilities  ourfunds  our means and our inborn willingness - in otherwords  unprecedented alliances have to be struck; for thereis no longer time to philosophize about the world we shallbequeath to our great grandchildren. Because of theunprecedented speeding up of history demographic economic and social projections are becoming alarming inthe medium term and no longer in the long term to whichwe had grown accustomed through our cozy selfishness orour defiance in the face of the unforeseeable.The phenomenon of exponential growth  which iswidening gaps and encouraging rivalry  causes immediaterather than delayed reactions. We have become our ownheirs! Undoubtedly  there is more food for thought in thisidea than in many statements.That illustrates to what extent our efforts must be bothplanned and creative. It also means that the immediateproblem to be tackled is to define our priorities. Here  mythinking is consonant with much of what has been saidfrom this rostrum. Certainly there is no lack of those whoplead for a safer  healthier and more prosperous world.And so many conferences and seminars have echoed thesame thought and have recalled this idea in their finaldocuments. But we are aware that we have to go beyondthis; hence  we are asking for action programmes whichmobilize experience  energy and imagination. Whencontinuity of effort is the key factor for success  we mustexpand the underpinnings of projects  assess results andrenew assistance.In other words  what we are advocating is a definitelyprescriptive approach  rather than the sort of analytical anddescriptive exercises which has been the comfortable routeof many international gatherings.If we are specific in defining the areas of ourdeliberations  then the ensuing action will necessarily bebased on precise  useful and needed dynamics.This specificity  in the case of Seychelles as in thecase of more than 30 territories throughout the world  is from the point of view of development  the dualconstraint of geographic and demographic smallness andbeing an island.Need we recall that the situation of small islandStates can  in many respects  provide indications as to thefuture of mankind. Here  more than anywhere else because of their vulnerability - whether it be due to thefragile ecosystems  the scant economic outlets or the lackof human resources - any dependence necessarily impactsupon the very future of the societies concerned.The Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  held inBarbados  was indeed extremely beneficial for us all. Itfocused attention on the particular situation of those smallStates whose relatively high per capita income does notaccurately reflect the reality of a situation which donorstend to tie to any aid for development.There is no doubt that that Conference has been thesource of great hope for the small island States. Butsome remain sceptical. In any case  we hope it will leadto a change in attitude on the part of the industrializedcountries with respect to the unique situation of smalldeveloping island States  for it is the industrializedcountries that will not only have to take up and enlargeupon the concerns of the small island States but also haveto set in motion the strategies and the plans of action which are the only real vehicles of change or ofdevelopment.Far be it from us to engage here in singling out thecountries or international organizations concerned.However  two years after the Rio Summit we are verydisappointed to see that the provisions of Agenda 21 haverarely given rise to actions. Does this mean that theconcept of lasting and sustainable development is goingto be severely compromised because of a lack ofsolidarity and international support and failure to respectcommitments?Let us get to the core of the problem. Theharmonization of development policies and measures toprotect the environment necessarily implies the definitionof specific budgetary categories by priority  based oncriteria of complementarity as between national effort andinternational efforts. This must be done free from anyspirit of charity  as well as divorced from any evaluationbased on per capita income.32Let us not forget the backdrop to all this  the fact thatin an era where everything occurs on a worldwide level theindividual and collective responsibility of States calls for aglobal approach and equitable sharing of the cost and moralinvestment the environment represents. Thoseresponsibilities must be consciously assumed.All these are indicators that merit the attention - theunwavering attention - of decision-making bodies andinternational donors. In the past  many pronouncementshave concluded on a hopeful note. Joined together in anorchestral score  such notes would barely fill out a refrainin praise of development  one that  like a clear conscience can often sound hollow.And yet we do not doubt the wisdom of ournegotiating partners. There are surely some who would liketo deal with questions of development from a dialecticalviewpoint  but that is not true of us. If  for us  the essentialthing is not to hesitate to be specific  we seek  in return measures that will be real  meaningful and measurable.More generally  this could apply to the role womenshould play in the development process. This is an olddebate. Fortunately  the time is now past when womenwere viewed as non-conventional vehicles of progress.Abolishing a principle  however  although paving the wayfor many improvements  can also generate a considerablepotential for inertia  for the walls of hypocrisy  as we allknow  are infinitely thick. It is not enough to quote somecases of women who are entrepreneurs or decision-makers There have always been some effective women. Theimportant thing is to modify behaviour and practices in realterms  at the societal level  and to analyse and transposethose models and ideas which have from time to time ledto good results. That is what we expect from the BeijingConference.Where natural prerogative is concerned  we cannot ofcourse speak of delegating authority but here too ofequitable and responsible sharing. Indeed  do we in facthave a choice?Women must act within their communities as aproponent force that is open to change and capable ofenriching the dynamic processes linked to changing values.It is impossible to give life without being concerned aboutsurvival  without being deeply aware of the changes thataffect the individual or the society whenever they give riseto uncertainty and muddy the waters.Humanism obviously owes a great debt to women.Let us enrich it with our understanding. The woman’sidentity is strong  but in many places there is still a lackof both recognition and expression  which are thefoundations of her legitimacy.The ideal of legitimacy is a noble concept  inaddition to being a good working notion. It is legitimateto look forward to the fulfilment of the promises made insolemn declarations; it is legitimate to expect thatintentions so boldly and courageously stated will becomepromises  and it is also legitimate  when the urgency ofthe matter no longer leaves time for either declarations ofintention or promises  to take action. Consensus cancome later.Here  and in the same spirit  I should like toemphasize our interest in the proposal made by theDirector-General of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for swifthumanitarian action - what we might call a ""spontaneousreaction"" - whenever called for. For here again we aretalking about the legitimacy that endows the human entitywith dignity and makes it worthy of respect.Before concluding I should like to appeal to allcountries and peoples present here to unite our efforts totake one large step towards world brotherhood. Let usoverturn the rigid barriers of all kinds of self-interest  letus be attentive to the needs of others and the future of ourplanet. Let us shape our relationships for active solidarityand willing adherence to the principle of sharedresponsibility.On such vital questions there is no place for triteofficial statements. In coming decades  no one will befooled by our unwillingness to engage  openly  fully andwith determination  on the path of well-being  especiallywhen it is the neediest of us who most require it.That is the price of true unity among nations. Andwe in Seychelles harbor this desire to stand alongside allcountries in concluding the unprecedented alliance thatwill guide the great ship of mankind towards the shoresof the third millenium.It is up to us to ensure that those shores will bewelcoming ones."
"158",6653,"SYR",49,1994,"I should like to congratulate Mr. Essy on hiselection to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly and to express our appreciation of thegreat responsibilities he will be shouldering  together withthe Secretary-General  in preparing for the commemorationof the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the UnitedNations.I also take this opportunity to salute  on behalf of mycountry  Syria  the long and arduous struggle of Africaagainst the system of apartheid in South Africa. Thisstruggle  recently crowned with the establishment of aunited  democratic and non-racial Republic of South Africa is a triumph not only for Africa but also for humanity andthe international community as a whole. It is especially atriumph for the United Nations as it is one of its mostimportant achievements. This great accomplishment willremain forever a source of inspiration and optimism for usall that all forms of racism are inevitably doomed toextinction.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations will raise fundamental questions about therole and achievements of the Organization and theobstacles it has faced and continues to face. In ouropinion  the most important question will focus on thereform and restructuring of the United Nations to make itmore democratic and thus more capable of responding tothe major changes that have taken place on theinternational scene  particularly since the end of the coldwar.It seems that none of the Member States objects inprinciple to the idea of introducing reforms to the UnitedNations  including the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil’s membership. However  the question that couldtake years before any agreement is reached on it is thatwhich relates to the nature of the required reforms  thecriteria for choosing the new members of the SecurityCouncil and  first and foremost  the right of veto:whether to expand it or abolish it altogether from theCharter.More than two-thirds of the current Members of theUnited Nations did not participate in drafting the Charterof the United Nations  either because they werelanguishing under colonialism or because  afterindependence  they were thrust into the cold war  forwhich the United Nations was an important arena. In thiscontext  developing countries pose the following question:If colonialism is truly a thing of the past and if the coldwar is indeed over  what other reasons are there toprevent the developing countries from activelyparticipating in the restructuring of the United Nationsand from taking the share they are democratically entitledto in the Security Council’s membership?We hope that the answer will not be a negative oneand that the cold war will no longer be waged in newinnovative forms and under different pretexts. Thatwould be in no one’s interest and would serve no usefulpurpose  either in the short or in the long term. Today’sworld  North and South  East and West  facesunparalleled challenges that require the cooperation of allMember States in facing up to them. Those challengesmay initially appear to be of a minor nature  but they maywell grow and spread like a plague.In many continents  dozens of civil wars have beenspawned from the womb of the cold war. The causes ofthese wars are many: national  ethnic  religious andtribal. Their victims are hundreds of thousands  while therefugees and displaced persons they uproot are in the tens17of millions. The number of those who live below thepoverty line in the world today has reached almost one fifthof the inhabitants of the globe. About 90 per cent of thoselive in developing countries.A phenomenon that seems truly odd and surprising isthe spread of organized crime to countries where such aphenomenon was never known before. Organized crimenow has its own international networks  its secrettransnational organizations are estimated to be in thethousands. Such organizations have the ability to break themost rigorous of laws by all the illegitimate meansavailable to them  including the smuggling of nuclearcomponents and their scientific designs.The indispensable international cooperation needed tomeet such varied challenges cannot achieve the desiredresults if certain of its principal parties take to evoking thespirit of the cold war by calling up the past instead oflooking forward to the future or if they act under theinfluence of some racist background that inspires theirpropaganda or election campaigns. It is no exaggeration tosay that such elements and subjective motives have alreadyplayed a role in obstructing international efforts to addressa number of serious crises  particularly those in whichhuman suffering has reached levels that defy descriptionand stymie the imagination  as in the cases of Bosnia Somalia and Rwanda  not to mention Afghanistan  wherethe shortsightedness of the conflicting parties hasoverwhelmed all wisdom and prudence.On the other hand  however  we must commend theUnited States of America for resorting to political dialoguewith the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and withCuba instead of continuing to pursue its policy ofconfrontation against them. These are positive measureswhich we hope will continue and expand to encompassother issues  in the forefront of which is that of Lockerbiedisaster and Libya  so that political dialogue will becomethe most appropriate option inresolving disputes betweenStates. In the same vein  we hope that the United ArabEmirates and Iran will be able  through amicable dialogue to reach a satisfactory solution to the question of thedisputed islands that would preserve the rights of bothparties and consolidate friendly relations between the twoneighbours.Syria was one of the first States in the Middle East tosign  as early as 1968  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In doing so  Syria wasprompted by its conviction that the possession of such anoverkill weapon by any State in our highly sensitive regionwould be a major cause for concern  not only to thepeoples of the region  but also to the world at large. Atthe time  Syria expected that its early signing of the NPTwould be an incentive to Israel  sooner or later  to sign inturn and would dissuade it from possessing nuclearweapons. Regrettably  we were to discover that ourexpectations were not justified. Israel  as yet  has neitheradhered to the NPT  nor agreed to open its nuclearinstallations to international inspection.Once again  and on the occasion of the ParisConference on Banning of Chemical Weapons in January1989  Syria took the initiative to call for making theMiddle East a region free of all nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons of mass destruction within theframework of the United Nations. However  Israel didnot respond to this call nor did it respond to any of thecalls of the United Nations  the International AtomicEnergy Agency or those of the Conferences of the Non-Aligned Movement or the Islamic Conference.This is an issue that has become of the utmostimportance and gravity  particularly in the light of theongoing peace process in the Middle East. It is notacceptable for any one party to have a privileged orexceptional position at the expense of others in regard tosensitive and decisive matters that relate to regionalsecurity which ought to be based on co-equality andmutuality.The forthcoming conference of the States Parties tothe NPT scheduled to review the extension of its tenurewhich is about to expire  affords a rare opportunity for allStates in the region to demonstrate their peacefulintentions.The accession by all States in the Middle East to theNPT is a vital step towards transforming the Middle Eastto a region free of all weapons of mass destruction. Fromthis rostrum  and in this context  the Syrian ArabRepublic calls upon Israel to accede to the NPT and toplace its nuclear installations under the inspection of theAtomic Energy Agency so that the States of the regionmay be able to agree to extending the Treaty. This  if itis done  will be an important step towards the creation ofa climate of confidence which in turn will contribute tobuilding peace and security in the Middle East.Three years have passed since the convening of theMadrid Conference and no just and comprehensive peace18in the Middle East has materialized. This is a fact thatcannot be cancelled out by the achievement of someprogress on some tracks.Our region is the cradle of human civilization andmonotheistic religions. Succeeding generations of itspeoples have become accustomed to repel invaders. It istime for the region to enjoy peace and stability. Thiscannot be achieved through half-measure solutions orthrough the trickle down of droplets of peace  nor can it beachieved through agreements which encroach on thenational dignity or compromise the interests of a nation.Syria accepted the initiative of the United States inwhich the United States undertook to work towards theachievement of a just and comprehensive peace in theregion  on the basis of international legality  SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)and the land-for-peace formula including a political solutionto the question of the national rights of the Palestinianpeople. The United States also confirmed that in pursuanceof its previous positions rejecting the extension of Israelilaw to the Syrian Golan Heights  it did not agree to theannexation of any part of the territories occupied in 1967.In the light of the complexities of the Arab-Israeliconflict and the suspicions of the Arab parties regardingIsrael’s intentions  Syria took two important decisionswhich complemented one another.The first decision was our commitment to coordinatewith the Arab parties participating in the peace process.This was prompted by our conviction that the other Arabparties would benefit from such solidarity as well as fromthe position of Syria and its various potentialities. We arealso convinced that the comprehensiveness of the solutionwould be a guarantee to all parties should they respond tothe requirements of peace.The second decision was that the peace option was astrategic one. By so doing we misled no one: neither ourown people nor any of the others  as to the truth of ourintentions  so that they may act accordingly.In this context  we were absolutely convinced thatthese two important decisions were going to be in theinterest of all parties participating in the peace process.These two decisions  we believed  would also facilitate thetask of the two sponsors  the United States and the RussianFederation  in achieving full peace in the region in returnfor full withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in1967.Regrettably  the peace process did not continue onthe right track towards achieving its desired objective.There are many reasons for that. However  we see nopoint in elaborating on them now. Nor do we want todigress and elaborate on the current position of thoseparties which have strayed from Arab coordination.Suffice it to refer to an essential point that was revealedin their public statements. The point is that they havenow begun to question the usefulness of what they havedone. The fact is they have become unable to contributeto the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace inthe region.In fact  the optimistic trumpetings by Israel aboutgreat progress achieved in the peace process is not true except from Israel’s point of view. The agreementsreached so far have achieved nothing but what Israelwanted from the land-for-peace formula while the Arabparty that signed those agreements with Israel still awaitsIsrael’s response to its demands.The most important characteristic of Syria’s policyunder the leadership of President Hafez al-Assad  is thereconciling of principle and reality. Principles that cannotsurvive on the ground are bound to decline. On the otherhand  living the reality without adhering to one’sprinciples leads to decline.Syria wants peace  and realizes that all parties havea stake in this peace. It realizes also that peace hasobjective requirements  and it is prepared to fulfil thoserequirements that are agreed upon. Syria means what itsays and adheres to what it means. The land-for-peaceequation must be implemented in both its parts. Thereturn of the entire Golan is not open to compromise unjustified delay or a misplaced testing of intentions. Onthis basis  Syria supports a genuine peace - a peace thatlives and flourishes without artificial obstacles or arbitraryconditions. Putting on the peace process a greater burdenthan it can bear does not help to achieve peace; rather  itposes a threat to the process. The peace process shouldnot be weighed down with issues that fall outside itsframework.19It is regrettable that  as a result of its strong influenceon the media  Israel has managed to distort information andturn facts on their head  to the extent that those in somecircles of Western public opinion now claim that Syria usedthe Golan Heights to launch offensives against the Israelis whereas  in fact  the opposite was the case. Israel uses thepretext of security in an attempt to justify its occupation ofthe Golan Heights and its refusal to withdraw therefrom.It was Israel  not Syria  that started the armed clashes in theperiod between 1949 and 1967.United Nations records and resolutions on this matteradopted by the Security Council during that period willdemonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that Israel wasresponsible for opening fire for the purpose of expellingSyrian farmers from their land and preventing them fromreaping their harvest. It was natural that the Syrian sideshould have defended its own citizens and land byresponding every time they were fired upon.The records to which I have referred are supported bymemoirs published by senior United Nations officers whowere entrusted with the task of supervising the trucebetween Syria and Israel during that period. Among thoseofficers are General Odd Bull and General Karl van Horn.Hills and mountains are no obstacle to today’s sophisticatedweapons. In any case  the Golan Heights are directlyopposite the Galilee Mountains  which are within Israel andare higher than the Golan Heights.Anyway  whether or not the Israeli public are awareof the truth of what I have just said  the United NationsCharter states the basic principle of the non-acquisition ofterritory by force. This principle has been confirmed inmany Security Council resolutions. The current peaceprocess cannot be completed without Israel’s withdrawingfrom the entire Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon.We believe that our position is just. We have a rightthat we shall never relinquish. As President Assad hassaid ""Relinquishing any part of a nation’s territoryamounts to relinquishing the entire country and itspeople’s free will.""We want a just peace that restores everyone’s legitimateright - the comprehensive peace after which the peoples ofthe region aspire and under which they will be able toenjoy security  stability and prosperity."
"159",6698,"TCD",49,1994,"Allow me  Sir  to convey to you on behalf of the peopleand Government of Chad  our heartfelt congratulations onyour unanimous election to preside over the forty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. It was a resoundingtribute to your country  whose devotion to peace anddialogue is well known. Not simply Côte d’Ivoire  but thewhole of Africa has thus been honoured.We should like to take this opportunity to salute thememory of the late President Félix Houphouët-Boigny whose renown as a statesman extended beyond ourcontinent.I should also like to convey heartfelt thanks to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Samuel Rudolph Insanally ofGuyana  for the skill with which he conducted the businessof our previous session.Finally  I wish to express our profound gratitude to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisdedication to international peace and security  to which hehas contributed with “An Agenda for Peace”  nowsupplemented by “An Agenda for Development”.We welcome the return to this Hall of South Africa a South Africa now free of apartheid. We welcome it andwish every success to President Nelson Mandela  whosetenacity should once again be commended.The picture of the international situation following theend of the cold war is mixed  being one of both hope anduncertainty.The evolving peace process in the Middle East is animportant step towards the achievement of acomprehensive  just and lasting settlement of a crisis whichhas persisted for too long. We pay warm tribute to theIsraeli and Palestinian leaders who  with theirforesightedness and sense of history  have taken thisdecisive step. We venture to hope that the peoples of thisregion  sorely in need of peace  have the benefit of thewholehearted support of the international community.We also commend the efforts now going on torestore democracy to Haiti.Chad has also been following with interest theprocess under way in Mozambique  and we hope that theelections to be held on 27 and 28 October will pave theway to a new era of peace and prosperity.However  grim situations still continue. How canone fail to be outraged at the daily events occurring inBosnia and Herzegovina  Rwanda  Liberia  Afghanistan orSomalia? Chad  which has been through three decades ofconflict  sympathizes with the tragic experience of thepeoples of these countries and condemns practices basedon ethnic  racial and religious criteria  practices whichbelong to the past.This was one of the reasons which prompted myGovernment to make a modest contribution  first  by itsmilitary presence with the French force in OpérationTurquoise  and then in the second United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda.Chad urges the United Nations to continue itstireless  energetic peacemaking and peace-keeping effortsand asks the parties involved in any conflict to attachgreater importance to dialogue.In this regard  we welcome developments in theongoing talks to bring lasting peace to Angola.We appeal for a speedy solution to the question ofthe embargo afflicting the Libyan people  a solution inkeeping with resolutions of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the Organization of the IslamicConference.The proliferation of armed conflicts in Africa is agreat challenge to us. Chad therefore makes an urgentappeal to the international community to give itswholehearted support to the OAU’s machinery forconflict-prevention  conflict-management and thesettlement of conflicts.Conflicts of any kind are always a disaster for thehuman race. Therefore  in order to save present and11future generations from the danger of a nuclear holocaust my country supports the indefinite extension of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).Conventional weapons are a permanent source ofconcern for Chad. That is why we support resolution 48/75E and welcome the initiative by President Alpha OmarKonare of Mali to halt the proliferation of such weapons inour region.Economic development is a constant concern of theinternational community. That is why the variousinitiatives and discussions on the subject  as well as the aptanalysis in the Agenda for Development  deserve carefulconsideration at this session. The worsening economiccrisis  marked by chronic indebtedness and the drop in theprice of raw materials in developing countries in general and in Africa in particular  has torn at the weak socialfabric and threatened the stability of States. This explainsthe spread of phenomena such as juvenile delinquency widespread drug-trafficking and organized crime.However  we look forward to the World Summit forSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen next year and to the World Conference on Women  to be held inBeijing  also next year.They will give the international community anopportunity to discuss today’s challenges and to try toimprove the lives of millions of human beings.I now turn to Chad  where the democratic processwhich began with the coming to power of the PatrioticSalvation Movement is continuing  to the satisfaction of all thanks to the wisdom of our President  His ExcellencyColonel Idriss Déby  who has honoured the spirit and theletter of the historic declaration of 4 December 1990 toestablish a State of law.The Sovereign National Conference organized  in aspirit of transparency  with the participation of citizens ofChad of all strata and all political leanings in the presenceof foreign observers  adopted a consistent  comprehensivestrategy. It thus reflected the general consensus onresolving all our problems  and in particular the creation ofa State that respects the rule of law. To that end  aschedule was worked out and transitional institutions wereestablished.At the last session  my delegation took note ofprogress made towards democratization. I am happy to sayfrom this rostrum that the transition in Chad is proceedingnormally thanks to cooperation between the three organs the presidency  the primature and the Higher TransitionalCouncil.In order to keep within our deadlines  the frameworkagreement was reduced to more realistic proportions backed up inter alia by the following priorities: theelaboration of a constitution and texts to govern theupcoming elections; the establishment of a nationalreconciliation committee consisting of governmentalrepresentatives  representatives of the provisionalparliament  political parties and civilians. That committeehas already achieved some results by signing certainagreements with some organizations  in particular theBangui II Agreement. We express gratitude to HisExcellency Ange Félix Patassé  President of the CentralAfrican Republic  for the decisive role he has playedthroughout the negotiations. At the same time thenational reconciliation committee is continuing itscontacts with other political and military groups. OurGovernment is confident that definitive peace will berestored to our country.Considerable progress has been made in therestructuring of the national army but much remains to bedone because of the complexity of the problem ofdemobilizing elements and reintegrating them into civilianlife. We reiterate once more our appeal to theinternational community to provide assistance in carryingout this essential programme for lasting peace in Chad.The signing of a social covenant concluded betweenthe Government and the trade unions took place on 1 July1994. It restored social peace and is the reason for theimportant progress that has been made in applying theprovisions of the framework agreement.Equally important progress has also been made inother areas. I wish to speak now of human rights andfreedoms. For almost four years now we have seen theunprecedented establishment of several independentnewspapers  the formation of many political parties  49 ofwhich have been legalized  and the creation of unions andhuman rights associations.The recent establishment of the Supreme Council forCommunications is another guarantee of freedom ofexpression  opinion and information.I turn now to human rights. My country  which hasexperienced one of the most cruel and misguideddictatorships  attaches great importance to the promotion12and defence of these rights. The ratification of variousinternational instruments and  more recently  the Conventionagainst Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment  the establishment of the NationalCommission for Human Rights and the authorizationprovided by my Government for the visit to Chad of anindependent expert from the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights  attest to this will.The Government of the Republic of Chad is thereforesurprised that certain press organs  certain human rightsassociations and organizations  manipulated by those whoare fighting for power  have launched a campaign that isseeking to mislead international opinion by spreading falseinformation about Chad.I wish to draw attention to the special situation in mycountry  where there are many political and military groupsequipped with weapons  as a consequence of the longconflict. The abuses committed by uncontrolled groupscannot and should not be attributed to Government policyto violate human rights. I should like  therefore  to takethis opportunity to call on all countries and governmentaland non-governmental organizations that are interested inChad and in the future of its people to come to my countryto establish the facts.Free democratic elections will be organized at thebeginning of next year in keeping with the timetableestablished by the framework agreement. On 7 October1994 His Excellency Colonel Idriss Déby  Head of State once again reaffirmed his determination to respect thetimetable for the elections to give the country reliabledemocratic institutions  inter alia  to guarantee the rights ofall citizens. Accordingly  we ask our traditional partners toassist the Government of Chad to conclude this delicatemission which require many resources.I now turn to the question of the border dispute thatexisted between my country and the Libyan ArabJamahiriya. On 3 February 1994 the International Court ofJustice in its Judgment put an end to this 20-year-oldconflict. An Agreement on the practical modalities for theimplementation of that Judgment was signed on 4 April1994 in Surt. In keeping with the Agreement thewithdrawal of Libyan troops from the Aouzou Strip wascarried out according to an agreed timetable and under thesupervision of United Nations observers. Now all thatremains to be done is to make a reality of the border asdefined between the two countries.I wish to reiterate my sincere thanks to all those whohave contributed directly or indirectly to the peacefulsolution of this dispute and our gratitude to the UnitedNations. This fortunate outcome  which reflects the pre-eminence of negotiation over confrontation  is a reasonfor hope in the matter of prevention and resolution ofconflicts.In the framework of the rehabilitation of the AouzouStrip and the reintegration of the local population  Chadhas already set up a technical committee to study thevarious aspects of rehabilitation  particularly therestoration of infrastructure  the cultivation of our oases and the restoration of our education and public healthsystems. We should also create an environmentconducive to all these actions by carrying out mineclearance and disinfecting wells that were poisoned duringthe occupation. We appeal to the entire internationalcommunity to help us to carry out this programme.Chad  like many other countries in Africa  isconfronting an unprecedented economic and financialcrisis. Existing difficulties have been compounded by thedevaluation of the CFA franc  which has wiped out all theefforts by the Government within the structuraladjustment framework. My country regrets the fact thatthe steps to accompany the devaluation have not beenentirely honoured. We urge some of our partners tocomply with their commitments in this respect.Chad is a country which is half desert and hassuffered a rapid degradation of its environment because ofits lack of energy resources and we welcome  therefore the signing on 17 June 1994 in Paris of the InternationalConvention to Combat Desertification in those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification Particularly in Africa. We hope that the provisions of theConvention will not remain a dead letter.While in the Sahel rain is welcomed enthusiastically the rainfall  which has been particularly abundant thisyear  has caused flooding in many regions of my country causing serious damage to crops and leaving manyfamilies homeless. At the same time an epidemic ofcholera has broken out in some cities in Chad.We are working together with our various partners United Nations agencies and non-governmentalorganizations to deal with these situations followingappeals made respectively by the Ministers of Agricultureand Health.13The United Nations will celebrate its fiftiethanniversary next year. To meet the many challenges wemust adapt to present changes. Therefore my countrysupports the common African position on restructuring andthe revitalization of the United Nations in the economic social and related fields.I turn now to the Security Council. I wish to recallthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic ofChad stated from this rostrum on 8 October 1976 that“The Security Council  whose principal role is tosafeguard international peace and security  shouldreflect the geographical composition of theinternational community.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Thirty-first Session  PlenaryMeetings  23rd meeting  para. 22)In the light of ongoing discussion of this question  wereiterate this position because it is a requirement of ourtime.I cannot conclude my statement without saying that wehope that the work of the present session will yield answersto our legitimate concerns."
"160",6744,"TGO",49,1994,"More than anyone else  Sir  you are aware ofwhat excellent and solid relations of cooperation friendship and fraternity have existed for many years nowbetween your country  Côte d’Ivoire  and Togo. It is thuswith great joy and enormous pride that my countrywelcomes your unanimous election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.5General Assembly 22nd meetingI therefore wish  on behalf of the Government ofTogo  in the name of my delegation  and in my owncapacity  to congratulate you most sincerely on this tributeto you and to your fraternal country  Côte d’Ivoire.The Togolese delegation and I myself assure you ofour support. We are convinced that your competence andyour long experience in international affairs augur well forthe success of our work.I should like to take this occasion to congratulate yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally  thePermanent Representative of Guyana  who  witheffectiveness and tact  guided the proceedings of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. We extendour congratulations as well to the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has dedicated himself to thenoble ideals of this Organization to which we all belong.We reiterate to him the total support of the delegation ofTogo.South Africa has returned from a long voyage. Wehave at last seen the death of apartheid. My country isproud to have contributed to reversing that odious system.Togo has always supported the legitimate aspirations ofpeoples oppressed the world over  but in particular theaspirations of the black majority of South Africa  whosefundamental rights  even the most elementary among them were long trampled.It is therefore with great joy that my country recognizing the courage  dedication and sacrifice of theSouth African nation  welcomes the return to the UnitedNations of that fraternal country  which is now free andcommitted to waging — together with all the StatesMembers of this Organization — the necessary fight fordemocracy and for the total independence of other peoples.In 1995  our Organization will celebrate its fiftiethanniversary. A new era of hope lies ahead for our nations.Unfortunately that era of hope also contains concerns disquiet at the increasing impoverishment of the poorestcountries  concern too about a world constantly devastatedby conflicts and difficulties of all types. The period ofupheaval in which we live presents our Organization witha challenge — that of understanding all the major changesthat are under way and of finding rapid solutions to themany problems confronting our planet.It is therefore urgent to redefine the broad guidelinesof the Organization on the basis of greater humanism onthe global level  so that man can again regain the strengthto better exercise his freedom  to enjoy it fully  to respectthe laws of nature  and to break away from egoism andhard-heartedness. We must also lay new foundations forcooperation to help the United Nations not only toeliminate the consequences of the cold war  but also tosolve the problems of today and those of tomorrow. Thisis the only way to respond to the expectations of ourpeoples and to respect the spirit of those who  50 yearsago  created our world Organization  with the purpose among other things  of preventing conflicts for the peaceof nations and the well-being of peoples. Theimplementation of the relevant recommendationscontained in the report of the Secretary-General  anAgenda for Peace  should  to this end  prompt us to focusour action  urgently  on preventive measures  to establishstable foundations for the harmonious development ofsociety and to resolve its problems by developing flexibleand appropriate mechanisms within the framework of thereforms now under way.There are clear grounds for optimism when we seethat the adversaries of yesterday have become the alliesof today  seeking together peaceful and mutuallyadvantageous solutions to the international problems ofthe day. We therefore have all the more reason to havefaith in the future of our Organization. Planning for thefuture rather than waiting to be overtaken by eventsshould be the watchword of our nations.On the internal level  my country has undertaken toembark on the path of democracy based on a completeand responsible multiparty system in order to establish aState based on law and on respect for the individual.Following the adoption of a new constitution inSeptember 1992  presidential and legislative electionswere held in August 1993 and in February 1994respectively  leading to the establishment on 25 May lastof a Government of national union whose programme ofaction aims basically at building a new Togo  democraticand free  at shaping national unity  at reconciling thepeople with itself  at rallying this people around itsnation  its values and its flag  in peace and regainedharmony  and at rebuilding an economy damaged underthe combined effects of a range of factors both nationaland international.Of course  all of this cannot be accomplished in justa few months; it takes time to overcome resentment  toreconcile the adversaries of the past  to establish the state6General Assembly 22nd meetingof law to which all aspire  to rebuild confidence and to laythe foundations of a solid and prosperous economy.In spite of the end of the cold war  we see disorderconstantly blurring the geopolitical landscape. The situationnow prevailing in Africa is hardly encouraging. Thecontinent  marginalized  awakens only the minds of themost attentive observers  when  across mountains andvalleys  they hear the cries of anguish and death. The casesof Rwanda  Angola  Liberia  Somalia and Mozambiquesuffice to illustrate this bitter fact.The defeat of the system of apartheid in South Africaand the tragic events in Rwanda illustrate the two extremesin the evolution of the African continent  characterized bythe contrast between hope and despair  progress anddestruction. While  at the present time  South Africa seemsto represent hope  Rwanda  on the contrary  symbolizes theface of an Africa mutilated and ravaged.Togo appeals to the Government of Angola and toUNITA to show goodwill and the flexibility that isnecessary if a speedy and comprehensive settlement of thequestion is to be achieved in the framework of the Lusakatalks.In Liberia  despite a number of agreements  thedisarmament of the factions has not yet occurred  and thegeneral elections that it was hoped would take place seemto be becoming a mirage. Let us hope that good faith willfind its way into the hearts of the parties concerned so thatthis fraternal country may regain the advantages ofreconciliation and find again the path of development.As for Somalia  Togo appeals to the internationalcommunity not to grow weary and leave that country. Wetherefore invite the parties to the conflict to refrain fromcontributing to discouragement and to resume real dialogueaimed at the rapid establishment of reliable nationalinstitutions.In respect of Western Sahara  my delegation supportsthe Secretary-General’s report on the question and urges allthe parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations toensure that the referendum on self-determination  to be heldin February 1995 for the purpose of deciding the future ofthe territory and its people  is organized effectively.The Togolese Government is gratified at the recentpositive development in the socio-political situation inBurundi and invites the new leaders to do all in theirpower to secure the definitive restoration of peace in thatcountry.Togo supports unreservedly the efforts of theSecretary-General and of the Security Council to bringpeace to Mozambique. It invites the parties to committhemselves totally to accepting and respecting the resultsof the forthcoming general elections.Faced with this situation of armed conflict  tensionand insecurity  Africa must shoulder its responsibilities.It is through its own efforts that the African continent willbe able to overcome the difficulties it faces today. Thisis the sense of the proposal that General GnassinmgbéEyadema  President of the Republic of Togo  made to theTunis Summit of the Organization of African Unity inJune 1994  when he advocated the creation of an Africanpeace force whose mission would be to ensure peacewhere it is threatened by acting as a buffer between thebelligerents and making possible a negotiated solution toconflicts. The delegation of Togo is delighted that thisidea aroused a great deal of interest on the part of certainlarge Powers that are prepared to provide logisticalsupport for such a buffer force.The unprecedented positive development of thepeace process in the Middle East  reflected over the past12 months in the Israeli-Palestinian accord of September1993 and in the historic Washington D.C. meeting of25 July 1994 between His Majesty King Hussein of theHashimite Kingdom of Jordan and Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin of Israel  opens up before us a horizon ofhope. These encouraging developments are importantsteps in the direction of peace. They demonstrate clearlythat disputes can be settled effectively only throughpeaceful means and that only resolute political will canhelp to build a peaceful society.In total agreement with the initiators of and theprotagonists at these gatherings  my country asks theUnited Nations  all Governments of the region andespecially the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to continuethe negotiations with a view to the establishment of aglobal  definitive and lasting peace in that part of theworld to enable all States concerned with the Arab-Israeliconflict to live henceforth within secure bordersrecognized by all  on the basis of mutual respect for thesovereignty  territorial integrity and political independenceof States.7General Assembly 22nd meetingAs regards the future of the Palestinian people  thetransition period  which is just beginning  must besustained  not only politically but also  and above all through financial  economic and technical assistance fromthe international community. The United Nations willtherefore have to assume its responsibilities fully until thePalestinian question is definitively and satisfactorilyresolved in all its aspects.In the eastern part of Europe the situation is stillconstantly characterized by violence and by an explosion ofnationalism. States have been dislocated  borders havebeen called into question  and dreams of annexation and of“ethnic cleansing” inspire and haunt both minds and hearts.Drawing lessons  as is imperative  from all thesetragedies and conflicts  the United Nations must promoteand encourage further the use by States of the principle ofthe peaceful settlement of disputes. Of course  theOrganization has in recent years clearly demonstrated itsusefulness  especially in the fields of humanitarian affairsand the maintenance of peace. But sometimes lack of willto act promptly paralyses its action. This paralysis revealsprofound shortcomings in the system of collective securityprovided for in the Charter and is due  above all  to therefusal of many Member States to commit themselves topeace  despite the special responsibilities entrusted to themby the Charter.This being the case  it is clear that  as it makesdecisions about the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  the Security Council should be broadened and thereby  adapted to the changes in the world of today.Togo believes that the United Nations is the mostappropriate forum for the creation of a new internationalorder and the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  as well as for the peaceful settlement of disputes.That is why we support its actions. We demonstrated this inter alia  in the framework of peace-keeping operations bysending military contingents and police officers to Rwanda Western Sahara and Mozambique to serve under the flag ofthe United Nations.Profoundly committed to peace and to the principle ofgeneral and complete disarmament  Togo rejoices in themany positive developments that have taken place in thisfield over recent months. But we remain concerned at theconstantly increasing proliferation of conventional weapons.The massive international transfers of such weaponsdangerously compromise the success of effective generaldisarmament. It has become urgent to strengthen the roleand the capacity for action of the United Nations regionalcentres for peace and disarmament  which are at presentpoorly structured and lack both the material and thehuman resources they need to function properly andproduce the results the international community expectsof them.The particularly alarming case of the United NationsRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  ofwhich my country is honoured to be the headquarters  isquite illustrative  and should be examined with care. For paradoxically  while the African continent is prey toviolent and constant civil wars  which endanger regionaland international peace and security  the Centre  whichthe United Nations could well have used to contribute tothe quest for appropriate solutions to these conflicts  is either by design or by circumstance  left out and itsexistence is almost ignored.As regards the nuclear problem on the Koreanpeninsula  my delegation welcomes the agreementrecently reached between the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States of America. Italso welcomes the readiness expressed by the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea to comply with the provisionsof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. Togo views this courageous position adoptedby the North Korean party as edifying testimony of itsdetermination to maintain peace in the region.The world economy continues to be characterized bytrends toward stagnation and the growing disparitybetween North and South.As we prepare to enter the third millennium  theelimination of poverty should be one of the mainobjectives of our Organization. In this context  the WorldSummit for Social Development  which the Governmentof Denmark has offered to host in March 1995 inCopenhagen  assumes its full importance. Togo ferventlyhopes that Member States will demonstrate political willand  in a surge of collective responsibility  give thisSummit the attention necessary to obtain concrete resultsand practical decisions whose implementation should leadto the true elimination of poverty  the creation ofgenuinely productive jobs and the complete integration ofmarginalized or excluded sectors of society.During the last 15 years  there have been manyobstacles to growth in our countries  including the declinein foreign capital  the debt crisis  and the constant declinein public development assistance  whose level is clearlyshort of the target 0.7 per cent of gross national product8General Assembly 22nd meetingthat was set and strongly recommended by the UnitedNations. All of this leads to widespread poverty aggravated by structural adjustment programmes that haveinsupportable social effects.There has been constant regression in Africa’s shareof world trade. The recent Marrakesh agreements thatresulted from long and difficult international negotiations inthe Uruguay Round  far from meeting the expectations ofthe developing countries in general and of Africa inparticular  are likely to lead to new imbalances ininternational trade which may require more than a decadeto redress.In this respect  my delegation views the Agenda forDevelopment proposed to us by the Secretary-General as atimely initiative  offering as it does an opportunity to begina process of constructive dialogue and political mobilizationto create a true and just partnership that can engage inbetter consideration of development issues.Together with the Group of 77 and China  Togostrongly supports the idea that this Agenda should build aninternational consensus for the global liberalization of trade on the one hand as an effective means for internationalcooperation for development  and on the other to give newimpetus to the efforts made over the last decade to avoidprotectionist policies.If the transition of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade into the World Trade Organization is to besmooth  there must be a mechanism that can compensatethe developing countries affected by the new system.Along these lines  the implementation of the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s adopted by the General Assembly in 1991  and theimplementation of the Paris Declaration and the Programmeof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s adopted in 1990  should  in our opinion  be geared to anincrease in the volume of official development assistance the promotion of respect for commitments that have beenundertaken for new and additional resourcesfor international cooperation  and a greater lightening of thedebt burden  or even its cancellation. It would be desirableto adopt policies that ensured an adequate flowof concessional financing to the developing countries  inparticular to the least developed among them; stimulatedother flows of capital  including direct investment; reversedthe negative trend in financialflows  and created mechanisms and allocated resourcesrelated to development.It can never be overemphasized that sustainabledevelopment is a prerequisite to lasting peace. The rightto development must be considered  henceforth  as afundamental human right  and thus be given priorityattention by the international community. Along theselines  my Government hopes that  in addition to theresults of the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September last the work of the World Summit for Social Development of the Fourth World Conference on Women  to be held inBeijing in September 1995  and of the Second UnitedNations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITATII)  to be held in Istanbul from 3 to 14 June 1996  willhelp produce at the international level a spirit of sharedresponsibility and the necessary political will to mobilizethe resources that are indispensable if our developingcountries are to thrive.Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration are an importantbridge on the road to sustainable development and to theprotection of the Earth from the dangers facing it. Thatis why  two years ago  all the participants in theConference showed such enthusiasm and sincerity.Regrettably  the results of that historic summit have stillnot been reflected in concrete facts. No notable progresshas yet been observed in the implementation of therecommendations contained  in particular  in theProgramme of Action. It is high time that States and theinternational community did everything in their power  atthe national  regional and international levels  to put intoeffect the commitments to sustainable developmentundertaken in Rio.The Togolese Government welcomes the entry intoforce of the Framework Convention on Climate Changeand is particularly delighted at the conclusion of anotherlegal instrument of global scope: the InternationalConvention to Combat Desertification in CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification Particularly in Africa. The Convention was adopted bythe intergovernmental negotiating Committee in Paris inJune 1994. Togo was pleased to take part in thenegotiating process and will soon take up the proceduresfor signature and ratification. We invite all StatesMembers of the United Nations to do likewise in orderthat the Convention and related instruments may enterinto force as soon as possible.9General Assembly 22nd meetingConsidering the uncertain future of mankind and thenumerous and formidable challenges confronting the humanrace  it is imperative that we become clearly aware of ourmoral obligations. As of this moment it is essential toidentify and correct the weaknesses and failings of ourOrganization. The reforms under way are indispensable but they must not become a means of conferring evengreater influence than in the past on the large countries andrichest Powers in the world. Our new awareness must alsohelp define ways of establishing relations among nations inthe future  and in dealing with our present-day concerns wemust take into account the causes of the disparities instandards of living between North and South. There is noeffect without a cause  and to deny the principle ofcausality amounts to deferring our problems and neversolving them.Only an attitude based on action  justice andinternational solidarity can spare the world a conflict thatwould otherwise  sooner or later  be inevitable. Thus tackling the deep-rooted causes of today’s problems meansseeking together the solutions that will make it possible formen  women and children to live decently and in completefreedom  without fear of being crushed by unemployment poverty and hunger. This would also make it possible toprotect the dignity of the human person and to safeguardhuman security.Tomorrow we should have a world in which allnations and all citizens refuse to listen to the voice of theirown personal interests when they run counter to thecommon weal  a world in which nations and peoples findsatisfaction not only in that which is to their own advantagebut also in that which is to everyone’s advantage.At its forty-ninth session  may the General Assembly under the leadership of its President  contribute to dispellingour concerns and to defining the ways and means ofhelping us blaze the way into the future. This is mydelegation’s most fervent hope."
"161",6789,"THA",49,1994,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Thailand  I extend warmestcongratulations to Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire onhis election as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-ninth session. I am confident that he will providethe General Assembly with the leadership to guide thesession to a successful conclusion.I should also like to pay tribute to AmbassadorInsanally  the General Assembly’s President at itsforty-eighth session. My delegation very muchappreciates his untiring and effective leadership and hisdedication to the work of this body. Under hispresidency  the General Assembly had an eventful year and its role was enhanced in ways which were beneficialto the Organization.Thailand joins the rest of the internationalcommunity in congratulating the Government and peopleof South Africa on having established a united democratic and non-racial country. They have shown usthat compromise is possible and that even the mostlong-standing and bitter of conflicts can be resolvedpeacefully. This achievement is due entirely to theexceptional vision  courage and pragmatism of thecountry’s leaders - in particular  President NelsonMandela and Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk.Tribute must also be paid to the United Nations  and inparticular to the Special Committee against Apartheid  forits contributions to the positive changes in South Africa.There is another bright spot giving all of us hope fora more peaceful world. Since the Thai Government haslong supported the Middle East peace process  the18termination of the state of war between Jordan and Israel announced in Washington in July this year  following lastyear’s historic agreement between Israel and the PLO  givesall of us reason to rejoice. We hope that it will lead tofurther agreements on ""other tracks"" acceptable to allparties concerned  so that a durable peace in the MiddleEast may finally be achieved.We also welcome the positive developmentsconcerning the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula andhope that dialogue and negotiation between the partiesconcerned will eventually result in that part of the worldenjoying lasting peace and stability.However  in spite of the promising outlook forinternational peace and security  there remain political andmilitary conflicts of both global and regional magnitude.It is therefore imperative that countries continue unfailingefforts to secure a stable and peaceful internationalenvironment. As a first step in this direction  theinternational community could support and cooperate inefforts towards comprehensive reform and totalrevitalization of the United Nations to enable theOrganization to meet the new challenges of today’s worldand to assist Members efficiently in their peacefulendeavours.Thailand pledges its continued support for theSecretary-General’s proposals in ""An Agenda for Peace"".These constitute an innovative and practical framework forthe maintenance of international peace and security anddeserve serious consideration by all Member States.In South-East Asia  realizing the need to ensure asecure and peaceful international environment  theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) took thelead in promoting political and security dialogues andconsultations in the Asia-Pacific region by initiating theestablishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).Designed to be a high-level consultative forum on politicaland security matters  the ARF held its first meeting inBangkok on 25 July 1994  after the twenty-seventh ASEANministerial meeting. Nineteen ministers from countries inthe Asia-Pacific region and from the European Unionattended this historic meeting to discuss political andsecurity cooperation issues  such as the latest developmentson regional situations  and decided to carry out somepractical confidence-building measures applicable to theAsia-Pacific region.As Chairman of the first ARF meeting  Thailand ispleased with the results of the meeting and itsachievements. In particular  Thailand is grateful for thekind cooperation it received from all countries concerned.Since the success of this first meeting  the ARF hasbecome a viable forum for the promotion of trust as wellas political and security cooperation within theAsia-Pacific region. The ARF has also demonstrated itspotential to make substantive contributions towards theUnited Nations efforts at preventive diplomacy and atmaintaining international peace and security.In other words  the ARF got off to a good start.Thailand is fully aware that the first meeting of the ARFin Bangkok was only the beginning. For this reason Thailand views the inter-sessional activities at variouslevels among officials from ARF countries as necessaryfor the ARF’s continued success. These activities couldhelp the ARF find its future direction and enable it tobecome more efficient and productive.Political and military security are but one aspect ofthe bigger picture facing us. As we search for a newinternational order based on a common set of principlesand values  we need to change our way of thinking. Wealso need a new culture of development cooperation andnew definitions of the notions of security anddevelopment.The winds of change have begun to sweep across theglobe. We are now witnessing the creation of majorlandmarks of international consensus-building. In 1992 the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit set a new stage forglobal partnership on the environment and sustainabledevelopment. Last year (in Vienna)  the WorldConference on Human Rights was held  producing aworld programme of action. Last month in Cairo wewitnessed the International Conference on Population andDevelopment. Next year in Copenhagen  the WorldSummit for Social Development will be held. ThisSummit will serve as a bridge between this year’sConference on Population and Development in Cairo andnext year’s Fourth World Conference on Women inBeijing. It also presents a unique opportunity for theinternational community to respond  on a global level  tourgent human and social concerns that place people at thecentre of the development process.The Thai Government accords special importance tosocial development. In light of this  we have establisheda social cabinet dedicated to formulating policies andfinding solutions to a number of pressing social problems.We have also organized a joint committee comprisingmembers of the private sector and of Government and19chaired by the Prime Minister. Its mandate is to overseeefforts to alleviate the social problems that beset a growingeconomy  such as those being experienced by my countryand others in the region.Thailand has participated and will continue toparticipate actively in all global deliberations. Theseconferences create new paradigms of international conductwhich give rise to the various comprehensive global plansof action. They have also started the new process ofredefining the notions of security and development.Security in this final decade of the twentieth centurygoes well beyond the familiar concepts of old. It mustinvolve people - how they live and how they exercise theirchoices. It should be security with a human face  becauseit must deal directly with political  economic  environmentaland social aspects of our lives in a comprehensive manner.Development  as pointed out by the Secretary-General must be seen in its five interlinked dimensions: with peaceas the foundation; the economy as the engine of progress;the environment as a basis for sustainability; justice as apillar of society; and democracy as good governance. Mycountry shares these perceptions and supports their premisesas envisioned by the Secretary-General.It is with this awareness that Thailand approaches itswork on the international agenda for development. Such anagenda should reflect and indeed promote self-reliance aswell as interdependence among Member States. There isno doubt that development is primarily a nationalresponsibility. Yet  it is also a shared responsibility of theinternational community. It is our firm belief that thedevelopment effort of any State in today’s world must besupported by a conducive international environment  basedon free and fair trading practices. The completion of theUruguay Round and the creation of the World TradeOrganization now hold out the prospect of providingsignificant benefits to the world economy.A United Nations agenda for development should notbe given any less importance than the agenda for peace.These two intertwined issues must be the core of any effortto strengthen the role and activities of the United Nationsas we approach the next century.Together with the ""An Agenda for Peace""  ""An agendafor development"" should serve as an instrument for thecoordination of activities within the United Nations  as wellas between the United Nations and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  and other non-governmental organizations. Itshould be an instrument to create unity of purpose  atboth the policy and operational levels  within theOrganization. The United Nations cannot be a strongforce for peace unless it is also a strong force fordevelopment.The United Nations remains humanity’s best hopefor creating a more desirable world - a world with aconscience  a world which recognizes that humanseverywhere  young or old  strong or weak  are at thecentre of our communal and individual efforts. To thisend  I should like to reaffirm Thailand’s commitment tothis vision  which cannot be fulfilled without the activeparticipation of Member States. Thailand will do its partin contributing to this end. We hope that other countrieswill also chip in with their fair share of contributions. Aworld united by this vision and this unity of purpose willsurely be a better place for us all and  more important  forour children and grandchildren."
"162",6814,"TJK",49,1994,"Speaking from this high rostrum of the United Nations  Iwould like first of all to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the high office of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. I am convinced that  having received such ahigh honour  you will be successful in your conduct of thisforum that is so important in the life of the worldcommunity.Reflecting on the past  we can state with satisfactionthat the United Nations  by traversing the difficult roadof overcoming political and ideological confrontation  hassaved humanity from a new global catastrophe. Todaywe can say with confidence that the United Nations is auniversally recognized instrument of peace andconstruction.We commend the United Nations peace-keeping andhumanitarian efforts in Tajikistan. I consider it my dutyto convey the sincere thanks of the Tajik people to theUnited Nations  the donor countries  the internationalorganizations - in short  to everyone who is doingeverything possible to help our State in these hard times.There is no need to describe in detail all thehardship that has befallen our long-suffering motherland.The wounds of the civil war  that serious illness of oursociety  cannot be healed either by surgical interventionor by compulsory treatment. They are healed only whenthe victim himself becomes aware of his affliction andmakes the most effective use of all possible meansnecessary for recovery.To the credit of the people of my country  it shouldbe said that they were able to put an end to bloodshed lawlessness and terror and start a constructive life.Experiencing a severe lack of time and an extremelyheavy burden of political  social and economic problems we were able to consolidate a tendency towards thestabilization of the situation in our country. Today we canstate with confidence that the situation differs radicallyfrom that prevailing at the beginning of last year.1Recognizing its responsibility for the destiny of thecountry  the Government of Tajikistan firmly declared itscommitment to values common to all humanity and itsresolve to start building a democratic and secular Statebased on the rule of law. In order to realize theseintentions we have launched the constitutional process inour country.In the course of drafting the Constitution we wereguided by the experience of countries with establisheddemocratic traditions and advice given by highly qualifiedexperts of the United Nations and the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). We sought totake into consideration the high standards set up in thebasic documents of the Helsinki process so that the newConstitution would ensure to the fullest extent possible theprotection of inalienable human rights.We intend to conduct a referendum so the wholepopulation can decide on the adoption of the newConstitution  the results of which will reinforce hope forachieving further progress in the development of societyand the State. The proposed draft Constitution will providea legal basis for subsequent democratic transformations andreforms. It will undoubtedly accelerate them and makethem irreversible. Furthermore  the President of theRepublic of Tajikistan  elected by the whole population will enforce the Constitution and guarantee the State’s unityand integrity.In our domestic policy the principal issues for ourcountry’s political leaders have become the questions of ournation’s spiritual revival  of the halting of senselessconfrontation and of the creation of a social basis formutual understanding and forgiveness. The solution ofthese problems will help achieve maximum progresstowards national reconciliation.Let me describe briefly to the Assembly our view ofthe problem. Addressing the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session  I stated that political dialogue was the onlypossible way of untying the internal Tajik knot andachieving national reconciliation and that it was one of ourhighest priorities. A careful study of the state of society and of public opinion in particular  gave us the idea ofentering into dialogue with those who have never concealedtheir desire to seize power by force. In doing so we usedall possible means  including regional and internationalmechanisms. Only the good will demonstrated by theleaders of Tajikistan made it possible to start and todevelop the negotiating process.The importance of the initiatives put forward by theSecretary-General  the decisions of the Security Counciland the assistance of the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe in accelerating the nationalreconciliation process should be particularly emphasized.We deeply appreciate the unwavering attention ofthe Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali to all the problems of Tajikistan  and wetake this opportunity to express to him our sinceregratitude.We appreciate no less deeply the activities of theSecretary-General’s Special Envoy to Tajikistan  Mr.Ramiro Piriz-Ballon  of the United Nations Observers inTajikistan and of the CSCE mission. All of them havemade a valuable contribution to the elaboration of thenegotiating mechanisms.I would like to note with satisfaction the hopefulresults of the political consultations between us and theTajik opposition  with the mediation of Mr. RamiroPiriz-Ballon  which took place in Tehran in the secondhalf of September 1994. The parties signed theAgreement on a cease-fire and stopping hostile actions and we consider this to be an important step towards theachievement of national reconciliation  peace and stabilityin Tajikistan. The Security Council and the internationalcommunity noted with satisfaction the signing of thatdocument. From this rostrum I would like to express thehope that the question of dispatching United Nationsmilitary observers to Tajikistan will be resolved withoutdelay.I express our gratitude to the Governments and thepeoples of the Russian Federation  the United States ofAmerica  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  Kyrgyzstan  the IslamicRepublic of Iran  the Islamic Republic of Pakistan andother concerned parties and countries for their assistancein the promotion of the inter-Tajik dialogue.However  I must state with regret that there havebeen recurrent outbreaks of violence  initiated by theunmotivated escalation of the armed opposition andmanifested in acts of terror  taking of hostages and othersubversive actions. We consider these actions a deviationfrom political methods of resolving contentious questionsand reconciling existing contradictions. We also see themas showing disregard of the international community’sappeal to the Tajik parties to show restraint andcountenance no action that might impede the process ofnegotiations.2Despite those actions  the political leaders ofTajikistan took a series of practical steps to strengthenconfidence-building measures. At its twentieth session theParliament of Tajikistan decided to postpone thereferendum and the elections. The aim of this initiative ofthe members of Parliament was to involve the widestpossible spectrum of political forces in the constitutionalprocess  to give everyone wishing to return home anopportunity to do so and to let all our compatriots who hadthe bad fortune to be outside the country take part in theelections. We are using this extra time to make properpreparations for addressing organizational questionsconcerning the invitation of observers from the UnitedNations  the CSCE  other international organizations andinterested countries to the elections.We reaffirm our principled position to solve existingcontentious questions by means of dialogue. We areconvinced that the opposition’s reliance on force and thecommensurate reaction to it may cause unpredictableconsequences leading to the undermining of the stabilizationprocess and of the positive decisions reached duringnegotiations.At the same time I consider it necessary to draw theAssembly’s attention to another very important aspect ofthis problem. It seems that the irreconcilable wing of theopposition is cultivating plans of expanding thegeographical scope of the inter-Tajik conflict by institutingthe use of mercenaries in the armed confrontation. Thiscreates conditions for the internationalization of the conflict which may in turn threaten to spread the confrontationthroughout Central Asia. It is easy to imagine what seriousconsequences this may have.Speaking from this rostrum  I must draw theAssembly’s attention to our anxiety over the currentsituation in the neighbouring Islamic State of Afghanistan.The world cannot remain indifferent to the situation in thatcountry  where internecine war came to dominate socialrelations. The Afghan conflict has brought forth adangerous phenomenon: the emergence of anarchicgeographical units that can become a base for internationalterrorism and unpunished trafficking in weapons and drugs.The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border keeps a vastregion in tension. Central Asia’s fragile backbone ofpolitical balance may not withstand the high pressure  andthe destructive processes taking place in Afghanistan rightnow may lead to a regional cataclysm. We urge that theAfghan problem be given the world Community’s mostserious consideration. Furthermore  we are convinced thatthe alleviation of tension in Afghanistan will significantlyand positively influence the solution of the inter-Tajikconflict. We have no doubt that the people ofAfghanistan will ultimately achieve reconciliation andrestore peace to their country. We sincerely wish thepeople of Afghanistan success in achieving these goals assoon as possible.In current circumstances  with many hotbeds oftension caused by the cold war still existing  thepeace-keeping efforts of the world community have aparticularly important role. It is evident that there arecertain rules limiting the use of United Nationspeace-keeping forces  which reduces the effectiveness ofmeasures taken by the Organization in this regard.I would once again like to draw the attention of theSecurity Council and the Assembly squarely to thequestion of giving to the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS) joint peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan thestatus of a United Nations operation. The CIS countriesare helping Tajikistan with the protection of its southernborders  which are at the same time the borders of theCommonwealth. In this regard we recognize the specialand leading role of Russia  which has been and remainsthe guarantor of stability and security for all CentralAsian States. We do not believe the presence of the CISpeace-keeping forces in our country contradicts thedecisions of the Security Council or the initiatives of theSecretary-General aimed at achieving peace in Tajikistan.Moreover  from our point of view  these forces are thedecisive factor in deterrence and in overcoming a state ofcrisis on the Tajik-Afghan border. Taking a wider viewof this problem  one might even see the outlines of a newconcept of security for the whole of Central Asia. Westill hope the Security Council will find it opportune toreconsider our initiative to call a special meeting of theCouncil to consider the situation in and around Tajikistan as well as the question of giving the CIS jointpeace-keeping forces the status of a United Nationspeace-keeping force.The tragedies of the peoples of Bosnia andHerzegovina  Rwanda  Somalia and the hot spots in theCIS all give evidence of the fact that the danger ofnuclear catastrophe has been replaced by civil conflictscaused by international  religious or ethnic differences andthat their recurrence is becoming the primary problem forthe world community.I should like to say a few words on the question ofthe proposed reform of the Organization. On the whole3we support the idea of expanding the Security Council.Such a step  on the one hand  would reflect the globalchanges taking place in today’s world and  on the otherhand  would give an opportunity to achieve a morebalanced representation in the Council.The emerging consensus on the need to enlarge thenumber of seats in the Security Council will probablyimprove the efficiency of this central body of the UnitedNations. In other words  the Council will enhance itspotential  acquire more dynamism  increase the variety ofdecisions it takes and generate a wider spectrum of ideas.The world is diverse and is thus unique. Its diversity however  does not preclude the process of integration. Apraiseworthy example is Europe. A better future formankind is apparently based on these kinds of processes.Tajikistan as a member of the world community seesthe future of its development in the integration processes onvarious levels  in cooperation with neighbouring and distantcountries  regions and international organizations.The activities of the CSCE have proved to us theefficiency of such cooperation. Its informal approach to theaccelerated integration of Tajikistan into the internationalcommunity and the realization of the mandate of the CSCEMission to Tajikistan will undoubtedly be among the majorfactors in the achievement of national reconciliation in ourcountry. To a considerable extent we rely upon CSCEassistance to enhance democratic institutions and create asociety founded on the rule of law and on the basis of highstandards that will provide universal human rights andfreedoms for every citizen. While carrying out activepreparation for the upcoming Budapest summit meeting  wehope to put forward at that important forum our view of theproblems and to define the areas of cooperation.Undoubtedly for us the question of participation in theCommonwealth of Independent States is vital.Our present position is that independence andsovereignty is not a sword but is rather the shield of anation that must be strong but not heavy. Independenceshould not burden human lives but on the contrary shouldmake everybody’s life easier and give all people on Earththe opportunity to be equal. Principles of independence andsovereignty in the current period of history must be flexibleand diverse  for the main goal is to ensure that people whoused to have deeply rooted historical ties now have anopportunity for a wider realization of their economic andspiritual potential in the interests of future generations.It is precisely in this light that we consider thedevelopment of the Commonwealth of Independent Statesthat is trying to find a mutually acceptable form ofintegration without harming national interests. Despitewell-known difficulties the Commonwealth ofIndependent States pragmatically searches for ways torationalize all mechanisms of interaction among itsmembers.I am convinced that the leadership and the people ofStates members of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates have by now recognized the truth that it isunrealistic to expect that  alone  a country can expect tosolve the task of renewing society and of carrying outreforms. We are facing the historical reality of buildingour future by cooperative and coordinated efforts.In the post-Soviet period  Russia - a permanentmember of the Security Council - has assumed a heavyburden and responsibility for peace-keeping on a greaterpart of the territory of the former Soviet Union. We notewith deep satisfaction that these supreme efforts of Russiahave started to bring results. The multinational nation ofTajikistan highly appreciates and welcomes thepeace-keeping activities of Russia.I should like to note in this context that the ideas ofconcluding a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  ofadopting the decision on the Non-Proliferation Treaty’sopen-ended and unconditional extension  of developingregional programmes to strengthen peace and security and other proposals put forward by Mr. Boris Yeltsin President of the Russian Federation  in his address to theforty-ninth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly and aimed at strengthening internationalsecurity  all deserve the broadest support.Tajikistan notes with gratitude the initiatives byUzbekistan to bring about a peaceful solution to the intra-Tajik conflict and to ensure security and stability in theregion of Central Asia.We highly appreciate our good-neighbourly relationswith the States of Central Asia. We hope that the sphereof their integration efforts will expand in the interests ofall countries of the region of Central Asia. They deservecareful study and support.Nowadays it is universally recognized that alongsidepolitical questions  problems of social and economicdevelopment have assumed the same importance andurgency. The correctness of this statement is confirmed4by the conclusions reached at the end of the high-levelEconomic and Social Council segment  that we support andapprove. It is our firm conviction that the main aim ofrestructuring the United Nations should be to preserve andincrease its potential to solve the whole range ofdevelopment issues.For the Republic of Tajikistan which has found itselfin the hard grip of a transitional period aggravated by theconsequences of tragic events in recent years  the problemof economic survival has become a critical test. Accordingto the ""development indicators"" data published by theWorld Bank  Tajikistan has been included in the group ofcountries with the lowest level of per capita income.Today Tajikistan badly needs the help of theinternational community  not only to restore its economybut also to create the conditions for long-term development.Our country  which is a land-locked State  is counting onspecial attention from the international community inmatters of economic and social development  and hopes thatits appeal to include Tajikistan in the group of leastdeveloped countries will be properly understood andsupported by the United Nations community.I assure Members that the highest objective for theleaders of the Republic of Tajikistan is the achievement ofvalues common to all humanity  calmness and peace in ourRepublic  the creation of a unified  peaceful  developedState of Tajikistan. And I hope that all countries of theworld will help us to achieve this noble objective.Eighty years ago the fire of the First World War brokeout  and very soon - in a few months - humanity will markthe fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second WorldWar. These dates will forever be inscribed in the historyof the twentieth century  in the history of the world. Still the dates themselves are not as important as the lessonswhich these events have taught us.The bitter experience of the Second World Warpersuaded the leading Powers of the necessity to create aninternational organization the aim of which would be themaintenance and enhancement of peace all over the world.The main achievement of the United Nations during thealmost 50 years of its existence has been saving humankindfrom the fire of a new world war  and its development hastaken place on the basis of enhancing mutual understandingand cooperation  taking into account the interests of allparties  and the equality of large and small nations in thename of preserving our planet for future generations.Now  at the end of the twentieth century  it gives usgreat hope that the world community will not onlyprevent the outbreak of a third world war but will do itsbest to make sure that the twenty-first century willbecome a period of creativity and calm on the wholeplanet."
"163",6905,"TTO",49,1994,"I should like tooffer congratulations and special greetings to AmbassadorEssy on his unanimous election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. I am confident that under his ableleadership this session of the General Assembly is wellplaced to address successfully the important issues on itsagenda.Allow me to express appreciation to His ExcellencyMr. Samuel Insanally for his wise and effective guidanceduring the session just concluded. He has indeed made anoutstanding contribution  of which our region is very proud.We express our thanks to the Secretary-General for hisstewardship of the Organization during these trying times and we renew our pledge to give him our fullest support.Trinidad and Tobago  like the rest of the world  is inthe process of making fundamental changes in the way wemanage our affairs. We have already advancedsignificantly along the path of deregulation andliberalization brought upon us by the inexorable movetowards globalization and borderlessness  and mostimportantly by the absolute necessity to achieve greaterefficiency and higher sustainable levels of productivity.Greater emphasis is being placed on the market paradigmas the means to unleash the inner energies of our societyand to create the wealth needed for the improvement of thelives of all our citizens.But let me hasten to add that we are acutely aware ofthe imbalances that could arise as a result of the purest playof market forces  and we as a society consider it ourresponsibility to ensure that distributive justice exists in oursystem  sufficiently to guarantee the well-being of all of ourcitizens  including those who are unable to compete andwho for one reason or another may have been pushed outof the mainstream of national activity. In other words whilst many things may be changing  there is one constantin Trinidad and Tobago  and that is our preservation of ahumane and just society where all have the opportunity forfulfilment.Side by side with the globalization process  or maybeas a byproduct of it  is a resurgence of regionalismthroughout the world. In our own hemisphere this is verypronounced  and the dream of a free trade area from Alaskato Tierra del Fuego seems more realizable than ever before.We are pleased to see various subregional groupingsemerge and then develop relationships with one another.Never before in the history of our hemisphere has theintegration process been so advanced. We have the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  the SouthernCone Common Market (MERCOSUR)  the Andean Pact the Central American Integration Movement  the LatinAmerican Economic System (SELA)  the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) and the Rio Group  in additionof course to the Organization of American States. It issignificant that the cooperation which is flowering is notonly economic but also political; this augurs very well forthe development as well as for the security of thehemisphere.In addition to this multilateral coalescence  there isa general strengthening of bilateral relationships. We inCARICOM have been making strides towards overcominghistorical barriers and have been deepening our ties withLatin America. My own country  having this yearestablished diplomatic relations with six countries of LatinAmerica  now has diplomatic relations with all thecountries of the western hemisphere. Also  we joined 38others  including both independent countries andnon-independent Territories  in establishing theAssociation of Caribbean States  comprising countries ofthe Caribbean littoral and bringing into being a market ofover 200 million people with a combined gross domesticproduct of $500 billion.We do all this for the benefit of our people  realizingthat when we join forces we are stronger  we lay thebedrock for a stable environment within the hemisphere and we create  among other things  megamarkets for ourproducts and generate the wealth through which weimprove the standard of living in our countries.I have spoken about the possibilities for politicalco-operation as a result of the integration processes takingplace in our region. May I mention an outstandingcurrent example. I refer of course to Haiti. At present inHaiti  sanctioned by Security Council resolution 940(1994)  is a multinational force comprised mainly oftroops from the region  with military contributions fromelsewhere. My Government welcomes the cooperationextended by countries outside the region whosefarsightedness persuaded them to contribute to therestoration process now taking place in Haiti.In the changed circumstances of today’s world  thereis more than ever a need to cooperate for securitypurposes and for the preservation of democracy  and this19of course requires the political will which has beendemonstrated by our region in the Haitian situation.Soldiers from Trinidad and Tobago are part of themultinational force at present in Haiti. We are pleased toparticipate in the collective efforts to ensure stability andthe return of democracy and the democratically electedPresident to that country. We believe that the Caribbeanhas a special responsibility in relation to Haiti. We havetherefore been in the forefront of attempts to solve thecrisis  and we vow to remain with the problem until it is nomore with us.Trinidad and Tobago joins the jubilation of themillions of proud Haitians at home and in the diaspora atthe welcome news of the resignation of General RaoulCedras and his Chief of Staff. Like others  we hope thissends an unequivocal message to those elements in Haitithat seek to continue to wage war and terror against apeople still yearning for a society of freedom  democracyand justice - a society in which the collective talents andresourcefulness of Haitians can be appropriately channelledtowards rebuilding their nation and fighting the enemies ofpoverty and degradation.Another area of Caribbean concern has to do withCuba. We welcome the commencement of dialoguebetween Cuba and the United States of America on specificissues. These talks should assist in laying a foundation forthe resolution of remaining difficulties and in achieving thelong-term objective of fully reintegrating Cuba into theWestern Hemisphere. We in the Caribbean are doing ourpart towards the goal of Cuba’s reintegration. We haveestablished the Cuba-Caribbean Community (CARICOM)Mixed Commission  and recently Cuba joined us as afounding member of the Association of Caribbean States.Trinidad and Tobago also welcomes the consolidationof democracy in the Latin American and Caribbean region.Peaceful elections continue to be conducted in thesecountries  deepening the democratic process in the region.We are pleased with the many positive developmentsin our part of the world. There have also been positivedevelopments in former areas of conflict which seized theattention of this body for many years  further illustratingwhat can be achieved through partnership and political will.The peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa a fewmonths ago stands out as a beacon of hope and signals thatno problem is insurmountable if there is concerted nationaland international action. Trinidad and Tobago joins withthe international community in assuring South Africa of itscontinued support in this crucial post-apartheid period. TheGovernment of South Africa has announced its decisionto include among its priorities the continuation oftraditional friendships and the promotion of newpartnerships. We look forward to the development ofstrong bilateral relations between South Africa andourselves  a process that is already under way.Trinidad and Tobago is also heartened by theprogress achieved so far in the Middle East peaceprocess. We welcome the initiation of self-governingarrangements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho - importantdevelopments in this transition period - and look forwardto the extension of Palestinian self-governingarrangements to encompass other occupied territories inthe implementation of the Declaration of Principles. Theinternational community’s support for development effortsin the economic and social fields and the rebuilding ofinfrastructure destroyed during the long years ofoccupation is critical to the Palestinian people at this time.We are encouraged by the Washington Declarationof 25 July 1994  issued by the Governments of Jordanand Israel  which ended the state of war and paves theway for normalization of relations and a formal peacetreaty. We also appreciate the efforts made by the Syrianand Lebanese Governments in their commitment toadvancing the peace process in the Middle East.Whilst there is cause for satisfaction globally  wecontinue to be traumatized by other events which havealready shattered the lives of millions of people  evokingimages more horrendous than those we have witnessedbefore. In Bosnia and Herzegovina  a genocidal warrages on  having already brought the evil of “ethniccleansing” into our modern vocabulary and consciousness.We were first appalled and are now numbed by the horrorin Rwanda  where hundreds of thousands of lives havebeen lost  creating hellish human suffering in that country.Destruction  oppression and suffering continue in variousparts of the world  affecting hundreds of thousands oflives in Somalia and elsewhere.Nuclear proliferation makes us all very uneasy creating pictures of an abyss of unspeakable chaos intowhich we can very easily slip. The ideological dividemay be behind us  but the threat of Armageddon stillhangs over humanity.It has become a cliché of international helplessnessto say that the world community must act decisively andexpeditiously to do this or that to deal with many of theproblems that I have mentioned. The fact is that there is20a very long road ahead. To effect lasting solutions to thecrises that are upon us we must go back always to thefundamentals and remember  for example  that developmentand peace are inextricably linked. If we are to getanywhere near to solving some of our problems we mustdeal with key issues such as good governance  thepromotion of peace  the promotion of justice as a pillar ofsociety  sustainable environmental management and socialdevelopment.There is no doubt in my mind that the worldcommunity is already beginning to grapple withfundamentals. We are in the process of elaborating theAgenda for Development as a necessary complement to the“Agenda for Peace”. International conferences of worldleaders  some held and others to come  all point the way toa new partnership for development based on globalconsensus and action.In this regard  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment will be convened in March 1995 in Denmarkto address some of the serious ills afflicting many societiesby focusing on the key problems of poverty  unemploymentand social marginalization. The programme of action to beadopted at the social Summit must therefore includespecific provisions  including adequate financial resourcesfor implementation and follow-up by the internationalcommunity and  more specifically  by the United Nationsand its agencies and institutions.There can be no doubt that the quality of life in manycountries today as it relates to the individual is undergoinga grave transformation. The growing intolerance andincreasing senseless violence within the home and incommunities at large have led many to question the verymores of the society in which we live. The situation isfurther aggravated by the growth of organized transnationalcrime  which in many countries exacerbates problems oframpant vicious criminal activity  terrorism  drug abuse illegal drug trafficking and money laundering.In this era of increasing globalization  no Government particularly Governments in the developing world  canhope  on its own  to address effectively these variedproblems. We therefore welcome the approval by theInternational Law Commission earlier this year of a draftstatute for an international criminal court and we supportthe convening of a diplomatic conference to conclude aconvention on the establishment of a permanent court.Another important area being tackled by theinternational community is the full participation of womenin the process of development. The fact is  effectiveinternational cooperation for development will remainelusive  in the absence of specific measures for anadequate means of empowering all members of society toparticipate fully in the political  economic and social lifeof their respective societies. It is widely acknowledgedthat investment in women can have an enormous impacton the advancement of society as a whole. However women from all parts of the globe continue to facesystematic discrimination in all fields of endeavour  whilealso bearing a disproportionate burden of theconsequences of economic recession  poverty  structuraladjustment policies and political strife.In acknowledging this  Trinidad and Tobago has putin place constitutional guarantees to ensure equaltreatment for all under the law  irrespective of gender creed or race. My Government holds steadfastly to theposition that women must be allowed equal opportunityto participate fully in all spheres of life and at all levelsof society  particularly in decision-making positions.Trinidad and Tobago is encouraged by efforts madeduring the ongoing preparatory process for the FourthWorld Conference on Women to address these and othercrucial issues. Much work remains to be done in theensuing months. My Government will continue to workclosely with others in an effort to elaborate concreterecommendations  including specific attainable goals aimed at overcoming the numerous impediments to theadvancement of women.The population question also continues to be on theinternational agenda. It is recognized that population-related goals and policies must be integral parts ofcultural  economic and social development aimed atimproving the quality of life. Consequently  theInternational Conference on Population and Development which was convened in Cairo last September  quiteappropriately reviewed the impact of demographic factorson development and emphasized the importance of theentire spectrum of population policies to the developmentprocess. We must now take concrete steps to uphold theprinciples and implement the Programme of Actionadopted by the Conference.The crucial area of the environment is also beingdiscussed. Member States have taken initial steps at thenational and international levels  towards the elaborationof a new development paradigm based on the integrationof environmental concerns in development activities. Thecontinuation of this process would lead to the21implementation of the policies and decisions adopted at Riode Janeiro  thereby making possible the attainment of thetargets identified for our common good.As a follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference  theGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States  which was held inBarbados earlier this year  allowed island States and the restof the international community to explore a comprehensiveapproach to sustainable development within the frameworkof Agenda 21. For many island developing States whichhave remained on the periphery of internationalprogrammes for development  the implementation of theagreements adopted in Barbados will create the opportunityto participate as contributors and beneficiaries in a trulyglobal effort. As Chairman of the Alliance of Small IslandStates  Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its commitment toplaying a lead role in the active pursuit of theimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.The preservation and sustainable management of theresources in all global commons must be an important goalof the Agenda for Development. But this goal must befacilitated by the development of legal regimes to ensurethat we successfully carry out our duties as trustees of thoseresources.In this context  Trinidad and Tobago welcomes theimminent entry into force of the 1982 United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea  having participated veryactively with other Member States in forging a new  moreuniversally accepted public order for the oceans. The spiritof accommodation and consensus manifested in the workachieved by the Preparatory Commission for theInternational Seabed Authority and for the InternationalTribunal for the Law of the Sea constitutes a solid andvaluable foundation for the launching of the InternationalSeabed Authority in Kingston  Jamaica  on16 November 1994. Trinidad and Tobago will continue toparticipate constructively and in close cooperation withother Member States in the decision-making process of theAuthority as well as in other institutions related to the 1982Convention.The coming into force of the Convention on the Lawof the Sea should provide an impetus to the United NationsConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly MigratoryFish Stocks  which is developing principles for the effectivemanagement of one of the most important renewable foodresources. This objective can be attained only if there is aconfluence of political will to act decisively.Political will is also absolutely necessary if we areto address adequately the various international economicimpediments to effective national efforts to promote socialprogress and better standards of life. The major obstaclesinclude trade barriers  insufficient flows of internationalfinancing  onerous external debt and the inadequatetransfer of technology to developing countries. Theyserve to frustrate the ardent efforts made by Governmentsto revitalize their economies.Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the important steptaken earlier this year towards free and open trade  withthe successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of tradenegotiations. We emphasize  however  that as we seek toimplement the trade liberalization measures under theagreements arrived at  urgent attention must be given tothe persistent trend of economic growth accompanied byincreased poverty  unemployment and marginalization oflarge sections of populations the world over.It is clear from what I have said that it is onlythrough a multilateral approach that we will solve theproblems of the world. Clearly  the most appropriatevehicle to accommodate this approach is the UnitedNations. People are turning increasingly to the UnitedNations not only for the realization of their aspirations forpeace and security  but also in their quest fordevelopment with equity and social justice. Following thedissipation of the distrust and hostility of the cold-warera  the United Nations ought to be in a better position torespond to these needs.On becoming a Member of the United Nations 32years ago  Trinidad and Tobago undertook along withother Member States to maintain international peace andsecurity and to promote the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples. To this end we intend toparticipate actively in current efforts to restructure theUnited Nations to enable it to become more responsive tothe needs of Member States in this dynamic internationalenvironment.As the United Nations is on the threshold ofcelebrating its fiftieth anniversary  Trinidad and Tobagois pleased to recommit itself to the purposes andprinciples enshrined in the Charter. As Members  weneed to redouble our efforts towards forging universalpeace and a new era of development  in which bothnations and individuals find security and fulfilment. I amconfident that inherent in the human condition is thedesire and the will to achieve these goals."
"164",6952,"TUN",49,1994,"It is my pleasure to convey to you  Mr. President  the text of the letter I have been charged by President Zein El Abidine Ben Ali  President of the Republic of Tunisia and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity to read to the General Assembly on his behalf. The President would have liked to deliver this speech himself  but for reasons beyond his control he is unable to do so. I shall therefore read his speech to the Assembly.""I have the pleasure  first of all  to extend to you  Mr. President  my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election does honour both to the entire African continent and to our sister country  Cote d'lvoire  and is also a well-deserved tribute to your excellent reputation. We are confident that your vast experience and outstanding qualities will be the best guarantee of the success of the work of the session.	(Cote d'lvoire)""It is also a pleasure for me to reiterate my warmest congratulations to your august Assembly and to assure you of the great importance that Tunisia attaches to the laudable and sometimes exhausting efforts which the United Nations continues to deploy in the service of peace and in laying the foundations of constructive dialogue between nations.""Tunisia  which has opted for dialogue as a means of conducting both its domestic and its foreign policies  can only support this approach  contribute to its consolidation and entrenchment.""The innumerable peace initiatives undertaken by the United Nations are distinguished by their civilizing character  as well as by their highly humanistic orientation. The fact is that civilization cannot coexist with war  just as peace cannot exist without dialogue. There is no doubt that our United Nations system possesses  in addition to the tool of dialogue  the means whereby it is able to deal with problems that threaten peace and security in our contemporary world.""Given the magnitude of the responsibility devolving on us all  given the accumulation of world problems in the areas of security and of the economy in particular  with all the attendant risks that arise there from  we are of the opinion that international solidarity requires all members of the international community to be more committed and to make further contributions to the search for effective solutions to such problems within the framework of the prevailing tenets of universalism and globalism.""Five years ago  from this very rostrum  I described to your august Assembly the radical reforms which we had then undertaken to put in place in Tunisia with determination and perseverance  in the wake of the constitutional change of 7 November 1987  as we faced up to the new challenges resulting from the great changes which were confronting us within the international community.""From the outset  we had opted  as a basic choice  for promoting the participation of our citizens and for the harnessing of their full potential in building their own future  in the conviction that such is the very essence of democracy  and its real meaning.""Since modernization of political structures can never yield the desired results if not accompanied by a reform process covering the social and economic sectors  we promulgated laws and put in place structures which we deemed capable of liberalizing the economy and encouraging private initiative in all sectors of production. In addition  we readjusted the fiscal system and improved the functioning of the banking and financial system in order to align them with this trend. As a culmination of this process  we enacted a unified investment law and reorganized and streamlined the functioning of the administrative channels.""At the same time  we devoted special attention to developing and strengthening our human potential in various areas  in particular through reforming our system of education and improving professional training. We also strengthened the cultural sector; consolidated the plan for the struggle against illiteracy and for the advancement of women  with a view to strengthening their rights and preserving their dignity by making them partners with full rights and duties in the work of development.""We also attach great importance to the protection of children and of the family. In the social domain  we adopted dialogue and negotiation as the basis for relationships between the forces of production. We have also made efforts to preserve the gains of workers  to promote good working conditions  to expand social welfare coverage and to protect health and safety in the workplace while trying to increase job opportunities. At the same time  we have revitalized the values of social mutual assistance and national solidarity in order to render assistance to the disadvantaged  to help develop the outlaying areas of the country  to integrate them in the framework of the national economy and  thereby  to raise the standards of living of their inhabitants.""The year 1994 has been a particularly momentous one for Tunisia. For the first time  a multi-party parliament has been elected. We had the honour of hosting the thirtieth summit of the Organization of African Unity and of welcoming President Nelson Mandela  hero of the struggle against racial discrimination and first President of the free Republic of South Africa  and a living symbol of Africa's wisdom in its most lofty sense.""In the same year  we said farewell to President Yasser Arafat  who returned to his homeland after having lived with us for 12 years  a respected and honoured guest  as the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization  now that the Palestinian people are beginning to recover their inalienable and legitimate national rights after a heroic struggle which lasted for half a century. We should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our deep satisfaction at the positive and promising steps that have been taken in the context of the Middle East peace process  and voice our determination to continue to contribute to the efforts aimed at achieving a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.""We have also spared no effort in strengthening further our close ties with our neighbours within the framework of the Arab Maghreb  as well as with the Arab  Muslim and African countries  the non-aligned countries and all friendly countries in Europe  Asia and America  with which we share mutual interests and have ties of fruitful cooperation. We have never hesitated to support those causes which were right and just  such as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and have responded positively  in so far as we were able  to the appeals and initiatives of the United Nations in the field of peace-keeping in several parts of the world.""All these choices  efforts and achievements entitle us to reaffirm that today  Tunisia is able to meet the challenge of change which it had the courage to take up well before the advent of the global changes which we have been witnessing since the end of the last decade. Tunisia  the land of openness  tolerance and moderation  inspired as it is by its rich legacy of civilization and dedicated to its convictions and its guiding principles  will spare no effort in continuing to make its constructive contribution to international efforts  particularly within the framework of the United Nations  in order to strengthen sustainable development and peace throughout the world in the interest of all mankind. It goes without saying that our mandate at the head of the Organization of African Unity affords us a valuable opportunity to work further in mobilizing the international community and in focusing heightened attention on the concerns of the African continent  whose countries represent nearly a third of the Member States of the United Nations.""Today  the African scene especially as projected by the audio-visual mass media  confronts us with highly contradictory images. Thus  while taking note with satisfaction and optimism of the reconciliation and harmony that we now see among the various elements of society in South Africa  which in the past were torn asunder by the odious system of apartheid  we feel despair and sadness at the persistent conflicts and hotbeds of tension in other parts of the continent. However  it would be neither fair nor objective to limit ourselves to a negative assessment of such events without attempting to shed light on them and to identify their causes in order to be able  with wisdom and concern  to remedy them and to contain their effects.""In order to resolve the fundamental problems of Africa  we need to identify the ideal path and the most effective means of helping the continent gain control over the course of events and changes that are taking place on its soil. We have to do this not only for the sake of Africa but also in the interest of the international community as a whole. We should always keep in mind the imperative need to deal specifically with the fundamental issue which confronts so many African countries  namely  the achievement of political reform and the modernization of the economy  as corollaries of global development  under conditions of security and stability.""There can be no doubt that in the area of political reform  the African continent has taken concrete and promising steps; but not as many as it would have liked  nor at the rate it would have desired. The African States more than anyone else  are well aware of that.""On the other hand  as the efforts of the donor countries have fallen short of expectations  those countries should review their stance with regard to the development process in Africa in the light of the new realities and the changes that have taken place  which require the international community to redouble its efforts to participate effectively in the development of the continent.""Africa is fully aware that the responsibility for its development is  in the first instance  its own. This is an awareness that has been confirmed by the African leaders  at their Summit in Tunis this year  when they stated that it is the duty of the Africans themselves to face up to the challenges that the present course of events confronts them with and to undertake firmly and in earnest the necessary economic reform and the rational development of human and material resources.""At their thirtieth Summit  held in Tunis  the African leaders voiced an unshakeable will to live in peace and to mobilize their potential in the service of global and sustainable development  in order to be able to ensure a decent life for their fellow-citizens  free them from all forms of domination and hegemony and guarantee their ability to exercise their right freely to choose the model of society most in keeping with their traditions and the specific cultures. Experience has shown the gravity of the error of trying to carbon copy systems of power and of administration and impose them on peoples of other continents. The tragic consequences of such efforts are very much in evidence.""Nevertheless  we look to the future with optimism  for today most countries of the African continent  with a heightened sense of responsibility and commitment  are trying to rid themselves once and for all of the legacies of the past. This necessary and legitimate endeavour can be made concrete only through consecration of the values of democracy  freedom and justice - those higher values to which mankind in Africa has always adhered spontaneously and enthusiastically.""During the Cairo Summit the African States were able to establish machinery for the prevention  management and settlement of conflicts. This decision was reaffirmed at the Tunis Summit. The African machinery has already begun to operate and has made a start on the implementation of the resolutions of the Tunis Summit and is tackling numerous remaining problems and crises in Africa - such as those of Rwanda  Burundi  Angola and Somalia - with a view to assisting in their settlement.""In this context  we have spared no effort  as acting President of the Organization of African Unity  in cooperation and in coordination with African leaders  to increase emergency assistance to Rwanda. It is indisputable that the tragic situation prevailing in Rwanda requires the participation of everyone of goodwill  including the international community  and the mobilization of all efforts to heal the wounds of the brotherly people of Rwanda and to help them recover their security and stability  in harmony and fraternity.""In implementing Security Council resolution 918 (1994)  the African States have not hesitated to demonstrate their readiness to send troops to Rwanda within the framework of the second stage of the United Nations Mission (UNAMIR II) with a view to the re-establishment of security in this brotherly country  in accordance with the decisions of the Arusha Summit.""We would have hoped  however  that material and logistical support for the African States involved had not been delayed. It was this delay that prevented the deployment of troops in Rwanda at a time when their presence was essential to and would have been a decisive factor in establishing peace and security in this brotherly country and in the region and in bringing about the desired national reconciliation that would have made possible the return of thousands of refugees  and thus would have mitigated the effects of this tragedy in line with the Arusha process.""In this respect  I should like to emphasize that the establishment of the machinery for the prevention  management and settlement of conflicts reflects Africa's political will to give concrete expression to preventive diplomacy. However  the existence of such will is not enough by itself  when it comes to taking on such a role. Hence the major responsibility devolving on the United Nations to assist the machinery  by providing the funds for peace deriving from the Organization  as well as necessary means for the success of such intervention.""At the Tunis Summit  the African countries adopted a code of honour and conduct designed to govern relations between the States of the continent and that aims at promoting the struggle against all forms of extremism  fanaticism and terrorism which are among the most important issues before the United Nations and the international community.""In this respect  one of the object lessons to be learnt from the events in Rwanda is that it is imperative that the review of the United Nations Security Council's methods of work be expedited and that the necessary measures to deal with the problem of procrastination that has been noted in the implementation of United Nations resolutions be taken with the speed and diligence required in dealing with international crisis situations so that United Nations intervention may be effective and timely. Failing this  the role of preventive diplomacy will have to be strengthened and Africa will have to be provided with the opportunity to contribute to its strengthening realistically in order to avoid any recurrence of the tragedies we have witnessed  such as those of Rwanda  Burundi and Somalia.""Joint African action in the economic sphere has continued since the African Economic Community was set up at the Abuja Summit in 1991. The aim is to initiate a strategy that would make possible the achievement of the complementarity and economic integration of the African States. Those States are required to achieve a greater degree of coordination and cooperation amongst themselves in order for them to be able to cope with the new developments in world markets especially after the establishment of the World Trade Organization. They have to explore prospects for the future so that Africa may be assured of a better position in international trade  which is witnessing a diminution of the share of the least developed countries.""Clearly  the efforts that Africa is currently making to solve the problems of the present and to secure the future deserve the support and assistance of the international community. I have called upon the leaders of the seven richest countries  when they met recently in Naples  to become involved in the concerns of the African continent and to respond to its desire for a review of the level and content of its cooperation with the international community within the framework of a global strategy of North-South cooperation based on partnership and mutual development for peace and progress.""While noting with satisfaction and being gratified at the success of numerous countries of America and of Asia with regard to settling the debt problem and increasing the rate of economic growth  we note with regret that the burden of external debt still constitutes the major obstacle to development efforts in Africa  as it has a highly negative impact on programmes of economic and social reform and on foreign investment.""In addition  it is important to note that the increasing level of African indebtedness arises essentially from the cost of debt servicing  which is doubling year by year and which  along with the deterioration in the terms of trade  is a principal factor inhibiting the African countries' development efforts.""We believe that stability  security and development are a collective responsibility and a common aspiration. The rich countries are called upon to take account of this in their policies; to make their public opinion sensitive to the importance of economic assistance for the developing countries; to make provision for a reduction in the staggering imbalances between peoples; and to highlight the positive consequences of such an approach  in the medium and in the long term  for the donor countries themselves through the opening up of markets  profitable investments and the limiting of emigration and of the problems resulting there from - the most appropriate means of translating preventive diplomacy into concrete action in dealing with all types of crises.""It was in the context of these mutual interests that we suggested several years ago to the industrialized countries the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for development in Africa that would allow the States of the continent clearly to define their economic plans on the basis of continuous support by the countries and institutions that back them financially.""Starting with 1989  I have proposed a number of initiatives at several international forums  including this General Assembly  the G-7 summits at Toronto and Naples  the European Union summit in Strasbourg  the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and the Vienna Conference. All those initiatives related to such issues as human rights  the environment  the concretization of North-South cooperation through the conclusion of development partnership contracts between the developing countries and the industrialized countries and the recycling of debts. The ultimate aim was the codification of trade and political relations on the international level.""All of those proposed initiatives have now taken shape. Some of them are being implemented  while others are still being studied by regional and international groupings.""Today  the world witnesses new phenomena  which have an ever-greater impact on the international arena and which are primarily characterized by universality and comprehensiveness. We are therefore all the more convinced of the timeliness of our initiatives and of the need to carry on and complete their implementation.""The organic interdependence of the present and future interests of States has now become a concrete reality. The same is true of the relationships amongst peoples in all their various aspects  which are subject to the functioning of the machineries of multilateral cooperation that manage the complex relations of States on the external and the domestic levels.""It is in this context that the various forthcoming international events will take place  namely  the United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders  which will be held in Tunis; the International Symposium on Organized Crime; the World Summit for Social Development  as well as the proclamation of 1995 as the United Nations Year for Tolerance; and the World Conference on Women  which will take place in Beijing. All of these events have been scheduled to take place in the context of the international action aimed at the setting up of humanity's agenda for comprehensive development - 'An Agenda for Peace' -that would reflect  on another level  the universal nature of human security.""Thus the international community is called upon to mobilize itself on the occasion of the Tunis meeting on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders and the International Symposium on Organized Crime in order to hone a preventive strategy  identify the means required or  more specifically  to build effective institutional structures to combat terrorism and organized crime  including offences of an economic and political nature  such as violations of human rights and drug trafficking.""In this respect  Tunisia has unswervingly adopted a diplomacy of cooperation based on peace  stability and security. In addition  we are working to ensure that the United Nations Year for Tolerance will be a good occasion wherein such human values will be underscored and made a political goal and a means of avoiding and preventing disputes.""As for the World Summit for Social Development  it will afford an opportunity to search for urgent international solutions to urgent social problems and to make clear the need for the formulation of an international strategy for social development  since social problems today are an overriding concern of all countries both in the North and in the South. Indeed  those problems endanger stability  security and peace throughout the world and in particular in Africa. Therefore  the African Heads of State and Government recognized  during their meeting in Tunis  the importance of this world Summit and the need carefully to consider the recommendations that will result from it.""The strong upheavals that have taken place on the world scene have directly impacted on the conditions in many countries and particularly in those which do not have the wealth or sufficient potential to adapt to the new international order. Therefore  the international community is called upon to devise new modes of cooperation. Such modes  as they will have to be unprecedented in both form and content  will require the existence of political will and international solidarity and the establishment of a partnership for lasting social and human development.""The improvement of living conditions  respect for human dignity  justice for all  equality of all races and peoples  as well as the values of tolerance and respect for others  are the indispensable foundations upon which social life and international cooperation must be based.""We are gratified here to reiterate our great appreciation of the active role that the United Nations performs in the management of problems of peace  security and development throughout the world. We would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the son of Africa and of the Arab world who has worked to introduce a new dynamism into the agenda for comprehensive development and the 'Agenda for Peace'. This role is supported by the African States  and we continue to find it a source of great encouragement. In the same context  we take note with great satisfaction of the compromise reached within the framework of the Organization of African Unity concerning the need to implement the project for structural reform of the United Nations aimed at greater efficiency and increased balance and equality in the representation of regional groups.""In this context  we insist on the legitimacy of the wish expressed by the African continent to strengthen its presence within the United Nations system by obtaining for itself that place which goes hand in hand with its position and with its aspiration to make a greater contribution to the management of international affairs and to the strengthening of security  stability and progress throughout the world.""It is on behalf of Tunisia and on behalf of the Organization of African Unity that I renew this appeal  while hoping that at this session we will achieve adequate formulas for reforms to be undertaken within the United Nations system  in order to consolidate the foundations of security  peace and stability throughout the world and to provide a stimulus for the process of development for the benefit of all of humankind."""
"165",6999,"TUR",49,1994,"Allow me to congratulate thePresident on his election to his high office  and to thank theoutgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for his wise leadership during the forty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly.Many had hoped that the fall of the Berlin Wall wouldput an end to the divisions of the world and usher in a newera of peace and harmony among nations. This has nothappened. Today humanity faces a new division orfragmentation far more dramatic in essence. The world istorn between hope and despair. This is the new divisionwe are facing.On the one hand  hope: the spirit of democracy iskept alive. The global commitment to the universalprinciples of respect for human rights  the rule of law andfundamental freedoms has been maintained.On the other hand  despair: the eruption oflong-suppressed evil forces  such as ethnic and xenophobicnationalism  racism and tribalism  has caused new conflicts.They have emerged as new threats to international peaceand security.On the darkest side  there are new instances ofgenocide. Slogans of racial hatred have resurfaced.Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed orwounded; hundreds of thousands of people have becomerefugees or displaced persons. Human dignity has beenviolated.On the brightest side  historic breakthroughs have beenachieved in South Africa and the Middle East. Thecourageous stand of some eminent statesmen has beeninstrumental in translating the basic vision of the UnitedNations into reality. In this respect  our praise goes to theleaders of Palestine  Israel and South Africa for theircourage and far-sightedness. Their bold steps towardspeace fostered our optimism to counter the negativetrends.In order to be able to plan a better future  we musttake account of the achievements and the failures of thepast and meet the challenges of the present. The time hascome to start to contemplate realistically how to createnew and workable mechanisms to respond effectively tothe challenges of our times. But we first have to acceptthe fact that euphoria is almost always short-lived.Today we observe two contradictory trends  onetowards fragmentation and conflict and the other towardsglobalization and cooperation. This new dialectic definesthe framework within which we have to work together tofind a balance between optimism and pessimism  betweenthe integrity of the nation-State and the demands of anever more interdependent world.This Organization was built on the ashes of theSecond World War. The war’s aftermath left its imprintnot only on the United Nations Charter  but also on therules that govern its work and its structure. Hence  thecrucial challenge before us today is to make the UnitedNations the real centre of universal solidarity  byimproving its effectiveness and harmonizing its work withthese new imperatives. It is in line with this reasoningthat we attach the utmost importance to the process ofreform and restructuring of the United Nations.In this exercise  the pivotal point should be theSecurity Council. The widespread demands to make thatprincipal body more representative  more responsive more transparent and more accountable have imposedupon us a historic task which we must fulfil. Thedemocratization of the Security Council is a challenge ofour times  one that requires an adequate response. Themoral authority of this body needs to be reinforced. Wehave to enhance the representative weight of the SecurityCouncil by enlarging it and by establishing a fairer andmore orderly system of rotation within the geographicalgroups.We must make sure that the Security Council is notperceived as a tool of a small group of big States thatseek to impose their will and their national policyobjectives on others. Indeed  the moral and legalauthority of the Security Council’s decisions emanatesfrom the fact that the Council  in accordance with Article24 of the Charter  acts on behalf of all States Members of23the United Nations. Consequently  it is essential that theworking methods of the Security Council be reviewed toreflect the spirit of democratization.With this understanding  my country  Turkey  has beenactively participating in the deliberations of the Open-endedWorking Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council. We expect this Working Group tobecome a genuine driving force for real reform of theSecurity Council. Therefore  any ""quick-fix"" solution inwhich the reform may be interpreted in a rather narrowsense cannot be accepted. In the same vein  we also fullysupport the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalizethe work of the General Assembly as the central anduniversal deliberative forum.The ongoing conflicts and tragedies all over the worldunderscore the urgency of our task of strengthening theUnited Nations  particularly in the field of collectivesecurity. In the past five years  United Nationspeace-keeping operations have undergone considerableexpansion. The nature of peace-keeping is changing.Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-enforcement peace-building and global human security have emerged asnew concepts on which further reflection is needed.As an active participant in the peace-keepingoperations of the United Nations  Turkey believes that theirsuccess depends ultimately on the support and assistancereceived from the community of nations. This  in turn requires the awareness of a sense of shared responsibilityin addressing our common concerns.The United Nations stand-by forces  in which we havedecided to participate  would play an essential role inpromoting such awareness. Only when a potentialaggressor clearly perceives that the international communitywill retaliate in a timely and effective manner might itchange its behaviour.The challenges we are facing today go beyond themeans and resources of a single organization. Accordingly there is a need for a new collective security architecture ofmutually-reinforcing institutions in which all elementswould have a role to play. The interaction between globalsecurity and regional security requires effective cooperationand coordination among the United Nations and regionalorganizations. One thing is clear: only the United Nationscan provide legitimacy to regional arrangements andinstitutions in the fields of peace-keeping and peacemaking.From Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Caucasus toRwanda  the peoples of the world  faced with threats ofracist hatred  are desperately demanding the helping handand protection of the United Nations.Regrettably  the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovinahas continued to be at the top of the international agendaduring the past 12 months. Despite numerous SecurityCouncil and General Assembly resolutions  theinternational community has been able neither to put anend to the ethnic cleansing  nor to roll back the brutalaggression against the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina. On the contrary  the lack of effectiveenforcement measures has encouraged the aggressors toproceed further with their genocidal campaign and theirblatant defiance of international law.Decisive and firm action to stop the aggression islong overdue. The Washington and Vienna Agreementslaid down the foundation for a just and viable peace inBosnia. These Agreements define the framework of afederation which preserves the territorial integrity andunity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multicultural multireligious and multi-ethnic State. They are also opento the participation of Bosnian Serbs.The Bosnian Government accepted the latestinternational peace plan proposed by the five-nationContact Group in the spirit of peace. However  theextremist Serbs  longing for an ethnically homogeneousGreater Serbia  have insisted on their defiance of the willof the international community and have rejected thepeace plan. Their rejection has demonstrated  yet again that aggression cannot be halted on the shifting sands ofpromises and declarations.The five-nation Contact Group has committed itself in case of rejection  to the tightening of sanctions onSerbia and Montenegro. We deeply regret that theSecurity Council  by adopting resolution 943 (1994) on23 September 1994  moved in the opposite directiondespite the efforts of the Contact Group of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Once again aggression has been rewarded. Genocide remainsunchecked. The Bosnian people are yet again completelydisappointed with the international system. Theirdisappointment is shared more and more by the rest of theworld  especially in the Islamic countries.We have arrived at a critical juncture. Theinternational community should stand by its commitmentsand should begin to act resolutely. We have to admit24that only diplomacy backed by sufficient force can makethe extremist Serbs realize that war gives them more painthan gain. There should be no further easing of thesanctions until Serbia and Montenegro recognize all thesuccessor States within their international borders.As winter approaches  the need to provide security shelter and humanitarian assistance to the civilianpopulation becomes ever more pressing. The safe areasshould be extended and effectively protected by the UnitedNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The strangulationof Sarajevo should be ended. The humanitarian corridorsshould remain open.As a matter of principle  the Bosnian Governmentmust be provided with all the means necessary forself-defence  so that it may exercise its inherent right underArticle 51 of the Charter. This is a moral  legal andpolitical obligation on the part of the internationalcommunity - but primarily a moral one.President Izetbegovic´  in his address at the 7th plenarymeeting  on 27 September 1994  from this rostrum announced a new formula in this respect. On the conditionthat certain conditions be fulfilled  he limited his justdemand for the lifting of the arms embargo to the adoptionof a formal decision  deferring the implementation of thedecision for six months. This is a new sacrifice motivatedby the international community’s inability to providesecurity for the victims or to recognize their basic right toself-defence. We must praise this noble gesture andsupport the new formula.Realization of the commitments to a just and viablepeace in Bosnia - commitments that have so far remainedunfulfilled - is vital for the restoration of the credibility andmoral authority of the United Nations. If we fail the test ofhistory in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the so-called ""newworld order"" could turn into a permanent ""new worlddisorder"".We are witnessing further potential threats to the peaceand stability of the Balkans. With the increasing tensionbetween Greece and Albania there is  regrettably  a risk thatyet another crisis may be created in the region. In addition the Republic of Macedonia is suffering from an illegaleconomic blockade imposed by Greece. Moreover Macedonia is still waiting to be represented at the UnitedNations under the name and the flag it has chosen.The Balkans can in no way stand the pressure ofadditional tensions. Compliance with the basic internationalnorms - respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity non-intervention in internal affairs  and the need toresolve disputes by peaceful means rather than by threator coercion - is today more than ever before a pressingneed in the Balkans.My country lies at the very epicentre of the vastgeography and the new geopolitics of Eurasia. Most ofthe conflicts which are high on the international agendaare taking place around Turkey. Fully aware of ourresponsibilities for the peace and stability of our regionand beyond  we are trying to contain conflicts.We seek to reverse destabilizing currents. We striveto promote the rule of law and democracy on ourperiphery. We remain a factor for stability. We believethat regional economic cooperation is a driving force forshared prosperity and increased confidence among nationsas well as the most effective way to prevent the spread ofethnic conflicts and potential hegemonic tendencies.With this awareness  we have developed newcreative and cooperative regional initiatives to enhancesolidarity and to consolidate the new geopoliticalpluralism. We have established the Black Sea EconomicCooperation with Albania  Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bulgaria Georgia  Greece  the Republic of Moldova  Romania  theRussian Federation and Ukraine. The EconomicCooperation Organization  originally founded by Turkey Iran and Pakistan  has been enlarged to includeAfghanistan  Azerbaijan  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Another blatant example of defiance of internationallaw has been unfolding in the Caucasus  where Armenianforces continue to occupy one-fifth of Azerbaijaniterritory. More than a million Azerbaijanis have beendisplaced. Constant calls by the international communityfor the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal ofoccupying forces  as stipulated in relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  have fallen on deaf ears. Thisunlawful situation  created by Armenians  constitutes aserious threat not only to the stability of the regionneighbouring Turkey  but also to international peace andsecurity.As a member of the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE) Minsk Group since itsinception  Turkey remains committed to the CSCE peaceprocess. We firmly believe that a solution should befound through collective efforts under the authority of theCSCE. In this respect  we fully support the endeavours25of the Chairman of the Minsk Group to organize amultinational force to assist the parties to reach a just andlasting solution. We stand ready to contribute to theseendeavours.In this context  I should like to reiterate our consistentand firm position  which we have expressed from thisrostrum on many occasions: Neither in the Balkans nor inthe Caucasus  nor  for that matter  anywhere else  willTurkey ever accept the acquisition of territory by force.Nor will Turkey ever allow misinformation and unashamedofficial propaganda - even from this rostrum - to continueto lead the international community to tolerate andperpetuate the living conditions imposed upon the Turkishpeople of Cyprus.Turkish Cypriots remain totally isolated in their partof the island because of innumerable restrictions thatGovernments and international organizations have placed ontheir trade  travel  cultural and sporting contacts with therest of the world. This arbitrary embargo is maintained asa result of a relentless campaign to distort the facts relatingto the history of events on the island over the last 31 years.Even a United Nations-sponsored confidence-buildingpackage  which was aimed at partially alleviating the illeffects of this embargo  was deliberately torpedoed by theshort-sighted policies of the other side  and  unfortunately prospects for a just and durable settlement have beenfurther eroded.A realistic and viable negotiated settlement continuesto be the objective of the Turkish Cypriot side. We supportthis  and we believe that the only way towards acomprehensive solution of the question of Cyprus lies inremoving the obstacles to the confidence-building measures.As a neighbouring country  Turkey follows veryclosely developments in Georgia. We look forward to therestoration of peaceful conditions in that friendly countryand stand prepared to participate in the concertedinternational action within the framework of the UnitedNations Observer Mission in Georgia.Turkey has set out on a lasting path of solidarity withthe newly independent Central Asian republics  with whichit has historic  cultural and linguistic ties. Turkey fullysupports the efforts of those secular republics to buildpluralistic societies and will assist them in integrating intothe world community. I should like to underscore thatTurkey’s relationship between sovereign countries is one ofcooperation and solidarity; it is a relationship betweensovereign countries. It is neither in competition with  norexclusive of  other countries’ relations with them.We attach great importance to the unity andterritorial integrity of Afghanistan. We had hoped that abroad-based national reconciliation process including allgroups could have started. However  we have beengreatly dismayed by the resumption of armed conflict.We once again call upon all the Afghan parties to put anend to the fratricidal fighting and start working for theestablishment of internal peace so that the rehabilitationand reconstruction of this devastated country can begin.In the Middle East  the end of the cold war hasfundamentally altered the bleak picture and opened newhorizons for peace. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement andthe ensuing Israeli-Jordanian agreements have opened upa new era in which enmity is giving way to reconciliationand despair to hope.The historic breakthrough in the peace process which promises concord and cooperation between thePalestinians and Israel  and between Israel and its Arabneighbours  will undoubtedly have positive ramificationson a much wider regional and global scale. Theestablishment of permanent peace in the Middle East willalso create the necessary conditions for harmony economic cooperation and shared prosperity.As a country neighbouring the Middle East  Turkeyhas a record of constructive involvement in the region’saffairs and good traditional ties with all the parties. It isactively participating in all tracks of multilateralnegotiations. It remains ready to contribute to theeconomic restructuring efforts of the Palestinians in Gazaand Jericho. It will take part in the temporaryinternational presence upon the request of the parties. Ishould like to reaffirm our strong support for the processtowards a just and lasting peace in the region.The rather optimistic prospects for the future of theMiddle East need to be tempered  however  with a degreeof realism  in the face of the hardship the Iraqi peoplehave been suffering. Four years after the outbreak of theGulf crisis they are still waiting to return to normality.We are fully aware of the fact that  in order to take itsrightful place in the international community  Iraq has tocomply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions.However  we cannot and should not turn a blind eye tothe fact that Iraq has almost completed its compliancewith the disarmament requirements under Security26Council resolution 687 (1991) and deserves encouragementin this respect.It should also be borne in mind that the sanctions havecaused great economic problems not only for the Iraqipeople but also for a number of countries  especially Iraq’sneighbours. The great economic losses of the mostadversely affected countries  particularly mine - Turkey -still have to be addressed.Here  I must also underline once again our principledstand that we will remain committed to the territorialintegrity and unity of Iraq  which are vital for peace andstability in the Middle East.The elimination of apartheid in South Africa closed along and dark chapter in the history of humanity. Apartfrom South Africa  the picture is still gloomy in many partsof Africa. The United Nations conducts half of itspeace-keeping operations in that continent and is activelyinvolved in maintaining and building peace in Somalia Mozambique  Angola  Liberia  Rwanda and Burundi.The efforts of the United Nations in Africa should bebased on a twofold and consolidated strategy. They shouldbe directed not only to maintaining peace  but also toaccelerating sustained economic development  throughwhich the major causes of continued armed conflicts maybe defused.Indeed  the root causes of conflict require new globalcommitments. In full agreement with theSecretary-General  my Government subscribes to the viewthat it is time to balance the old commitment to territorialsecurity with a new commitment to human security; to shiftfrom providing security through arms to ensuring securitythrough development.The end of the cold war has also ended thecompartmentalization of major components  such aspolitical security and social issues. It is now mostlyrecognized that security cannot be viewed in political andmilitary terms alone  and that peace and prosperity areindivisible.At a time when disorder and disintegration  both atnational and international levels  seem fated to increase  theconcept of crisis prevention needs to be elaborated andexpanded.We strongly endorse the view that peace  developmentand democracy are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.We all recognize the pressing need to promote a newculture of development. The United Nations new agendafor development must bring sustainable andpeople-centred development to the forefront. For this  astronger role for the United Nations is needed.Democracy is the underlying imperative for humansecurity  social integration and good governance. Indeed during the Vienna Conference last year  the internationalcommunity reiterated its commitment to the protection ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and to thecommon struggle against racism  xenophobia andintolerance. Today a pluralistic civil society  free and fairelections  and the rule of law are defined as the commongoals of humanity. Dialogue between different culturescan only be achieved within the context of democracy.Violence and terrorism could not  and should not  bejustified under any circumstances. In this spirit  theGeneral Assembly in its resolution 48/122 reaffirmed theVienna Declaration and described terrorism as an activitywhich aims at the destruction of human rights fundamental freedoms and democracy  as well asthreatening the territorial integrity and security of States destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverseconsequences on the economic and social development ofStates. We call upon the international community tostand by its commitments and to take the necessary stepsto combat and eradicate terrorism.Lack of tolerance is the underlying cause of variousconflicts which constitute the most important threat tointernational peace and security. Therefore  promotion ofa culture of tolerance has a direct bearing on crisisprevention. We should inject the spirit of tolerance intothe young generations.It is a pleasure for me to recall here that on Turkey’sinitiative  the General Assembly last Decemberproclaimed 1995 as the United Nations Year forTolerance. By the terms of resolution 48/126  the entireUnited Nations system has been asked to contribute to itssuccessful observance. Its celebration will contribute tothe acceleration of efforts to prevent all forms of racism discrimination  fanaticism and fundamentalism.Disarmament should also be seen within the contextof preventive diplomacy. We must recognize the fact thatthe end of the cold war has not removed the danger ofnuclear weapons. On the contrary  in some cases thedanger has actually increased. Hence  another field where27progress is needed is the prevention of nuclear proliferation.As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  whichwill be convened next year  the creation of a climate ofconfidence will be vital. Measures need to be taken nowto create that climate.In the same vein  we hold the view that fullcompliance with existing arms control and disarmamentinstruments at regional and global levels is of primaryimportance.As the Secretary-General has rightly stated  thechildren’s Summit in 1990  the Earth Summit in 1992  thehuman rights Conference in 1993  the populationConference in September 1994  the social developmentSummit in March 1995 and the women’s Conference to beheld in September 1995 are all linked. By 1995  in timefor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  we shouldreach a global consensus on the way forward to newcommitments towards building a better world.To complete the agenda  we must also add to thesemajor events the Second United Nations Conference onHuman Settlements (Habitat II)  which will be held inJune 1996 in Istanbul. In this context  we welcome theSecretary-General’s call to declare the Habitat IIConference as the ""City Summit"" to increase worldawareness on this subject and to commit the world’sleaders to making our cities  towns and villages healthy safe  just and sustainable. High-level participation in thisConference will ensure its success.We will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization next year. It is the most opportune time  onthe threshold of a new millennium  to take stock of whatwe have achieved  and where we have failed  with a senseof realism and vision. We are obliged to realize thedreams of the founders of the United Nations. We hopethat our deliberations will help to generate a new impetusfor positive action to this end.Member States have set their hopes on the UnitedNations  which reflects diversity united in a commoncause. To the extent that it succeeds  we will have abetter world for all peoples  and peace  security democracy  development and prosperity will be enhanced.This requires cooperative action  which all nationsshould be engaged in. We have to give full scope to ourimagination to keep pace with the winds of change andstrive for the realization of the shared dreams ofhumankind. If we fail  future generations will pay dearlyfor our mistakes. I am convinced that after all the bitterexperiences of the past  humanity has the cumulativewisdom not to make such mistakes."
"166",7061,"TZA",49,1994,"I wish to join my fellow Headsof State who have spoken before me in congratulating youmost sincerely on your well-deserved election as Presidentof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. As adistinguished son of Africa  you bring to this high officevaluable experience  diplomatic skill and wisdom  all ofwhich equip you superbly well to lead this Assembly - anassembly in which the faith and hopes of our people arereposed. Let me assure you  Mr. President  of Tanzania’swhole-hearted cooperation and support as you execute yournoble and immense responsibilities to humanity.I should also express the great appreciation whichmy delegation feels for the dedication to duty and greatleadership displayed by your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana  whovery ably led the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly to its successful conclusion.I wish also to acknowledge the untiring efforts ofanother son of Africa  our Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  who  together with his Secretariat  hascontinued to serve our Organization very well indeed.The Secretariat needs  and deserves  the support of allMember States in facing the challenges of theirday-to-day work  often under very trying circumstances.This is my second appearance before a session of theGeneral Assembly since being elected President of theUnited Republic of Tanzania in 1985. I had the honourto address the forty-second session of the Assembly on 8October 1987. I used that occasion  as the new Presidentof my country  to reaffirm our faith in the United Nationsand our commitment to the principles of the UnitedNations Charter.Today  I am addressing this Assembly for the lasttime as President of my country. As members may wellknow  Tanzania has embarked on extensive political andeconomic reforms  which are proceeding very well  inpeace and in harmony.As part of the political reforms  the constitutionalterm of a president is limited to a maximum of two five-year terms. My second and last term  therefore  will cometo an end towards the end of next year  a time when wewill hold our first general elections under a multipartydemocratic system. It is my great wish that I shouldbequeath to the Tanzanian people a functioning democraticsystem that will allow them to choose their own leaders ina free and fair atmosphere.As I prepare to pass on the baton of the leadership ofmy country to someone else  I can only reaffirm the faithand confidence my country has always had in the UnitedNations system. All its imperfections notwithstanding  theUnited Nations remains the only hope for poor and weakcountries like mine  for it is only through the UnitedNations that we can raise our concerns for humandevelopment  world peace  justice and equality without fear.The imperfections of the United Nations system havenothing to do with the principles set forth in the UnitedNations Charter; rather  they are a product of the action orinaction of the Member States.In this connection we are pleased to extend to all thenew Members a warm welcome and sincere congratulations.Their admission has brought us much closer to ourcherished goal of universal membership of the UnitedNations. We pledge to continue working closely with allnations to make our world a much better place for allhumanity.During my time as President of Tanzania  fundamentalchanges have occurred in the world. Some of thesechanges have given us reasons for hope; others have not.Our hopes that the post-cold-war era would bring a newimpetus in our Organization for peace and development inall corners of the world have not yet been realized. The so-called peace dividend is not reaching those who need itmost  that is  the poorest sectors of humanity. It is a pitythat global tensions have been replaced by regional andnational conflicts  with devastating consequences forinnocent men  women and children. Whether ondevelopment questions or security issues  the developingcountries  which constitute the vast majority  have seenlittle respite following the end of the cold war.The collective security system envisaged under theUnited Nations Charter has not always worked to thesatisfaction of many Members. This is because someMember States have  in the past  been reluctant toimplement both the letter and the spirit of the Charter.Instead  loopholes and pretexts have often been used tojustify action contrary to the spirit of the Charter. Today as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  we all need to rededicate ourselves to the goalsand ideals embodied in its Charter. This includes theneed to make the United Nations and all its organs morerepresentative of all its Members and more democratic.It is both hypocritical and a mockery of the ideal ofdemocracy that some Members should preach democracyto the rest of the world and yet not accept the fulldemocratization of the United Nations system.This matter is particularly urgent in this post-cold-war world era. The emerging new power relationsin the world can be either an asset or a liability depending on whether all Members have the political willto enhance the representative nature and the democratictraditions of this world body. If such political will exists I am sure we can make rapid progress on the expresseddesire of many Member States to look again at the role powers and membership of the Security Council. I amequally sure that if we all have the political will to reformthe United Nations system for the better  we can quicklyagree on enhancing the powers of the General Assemblyand the Economic and Social Council. It is these twoorgans that are important agents in focusing ourOrganization on the real and urgent issues confronting theoverwhelming majority of humanity.In his comprehensive report to the General Assemblyat its forty-eighth session  the Secretary-General drew ourattention to the peace-keeping role of the United Nationsin the changing international context. While UnitedNations peace-keeping and peacemaking responsibilitieshave been on the increase  the means to implement thoseresponsibilities have hardly kept pace with these newrequirements. With more than 80 000 civilian andmilitary personnel serving in 17 peace-keeping operationsworldwide  the Organization requires new commitmenttowards meeting the costs involved.We should all strive to honour our financialobligations as assessed to meet United Nationspeace-keeping expenses. We must not reach the pointwhere training and deployment of personnel will beundertaken only by those Member States who can affordsuch expenses on their own. Such an eventuality will notonly make peace-keeping the monopoly of a few richcountries but will also deal a fatal blow to our cherishedprinciple of universality of participation. In thisconnection  we entirely support the proposal made byCanada last week in this Assembly for the establishmentof a permanent United Nations peace-keeping force. Thisidea has been with us for a long time  and now is thetime to act.2My delegation takes this opportunity to salute allUnited Nations personnel in the field for their devotion toduty and their perseverance under increasingly dangeroussituations. Many  including Tanzanians  have died inaction. We mourn them. Many more have been wounded.They deserve our heartfelt sympathy. The safety andsecurity of United Nations personnel must continue to be apriority  and we support every initiative taken to establishan international treaty for their protection.As a neighbour of both Rwanda and Burundi Tanzania has found itself deeply involved in the search forpeace and reconciliation in those two most troubledcountries. Last year in Cairo  we  the African Heads ofState  decided that the time had come for Africans to takecharge of preventing  managing and resolving conflicts intheir continent  for our countries may be poor  but ourpoverty does not extend to the realm of humanity  dignityand wisdom.In both Rwanda and Burundi  there was a time whenour hopes rose high  when we thought that at last apermanent solution had been found to their endemicproblems. In the case of Burundi  the high point was theelection of July 1993  which was declared by internationalobservers to have been free and fair. The transition ofpower from President Buyoya to the late President Ndadayewas equally impressive. That man  whom the people ofBurundi had chosen to lead them  personified not only hopefor peace  unity and reconciliation in Burundi  but also thedawn of a new era of peace  stability and cooperation inour subregion.But some people in the military establishment decidedto put their private and parochial interests above the wishesof the ordinary people of Burundi. What the Burundipeople got through the ballot was taken away by the bullet.The attempted coup that followed in October 1993 resultednot only in the death of President Ndadaye but also in thedeath of many innocent people of Burundi. No one knowsexactly how many died; estimates range from 100 000 to200 000. But statistics alone are unimportant  as not asingle life should have been lost in the first place; aboveall  behind these cold statistics are real people - husbandsand wives  sons and daughters  all of whom perishedleaving behind widows and widowers  as well as orphans.In addition to those who died  over 700 000 others fledtheir country in order to save their lives; about 500 000 ofthem fled to Tanzania alone. Another 200 000 or morewere displaced internally. With those events of October1993  our hopes for peace and reconciliation in Burundiwere dashed to the ground; since then we have beenwaiting anxiously for new developments that couldrekindle our hopes.We are encouraged by the efforts of moderateelements in Burundi to create a transitional government ofunity  based on the concept of power sharing. It isincumbent upon those of us neighbouring Burundi andupon the international community as a whole to supportand encourage the Government of President SylvestreNtibantunganya during this transitional period.In the case of Rwanda  the event that gave us hopewas the signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement on 4August 1993. The Agreement provided a comprehensiveframework for the permanent solution of the political andsecurity problems in Rwanda. But the Agreement  whichhad been so painstakingly negotiated  was held hostage bythose who were keen to protect their own interests ratherthan the interests of the ordinary citizens of Rwanda. Foreight months  the timetable agreed upon for theimplementation of the Arusha Agreement was notfollowed. The only transitional institution provided for inthe Agreement was the presidency. The death ofPresident Habyarimana  therefore  denied us the only legaltransitional authority in Rwanda at that time. Then beganthe worst carnage in African history - which  even as Ispeak  is still claiming the lives of innocent people  not tomention having been the cause of over 1.5 millionrefugees in neighbouring countries. Most of those whoparticipated in the Arusha negotiations on behalf of thethen Rwanda Government were massacred.Following its military victory  the RwandesePatriotic Front (RPF) established in July 1994 a fairlybroad-based Government of National Unity. Tanzaniawas among the first countries to recognize this newGovernment. We recognize and appreciate the efforts andgood intentions of this new Government to restore peacein Rwanda  to rebuild State institutions and to bring aboutgenuine national reconciliation. In particular  weencourage and support all efforts of the RwandeseGovernment to create conditions within Rwanda that willgive Rwandese refugees the confidence to return home assoon as possible. Rwanda needs to revert to a state ofnormalcy as soon as possible. A country from which itsown citizens run away to save their lives cannot benormal. Even as I speak  some Rwandese refugeescontinue to enter Tanzania. This means that theRwandese people  especially the Hutus  still feelinsecure - whether for valid reasons or as a result of the3propaganda war waged by the ousted regime and its agents.In this connection  the Government of Rwanda needsthe encouragement and practical assistance of theinternational community to restore essential services and tore-establish the rule of justice and law and order. Thetraditional discipline within the ranks of the RPF needs tobe maintained  and individual acts of vengeance must becontained. Innocent Hutu refugees must feel secure andconfident that no reprisals will be meted out to them forprevious atrocities associated with their tribe. On the otherhand  all those guilty of the genocide in Rwanda must facejustice. In this respect  we urge the United Nations  incollaboration with the Rwandese Government  quickly tomake operational the international tribunal that willinvestigate and put to trial all those suspected ofcommitting these atrocities. This  we hope  will reduce themotivation for individual acts of revenge.The urgency of stemming the tide of refugees  and ofeffecting their subsequent repatriation  is of paramountimportance. The refugee camps must not be allowed toacquire the character of permanency  as this would createan environment conducive to the political and even militarymobilization of the refugees. In the meanwhile  we whoare hosts to these refugees have a duty to disarm them andtake whatever action is necessary to make it impossible forthem to be mobilized  whether for political or militarypurposes.Neighbouring countries and the internationalcommunity should also warn the deposed regime and itsarmy not to entertain thoughts of a military return to power.We cannot allow another chapter of this tragedy to bewritten in the history of Rwanda. For  as an Englishpolitical philosopher  Edmund Burke  said two centuriesago:""The use of force alone is but temporary. It maysubdue for a moment; but it does not remove thenecessity of subduing again; and a nation is notgoverned  which is perpetually to be conquered.""In this connection  I wish to emphasize the need forthe Rwandese Government to proceed on the basis of theframework of the Arusha Peace Accord  which in my viewremains the best hope for a permanent solution to theproblems facing that country. As Facilitator to the peaceprocess in Rwanda  I wish to commend the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim  and the OAU Secretariat for theoutstanding commitment they have shown to the resolutionof this problem  despite the many disappointments alongthe way. I also wish to use this opportunity to thank theUnited Nations  as well as Belgium  Burundi  France Germany  Senegal  Uganda  the United States of Americaand Zaire  which acted as observers to the Arusha peacenegotiations.I wish also to thank the United Nations agencies andall Governments and non-governmental organizations thatjoined hands with my Government in providing relief tothe Rwandese refugees in my country. But the reliefwork is far from being over; new refugees are stillcoming in. The local communities which have hosted therefugees need to be compensated for the food and otherservices and supplies they have shared with them. Theenvironmental damage caused by the huge and suddeninflux of refugees also needs to be addressed as soon aspossible.The people of Ngara district in Tanzania havethemselves been forced to live like refugees in their owncountry. The local population has been outnumbered bythe refugees by a ratio of one to two. They faceovercrowding in social service centres and enduretremendous price hikes  sometimes reaching 300 per centover a short period  for all their requirements. And tothis must be added increased security risks andcriminality.As for environmental damage  the influx of refugeesinto Ngara and Karagwe in Tanzania  between April andJune 1994 alone  caused a loss of 18 000 tons of trees with an estimated value of $12 million. The 400 000refugees living in Ngara have since April consumed200 tons of firewood daily  with far-reachingconsequences for the environment. The internationalcommunity needs to continue to be seized of this matterand increase its support to those of us hosting this hugeinflux of refugees.It is only honourable for us as Members of theUnited Nations to accept that the role of our Organizationin Rwanda has been far from honourable  and has beenquite contrary to the principles of our Charter. While aidagencies and non-governmental organizations can dowonders on the ground  Governments wring their handsand wait for one another to lead the action. The crisis inRwanda was made worse by political indecision withinthe international community. My delegation can onlyagree with the OAU Secretary-General that  by our failureto act promptly  we too stand to be blamed for the loss ofinnocent lives and the suffering of an entire people.4African troops pledged at the OAU Summit in Cairolast June should quickly be given the necessary logisticsupport to enable the redeployment of the United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) at its fullstrength to start without undue delay. The enlargedUNAMIR should then create safe zones along the Zairianand Tanzanian borders  which should be fully stocked withrelief supplies so as to encourage refugees to enter thesesafe zones as a first step towards returning to their ownhomes.Since my country became a member of thisOrganization  there has perhaps been no issue before thisAssembly which has preoccupied us like the question ofdecolonization and the struggle against the apartheid systemin South Africa. It is therefore a matter of tremendoussatisfaction to us that decolonization is now almostcomplete and that apartheid has finally landed where itbelongs - in the dustbin of history. South Africa’s returnto the membership of the United Nations is a victory for allthe people of that country  whatever their colour  a victoryfor the United Nations and certainly a victory for theinternational community as a whole.The political and economic reintegration of SouthAfrica into the rest of Africa is one of the biggest triumphsfor Africa for many years. We in the southern African sub-region are happy that at last our people can sleep peacefullywithout fearing a surprise attack or a destabilizationcampaign from South Africa. We are happy that theemerging peace and security in our region can now releasescarce resources for the development of our people. On theeconomic front  we have quickly begun to reverse the yearsof disengagement from South Africa and to work togetherto integrate our economies through the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC)  in which the new SouthAfrica will play a very important role.This  unfortunately  does not mean that all ourproblems in southern Africa have been resolved. Events inAngola continue to cause us a good deal of anxiety.Through its endless intransigency  UNITA continues tocreate problems for the Angolan peace talks in Lusakaunder United Nations mediation. I think the time has comefor the international community to exert final pressure onUNITA to stop it from continuing to obstruct these peaceefforts. We must not forget that the MPLA party won theelections sponsored by the United Nations in September1992. Yet  regardless of its victory  the MPLA has beengenerous in inviting UNITA to join a government ofnational unity. We cannot see why certain foreignGovernments should continue to pamper UNITA as itcomes up with new excuses to delay the process ofnational reconciliation in that country. Our Organizationshould tell Mr. Savimbi that he cannot have his own wayforever. We therefore call upon all those with influenceon Mr. Savimbi to ask him either to cooperate or face theconsequences of the full sanctions promised in resolution932 (1994).In Mozambique  thanks to the determined efforts ofthe Secretary-General and the United Nations Operationin Mozambique (ONUMOZ)  most of the difficulties havesince been overcome. We look forward with anticipationto the national elections later this month in the hope thatthey will not only be free and fair  but also that all partieswill respect and abide by the election results. We hopethat the lessons from the Angolan experience have nowbeen learned well and that the people of Mozambique willbe spared the menace that Mr. Savimbi continues topresent in Angola. We commend  in particular  theoutstanding goodwill and generosity of the Governmentof President Chissano  which was demonstratedthroughout the negotiating process.Despite overall economic growth in the world  andthe creation of numerous developmental and socialinstitutions  poverty has been on the increase in mostparts of the developing world  particularly in Africa.A supportive international environment is crucial ifwe are to attain sustained economic growth in developingcountries  especially in the least developed ones. TheUnited Nations must be able to play a much greater rolein this matter because  unlike the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  the United Nations is universal; itsprogrammes operate everywhere; and it does not ignorecountries. But I must add that the United Nations has tobe strengthened  as mandated by its Charter  to enable itto play a complementary role vis-à-vis the otherinternational organizations involved in development.Most of the least developed countries  includingTanzania  remain among the most debt-distressedcountries. It is true that the magnitude of our debt ismarginal by international standards. Indeed  theindebtedness of the least developed countries does nothave a substantial effect on the international financialsystem. But in relation to the size of their economies  thedebt burden is far too heavy and constitutes a majorobstacle to sustained growth. In the light of an alreadygrim financial flow situation  caused by declines inofficial development assistance  the crippling burden of5international debt has seriously hampered developmentprospects for most of our countries.As an illustration  if we in Tanzania were to apportionour total national debt of $6.3 billion to each of ourcitizens  every poor man  woman and child would beindebted to our rich creditors by the equivalent of their totalearnings for over two years. Put differently  even if theTanzanian Government were to devote all its foreignexchange earnings to paying off this debt  it would still takeus over 12 years to do so. With a debt burden of thismagnitude dragging us down all the time  it will be difficultfor our economy to take off.There is an urgent need for the internationalcommunity to adopt a unified and coordinated approachtowards a durable solution of the external debt position ofcountries like mine if we are serious about reducing povertyin the world. To achieve this  there should be a fullcancellation of all bilateral and official debt  as well as asubstantial reduction of the debt stock and the debt serviceburden owed to multilateral financial institutions andcommercial creditors.Nowhere in the world today are the social conditionsmore desperate and calling for more urgent attention thanin the least developed countries. Declining incomeaggravates poverty and threatens the social fabric of entiresocieties.It is our hope that the forthcoming World Summit forSocial Development in Copenhagen will be an importantforum for the world community to focus on the social anddevelopmental concerns of developing countries in anattempt to free them from the vicious circle of poverty.The protracted Uruguay Round of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) finally came to aconclusion in December 1993. We then met at Marrakesh Morocco  on 15 April 1994  to sign the new agreement thatestablishes the World Trade Organization. We from thedeveloping world  and especially those of us fromSub-Saharan Africa  signed that agreement not because wewere happy with it or because we thought it took care ofour interests. We signed it because the alternative wasequally tragic. In truth  this new agreement will only meanthe entrenchment of poverty in our countries unlesscompensatory measures are urgently taken in our favour.It is already being estimated that Africa is the onlycontinent that will actually lose rather than gain from thisnew agreement. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to loseabout $2.6 billion a year by the beginning of the nextcentury. The cause of this loss is largely theentrenchment of unfavourable terms of trade  and theopening up of African markets to transnationalcorporations based in the rich countries  which will nowhave wider and unhindered access to markets in Africaand elsewhere. We will therefore continue to demandbetter terms of trade for our products in internationaltrade  as well as preferential treatment where this is feltto be necessary.It is now two years since we assembled at Rio deJaneiro to bring to its conclusion the United NationsConference on Environment and Development. Theimplementation of the agreements reached at that worldsummit has been extremely slow and in most areasnon-existent. The world is still far from the concept ofsustainable development. The Agenda 21 documentremains an academic masterpiece while the issuesinvolved remain unresolved. Among other things  theUnited Nations  through the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  should assume a major role in helpingdeveloping countries to build their indigenous capacitiesin science and technology and in promoting access toexisting technology on favourable terms.We are none the less gratified that the desertificationConvention has been concluded. This is a great relief forthe 900 million people world wide affected by thisphenomenon. We look forward to the signing of theConvention later this month.We commend our development partners thatsupported the negotiations on this important Conventionfor Africa. The African annex to the Convention containsour commitments to implement the programmes of actionin an effort to contain the processes of desertification anddrought  which are exacerbated by poverty andunderdevelopment. Unless there is a serious commitmentby developed countries and multilateral financialinstitutions to extend the financial resources required toimplement the Convention  the social and economicconsequences of desertification and drought will beirreparable.We welcome the timely initiative taken by theSecretary-General in preparing the Agenda forDevelopment. The Agenda provides an appropriateframework for dealing comprehensively with theinterrelated issues of economic and social development the environment  peace  justice and democracy.6Development is a shared concern of all nations and theacceptance of this fact by the entire internationalcommunity will result in great success in dealing with thisAgenda.While we recognize that States must assumeresponsibility for their own socio-economic development we must also recognize that this will be increasinglydifficult without the assistance of the internationalcommunity. The solutions to the problems created bypoverty  rural-urban migration  the degradation of theenvironment and the complexity of the refugee situationwill require an integrated approach. It is our hope that theAgenda for Development will project a coherent strategyfor achieving a new and inclusive vision of worlddevelopment. Such a strategy must bind all countries  bothsmall and large  rich and poor  in a planned andimplementable programme for human progress.Tanzania attaches great importance to the full andeffective participation of developing countries in decision-making for the resolution of economic problems facing ourcommon planet. In addition  the Agenda should incorporatethe various agreements and strategies for internationaldevelopment already adopted over the years in differentforums and conferences. We must also identify the reasonswhy so many of these commitments and agreements especially those related to developing countries  are still onpaper only.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate our faith in andcommitment to the United Nations. In this post-cold-warera  the temptation to bypass  or dictate to  this world bodymight be quite high. We must not allow that to take place.We must instead work to strengthen the United Nations andits agencies and to entrench their democratic tradition. Wemust  at the same time  recognize that poverty  like theenvironment  knows no borders. It is in our collectiveinterest that  as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations system  we dedicate ourselves in practicalterms to the eradication of poverty the world over. Wemust agree that poverty is as much a threat to peace andsecurity and as much an affront to humanity as injustice oppression and discrimination."
"167",7104,"UGA",49,1994,"Permit me  Sir  onbehalf of the Uganda delegation  to congratulate you mostwarmly on your well-deserved unanimous election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. Your election is a recognition by ourOrganization of your exemplary personal qualities. It is indeed  a great honour to your country  Côte d’Ivoire  withwhich Uganda enjoys warm fraternal relations. I amconfident that  with your skills and experience  you will beable to guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.I wish to pledge Uganda’s full support and cooperation toyou in your endeavours.I also wish to pay special tribute to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana  for theable manner in which he steered the work of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.Our appreciation goes to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his courageous and clear-sighted leadership of the Organization.At the outset  let me say how warmly Ugandawelcomes the presence in our midst of a new South Africa born on the principles of equality  justice and democraticgovernance. I wish to pay a special tribute to HisExcellency President Nelson Mandela and other leaders ofthe South African liberation movements  and toMr. de Klerk  for their vision and statesmanship  whichenabled the United Nations to achieve one of the key long-sought objectives of Africa.Since the last session of the General Assembly  severaldevelopments have taken place in the international arena;some of these have offered hope and encouragement  whileothers have led to frustration and despair. In manycountries  peace  the rule of law and democratic governanceare being consolidated. However  in some others  such asAngola  Somalia  Liberia and Bosnia and Herzegovina conflicts have caused untold suffering  loss of life anddestruction of property  and have contributed to thestaggering numbers of refugees and displaced persons  withthe attendant negative consequences.The Office of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees estimates the number of refugees anddisplaced persons worldwide to be over 23 million and26 million respectively. Africa is estimated to have over32 per cent and Asia over 25 per cent of the total refugees.Seven countries in Africa are among the top 10 countries oforigin of refugees. Most of these refugees and displacedpersons have fled as a consequence of conflicts  mainlywithin nations  but to a lesser extent between nations. Thisis a vivid  awesome picture for Africa in particular  and fordeveloping countries in general.Uganda welcomes the increasing priority attentionbeing given by the United Nations to the resolution ofconflicts in Africa and elsewhere  especially the emphasisgiven by the Secretary-General in “An Agenda for Peace”to preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. We agreewith his view that security  socio-economic well-being environmental sustainability and the protection of humanrights are closely interdependent and interlocked in amutually reinforcing manner. They should therefore beaddressed in tandem in order to avert conflicts and theirattendant negative effects  such as the outflow of politicaland economic refugees  capital flight and brain drain.We welcome the establishment of the OAUMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution. Such a mechanism is useful for confidence-building among rival parties and can facilitate peacefulresolution of conflicts. Uganda is committed to makingthe OAU Mechanism effective and usable. We urge theUnited Nations and the international community to lendit the requisite support.The situation in Somalia remains tense and fragilewith serious negative implications for peace  nationalreconciliation and orderly provision of humanitarianassistance. Uganda supports the new emphasis by theinternational community on seeking a political settlementto the Somalia conflict. Uganda urges all Somali groupsand factions to put behind them fear and mistrust  and tobegin to implement all commitments they undertook inthe Nairobi Declaration on National Reconciliation inorder to pave the way for the implementation of theAddis Ababa Agreements  including the establishment oftransitional administrative mechanisms. We commend theUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) forfacilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and weurge continued international support to Somalia.As regards Liberia  Uganda was encouraged by stepstaken to begin the implementation of the CotonouAgreement  namely the establishment of the LiberiaNational Transitional Government and the initiation of theprocess of disarmament and demobilization of variouscombatants. However  we are disappointed by theincreasingly tense military situation on the ground  bothwithin and between parties  which has brought the processof disarmament and demobilization to a virtual standstill.We urge all parties to show seriousness to the process ofpeace and national reconciliation as this is vital forcontinued international support and a continued presence.2Uganda welcomes steps taken so far by theGovernment of Mozambique and RENAMO to implementthe general peace agreement. We urge the parties to remaincommitted to the peace agreement and to respect theoutcome of the elections scheduled for 27 and28 October 1994. We commend the United NationsOperation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ)  which has helpedto engender confidence among the parties — vital for thesuccessful implementation of the peace agreement — andwe urge continued international assistance to Mozambique especially in the resettlement of refugees and displacedpersons.The situation in Angola remains a matter of concernto the international community despite ongoing Lusakanegotiations between the Government of Angola andUNITA. The people of Angola continue to suffer fromindiscriminate killings and destruction of property. Mydelegation urges the parties concerned  especially UNITA to demonstrate flexibility  realism  political will  toleranceand compromise  which are necessary for peace andnational reconciliation.The civil war in southern Sudan has continued toescalate  with an enormous loss of lives  destruction ofproperty and a large number of refugees and displacedpersons. Uganda alone hosts an estimated 300 000Sudanese refugees. We urge the parties to the conflict toset their sights on the common good and mutualaccommodation in the ongoing regional efforts — inparticular  the Inter-Governmental Authority for Droughtand Development (IGADD) initiative — which are aimedat finding a durable political settlement.As regards Western Sahara  Uganda is concerned atthe slow progress towards the holding of a United Nationssupervised referendum on self-determination of the peopleof that territory. We appeal to the parties to overcome theirdifferences and enable a just and impartial referendum to beeffected.The systematic and widespread massacres of civilianswhich took place in Rwanda were tragic and deplorable.Uganda supports the setting up by the Secretary-General  on29 July 1994  of an impartial commission of experts toinvestigate violations of international humanitarian law andacts of genocide committed in Rwanda with a view toidentifying persons responsible for those violations andbringing them to justice. This should contribute to theprocess of national reconciliation. We are encouraged bythe declaration of the Government in Rwanda that it will beguided by the spirit of the Arusha Peace Agreement as aframework for peace and national reconciliation and forits support for the regional initiatives on the problem ofRwandese refugees. Similarly  we also appeal forassistance to be extended to local populations inneighbouring countries that are hosting the refugees  inorder to mitigate the adverse socio-economic andenvironmental effects they are facing as a result of theinflux of refugees.Uganda congratulates the Governments of SouthAfrica and Namibia for settling  through peaceful means their long-standing dispute over Walvis Bay and theoffshore islands.Uganda notes the flexibility shown by the LibyanArab Jamahiriya with regard to implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 731 (1992). We hope that thiswill contribute to a peaceful resolution of the problem.Uganda welcomes the initiation of Palestine self-rulein the Gaza Strip and Jericho. We commend ChairmanArafat and Prime Minister Rabin for their politicalsteadfastness  which made this possible. We encouragethem to continue working together to resolve alloutstanding issues for the full implementation of SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Weappeal to the international community to provideincreased assistance to Palestine which is needed forreconstruction and development.We express our satisfaction over the signing byJordan and Israel of the Washington Declaration by whichthe two countries mutually agreed to end the state of warbetween them. This should go a long way in helping tobuild confidence  facilitating the normalization ofrelations  concluding a formal peace treaty between thetwo countries and between Israel and other countries inthe region.Uganda supports efforts with a view to the peacefulresolution of the problem in the Korean peninsula andurges all parties to work together to create an atmospherethat will help ease the tension and that is conducive tonegotiating a durable political settlement of the Koreanproblem.Uganda welcomes the developments in Haiti directedtowards the return of President Aristide and therestoration of a democratically elected Government in thatcountry.3Uganda is deeply concerned over the continuinggenocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" in Bosnia and Herzegovina.We urge the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to act decisively and to take appropriate stepsto end hostilities in accordance with relevant resolutions ofthe General Assembly and the Security Council  as well asthe peace plan of the Contact Group and to create anenvironment conducive to a smooth and timely flow ofhumanitarian assistance to the people affected.Uganda is encouraged by some positive developmentsthat have taken place in the area of disarmament. We notethe ongoing formal negotiations on a comprehensivenuclear-test-ban treaty (CTBT)  under the auspices of theConference on Disarmament  and urge successfulcompletion of the CTBT prior to the convening of theReview Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be held early in 1995. As aState Party to the NPT  and in the context of thepreparatory process and review of the Treaty  Uganda willseek the removal of all imbalances in the NPT and thesecuring of adequate technical assistance for developingcountries in the peaceful application of nuclear technology.We also note the progress that is being made to strengthenthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction throughmeasures such as mandatory data exchanges and periodicon-site visits. These measures are useful in engenderingconfidence in compliance and in helping minimizeviolations of the Convention. We are also encouraged bythe possibility of the entry into force in mid-1995 of the1993 chemical weapons Convention.The treaty on an African nuclear-free zone will be yetanother important landmark for peace in Africa. Ugandaurges its timely and successful conclusion.It is imperative to consolidate achievements so farrecorded in the area of nuclear testing and non-proliferationin order to lay firm ground on which to make progress inother new and more challenging areas of disarmament.Uganda is committed to the full respect and universalenjoyment of human rights. We reaffirm our support forthe Declaration and Programme of Action on human rights and welcome the appointment of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. For its part  Uganda hasestablished a human rights national focal point within theJustice Department aimed at enhancing public awarenessand developing national capacity in the observance andpromotion of human rights in the country. My delegationwishes to pay special tribute to all countries that haveextended support to Uganda in this vital area of ourdevelopment  and we appeal for continued support.Uganda is committed to democracy  goodgovernance and the rule of law. A democratizationprocess in the country is well under way. TheConstituent Assembly was successfully elected on28 March 1994. The Assembly is currently debating adraft constitution  which is expected to be finalized andpromulgated by the end of 1994. That will be followedby nationwide presidential and legislative elections inearly 1995.Uganda is concerned about the current trends in theglobal economy which continue to weigh unfavourably onmany developing countries  particularly in sub-SaharanAfrica. Excruciating external indebtedness remains amajor impediment to our development. Many of ourcountries are spending large proportions of meagre exportearnings on debt-servicing alone. For instance  as of30 June 1994 Uganda had a total external public sectordebt of $2.99 billion — over 80 per cent of estimatedgross domestic product for the 1993-1994 financial year.Contractual debt-servicing was $185 million — almost76 per cent of export earnings; while arrears to be clearedwere $222 million — or 91 per cent of export earnings.The situation is compounded by the fact that 77 per centof the total stock of debt  which is the portion owed tomultilateral and bilateral institutions  is currently ineligiblefor restructuring or reduction.The problem of external indebtedness is furtheraggravated by unfavourable terms of trade  especially thecollapse of our export commodity prices  severelycontracted resource inflows and limited access totechnology. In addition to these unfavourable conditions most of our countries are implementing stringenteconomic reforms  with their attendant adversesocio-economic implications for our people. Thisnotwithstanding  some countries  including Uganda  areregistering positive economic growth and controllinginflation.For economic reforms to succeed in our countries all creditors  including multilateral institutions  shouldadopt enhanced measures that go beyonddebt-rescheduling in order to bring about a substantialreduction in our total stock of debt. Such measuresshould include substantial debt cancellation or conversioninto grants and/or other innovative schemes such as theuse of reserves  a new issue of special drawing rights and4debt swaps. In this regard Uganda endorses the conclusionof the recent Jakarta Non-Aligned Movement MinisterialMeeting on “Debt and Development: Sharing ofExperiences” and also endorses the recent proposal by theBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer on measures to resolvethe debt problem of the poorest countries.Equally  there is a need significantly to increaseresource in-flows to our countries — for example  throughincreased levels of official development assistance; foreigndirect investment in areas such as manufacturing agricultural processing and tourism; and the provision ofremunerative commodity prices. Uganda  in the context ofthe preparatory process and next year’s mid-term globalreview of the Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries  will also seek the adoption of similarmeasures in favour of the least developed countries.As regards the Uruguay Round  Uganda urges that inthe implementation of the provisions of the Final Actspecial offsetting measures be adopted to obviate adverseeffects that are likely to arise from the erosion of specialpreferences currently enjoyed by some developing countriesunder arrangements such as the Programme of Action forthe Least Developed Countries and Lomé IV. Further  theway should be eased for more developing countries to gainincreased access to international markets for their products in order to augment their export earnings. We also urgethat the necessary assistance be provided to enhance ourcapacity to produce value-added goods and services forinternational markets.The Secretary-General’s “Agenda for Development” which has been submitted to this session of the GeneralAssembly  provides a useful framework for politicaldialogue between the North and the South on practicalmeasures to make operational the international policies programmes and actions on development which have so farbeen adopted by the international community. Mydelegation supports this initiative. As we elaborate on theAgenda  we should be guided by the overall objective ofeffecting a substantial  rapid improvement in the quality oflife in developing countries  through the eradication ofpoverty and the provision of basic needs  namely  nutrition shelter  health and education. Equally  we endorse theproposal made by Brazil for the convening of a UnitedNations conference on development some time in 1996.Uganda welcomed the fact that the General Assembly in its resolution 48/214 on the United Nations New Agendafor the Development of Africa in the 1990s  agreed toaddress the full range of issues related to the diversificationof African economies  with particular attention to begiven to the issue of the establishment of a diversificationfund for African commodities. Uganda attaches greatimportance to the establishment of such a fund. Weappeal to our developed partners to be understanding andflexible in the negotiations in order to enable the facilityto be put in place as soon as possible.The international economic system dictates that weenlarge our economic horizons beyond nationalboundaries in order to widen our markets. Ugandawelcomes the coming into force  of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Abuja Treaty establishing theAfrican Economic Community  which provides a usefulframework for coordination of African developmentefforts at the continental level. In order to succeed efforts to be pursued at subregional levels should be wellcoordinated and rationalized. Uganda is committed to fullimplementation of the Treaty for the Common Market forEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the ArushaTreaty on revived East African cooperation. We appealto the international community to provide requisiteassistance to support our regional integration efforts inorder to strengthen or create infrastructures that facilitatethe movement of goods and services.Uganda reaffirms its support for Agenda 21 andother agreements on sustainable development adopted inRio de Janeiro. However  it is necessary that the Riopolitical momentum be translated into practical measuresto implement all commitments agreed upon  especiallywith regard to the provision of financial resources and thetransfer of technology to developing countries. For itspart  Uganda is committed to addressing all causes andeffects of environmental degradation  particularly poverty.For instance  we are sparing no efforts in seeking waysand means to exploit our enormous potential inhydroelectric power and solar energy  which areenvironmentally sound and are economic alternatives towood fuels. This will help stem the current widespreadforest depletion. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to support our efforts in the area ofsustainable development.The most important outcome of the CairoConference on population was the endorsement of theview that the problem of population is not just a questionof numbers; rather  the critical issue is that of humandevelopment and welfare. In this regard  the challenge isto improve people's standard of living in such areas as theprovision of education and health  housing  transportation clean water and sanitation  and to eradicate poverty. In5developing countries especially  population problems thatarise from irresponsible parenthood are ultimately a resultof socio-economic despair and ignorance  and these demandour foremost attention.As a follow-up to the 1990 Programme of Action onchildren  Uganda has established the National Council forChildren to oversee national activities aimed at theirprotection  promotion and development.We support the convening of the Copenhagen WorldSummit for Social Development in March 1995 to addressissues of poverty- eradication  productive employment andsocial integration  which we hope will lead to theimprovement of standards of living  especially in the mostimpoverished countries. We also support the convening ofthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995to devise measures for the enhancement of gender equalityand the empowerment of women. Uganda will continue toparticipate actively in the preparatory processes of bothmeetings.The reform of the Security Council  in our view should aim at achieving greater transparency in its methodsof work  making it more democratic in decision-making andreflective of the increased United Nations membership in itscomposition. We therefore support the proposal to expandits membership. However  in our view  its expansionshould increase the number of seats for developingcountries on an equitable regional basis  to reflect theincreased membership of developing countries in the UnitedNations and the fact that the agenda of the Security Councilis increasingly dominated by issues of concern and interestto developing countries  such as conflict-resolution andhumanitarian emergencies. As regards the Council'sdecision-making procedures  our view is that aproportionate number of developing countries  includingAfrican countries  should be accorded rights andresponsibilities similar to those currently exercised bypermanent members of the Security Council.Our legacy to future generations is to put in place afirm institutional framework that can adequately andequitably respond to the interests and concerns of allmankind  rich and poor alike. This is the challenge thatfaces our Organization as we enter the fiftieth anniversaryyear of the United Nations."
"168",7151,"UKR",49,1994,"It is a greathonour for me to congratulate you  Sir  on your electionto the distinguished and very important post of Presidentof the General Assembly.I am confident that your knowledge  experience andconsummate personal skills  which you have demonstratedboth as Permanent Representative to the United Nationsand as President of the Security Council  will allow thesuccessful resolution of the complex problems theinternational community is now facing on the eve of thecelebration of the United Nations half century.I would like also to express my appreciation to thePresident of the previous session of the GeneralAssembly  Ambassador Insanally  whose wise guidanceresulted in the adoption of an entire set of constructivedecisions to the benefit of all Member States of theUnited Nations.The year that has elapsed since the previous sessionof the General Assembly has witnessed importantinternational developments  in many of which the UnitedNations was both a catalyst and a participant. Theyincluded the historic turn towards peace in the MiddleEast and the elimination of the apartheid system in SouthAfrica. Positive developments are expected in Ulster andin other hot spots of the planet. The completion of thewithdrawal of Russian troops from Germany and theBaltic States has at last marked the end of the Europeanhistory of the Second World War. In this context  theleaders of the Russian Federation should be given theirdue for displaying political courage and foresight.17Radical changes have also taken place in the political social and economic life of Ukraine  which recentlycelebrated the third anniversary of its independence. TheUkrainian people  of their own free will  in a trulydemocratic way  elected Leonid Kuchma as the newPresident  and has elected the Parliament of the country.New leaders have come to executive power. Naturally  allof these developments are generating broad interest in  andcloser attention to  Ukraine.In this connection  different - sometimes arbitrary -predictions have been made concerning the direction of ourdomestic and foreign policies  and even regarding theirpossible reorientation. Many radical and even diametricallyopposed views have been heard - for example  whether thepolitical pendulum in Ukraine will swing to the East orWest  or whether Ukraine will remain an independent Stateand preserve its political sovereignty.In taking the opportunity to speak from this rostrum I should like to clarify these important issues.First  the State policy of Ukraine will be consistentlybased on the authority established by the Ukrainian peoplewhen it confirmed  almost unanimously  its choice ofindependent development during the national referendumheld in December 1991. This reality is decisive  andrumours that Ukraine will eventually lose its sovereigntyare absolutely unfounded. We shall continue to follow thepath of building an independent State  and a return to thesituation which prevailed in the former Soviet Union isimpossible.Secondly  what also seems to be an oversimplificationis the question of where Ukraine will be  whether in theEast or the West  of where it will go. I think it is preciselyhere in this Hall  which brings together representatives ofall continents and regions of the world  that the artificialdivision into East  West  North and South is especiallystrongly felt. Today the world is becoming moreintegrated  and political indicators of geographicalaffiliation of countries are gradually disappearing. Ukraine like any other State  cannot simply ""go"" East or West. Itis there  where it has been for ages  and where it will stayfor ever. Its main task as a historically ancient butpolitically young State consists in gradual integration intothe European and world political  economic  humanitarianand other processes as a reliable link in a new globalsystem of international relations.Of course  there will be corrections to our policy. Theworld has changed considerably  even in comparison withthat period of time when Ukraine emerged on the politicalmap as an independent State. All of us  includingUkraine  have to take into account new realities andrespond to them appropriately. This is particularly sowhen we deal with the question of the intensification ofmutually beneficial and equitable cooperation with theRussian Federation and with the other countries of theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But theserelations will by no means be developed at the expense ofour contact with our other partners. Ukraine is equallyconcerned with strengthening relations with the UnitedStates; Germany; Canada; the countries of Central andEastern Europe; the States of Asia - above all  China andJapan; as well as other countries of the Asian-Pacificregion  Africa and Latin America. In other words  therange of our foreign policy interests is very broad. Iwould like to emphasize that at the international levelUkraine will protect its national interests  including itseconomic interests  with increasing dynamism andpragmatism.These are the corrections that will be made toUkraine’s foreign policy  which  despite domestic politicalchanges  remains  as President Leonid Kuchma has stated predictable  consistent and weighted. There can be nodoubt whatsoever in this respect: Ukraine has beencommitted  and will continue to be committed  tofulfilling its international obligations  consistently and ingood faith. This is a solid foundation of our foreignpolicy.The wave of political romanticism yielded to a timeof severe trials in the political  social and economic livesof the newly independent States that emerged from theformer Soviet Union. Linking the titles of two well-known novels  the overall tenor of the mood of society inthe post-communist world might be described as ""greatexpectations gone with the wind"".To speak frankly  those feelings were not sparedUkraine  which immediately declared its readiness tocooperate honestly and openly with all interested partners.However  our State  after having made persistent efforts has felt that only recently has the world community cometo understand its position. At the same time  the realityof the current situation of Ukraine is that we are still thesubject of pressure and suspicion from outside and thatwe continue at times to encounter open reluctance tounderstand the essence of the problems we are facing.This greatly aggravates the present and still difficulteconomic situation in the country and hinders the processof market reforms.18Today  Ukraine is facing the difficult tasks ofovercoming an economic crisis  of normalizing its socialand economic situation and of creating favourable domesticand international conditions for gradually raising the livingstandard of its population. The President and the newGovernment are focusing their efforts on those tasks  but Imust note that Ukraine’s problem in surmounting itseconomic crisis has an international dimension as wellsince  because of its geopolitical situation  the establishmentof Ukraine as a sovereign and economically developed Stateis an important factor for peace and stability on thecontinent of Europe. There is therefore every reason toassert that support for Ukraine - both political and especially  economic - is a reliable investment in thestrengthening of international security. These facts aregradually being accepted  and the discussion of theUkrainian question at the Naples Summit Meeting of theGroup of 7 was evidence of this trend.The existence of a group of countries undergoingtransition to a market economy has become a real factor incurrent international relations. Ukraine is a part of thatgroup. Our experience is showing that the transition periodwill not be smooth  that it will be fairly lengthy and that itwill necessitate considerable effort  including internationaleffort. There is  however  no alternative. Those veryaspects of statecraft will be the focus of PresidentKuchma’s attention in the policy statement he will soondeliver to the Parliament. I should also like to note that thedifficult economic situation in our country can to aconsiderable extent be explained by the vast financialburden of nuclear disarmament and the eradication of theaftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Those problems arenot solely Ukrainian; they have a global dimension as well.In this connection  one positive development is the fact thatthe problems of countries undergoing the transition to amarket economy are gradually coming to occupy a rightfulplace in the varied activities of the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies.However  it seems that donor States  while declaringtheir support for the implementation of reforms in countriesundergoing transition  are still being excessively cautious inproviding adequate support to specific projects in EasternEurope and in the countries of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS). Today  that attitude is beginningto pose a serious problem.We are also looking forward to target-orientedactivities by the international community designed to createfavourable conditions for free access to the world marketfor exports from countries in this region  particularlyUkraine. In this connection  Ukraine welcomes theestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO)and firmly intends to accede to the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO system. We hope thatthat system will promote trade liberalization and facilitatethe creation of an open and transparent system of trade.After all  the intensification of international trade is anintegral part of economic development.As a European country  we are primarily concernedwith the problem of security in Europe in the broadestsense of that term. I should like to express some viewsconcerning Ukraine’s vision of ways to safeguard peaceand stability on that continent.The difficulties of making forecasts in the field ofinternational relations can be explained by the number ofnew risks and challenges to security that have beencreated by political  economic  inter-ethnic and othercontradictions. These have already generated a wave ofconflicts to which Europe was not prepared to make anadequate response.The anxiety on the continent of Europe is clearlydemonstrated by the ongoing search for new machinery toensure State security in Eastern and Central Europe  ofwhich Ukraine is also a part. The point is not thatappropriate structures to strengthen security in Europe donot exist. There are the activities of the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the WesternEuropean Union (WEU) and the North AtlanticCooperation Council (NACC)  and the countries of theCommonwealth of Independent States are also seekingways to achieve collective security. However  for variousreasons none of those structures is able adequately to fillthe military and political vacuum created in the regionfollowing the disintegration of the USSR and the WarsawTreaty.That is why Ukraine strongly supports initiativesaimed at all-European cooperation in various fields including the field of security.I should like to recall that Ukraine was the first ofthe CIS countries to become a signatory of the NATOPartnership for Peace programme and the Agreement onPartnership and Cooperation with the EuropeanCommunity. The Ukraine became a party to theConference on the Pact on Stability in Europe and has putforward initiatives for the strengthening of security and19cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe and in the BlackSea region.However  it should be acknowledged that notwithstanding all their positive features  neither thePartnership for Peace programme nor any other measuresundertaken can yet ensure reliable security safeguards forthe States concerned.In the existing situation it seems reasonable to focusattention on a detailed examination of the question ofcreating an all-European security structure that wouldinvolve all the existing structures in this field - the CSCE the NACC  NATO  the WEU - and  of course  the States ofthe former USSR should have an appropriate place in thatstructure. Ukraine advocates just such an approach namely  the strengthening of partnership and cooperation inan all-European dimension rather than a search for newgeometrical schemas which would  in fact  solidify thedivision of the European continent  small as it is on theglobal scale.We feel that the strengthening of stability and securityin the all-European sphere can and must be supplementedby regional actions that could be organically integrated intothe overall process of confidence-building and constructivecooperation.In the search for such steps  Ukraine put forward theinitiative on confidence-building measures in the region ofthe Black Sea. This region is extremely important to us asa crossroads between Europe and Asia and between Northand South. The elaboration and implementation of specificconfidence-building measures in the military and politicalfields in the Black Sea region would promote good-neighbourly relations and political and economiccooperation between the Black Sea countries.Multilateral consultations on these issues have alreadybegun. Ukraine proceeds on the basis that all Black Seacountries may participate in confidence-building measures.We believe that the measures themselves should beidentified in a politically binding document  which wouldregulate naval activities on the Black Sea  establish aprocedure for the exchange of appropriate information andpromote the development of contacts between the navalforces of States parties.The principle of collective action aimed at themaintenance of peace under appropriate internationalcontrol must be one of the important conditions for theoperation of an all-Europe security system. At thepresent stage  national and international security isthreatened not so much by the possibility of militaryaggression from outside as by local and regional conflictsprovoked by domestic circumstances - economic  ethnic religious and others - and especially by the possibility oftheir spilling over and involving neighbouring countries.This requires timely preventive action.Assessing recent developments in the world  we haveto recognize that  on the whole  preventive diplomacy iscoming to the foreground of United Nations activitiesaimed at securing  restoring and strengthening peace andof activities of the CSCE. In this context  I should like toexpress gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  theUnited Nations Secretary-General  for his significantpersonal contribution to the development of thefoundations in this extremely important field ofinternational activity.We greatly appreciate United Nations peace-keepingefforts aimed at settling regional conflicts. We realizethat such activities require intensive political  physical andfinancial support from Member States. Unfortunately  thedifficult economic situation of our State - not to mentionthe unjustified excessively high contribution to the regularbudget - prevents Ukraine from meeting in full itsfinancial obligation to the United Nations. However  weare trying to compensate  at least partially  through ourcontribution to the peace-keeping forces.Ukraine has already become one of the majorcontributors to United Nations forces  and it remainsready to cooperate in this field. We believe thatappropriate protection and security for the peace-keepingpersonnel are essential conditions for such cooperation.Let us consider the sad statistics. In the course of allUnited Nations operations more than 1 000 peace-keepershave been killed. In the territory of the formerYugoslavia nine Ukrainian servicemen gave their lives and more than 30 persons were wounded. The problemof security for United Nations personnel becomes moreacute every year. When sending its troops to Yugoslavia Ukraine took the initiative of developing an internationalconvention on the protection of United Nations peace-keepers and of submitting a draft of the document. Wenow await with hope the completion  during the currentsession  of work on this question.Developments in the former Yugoslavia and inSomalia compel us to think about the problems of the20effectiveness of United Nations peace-keeping operations.The fact that the United Nations  even using the potentialof such a powerful organization as NATO  failed toextinguish the flames of bloody conflict in these countriesobviously calls for a more thorough examination and acloser definition of principles of United Nations peace-keeping operations. First and foremost  there are suchquestions as a precise mandate  a link with the negotiatingprocess  the neutrality of the United Nations contingent  thereasons for coercive action and the concept of multinationalforces.Today  with the transition to a multipolar world  it hasbecome evident that no country  however great its potentialfor military power  can any longer pretend to be aneffective guarantor of peace by relying exclusively on itsown strength. This would be incompatible with the rulesand principles of behaviour that are recognized throughoutthe world. Unfortunately  the United Nations proved not tobe completely ready to assume this important role.Operations have become increasingly expensive andunwieldy. During the last four years alone United Nationsexpenditure for these purposes has increased from $350million to $2.8 billion  thus aggravating the chronicfinancial problems. In the opinion of the world community peace-keeping operations have lost their element of theextraordinary and have become routine  and not alwayssuccessful  emergency actions. But the main reason for thecrisis in United Nations peace-keeping efforts has proved tobe changes in the conditions and circumstances of conflicts.Classic peace-keeping operations started after the endof the ""hot"" phase. That is why they were  in fact  quiteeffective means of conflict prevention. Now  in manycases  the United Nations intervenes when hostilities are attheir height. This changes the principles of the use ofpeace-keeping forces. It is not always the case that the""blue helmets"" are regarded by all the conflicting parties aswelcome guests. That is why the United Nations forces’mandate is considerably wider than used to be the case. Insome cases they have been given the right to use allavailable weapons - and not only in self-defence.The parties to conflicts are often unable to provideadequate conditions for United Nations forces to accomplishtheir peace-making mission. A distinctive attribute ofcurrent conflicts is the phenomenon of field commanders.These people obey no one and  thus  compromise UnitedNations decisions or agreements reached within theframework of efforts aimed at achieving an armistice.It is high time to renew the principles andmechanisms of peace-keeping operations on the basis ofthe United Nations Charter. We feel that it is necessaryto accelerate the creation of United Nations rapid-deployment forces  which would recruit volunteers andwould be extraterritorial in character. Ukraine hasalready declared its readiness to take part in this process.An extremely important issue is the enhancement ofthe role of international law within the system ofinternational relations and the creation of a climatebetween States that would completely exclude diktat interference in internal affairs  the proclamation ofso-called zones of special interests  and so on. TheUnited Nations is also making a valuable contribution tostrengthening the international rule of law. In thiscontext  Ukraine advocates further enhancement of therules and principles of international law - first andforemost  such basic principles as respect for thesovereignty of States; territorial integrity and theinviolability of borders; and the protection of individualhuman rights  including the rights of national minorities.Our State is committed to cooperating with othercountries in this field.Ukraine is also ready to make its contribution to thesolution of other urgent problems. It is necessary that weshould examine thoroughly and comprehensively thequestion of the implementation of economic sanctionsagainst those who threaten peace and security. PreviousUnited Nations experience in this field provides groundsfor justified criticism of the effectiveness of suchsanctions. It is time to give serious thought to thecreation of machinery for the implementation of Article50 of the United Nations Charter. This would protect theeconomic interests of third countries  which are sufferingcolossal losses as a result of the strict implementation ofsanctions.Ukraine has already lost more than $4 billion as aresult of the implementation of sanctions againstYugoslavia. Unfortunately  the international structuresdid not extend appropriate assistance to enable our Stateto overcome the economic difficulties caused by theembargo. Obviously  collective action aimed atimplementing coercive measures cannot be taken on suchan unfair basis  as this increases the danger of a loss ofconfidence in the device of sanctions.Generally  the necessity of substantively reformingthe United Nations  with a view to enhancing theeffectiveness of the Organization while reducing at the21same time the expenditures for its functioning  is a veryserious problem. I am confident that this problem hasceased to be merely an administrative and budgetary oneand is moving to the foreground as one of the majorpolitical problems. Many countries  including Ukraine  arecurrently encountering great difficulties in convincing theircitizens that it is necessary to make excessively largecontributions to the budget of international organizations.There are still many outstanding problems in the fieldof arms control and disarmament  which traditionallyoccupy an important place in the foreign policy of Ukraine.We support efforts aimed at putting into force the chemicalweapons Convention. We are taking an active part in theelaboration of effective mechanisms of international controlregarding the implementation of the inhumane weaponsConvention  the Convention on the prohibition of biologicalweapons  the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces inEurope  and other international instruments to whichUkraine is a party. We attach great importance to thepreparation of the comprehensive test-ban treaty  which isnow under way within the framework of the Conference onDisarmament. These activities prove that Ukraine ispursuing a consistent policy in the field of the prohibitionof weapons of mass destruction  and they demonstrate itsopenness and readiness to cooperate  its commitment torespect the obligations assumed. Ukraine stands for theequality of all States parties to international treaties andsupports the universality and non-discriminatory nature ofthese treaties.It is precisely from such a position that Ukraineapproaches nuclear disarmament  which  at the presentstage  is its most complicated problem. It should beemphasized that Ukraine is the first State in the world thathas voluntarily and unilaterally assumed the obligation ofeliminating nuclear weapons located in its territory - thethird nuclear potential in the world - and that intends toachieve the status of a non-nuclear Power.The decision on non-nuclear status was approved bythe Parliament of Ukraine for the benefit both of thehighest interests of our State and of mankind as a whole.This decision was based on the profound belief of ourpeople in the morality of the non-nuclear option and wasnot the result of any external pressure.At the same time  Ukraine  as a State that of its ownfree will is giving up nuclear weapons - this most effectivemeans of deterrence - obviously has the right to obtainreliable security guarantees from other nuclear States andadequate economic and technical assistance from theinternational community for the elimination of theseweapons.Unfortunately  our partners did not immediatelycomprehend these just demands  and we lost a lot of time.The Ukraine Parliament’s conditions for revoking itsreservations at the time of the ratification of the STARTTreaty and the Lisbon Protocol  and for proceeding withthe practical withdrawal of nuclear warheads fromUkraine with the view to their further elimination  werecreated only after the Trilateral Statement by thePresidents of Ukraine  the United States and the RussianFederation was signed and the relevant implementationagreements were concluded.Very soon the Parliament of Ukraine intends toconsider the accession of our State to the non-proliferation Treaty. Today  the settlement of this issuedepends mainly on the finalization of an acceptable textof the document concerning the provision of guaranteesfor Ukraine’s national security by the nuclear States.Ukraine stands for corresponding guarantees to bemultilateral and to be addressed directly to Ukraine asthat State which for the first time in history  on its own is getting rid of nuclear weapons; these guarantees shouldprovide a mechanism of consultations  which couldbecome involved should the security of Ukraine bethreatened. In this process  we attach great importance tothe role of the United Nations as the most authoritativeinternational organization.In conclusion  I would like to express optimismconcerning the future development of the United Nationsand international co-operation. Current international lifeis highly complicated and contradictory: there arealarming moments and there are frustrations  but there arealso truly historical shifts which have led to the end ofthe cold war and to the transition to constructiveco-operation. It is highly symbolic that this is happeningon the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization which emerged from the ruins of the Second World War.On behalf of Ukraine  which suffered very heavy lossesin that war  I would like to support the proposal toproclaim 1995 the universal year of commemoration ofthe victims of this  the bloodiest of wars.Present-day realities are laying a sound foundationfor global cooperation  stability and peace. Let ustherefore make every effort not to lose this historicopportunity."
"169",7198,"URY",49,1994,"Iwish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. I feel sure that with5your experience you will guide this session to a successfulconclusion.In my capacity as President of the Eastern Republic ofUruguay  elected by the free vote of our citizens  I have thegreat honour of addressing the General Assembly.My country has been linked to the United Nationssince the very moment of its creation. It not only has kepta legal and formal link with the Organization but hasbecome an active participant in its political and socialactivities.As the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of theUnited Nations approaches  this is an appropriateopportunity to undertake a critical analysis of theOrganization itself and to analyse the world situationfollowing the crucial events of the last few years.The consequences of the end of the bipolar are and thecold war still affect the life of all nations. Although it hasbeen stated that there is now a new world order  this iscontradicted daily by events that occur in all parts of theworld. We can say that the old order no longer exists andwe can also say that the world is currently undergoing aprocess of complete reordering.We cannot yet see the end of that process  but thereare a number of different actors  of various origins. Super-Powers and nations are no longer the only influences atplay in the international arena. Today  we can discern newcentres of power that have an unquestionable influence oninternational life. I would refer - and the list is far from complete -to the mass-communications media that standardize andtransmit opinions throughout the planet  thereby becomingguidelines that form opinion and actions and exert anundeniable influence.Similarly  we could mention the re-emergence ofpolitically militant religious movements  both domestic andinternational  which use philosophical currents to creategenuine political leverage. Although economic interestshave  since the beginning of mankind’s history  always beenfactors in the power equation  market regionalization hastoday strengthened the power of economic and financialelements which  in America  Europe and Asia  are emergingas the main protagonists of national life.Of course  in this analysis we cannot fail to mentionthe crucial and significant role played by internationalorganizations  particularly our own Organization  the UnitedNations.Painful experience has taught us how far mankindstill is from successfully expanding international law inrelations among countries. We are currently living in theaftermath of the reordering process I have mentioned  andthe redistribution and relocation of the world’s centres ofpower.As part of this process  collective securitymechanisms must be thoroughly analysed. Several Stateshave called for review of United Nations institutions  butwe must approach that task very carefully  for ourprogress will be meagre indeed if we confine ourselves toagreeing that the new role of the United Nations shouldbe simply to reflect the new distribution of power thatresults from the new world order. We believe  pursuantto the Charter  that the main issue of internationalpeace-keeping and security is to be found in the extent towhich international society is able to guarantee full andcomprehensive observance of all of the Charter principles.Here  emphasis should be placed on distinguishingbetween reforms of the institutional mechanisms designedto implement collective security and the integrity of theprinciples of international conduct  observance of whichis the very foundation of this society.It is indeed appropriate to enunciate these principles:prohibition of the use of force against the territorialintegrity and the independence of States; equality of rightsand free self-determination; the duty of non-interventionin internal affairs - a principle that is clearly of LatinAmerican origin; the sovereign equality of States; thepeaceful settlement of disputes and good-faith cooperationamong nations. This is not a set of abstract measures orpostulates that are overtaken by the present globalcontext. These principles form the essence ofinternational conduct for all States  the practical  directand unavoidable end product of international relations.Full  comprehensive and continuing respect for theseprinciples will determine whether or not the internationalsecurity and stability the world so needs is achieved andcan be maintained  particularly in this era of such greatchange. Speaking realistically  they could be rated aspossibilities that could  were they realized  lead to hoped-for  feasible and compelling results. Thus  the creation establishment and maintenance of a climate andatmosphere of international security are responsibilitiesthat are incumbent mainly on those States with thegreatest power and the greatest decision-making capacityin the international order  although other States bear equalresponsibilities in this respect.6These principles are part of a whole  and they mustnot yield to possible distortions  one of which calls forchange on the grounds that the world context has changed leading to the justification of intervention on humanitariangrounds  and another of which is embodied in thetemptation to exaggerate some of these principles to thedetriment of others  for example invoking self-determinationas a pretext for violating the territorial integrity or nationalborders of other States.Speaking in the Security Council on 4 May 1965  mycompatriot  Ambassador Carlos Maria Velasquez  statedwith perfect clarity:""As I said only a short time ago in this verychamber on assuming the office of representative ofUruguay on the Security Council  my country has longrealized from its own historical experience  which hasbeen no less unhappy than that of other LatinAmerican countries  that the world must be governedby real respect for the rules of international law andmorality. Without this  harsh reasons of state willcontinue to be the predominant factor in internationalrelations and the fate of small countries will remainprecarious and uncertain.""Our attitude is not what some realistic mindsmight describe as one of sanctimonious legality.There are very real grounds - and the case we are nowconsidering is an example - for the small countries’belief that strict and faithful application of juridicalprovisions governing what is termed security underlaw represents one of the corner-stones of our ownsecurity.""""If I may say so  the great Powers can give suchinterpretation to texts as they see fit because if  infact  political decisions are to be based on will ratherthan on reason  it is they who have the power todictate them. We smaller nations need to adhereunswervingly to the rule of law. In our own nationalinterest  we need to know how far we can go and perhaps more important still  the extent to which wecan be compelled."" (Official Records of the SecurityCouncil  Twentieth Year  1198th meeting  paras. 33and 34)In this ever-changing world  diverse threats andtensions are multiplying  even in those regions where peaceand security would seem to be firmly established.It therefore seems urgent that the internationalcommunity effectively show that its commitment to thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter isnot a mere formal commitment or a passive expression ofhope.It is indeed deplorable to see that from one sessionof the Assembly to the next new confrontations continueto occur in various parts of the world  leaving their tragicaftermaths of death and grief. This sad reality means  asnoted in the document submitted by the Secretary-General  ""An Agenda for Peace""  which clearlyemphasizes the unavoidable responsibility of each andevery one of us in this area  priority must be given to thework of the United Nations.Caught up as we are in a vicious circle of distrust civilized and fruitful coexistence will be possible only tothe extent that States carry out their actions in theirparticular areas of interest in accordance with theinternational legal order and in strict accordance with theobligations incumbent upon them under the UnitedNations Charter.Accordingly  Uruguay  in a constructive spirit  hasparticipated actively in various peace-keeping operationsin response to the needs of the international community.Our participation has been based on a number offundamental principles that govern our foreign policy namely  non-intervention in internal affairs  peacefulsettlement of disputes  self-determination of peoples  andnon-use of force to achieve peace.Our assessment is that  in general  peace-keepingoperations have shown positive progress in the settlementof conflicts  although several operational matters still haveto be improved and resolved.First  we believe that peace-keeping operations mustbe carried out in full compliance with the principles ofinternational law as enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. In this sense  and on the basis of ourexperience  we believe that actions under Chapter VII ofthe Charter or operations with a broad mandate should beundertaken only as a last resort  after the political meansdescribed in Chapter VI of the Charter have beenexhausted.Furthermore  we believe that action of this type canbe undertaken only when there are  clearly  emergencysituations that pose a real threat to international peace andsecurity. In addition  we have to bear in mind the views7of regional organizations and those of neighbouringcountries in the areas of conflict.On the other hand  peace-keeping operations musthave a feasible and precise mandate  as well as a realisticschedule. Security Council decisions to send a missionshould not take account of the strategic or politicalimportance of the different regions and  thereby  simplyhighlight differences that should not affect this type ofdecision.Uruguay has participated  and will continue toparticipate actively  in activities of this kind. We arecurrently taking part in seven operations - in India/Pakistan Mozambique  Iraq/Kuwait  Western Sahara  Liberia Rwanda and Georgia. Overall  more than 950 persons areinvolved. Given the relatively small number of people inour armed forces  these figures represent a high degree ofcommitment  hardly matched in the internationalcommunity.Our country provides contingents for peace-keepingoperations in the belief that we are contributing in a spiritof solidarity to the attainment of a collective goal thattranscends exclusively national interests. We believe thatwe have a right to declare that such solidarity must also bemanifested by other members of the internationalcommunity in support of this effort.Despite its effort and the degree of its commitment however  Uruguay does not see a similar return from theinternational community. It has not received compensationderiving from the depreciation of equipment and materialsand from the contribution of contingents  which often paywith their lives for their commitment to the internationalcause.We support the various efforts with a view toadjusting the Charter of the United Nations to the changesin the international situation - in particular  those referredto in General Assembly resolution 47/60.Reform of the Charter must be effected within theframework of the need to attain greater democratization andtransparency in decision-making  and to strike a balancebetween the existing Powers of the different bodies.Uruguay favours an increase in the number ofmembers of the Security Council to make it morerepresentative and to facilitate the fulfilment of its tasks.Here  the main challenge is to prevent an increase in themembership of the Security Council from compromising itsefficiency. Uruguay favours a minimum of 20 membersand a maximum of 25. Uruguay does not oppose theinclusion of new categories of members -semi-permanent  for example - under the principle ofequitable geographical distribution  so long as this wouldprovide for more appropriate representativeness and equaloperational opportunity. Nevertheless  we understand thatsuch an innovation must be based on the idea that ""moreprivileges entail more obligations""  including financialobligations.New members should be elected for fixed terms torepresent the various regions  and they should have amandate encompassing regional interests. We wouldaccept their re-election provided that the members inquestion had the support of the States in their ownregions.There are certain legal matters affecting theOrganization that deserve our attention. In thisconnection  I should like to refer first to the situationprovided for in Article 50 of the Charter  which affects usdirectly. Reality has shown the need for a mechanism toensure reparation for third States that are economicallyaffected by the application of sanctions imposed underChapter VII of the Charter. In our opinion  such amechanism should be permanent and should operateautomatically.Secondly  we must pay more attention to thequestion of responsibility for attacks on United Nationsand associated personnel  given the ominous increase inthe number of such attacks. This is a situation withwhich our country is very familiar.The problems facing the international communitytoday include issues of a global nature affecting allMembers of the United Nations  as well as othertemporary issues which concern one or more individualStates but which may have implications for the rest of theinternational community.We shall refer to both  beginning with those of aglobal nature: international terrorism  internationalcooperation against crime  and human rights.Acts of international terrorism are seriouscommon-law crimes  which violate the most elementalprinciples of individual and collective security irrespective of the political excuses invoked for theirperpetration. They are a flagrant violation of human8rights and must be fought  domestically and internationally with efficient and energetic measures.Uruguay is aware of the various efforts in differentinternational forums  but we are concerned about the lackof practical  concrete and global action to deal effectivelywith this serious and complex problem. Although themaintenance of internal order and security is theresponsibility of each State  cooperation between countriesis essential to coordinated prevention and punishment ofcrimes that have international implications.These mechanisms could include full respect for thenorms of extradition in accordance with the law  which arethe tangible expression of the political will of States tocooperate in the preservation of the legal rights protected byinternational agreements and by domestic legislation.Among the many rights for the protection of which weare directly responsible are the human rights of the child.In this very building  in 1990  we held what was describedas the World Summit for Children. On that occasion weadopted an extensive document intended to set theguidelines for highly ethical action  through which nationsundertook to protect the future of mankind - our children.This document included pragmatic issues such as theprotection of children in situations of armed conflict and theadoption of appropriate measures to protect them.The conflict afflicting the Balkans has given rise toepisodes that disturb the conscience of mankind. Theconsequences have been particularly atrocious for thechildren in the region - innocent victims of an immoralconflict. We have brought this case to the attention of therelevant agencies. We considered that under theConvention on the Rights of the Child there was a case forseeking a truce to allow for the evacuation of children frombattlefront areas. Unfortunately  nobody got beyond writtenwords  and our Organization was not able to prevent eventhis aspect of the barbarism prevailing in that area.In the same spirit  it is necessary that our Organizationfully enforce this Assembly’s resolution establishing theneed for effective action against the sexual exploitation ofchildren in order to prevent and eliminate such abuse.Uruguay is aware of the need to preserve the qualityof the physical and human environment and of the dangersarising from the degradation of natural resources. This iswhy it has adopted the programmes in Agenda 21 of theUnited Nations. Our National Parliament enacted a lawgranting priority to the protection of the environmentagainst any form of depredation  destruction or pollutionand making environmental impact assessments mandatory.As a State located in the Southern Cone of theAmerican continent  our country has a particular interestin all issues relating to climate changes that affect us. Atthe tenth session of the Intergovernmental Committee  asa contribution to the research on this topic  Uruguayoffered to host the permanent headquarters of thesecretariat of the Convention on Climate Change.All these actions and initiatives have been taken inthe framework of the strategy - which my countryshares - to promote lasting economic and socialdevelopment without prejudice to the environment or tonon-renewable resources  thus achieving solid andsustained growth for both the present and futuregenerations.The work of the United Nations and the specializedagencies in the social field has earned a well-deservedrecognition. The present times call for a more crucialrole by the United Nations system and for the broadeningof activities to meet the new challenges  for example  thegrowing imbalance between the wealthy countries and thetwo thirds of mankind who live in poverty.It is urgent that we check deteriorating socialconditions in the developing world  so as to prevent thesesituations from becoming threats to international peaceand security. Accordingly  Uruguay enthusiasticallysupports the convening of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  to be held in Copenhagen in March 1995.This event will provide an opportunity to discuss globalstrategies for strengthening international cooperation forboth wealthy and developing countries.Our country is deeply concerned about thecontinuing deterioration of the world economy  whichseems to be accelerating day by day. The persistence ofrecession and inflation  the rise in unemployment  theinstability in foreign exchange markets  the disorder in thebalances of payments in industrialized regions  therecurring protectionist currents that continuously departfrom GATT rules - all this inevitably delays economicprogress in the developing countries  the majority of theStates gathered here.Free trade is still one of the bases on which toachieve and to strengthen development processes; it istherefore important that we have been able to concludethe so-called Uruguay Round of GATT - but this can only9be seen as the end of one stage. Although in principle theresults can be described as encouraging  they will bemeaningless unless free trade is broadened in the future.That is why the various agreements reached must becomplemented by further reducing support and subsidylevels and by eliminating non-tariff obstacles to trade.There is no doubt that the tasks to be undertaken bythe World Trade Organization will be of critical importancein strengthening the process of free trade. Therefore prompt ratification of the Marrakech Agreements by allcountries is necessary in order to allow this neworganization to begin operations on 1 January next year.In the context of reorganizing current internationaltrade relations  Uruguay firmly supports the Secretary-General’s initiative in his report  ""Agenda forDevelopment""  which is a positive contribution in thesearch for a revitalized approach to the concept ofdevelopment  as it includes the objectives of peace freedom  justice and progress.Before I turn to items on particular situations  let metake up one last global topic  that relating to progress ininternational law  an area dear to my country  which is afervent advocate and a jealous guardian of its application.We are convinced of the need to promote theevolution of international law as the most effective tool togovern relations among States. We wish to affirm oursupport for the implementation of General Assemblyresolution 44/23  the objective of which is to promote thepeaceful settlement of disputes and to achieve compliancewith the decisions of the International Court of Justice while encouraging the codification of international law  agoal our country has long desired.In addition  we are pleased to see the entry into forceof the Convention of the Law of the Sea - which wasratified by our country - and we are hopeful that someStates will be able to overcome their difficulties withcertain points and accede to the Convention  thus achievingits full acceptance.In conclusion  I would like to refer to threeinternational situations in which my country has a particularinterest  as their outcome may have consequences at theinternational level and affect the credibility so necessary toour Organization at this time of restructuring andrevitalization.First of all  my country wishes expressly to mentionthe situation in the Middle East  given our traditionalbonds with many of the States of the region. We havealways been concerned with the various approaches toachieving peace in the Middle East. In this connectionwe recall Uruguay’s co-sponsorship of the repeal ofresolution 3379 (XXX)  which illogically and unjustlydetermined that Zionism was a form of racism.Uruguay has always supported all actions  inaccordance with international law and with the resolutionsof the Security Council  aimed at achieving peace throughthe negotiation of agreements among the parties involved as the only valid alternative allowing the parties thepossibility of living within safe and recognized borders.We have recently witnessed an acceleration of thesenegotiations  with considerable progress in theachievement of border agreements  the opening of aircommunications and the recognition of the State of Israel.At the same time  however  we note with concern therecurrence of terrorist attacks aimed at crippling thisprocess - the final goal of which is desired by theoverwhelming majority of the international community:the achievement of permanent peace in that region.We understand that this session of the Assembly canbe instrumental in furthering progress in the peaceprocess  by the Organization’s adoption of a realistic andup-to-date position on the current negotiations  modifyingthe contents and style of General Assembly resolutions inkeeping with this new stage.We in the American hemisphere believe that theCuban situation must be seen in the light of twoconsiderations: on the one hand  the view - shared by ourcountry - that pluralist and representative democracy andthe protection of human rights must be fully consolidatedin our continent without any exceptions; and  on theother  the perspective of respect for the principles of theUnited Nations Charter regarding non-intervention and theself-determination of peoples.Observance of these precepts and of generalinternational law implies the adoption of unambiguouscriteria regarding the economic  commercial and financialblockade of Cuba. In this sense  our country  true to itsconsistent policy  will support the resolution thatestablishes the need to eliminate the unilateral applicationfor political purposes of economic and commercialmeasures against another State - without  however  any10implications of recognition or acceptance of the type ofregime prevailing in that country.Lastly  the position of Uruguay on the crisis in Haitiis well known. Our country has invariably opposed anykind of military intervention lacking the necessary legalsupport. Under the Charter of the Organization  the use offorce is limited to cases in which the community isconfronted with a clear threat to international peace andsecurity.Regardless of the dynamics of events  we still believethat political instances and dialogue are the best instrumentfor preserving the principles of international law andsettling situations of this nature.International  and particularly hemispheric  relationsmust take place against a backdrop of realism and legalsecurity: realism to adjust to ongoing change in the internaland external aspects of each country; and legal security tofind in law the criteria of equity and justice that make theprinciple of the sovereign equality of States feasible andcredible.May the upcoming commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations be an opportunity toreflect on what has been achieved and - as was so well saidby the Secretary-General - to learn the lessons of the pastas a challenge for the achievement of future goals."
"170",7245,"USA",49,1994,"Let me first congratulate you  Mr.President  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly for its forty-ninth session. The American peoplelook forward to working with you to celebrate the UnitedNations fiftieth anniversary.We meet today at a time of great hope and change.The end of the cold war  the explosion of technology andtrade and enterprise have given people the world over newopportunities to live up to their dreams and their God-givenpotential. This is an age of hope -yet in this new world we face a contest as old as history.It is a struggle between freedom and tyranny; betweentolerance and bigotry; between knowledge and ignorance;between openness and isolation. It is a fight between thosewho would build free societies governed by laws andthose who would impose their will by force.Our struggle today - in a world more high-tech more fast-moving  more chaotically diverse than ever - isthe age-old fight between hope and fear.Three times in this century - from the trenches of theSomme to the island of Iwo Jima to the shattered Wall inBerlin - the forces of hope were victorious. But thevictors of the First World War squandered their triumphwhen they turned inward  bringing on a global depression and allowing fascism to rise and reignite global war.After the Second World War  the Allies learned thelesson of the past. In the face of a new totalitarian threatand the nuclear menace  great nations did not walk awayfrom the challenge of the moment. Instead they chose toreach out  to rebuild and to lead. They chose to create theUnited Nations and they left us a world stronger  saferand freer.Our generation has a difficult task: the cold war isover. We must secure the peace. It falls to us to avoidthe complacency that followed the First World War -without the spur of the imminent threat to our securitythat followed the Second World War.We must ensure that those who fought and found thecourage to end the cold war - those from both East andWest who loved freedom - did not labour in vain. Oursacred mission is to build a new world for our children -more democratic  more prosperous  more free of ancienthatreds and modern means of destruction.That is no easy challenge; but we accept it withconfidence. After all  the walls that once divided nationsin this very Hall have come down. More nations havechosen democracy than ever before. More have chosenfree markets and economic justice. More have embracedthe values of tolerance and liberty and civil society thatallow us all to make the most of our lives.But while the ideals of democracy and free marketsare ascendant  they are surely not the whole story.Terrible examples of chaos  repression and tyranny alsomark our times. The twentieth century has proved thatthe forces of freedom and democracy can endure againstgreat odds; our job is to see that in the twenty-firstcentury these forces triumph.6The dangers we face are less stark and more diffusethan those of the cold war  but they are still formidable:the ethnic conflicts that drive millions from their homes;the despots ready to repress their own people or conquertheir neighbours; the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction; the terrorists wielding their deadly arms; thecriminal syndicates selling those arms  or drugs  infiltratingthe very institutions of fragile democracies; a globaleconomy that offers great promise but also deep insecurity and in many places declining opportunity; diseases likeAIDS that threaten to decimate nations; the combineddangers of population explosion and economic decline which prompted the world community to reach theremarkable consensus at the Cairo Conference; global andlocal environmental threats that demand that sustainabledevelopment become a part of the lives of people allaround the world; and  finally  within many of our nations high rates of drug abuse and crime and family breakdown with all their terrible consequences. These are the dangerswe face today.We must address these threats to our future.Thankfully  the end of the cold war gives us a chance toaddress them together. In our efforts  different nations maybe active in different situations in different ways  but theirpurposes must be consistent with freedom and theirpractices consistent with international law. Each nation willbring to our common task its own particular strengths -economic  political or military.Of course  the first duty of every Member of theUnited Nations is to its own citizens  to their security  theirwelfare and their interests. As President of the UnitedStates  my first duty is to the citizens of my country.When our national security interests are threatened  we willact with others when we can  but alone if we must. Wewill use diplomacy when we can  but force if we must.The United States recognizes that we also have aspecial responsibility in these common endeavours that weare undertaking  the responsibility that goes along withgreat power and also with our long history of democracyand freedom. But we seek to fulfil that responsibility incooperation with other nations. Working together increasesthe impact and the legitimacy of each of our actions  andsharing the burdens lessens everyone’s load. We have nodesire to be the world’s policeman  but we will do what wecan to help civil societies emerge from the ashes ofrepression  to sustain fragile democracies  to add more freemarkets to the world  and of course to restrain thedestructive forces that threaten us all.In every corner of the globe  from South Africa toAsia  to Central and Eastern Europe  to the Middle Eastand Latin America  and now to a small island in theCaribbean  ordinary citizens are striving to build theirown future. Promoting their cause is our generation’sgreat opportunity  and we must do it together. Acoalition for democracy is good for America.Democracies  after all  are more likely to be stable  lesslikely to wage war; they strengthen civil society and canprovide people with the economic and politicalopportunities to build their futures in their own homes -not to flee their borders.Our efforts to help build more democracies willmake us all more secure  more prosperous and moresuccessful as we try to make this era of terrific changeour friend  and not our enemy. In my nation  as in all ofyour nations  there are many people who areunderstandably reluctant to undertake these effortsbecause often the distances are great or the cultures aredifferent. There are good reasons for the caution thatpeople feel. Often  the chances of success or its costs areunclear. And  of course  in every common endeavourthere is always the potential for failure and often the riskof loss of life.And yet our people - as we have seen in theremarkable global response to the terrible crisis inRwanda - genuinely want to help their neighbours aroundthe world and to make some effort in our common cause.We have seen that progress can be made as well. Theproblem is deciding when we must respond and how weshall overcome our reluctance. This will never be easy.There are no simple formulas. All of us will make thesedecisions in part based on the distance of the problemfrom our shores  the interests of our nation  the differencewe think we can make  the costs required  or the threat toour own citizens in the endeavour.Hard questions will remain  and cannot be erased bysome simple formula. But we should have the confidencethat these efforts can succeed  whether they are efforts tokeep people alive in the face of terrible tragedy  as inRwanda  or our efforts to avert a tragedy  as in the Hornof Africa  or our efforts to support processes that areliterally changing the future of millions. History is onour side. We should have confidence about this. Lookat the march of freedom we have seen in the last yearalone. Who  a decade ago  would have dared predict thestartling changes in South Africa  in the Middle East andin Ireland; the stunning triumph of democracy andmajority rule and the redemption of the purpose of Nelson7Mandela’s life; the brave efforts of Israel and its Arabneighbours to build bridges of peace between their peoples;the earnest search by the people of Northern Ireland andGreat Britain and Ireland to end centuries of division anddecades of terror? In each case  credit belongs to thosenations’ leaders and their courageous people. But in eachinstance the United States and other nations were privilegedto help in these causes.The growth of cooperation between the United Statesand the Russian Federation also should give us all greatcause for confidence. This is a partnership that is rooted indemocracy  a partnership that is working  a partnership of not complete agreement  but genuine mutual respect. Afterso many years of nuclear terror  our two nations are takingdramatic steps to ease tensions around the world. For thefirst time since the Second World War  foreign troops donot occupy the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. TheBaltic nations are free. Russian and American missiles nolonger target each other’s people. Three of the four nuclearmembers of the former Soviet Union have agreed toremove all nuclear weapons from their soil. And we areworking on agreements to halt production of fissilematerials for nuclear explosives; to make dismantling ofnuclear warheads transparent and irreversible; and furtherto reduce our nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles.The United States and Russia also recognize that wemust cooperate to control the emerging danger of terroristswho traffic in nuclear materials. To secure nuclearmaterials at their sources  we have agreed with Russia tostop plutonium production by the year 2000; to construct astorage facility for fissile materials and buy up stocks ofweapons-grade fuel; and to combat the criminals who aretrying to smuggle materials for nuclear explosives. Ourtwo nations and Germany have increased cooperation andengaged in joint anti-terrorist training. Soon  under theleadership of our Federal Bureau of Investigation  we willopen a law enforcement training academy in Europe  wherepolice will learn how to combat more effectively traffickingof nuclear weapons components  as well as the drug trade organized crime and money laundering.The United States will also advance a wide-rangingnon-proliferation agenda: a global convention to haltproduction of fissile materials; efforts to curb NorthKorea’s nuclear ambitions; transparent procedures fordismantling nuclear warheads; and our work to ban testingand to extend the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons. And today I am proposing a first steptoward the eventual elimination of a less visible but stilldeadly threat: the world’s 85 million anti-personnel land-mines - one for every 50 persons on the face of the earth.I ask all nations concerned to join with us and concludean agreement to reduce the number and availability ofthose mines. Ridding the world of those often hiddenweapons will help to save the lives of tens of thousandsof men  women and innocent children in the years tocome.Our progress in the last year also providesconfidence that in the post-cold-war years we can adaptand construct global institutions that will help to providesecurity and increase economic growth throughout theworld. Since I spoke here last year  22 nations havejoined the Partnership for Peace of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO). The first joint exerciseshave been conducted  helping to give Europe the chanceto become a more unified continent in which democraticnations live within secure borders. In Asia  security talksand economic cooperation will lead to further stability.By reducing nations’ fears about their borders andallowing them to spend less on military defences  ourcoalition for democracy can give nations in transition abetter chance to offer new freedoms and opportunities totheir own people. It is time that we think anew about thestructures of this global economy as well  tearing downwalls that separate nations instead of hiding behind them.At the Group of Seven meeting at Naples this yearwe committed ourselves to this task of renewal  to re-examining the economic institutions that have served usso well in the past. In the interests of shared prosperity the United States actively promotes open markets.Though still in its infancy  the North American FreeTrade Agreement has dramatically increased tradebetween the United States and Mexico and has producedin the United States alone an estimated 200 000 new jobs.It offers a model to nations throughout the Americaswhich we hope to build on. And this week I will sendlegislation to the Congress to implement the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  the largesttrade agreement in all of history. GATT - and itssuccessor  the World Trade Organization - holds thepromise for all of us of increased exports  higher wagesand improved living standards. In the months and yearsto come we will work no less to extend the reach of openmarkets  starting with the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council and the Summit of the Americaslater this year.Here at the United Nations we must develop aconcrete plan to meet the challenges of the next 50 yearseven as we celebrate the last 50 years. I believe we8should declare next year’s fiftieth anniversary not just ayear of celebration but a year of renewal. We call on theSecretary-General to name a working group so that by thetime we meet next year we will have a concrete action planto revitalize the obligations of the United Nations to addressthe security  economic and political challenges ahead -obligations we must all be willing to assume.Our objectives should include ready  efficient andcapable United Nations peace-keeping forces  and I amhappy to report that  as I pledged last year and thanks tosupport in the United States Congress  $1.2 billion is nowavailable from the United States for this critical account.We must also pledge to keep United Nations reformmoving forward so that we do more with less  and we mustimprove our ability to respond to urgent needs. Let mesuggest that it is time for the members of the Assembly toconsider seriously President Menem’s suggestion for thecreation of a civilian rapid-response capability forhumanitarian crises.And let us not lose sight of the special role thatdevelopment and democracy can play in preventingconflicts once peace has been established. Never beforehas the United Nations been in a better position to achievethe democratic goals of our founders. The end of the coldwar has freed us from decades of paralysing divisions. Andwe all know that multilateral cooperation is not onlynecessary to address the new threats we face but possibleto succeed.The efforts we have undertaken together in Haiti area prime example. Under the sponsorship of the UnitedNations  American troops  now being joined by thepersonnel of an ever-growing international coalition of overtwo dozen nations  are giving the people of Haiti theirchance at freedom. Creative diplomacy  the influence ofeconomic power and the credible threat of military force -all have contributed to this moment of opportunity.Essential civil order will be restored. Human rightsviolations will be curbed. The first refugees will bereturning within hours  on this day. The military leaderswill step down. The democratic Government will berestored. President Aristide will return. The multinationalmission will turn its responsibilities over to the UnitedNations mission  which will remain in Haiti throughout1995  until a new president is elected. During this time amultinational development effort will make available morethan $1 billion to begin helping the Haitians rebuild theircountry. In the spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction President Aristide yesterday called for the immediate easingof sanctions so that the work of rebuilding can beginimmediately. Accordingly  I intend to act expeditiously within Security Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940(1994) to enable us to restore health care  water andelectrical services  construction materials for humanitarianefforts  and communications  agricultural and educationalmaterials.Today I am also announcing that the United Stateswill suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti exceptthose that affect the military leaders and their immediatesupporters. This will include regularly scheduled airflights when the airport becomes available  financialtransactions and travel restrictions. I urge all othernations to do the same.In Haiti  the United States has demonstrated that itwould lead a multinational force when our interests areplain  when the cause is right  when the mission isachievable and the nations of the world stand with us.But Haiti’s people will have to muster the strength andthe patience to travel the road of freedom. They have todo this for themselves. Every new democratic nation isfragile. But we will see the day when the people of Haitifulfil their aspirations to liberty and when they are onceagain making genuine economic progress.United Nations actions in Bosnia  like those in Haiti demonstrate that progress can be made when a coalitionbacks up diplomacy with military power. For the firsttime ever  NATO has taken  since we met last year military actions beyond the territory of its members. Thethreat of NATO air power helped to establish theexclusion zone around Sarajevo and to end the BosnianSerbs’ spring offensive against Gorazde. NATO’sFebruary ultimatum boosted our mediation efforts  whichhelped to end the war between the Bosnian Governmentand the Bosnian Croats and forged a federation betweenthose two communities. To that extent the situation inBosnia has improved  but in recent weeks the situationaround Sarajevo has deteriorated substantially  andSarajevo once again faces the prospect of strangulation.A new resolve by the United Nations to enforce itsresolutions is now necessary to save Sarajevo  and NATOstands ready to act.The situation in Bosnia is yet another reminder ofthe greatest irony of this century we are leaving. Thiscentury  so full of hope and opportunity and achievement has also been an age of deep destruction and despair. Wecannot help but remember the millions who gave theirlives during two world wars and the half century of9struggle by men and women in the East and West whoultimately prevailed in the name of freedom.But we must also think of our children and the worldwe will leave them in the twenty-first century. History hasgiven us a very rare opportunity - the chance to build onthe greatest legacy of this century without reliving itsdarkest moments. And we have shown that we can carryforward humanity’s ancient quest for freedom to build aworld where democracy knows no borders but wherenations know their borders will always be secure  a worldthat gives all people the chance to realize their potential andto live out their dreams."
"171",7270,"UZB",49,1994,"Allow me to join preceding speakers incongratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.I should also like to pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for his successful leadership as President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.Taking advantage of this opportunity  I should like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and I should like to thank him for his substantive contribution to enhancing the authority of the United Nations and his efforts with a view to the maintenance of peace in various regions of the planet.For me  it is a great honor to address the Assembly today from this lofty rostrum on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan.Just recently  Uzbekistan marked the third anniversary of the proclamation of its independence. During this time  our country has undertaken significant efforts to strengthen the sovereignty of the States based on the principles of democracy and to set up a free market structure.Profound economic and political transformations are taking place in the Republic with a view to the formation of a socially oriented market economy.Today  a process of reform in Uzbekistan has reached a new qualitative level. The Parliament and the Government have adopted a number of significant and fundamental laws and decrees which are now opening the way to developing entrepreneurship and privatization. New legislation guarantees the protection of private property. A number of legislative and economic incentives for potential foreign investors have been provided  and an extremely favorfavorable environment has been created for their activities in the Republic's markets. For example  all limitations on the importation and exportation of foreign investments have been lifted. Customs duties for goods imported into Uzbekistan have also been canceled. Joint ventures are exempt from taxes for five years.The process of privatization of State property is under way in the Republic. Commodity  currency and stock exchanges  as well as real estate markets  are being set up.The most important process of introducing the national currency was recently completed in Uzbekistan. Implementation of the measures jointly agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund will make it possible to have a firm fiscal policy and will strengthen the national currency.Perhaps there is no country in the world that has sufficient experience to extend ready advice on how to change social and economic structures smoothly. The complicated and very often controversial processes of the transition to democracy and a market economy are being carried out mainly on an empirical basis  and sometimes in a highly contradictory situation.An extremely complicated task for the people of Uzbekistan is the perception of the basic principles of democracy and the socially oriented market economy  while at the same time preserving the development of its own rich history and unique culture and traditions. This is assuming today a decisive significance in the successful realization of the task of renewing our society and in the construction of an independent State.The steps the Government of Uzbekistan has been undertaking in order to reshape the political structure of the State have one more important aspect. They are not a goal in themselves; they are aimed at establishing conditions of social justice. In fact  in many countries  social justice has already long been recognized as a fundamental principle of social life. In essence  if we look at the future in the long term  without justice there cannot be any kind of stability  peace or security. There cannot be any social development  any freedom for the individual  human dignity or an acceptable quality of life for all.The Constitution of Uzbekistan grants to all citizens of the Republic basic rights and freedoms and provides for their equality before the law without distinction as to sex  race  nationality  language  religion  social standing  or personal beliefs.The number of political parties and social movements which are operating on the basis of the laws and decrees that have been adopted and incorporated into the political system is gradually increasing. They will be taking part in the parliamentary elections which will be held in Uzbekistan in December 1994 on a multi-party basis.Speaking about political processes  I should like to touch upon the issue of human rights. First of all  allow me to point out that the modem concept of the basic rights and freedoms of individuals was formed mainly on the basis of a Western system of values and elaborated over a long period of time  under specific cultural and social conditions  and developed as part and parcel of economic growth and better standards of living in Western countries. This experience is hardly one that could be mechanically transferred to other countries.We do believe  however  that universally accepted human rights concepts should be adapted to the national  religious and historical characteristics of different countries. International practice has in many cases demonstrated that unless society has reached a sufficient level of maturity and sustains it  it will be compelled to a certain extent to constrain the freedom of the individual for the sake of the preservation of the constitutional order.Today we live in a multidimensional world. Each nation is eager to establish its own political  social and cultural systems on the basis of respect for the national sovereignty of other States and the principle of noninterference in their internal affairs. Therefore  we consider the question of human rights in close connection with that of the need to guarantee to the country stability and peace as the primary conditions for democratic development.I hope that the recent seminar of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) on general issues  held in Tashkent  the capital of Uzbekistan  provided an opportunity to the international observers and its participants to see the gradual evolution of our society towards democracy. At the same time  the seminar has deepened our knowledge on possible ways to make progress in the field of human rights.Unfortunately  the end of the confrontation between two social and political systems  which reached its peak in the military sphere  has not brought about universal peace. The threat of global thermonuclear war has been reduced. Yet the world has encountered the emergence of several regional military conflicts. In this regard  I would like to make known Uzbekistan's position on the situations in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.First of all  we consider that settlement of these conflicts is solely the internal affair of Afghanistan and Tajikistan. At the same time  one should keep in mind the fact that these States are the geographical neighbors of Uzbekistan and that there is a potential danger of the regional escalation of these conflicts. That is why we view the situation in these countries with great concern and we are interested in the earliest possible settlement of these conflicts by political and diplomatic means.I should particularly like to emphasize that today this region is becoming a dangerous zone of open production of and trade in drugs and weapons. These conflicts are exacerbated by the fact that certain forces are secretly seeking to maintain tension in order to strengthen and expand their influence by making use of various religious and nationalist slogans. Moreover  there are some influential groups of drug and weapon dealers interested in continuing the military confrontation for the sake of the preservation of their illegal profits.In general  crises of this nature have revealed the inadequacy of the existing instruments to settle them through traditional means  given the new security demands of the post-cold-war era.In this context  Uzbekistan welcomes any initiative by individual countries or groups of countries  as well as by the United Nations  aimed at settling the conflicts. The new possibilities of the United Nations could expand the spectrum of military-political measures for stabilizing situations in such explosive regions  including within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). At the same time  taking into consideration the importance of ensuring the sovereignty of countries that have recently achieved independence and embarked on their own path of development  we believe it would be expedient to have recourse to such measures  with the agreement of Governments interested in such United Nations assistance or with the agreement of the parties to the dispute to a mediating role by the United Nations.For its part  Uzbekistan has been taking steps to improve the situation in the region. At the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly  President Karimov of Uzbekistan proposed the convening in Tashkent of a standing seminar on security issues under the auspices of the United Nations. Today  plans for this idea are becoming clearer. About 15 States have already expressed their interest in participating in the seminar. We hope that in the near future the first seminar of this kind will take place. We are ready to welcome its participants to the ancient and peaceful land of Uzbekistan.Uzbekistan is also proposing for consideration at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Security Council the question of imposing an embargo on the sale of weapons and ammunition in zones of regional conflict.I should like to take this opportunity to note that there are certain groups in some countries which are intentionally spreading false information about ostensible interference by Uzbekistan in the internal affairs of Afghanistan by taking sides with one of the conflicting parties. In fact  the only support Uzbekistan is rendering to this neighboring country is humanitarian aid for its suffering people  as requested by the Government of Afghanistan  as well as to Tajik refugees who fled to Afghanistan. This assistance is extended through the representation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the City of Termez.I should like to pay tribute to the active role the United Nations and the CSCE are taking in this process through their special envoys. We also highly appreciate the productive activities of the regional representation of the United Nations in Uzbekistan.I should now like to touch upon one more problem which is a threat for many countries - illegal drug-trafficking. In the Republic of Uzbekistan  on the basis of the laws of Uzbekistan and according to Conventions of the United Nations of 1961  1971 and 1988  preventive measures to cut off illegal activities related to the drug trade are now being undertaken.In general  narcotics come to Uzbekistan through neighboring countries  where  owing to unstable political situations  control over the drugs business has been weakened. Moreover  most of these narcotics are in transit to European countries.In 1993 more than 14 tons of narcotics  with a value of more than $600 million  were seized from criminals in Uzbekistan and were destroyed. The majority of these were intended for sale in Russia and in Europeancountries. In this connection  we call for the imposition of effective measures to prevent the illegal trafficking in drugs and to coordinate international efforts. An example of the successful cooperation between law-enforcement institutions is the Agreement signed in 1992 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan and its counterparts in Russia  Turkmenistan  Kyrgyzstan  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan  Belarus and Ukraine.Since October 1993 the Republic has been maintaining close cooperation with the United Nations International Drug Control Program. The visit of the Deputy Executive Director of this United Nations Program  Mr. Georgio Giacomelli  to Uzbekistan was an important event in the development of cooperation on this issue. A document defining a long-term program of collaboration against narcotics was signed during the course of that visit.I should like especially to draw attention to the important role that regional representatives involved in the United Nations Program have been playing in the coordination of international efforts to solve this global problem. This process was begun in Tashkent at the invitation of the President of Uzbekistan.We shall do our utmost to cooperate with all interested countries and organizations to bring the narco-business to an end.I must not miss this opportunity to refer briefly to environmental issues. We are grateful to the United Nations and to the specialized agencies concerned with environmental control and with the prevention of global ecological disasters. We are ready to provide all possible assistance in this noble task.Central Asia  like many other regions of the world  has experienced ecological disasters of global dimensions. I refer  first and foremost  to the tragedy of the Aral Sea. Over a period of several years the volume of water has dropped more than three times  the area has diminished two times; and the shoreline has receded 80 kilometers. Owing to these factors the desert has eaten up more than 2 million hectares of arable land. The dust-storm radius has increased by more than 300 kilometers. These developments have had a negative effect on the sanitary situation in the region. It is the opinion of United Nations experts that  in terms of ecological and socio-economic implications  the Aral Sea tragedy is one of the greatest disasters of the twentieth century. The death of the Aral Sea  which is possible  could have unpredictable consequences for the whole world. This is why we are appealing to the international community to help to save the Aral Sea and the Aral region.One possible means of solving this global problem is the creation of an international commission of experts under the auspices of the United Nations  which would initiate projects and make recommendations. The Government of Uzbekistan  for its part  would provide all possible support for the activities of the commission.The profound changes that have taken place in the world over the past half century require adaptation to new realities. There are now about 200 States  and the roles of many countries have changed. Some now have the right to be regarded as great Powers. Huge economic unions are being formed by States. Regional and global cooperation is an increasing trend. Because of the need for effective management of the processes of economic integration Governments are voluntarily transferring some of their sovereign rights to newly created joint political institutions. On the other hand  these trends underline the fact that a State should be recognized as a sovereign member of the world community so that such cooperation may be possible.The time is now ripe for the full realization of the fundamental principles of the United Nations  which were set down when the Organization was founded nearly 50 years ago. The United Nations procedures must be rejected; these procedures came into being largely under the influence of the spirit - which until recently had prevailed within these walls - of the cumbersome  often ineffective and over-bureaucratic confrontation between the United States and the USSR.The necessary reforms are already producing results. I refer in particular to the recent decision to establish the Office of Internal Oversight Services. As an Under- Secretary-General  the head of this Office will be able to initiate a more substantial discussion on the impending phases of reform of the Organization.There is no doubt that the evolution of the Security Council is still the most important and most complicated issue. How are we to reconcile the need to increase the number of permanent members  so that they are representative of all the regions of the world  with the need to make the Council more effective towards the solution of urgent international problems?Flow can the desire to reduce the level of bureaucracy in the United Nations be reconciled with the efforts to increase the number of permanent members of the Security Council? And will the exercise of the right of veto remain predominant  or should consensus become the main means of adopting decisions?These and many other issues are multidimensional and complex. They affect the interests of many countries  which often have quite different points of view  both in terms of the internal procedures of the United Nations and in terms of the means of settling international problems. It is obvious that this process will be difficult and time- consuming. We have no doubt that  ultimately  the question of increased membership of the Security Council should be considered in the context of the principle of rotation. Countries that now have the necessary capacity and sense of responsibility in respect of the maintenance of peace and security throughout the world  and at the same time are representative of the various regions of the world  should become additional permanent members of the Security Council.Our country bases its foreign policy on the realities of the contemporary world. It aims for integration with the world community through equal partnership with all other countries. Of course  our current capabilities are limited  for a number of understandable reasons. None the less  we are ready to contribute whatever is necessary for the resolution of global problems. We are eager to cooperate with countries that are interested  and we are prepared to do so both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the United Nations. We believe that the greater the number of parties involved in the discussion of international problems and of the question of increasing the effectiveness of the international institutions  the more fruitful will be the outcome. Harmonization of the rights of individuals  nations and people  together with a common interest in securing peace and development in the world  should become the main tool for resolving problems."
"172",7315,"VCT",49,1994,"As weprepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the foundingof the United Nations  the memory of the cold war isfading rapidly from our minds. We recall the nostalgiawith which we heralded the end of the era and theconcomitant universal aspirations to a world of peace andprosperity.The world has witnessed the triumph of democracy inseveral areas and the resolution of conflicts that hadoriginated in a war maintained by the earlier East-Westconfrontation. However  the images of violence  famineand destruction that flicker daily on our television screenssuggest some urgency for the world community to attemptto put an end to the violence and the senseless destructionof human lives.It is against this backdrop  Sir  that we welcomesomeone with your wide diplomatic experience and wisdomas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. I am confident that you will make an importantcontribution to the further success of our deliberations onthe vital and major issues of our time.Your predecessor  our Caribbean Community(CARICOM) and West Indian brother AmbassadorSamuel R. Insanally  has established a superb record ofachievements  on which I would like to congratulate himwarmly.At this juncture in the history of the United Nations our Organization is fortunate to have a Secretary-Generallike Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a person eminently suitedby training and disposition to guide the membership ofthis body towards a new era of peace and prosperity thatwe hope will emerge from the debris of the cold war.My delegation takes this opportunity to welcome thenew South Africa into our midst as an equal Member ofthe Organization  ready to participate in all its activitiesin accordance with the purposes and the principles of theUnited Nations Charter. We now join the courageouspeople of South Africa as they celebrate with happinessand pride their victory over the struggle of the century:the fight against apartheid. At long last they have ridthemselves of the shackles of that abominable crime andhave finally removed the greatest blemish from thecontinent of Africa. We congratulate Mr. NelsonMandela and salute his determined march from prison toPresident. He symbolizes the aspirations of the SouthAfrican people and the values of non-racialism democracy and peace. Indeed  this is a lesson inperseverance and faith in the human spirit.The voice of the international community was clearlyheard as it worked to mobilize public opinion against theinjustice of apartheid  and we are now greatly relieved thatthe question of its elimination will finally be removed fromthe agenda of succeeding session of the General Assembly.My delegation hailed the historic Agreement onmutual recognition between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization  which was signed on13 September 1993 in Washington  D.C. We alsowelcomed the historic breakthrough that gave impetus to anoverall Arab-lsraeli settlement when Prime Minister YitzakRabin and Jordan’s King Hussein met in Washington lastJuly and laid the foundation for the establishment of apeace treaty between the two countries. The internationalcommunity must also be heartened by the establishment ofdiplomatic relations between Israel and Morocco and by anapparent thaw in relations between Israel and Syria. Weare all looking forward with great anticipation to thecommencement of negotiations between the twoGovernments. It is our hope that these initiatives signal thebeginning of the end of one of the longest standing andmost intractable conflicts of our time and that they heraldan era of peace  security and political stability in theMiddle East.The recent peace overtures in the Middle East are yetanother demonstration of the dramatic changes ininternational relations that have taken place since thecollapse of communism and the end of the cold war. Inthis context my Government is optimistic that the still-unresolved major international political issues will besimilarly settled. I refer in particular to the problem ofNorth and South Korea and that of the People’s Republicof China and the Republic of China in Taiwan.It is the view of the delegation of Saint Vincent andthe Grenadines that the time has come when seriousconsideration should be given the eligibility of the Republicof China in Taiwan to become a Member of the UnitedNations. That is why my Government  in association withother like-minded countries  requested the Secretary-Generalto include an item on the agenda of the forty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly entitled “Consideration of theexceptional situation of the Republic of China in Taiwan inthe international context  based on the principle ofuniversality and in accordance with the established modelof parallel representation of divided countries at the UnitedNations.” We trust that this item will soon secure a placeon the agenda of the General Assembly and that when itdoes every Member State of this noble institution will giveits full support to this initiative. We cannot preach aboutthe universality of the United Nations while at the sametime we ignore the aspirations of over 20 million peoplein the Republic of China on Taiwan.Certain present-day international political trends  asI mentioned earlier  give us renewed encouragement andhope of relations being conducted between and withinStates in accordance with the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations Charter. This  however  does notmean that the world is now free from tension andinternational disputes.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is apersistent crisis which continues to shock us all. Effortsmade to date by the international community to halt theaggression by Serbia and Montenegro and to settle thecrisis by peaceful means have been in vain. TheGovernment of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines regretsthat the recent proposals for a political settlement of theconflict have been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs. Thatrejection carries with it the danger of the continuation andeven grave escalation of the conflict. We urge theBosnian Serbs to accept the proposals of the ContactGroup and to resolve their remaining differences in thespirit of peaceful negotiation and reconciliation  thustaking irreversible steps towards a just and durable peacein Bosnia.As a country blessed with freedom and the absenceof racial and religious bigotry  we will always raise ourvoice against any form of “ethnic cleansing”. We alsolook forward to the reunification of Cyprus and to thedeparture of foreign occupation troops from all countries.The vicious cycle of starvation  violence  thebreakdown of central authority  and endless conflictscontinues to bedevil in varying ways the situation inSomalia  Zaire  Angola  Liberia  Mozambique  Burundiand Rwanda. We call upon the United Nations tocontinue its struggle to establish peace in these areas.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines places a highvalue on its relations with the Americas since we are partof the same hemisphere. We share the same burningdesire for meaningful economic  political and socialdevelopment. Over the past decade there has been anoticeable and commendable trend towards democraticrule.The Convention establishing the Association ofCaribbean States  which was signed at Cartagena on24 July 1994  represents an achievement in the areas of2economic cooperation and regional integration  with theultimate objective of launching new opportunities for thepursuit of collective initiatives by 40 Latin American andCaribbean States  comprising some 200 million people andunited by the waters of the Caribbean. The furtherstrengthening of the inter-American system remains a majorobjective of the Government of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines.My delegation is very pleased that the use of forcewas averted in Haiti and that  at long last  democracy andconstitutional legitimacy will be returned to that land. Weare equally delighted to learn that General Cedras hasdecided to relinquish power  thus paving the way for thereturn of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.My delegation wishes to commend President Clintonfor the leadership and determination he has shown insupport of the international community’s effort to restoredemocracy to Haiti and hope and dignity to the Haitianpeople. The Government of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines will continue to be an active participant in allarrangements aimed at ensuring the safe return of PresidentAristide and in the eventual rebuilding process.Among the goals that the founding fathers of theUnited Nations set for the Organization were promoting“social progress and better standards of life in largerfreedom”and recognizing development as an inalienable right ofmankind. Regrettably  third-world countries like SaintVincent and the Grenadines feel very strongly that this goalhas so far been very elusive. With the end of the cold warand the relative success of the United Nations in its peace-keeping  peacemaking and peace-enforcement roles  theinternational community must now attempt to grapple moreseriously with the developmental problems faced by third-world countries.If countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines areto survive in this harsh world environment  careful andurgent consideration must be given by the internationalcommunity to the following measures: first  revitalizinggrowth in developed countries; secondly  liberalizing trade especially to give market access to the products ofdeveloping countries; thirdly  reducing debt and the debt-service burden; fourthly  reversing the deterioratingmarketing situation for the primary products of developingcountries; fifthly  increasing official development assistanceand humanitarian aid; and sixthly  creating a sensitivity tothe reduction in net capital flows from bilateral andmultilateral sources  as well as to the negativeconsequences of the graduation of some countries  suchas ours  from concessionary funding arrangements of anumber of multilateral institutions.The changing world environment dictates the needfor the revitalization and restructuring of the variousorgans of the United Nations. At the last session of theGeneral Assembly Saint Vincent and the Grenadinescalled for enlargement of the membership of the SecurityCouncil to reflect the current global reality. Today werepeat that call.My Government attaches very high priority torevitalizing and strengthening the role of the UnitedNations in the promotion of international cooperation foreconomic and social development. We share the viewthat the United Nations should be encouraged to developits full potential in the area of international economiccooperation and should be endowed with the necessaryresources to enable it to contribute to solving the seriouseconomic and social problems facing developing countriesin their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth anddevelopment.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines hopes that theSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development  togetherwith the conclusions of  and the follow-up to  the RioConference and the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  whichwas held in Barbados  as well as summits andconferences such as the International Conference onPopulation and Development  the World Summit forSocial Development  the Fourth World Conference onWomen and the Second United Nations Conference onHuman Settlements  will all contribute to betterunderstanding of the problems faced by developingcountries and assist the evolution of a global consensusand the mobilization of adequate resources to addressthese problems effectively.We do not  however  support the creation of newbureaucracies. There are already enough institutions.What we need are better terms and a speedier reaction toestablished needs.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to beplagued by the modern-day problem of the illicitproduction  trafficking and consumption of drugs andpsychotropic substances. This scourge poses a serious3threat to the well-being of our people and threatens todestroy the social and moral fabric of our communities.The archipelagic nature of our State  its many baysand cays and the mountainous terrain and rich alluvial soilof mainland Saint Vincent are characteristics that attractmany visitors to our shores and provide scarce foreignexchange to assist us in the development of our country.These very features  however  operate against us in our waragainst the illicit production of drugs and their distributionby drug barons and their associates. Due to our limitedresources  we are unable to police and control our bordersand coastlines effectively.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports everysingle measure taken by the United Nations to cope withthis serious problem  and calls for continued efforts toeliminate this global scourge.At the local level  we have been taking forceful stepsto confront this evil — pursuing a dynamic drug-abuse-prevention drive and at the same time launching majoradministrative  legislative and judicial initiatives against themarketing and trafficking of drugs.My country has viewed with great interest themeasures taken by the Secretary-General to revitalize theUnited Nations so that it is better prepared to attain theobjectives of the Charter. In particular  I wish toemphasize the active peace-keeping role of the Organizationin the resolution of conflicts that originated before the endof the cold war and of new tensions emerging in hot spotsaround the world. The peace-keeping forces operatingunder the United Nations flag perform a fundamental roleby paving the way to dialogue and negotiation  thuspreventing prolonged confrontations.We wholeheartedly support this major peace-keeping peacemaking and peace-enforcing thrust of the UnitedNations. However  we feel that the criteria used infinancing the forces involved must be re-examined. Thecost of such operations is beginning to prove quiteburdensome for both the Organization and its MemberStates  especially those  like Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  with a limited resource base. We look forwardto efforts to alleviate the financial burden placed on smalldeveloping States by the frequent deployment of suchoperations.Today  as we prepare to mark an important milestonein the history of the United Nations  and as we approachthe beginning of the twenty-first century  we look forwardto a world where democracy  peace  sustainabledevelopment and human welfare are be available to all.Mankind has spent almost half a century in pursuit ofthese goals. Let us continue the struggle and never tirein its pursuit."
"173",7362,"VEN",49,1994,"On behalf of the Government and people of Venezuela I wish to congratulate you  Sir  Minister of ForeignAffairs of Côte d’Ivoire  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I amconfident that under your guidance the Assembly will atthis important session contribute to progress in thecarrying out of the important task with which theOrganization is charged - the constant quest for peace.I also take pleasure in paying tribute to Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  whose intelligentand expert leadership have given the world fresh hope  aswe are about to enter a new millennium  so that we maybe optimistic about the future  even though there are stillgrounds for concern.The twentieth century  which is drawing to a close has witnessed momentous events for mankind. Twoworld wars  which cost an enormous number of humanlives and immense physical  economic and cultural losses demonstrated the extent to which man is capable ofdestruction - above all  self-destruction. The world’spolitical map has been changed many times  withpredictable consequences.Science and technology have made remarkableprogress. The discovery of antibiotics has providedundreamt-of opportunities for surgery. Surgeons have6converted the human body into a fruitful field foroperations capable of correcting natural defects and injuriesarising from circumstances prevailing in an increasinglycomplex society. Life expectancy has risen steadily  andterrible endemic diseases that used to claim countlessvictims have vanished almost completely.Communications have been the greatest marvel of thiscentury. The twentieth century has been the era of radiobroadcasting and television. Important events occurring inany part of the world are immediately known in the mostdistant regions. The fax has supplanted the mails andimproved on the telegram and the telex. Communicationsare the principal reason why the inhabitants of this planetare gradually recognizing their role as members of a single vast community of nations.Of necessity  institutions have endeavoured to keep instep with the rapid and unremitting march of events. Bothinternal and international juridical norms are subject toconstant change. Fundamental concepts of nationality andsovereignty are being reconsidered  and formulas are beingsought so that inalienable and traditional rights may exist inharmony with the requirements of the supranationalcommunity. Amongst these values are the self-determination of nations and non-intervention  as laid downin the Preamble to our Constitution. Accordingly Venezuela has been and remains permanently disposed topromoting the peaceful spread of democracy to every nationon Earth  and especially to those of our continent. Wehave consequently supported efforts aimed at reintroducinga fully democratic system in those Latin Americancountries where it is not at present established. Theirsituation is inevitably of deep concern to us by reason ofhistory and natural affinities. For the same reason  though Venezuela did not support military intervention in Haiti despite the fact that the United Nations has lent itmultilateral and institutional support.At the same time  regional integration is expanding with profound effect on the exercise of rights within everycountry. This process is rapidly leading to hemispheric anduniversal integration. For Latin Americans  the bicentennialof the birth of Antonio José de Sucre  the young man whoconsolidated our independence at the battle of Ayacucho will provide an opportunity to reassert the unbreakable linksof our solidarity. As we see it  the objective of theforthcoming meeting of Heads of State or Government convened by the President of the United States  will be theencouragement of a genuinely democratic system in theAmerican continent and throughout the world. It is ourhope in this regard that there will be a commitment to fightwithout quarter against poverty and an effectiveagreement to stamp out corruption.The United Nations has managed to avoid most ofthe obstacles that caused the failure of its immediatepredecessor  the League of Nations. Next year it willcelebrate its first 50 years of existence: a time in which amidst contradictions and disappointments  it has provideda unique forum for constant dialogue  in every languageand in the most contrasting tones. It has madeuninterrupted progress and shown a willingness to acceptthe structural changes that changing times have imposed.For this reason we are awaiting further changes  such asthe expansion of permanent representation on the SecurityCouncil to Latin America by granting Brazil permanentmembership. Latin America has every right to this byvirtue of its spiritual strength and its constant espousal ofliberty and international friendship.However  despite all the progress achieved  it isundeniable that we are still a very long way from havingestablished a stable  universal peace or a harmoniouscoexistence amongst nations. Nor have we developedstandards of living that permit all social strata in thevarious continents to enjoy a fitting human existence  witha satisfactory world-wide level of equity in socialrelations.The struggle for human rights has spreadsignificantly  and international treaties have been signedto ensure that protection of such rights transcends allborders. But the basic human right to life itself  the rightto work and the right to have enough to eat for healthyliving are far from having been secured for a considerablepart of mankind.The momentous International Conference onPopulation and Development  recently held in Cairo seemed to be based on the assumption that it isimpossible to guarantee development interpreted asparticipation by the whole human being and by all humanbeings in economic and social processes - if thepopulation continues to increase. This is because manycountries have not ensured  as is essential  that everyonewho is born will have the means to enjoy a decentexistence. In my country  at the beginning of the century a time of manifest poverty and backwardness  there wasa saying that every child was born with an arepa underthe arm. ""Arepa"" is a bread made of maize and is apopular staple of the daily diet. This saying has nowdropped out of popular usage.7In spite of the dramatic repercussions of the eventsfollowing the destruction of the Berlin Wall  peace has notyet been achieved. Just as we were ready to thrill withemotion at the arrival of universal peace  the Gulf Warawakened us from that dream. Recent conflicts in theformer Yugoslavia and in Rwanda  two countries sofundamentally different one from the other  have stirred upvestiges of barbarism that had supposedly disappeared forever. Religious conflicts and ethnic antagonisms  thoughtto have been overcome once and for all  have re-emergedwith unbelievable bitterness. Events recall the Biblicalcommentary of the Peruvian Victor Andrés Belaunde  anillustrious Latin American  greatly appreciated in the UnitedNations  who said that human beings bear the weight of acurse implicitly imposed by God when He cast them out ofthe Garden of Eden: Since they refused to be governed byGod  they would have to govern themselves.The United Nations faces a constant challenge: thequest for peace. It is clear that peace will not be achievedsimply through political discussion or diplomaticnegotiation  still less through the mere use of force. It hasoften been said by knowledgeable speakers that peace is thefruit of justice: that is  without some degree of justice peace is unattainable.That was understood by the negotiators at Versaillesat the end of the First World War when they included intheir Peace Treaty a lengthy clause devoted to theInternational Labour Organization and inspired by thenotion of social justice. Undoubtedly  however  the needfor justice goes far beyond international conventions andrecommendations with regard to labour  and meeting thatneed is becoming a matter of increasing urgency.The rapid process of globalization we are witnessingis unstoppable and unavoidable. The steps being taken inthis direction are dictated by the state of today’s world andthe demands of the immediate and mid-term future. Theconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of theWorld Trade Organization represent undeniable progress formankind. The bilateral and multilateral agreements reachedon all continents are signs of progress and stimulate thecreation and exchange of wealth. It is neverthelessessential to introduce into relations between Statesinstruments that will prevent commercial interchange frombecoming an economic war to the death. It is inappropriateto transfer to social relations the concept of the struggle forexistence in the sense that nature itself  through thisstruggle  will automatically ensure the survival of the fittest -in other words  the absolute predominance of the strongestand the disappearance of the weakest. The acceptance ofsuch an idea would be a crime against humanity.It must be recognized that the United Nations and itsimportant subsidiary bodies have made great efforts toalleviate the sufferings and shortages of those sectors ofhumanity where the standard of living is below what isdeemed humanely indispensable. It is encouraging tonote that institutions directly related to the United Nationssuch as the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund recognize that the fight against poverty must be atop priority. It is not  however  enough to givehumanitarian assistance to the neediest. It is essential toafford nations the conditions they require to enable alltheir inhabitants to compete efficiently  to ensure theirhealthy survival and to encourage their progress.It is true that economic-liberalization measures inless-developed countries have produced positivemacroeconomic results  but in some countries that pointwith satisfaction to the tremendous economic progressthey have achieved one can note  at the same time  agrowing concern about that portion of the population thatis living in poverty and  even more distressing  in criticaland even extreme poverty.I share the aspiration voiced by the President ofColombia to a new model of development for ourcountries  for an ""alternative model "" as he put it whenaddressing the Assembly. He proposed the establishmentof""a new and more productive citizen in the economy a citizen who participates to a greater degree inpolitics and who is more supportive in the socialsphere."" (Official Records of the General Assembly Forty-ninth Session  Plenary Meetings  5th meeting [p. 27])In recent years my country  Venezuela  has faced adifficult economic situation and disquieting socialcircumstances. Undeniably  the blame lies largely with us.Grievous mistakes in running the country and thepoisonous plague of corruption are the principal causes ofthe acute crisis we are experiencing  but external factorshave also played a part. I am not here to pronouncejudgement on the past. As I have pledged to mycompatriots  I must find ways of restoring the confidencethat is indispensable if coming generations are to be able with training and hard work  to avail themselves of theopportunities the country has to offer. Seriousinstitutional problems - such as the legal proceedings8against two former Presidents of the Republic  one ofwhom was suspended from office while still President -have been handled within the legal system with strictadherence to the Constitution. The people’s conduct hasbeen truly exemplary. The natural resources with whichprovidence has endowed us and the favourable prospectsguaranteed by our human resource  our people  who havealways demonstrated intelligence  creative audacity andcourage in times of danger  inspire us with optimism. Werealize that we must seek within ourselves the essentialelements that will enable us to win the struggle fordevelopment to which we are so seriously committed. Wehave put forward an economic stabilization and recoveryprogramme that has been in large part accepted. It lays outa feasible and clearly defined course that will ultimatelylead to a solution of the crisis. However  we feel that weare in duty bound to explain to international forums  andmost particularly to this world forum  the need forfavourable prospects to open up that can help us to avoidexerting our efforts in vain and ensure instead that they willbe successful and will contribute to a better future formankind.For example  when considering the need to strengthentrade relations throughout the world we must call forguaranteed access to the markets of the developedcountries  where mechanisms are sometimes in place thatare skillfully used to exclude our competition. We agreewith the need for environmental protection for the benefitof the world’s inhabitants  and we are certainly ready tocontribute to that goal. However  we must make the pointthat on more than one occasion the ecological struggle fora healthy environment has been hypocritically used as away to prevent developing countries from gaining access tothe markets of wealthy nations. We further believe thattransfer of technology must be wide ranging and genuine for if it is not the gap between us and the developedcountries  which increases every year  will ultimatelybecome impossible to bridge and will lead to a sharp andbitter rift between two sectors of mankind  withunforeseeable but undoubtedly disastrous consequences.Access to capital is a requirement that is becomingever more acute as technological advances make productiveprocesses more capital- and less labour-intensive. At thesame time  there must be fair payment for the raw materialsthat represent the principal contribution of theunderdeveloped countries to international trade but that areconstantly losing their relevance in end products.Consequently  access to capital must be arranged onequitable terms to protect the interests of producers  whoare often obliged to accept conditions that are little morethan adhesion contracts. This struggle to obtain betterprices for raw materials  which are almost invariablysubject to conditions imposed by consumer countrieswithout any real participation by the producers  and theestablishment of reasonable terms for international loansare part of the struggle for justice and an integral part ofthe struggle for peace.The external-debt problem of the developingcountries is still far from being solved. It is true thatthere have been negotiations on restructuring and thatthey have temporarily alleviated the dreadful burden thatproblem represents for the debtor countries  but as therepayment deadlines fall due the burden for those in debtbecomes harder to bear with the passing of every year.To cite a concrete example: in my country next year’sdebt servicing payments will amount to 35 per cent of thenational budget  and in coming years the situation willbecome even more acute. The drop in the price of ourmain export has made it very difficult to meet the basicneeds of our population. We have never given anythought to disavowing our obligations. We are resolvedto meet them  but we consider that this subject must beplaced on international agendas and that a search mustbegin for a broad solution that will open up new horizonsof justice and peace.I believe that as we approach the beginning of thesecond half of the United Nations first century thefundamental aim of the United Nations must be the searchfor justice in relations among peoples.Social justice has been one of the most importantachievements of this twentieth century that is nowdrawing to a close. This demands of every individual andevery group whatever is required for the common good.Above and beyond the numerical equality of commutativejustice  it also requires of all of us that we make acontribution to the community of nations in proportion toour individual possibilities. This concept has still notgained acceptance in the international field. It is true thatthere have been some minor concessions to the mostneedy countries but there is a lack of any clear coursetowards the achievement of universal well-being. It is notonly States that should be the agents. Once the door wasopened by the International Labour Organization (ILO) international organizations also provided access forunofficial bodies. The large transnational corporationswhich have and exercise real power must becomeinvolved in the management of programmes that will seekpeace through justice; economic justice in so far as it9concerns them; and respect for the sovereignty of bothlarge and small States.Those of us who love freedom; those of us who havestruggled to achieve it  regardless of cost and sacrifice;those of us who consider democracy and respect for humanrights as priority objectives; those of us who sincerelyyearn for friendship and fruitful understanding among allnations; those of us who believe in dialogue and resolutelysupport the endeavours of the United Nations to encourageit - all of us desire to see the United Nations displayingunflinching determination that the search for justice - andI shall never tire of repeating this - must play a key role inthe building of peace.If peace is our goal let us strive to make justice itsfoundation. In this way we shall realize the ideal whichour Liberator  Simon Bolivar  visualized as the mostimportant goal of the best system of government: ""thegreatest possible degree of happiness""  in other words happiness for all."
"174",7401,"VNM",49,1994,"First  allow me  on behalf of thedelegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  tocongratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. I am confident that  under your guidance andwith the active contributions of member countries  thissession of the General Assembly will have a successfuloutcome. I also wish to take this opportunity to expressour admiration for the efficient performance of yourpredecessor  Mr. Samuel R. Insanally. We greatlyappreciate the great efforts made by Mr. Boutros-Ghali inhis high post as Secretary-General of the United Nationsin the cause of peace  national independence anddevelopment.5The United Nations is approaching the final year of itsfirst half century of existence. The most appropriate wayfor us to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization is to help it act in a manner commensuratewith its global role and with the important  difficult andcomplex tasks set out by the new world situation. Sincethe last session of the General Assembly  we havewitnessed immense and profound changes in the world asa whole and in each region. Mankind is confronted by bothopportunities and challenges. It is the task of each countryand of the international community as a whole to realize thenoble aspirations of mankind  to overcome the obstacles tosettling global and pressing issues and to promote peace cooperation and development.The world panorama is full of contradictions. Whilethe threat of a destructive world war has been furtherchecked  ethnic  religious and territorial conflicts continueto persist or even multiply in a number of regions. Againstthis disturbing backdrop  there have been some rays of hopethat certain conflicts in the world will be settled. Thesuccess of the struggle waged by the South African peopleto abolish apartheid and establish a new united  democraticand non-racist State in South Africa constitutes a historicachievement for the South African people  the UnitedNations and the world community. The Vietnamesedelegation warmly welcomes the delegation of the newSouth Africa to the General Assembly.In the Middle East  encouraging progress has beenmade  particularly between Palestine and Israel and betweenJordan and Israel  in the negotiating process and the searchfor peace. These developments foster hopes of reaching ajust and lasting peace in the region and of restoring thePalestinian people’s rights to self-determination and anindependent State in their own land.Over the past year there have been certain positivedevelopments in the world economy. In a number ofcountries there have been signs of recovery. Globalism andregionalism have accelerated. Economic competition isacute and  in this context  the developing countries continueto bear innumerable disadvantages. A considerable numberof these developing countries  however  are beset bypoverty and backwardness; with every passing day millionsof people are threatened by starvation. The developingcountries hope that  with the conclusion of the UruguayRound and the decision to establish the World TradeOrganization  trade and investment will be expanded  thusstrongly enhancing international economic cooperation onthe basis of equality and mutual benefit.They cannot  however  help being worried aboutattempts to use social and environmental issues as fuel forprotectionism. This will affect the common sentimentsamongst the world’s nations at a time when joint effortsare needed to solve global issues in the interests of thedevelopment and advancement of every nation and of theentire international community.In an increasingly interdependent world in whichglobalism is being strengthened  there is continuouspressure to facilitate increased cooperation on the basis ofequal and mutual benefit and to narrow the gap betweenthe level of development of the North and that of theSouth with a view to securing sustainable and lastingpeace throughout the world.We therefore welcome the Secretary-General’sinitiative in producing his ""Agenda for Development"".We believe that through wide consultations betweenMember States we shall arrive at an agenda that respondsto common demands and will ensure that the UnitedNations plays an active role in facilitating economic andsocial development and the eradication of poverty inMember countries  thereby strengthening theOrganization’s important role in international economicrelations.We share the view - expressed by manydelegations - that the maintenance of international peaceand security and the promotion of development are thetwo paramount tasks of the United Nations. It is ourhope that the role of the United Nations in the field ofdevelopment will be strengthened in response to theexpectation of the countries of the world.There is an increasingly irresistible trend towardsdialogue and international and regional cooperation. Inour view  international cooperation should be based onobservance of the principles of respect for independenceand national sovereignty  non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States  mutually beneficial cooperation onthe basis of equality  the settling of disputes throughnegotiation and without recourse to force or the threat offorce. In today’s world of increasing awareness ofnational independence  respect for the right of nationsfreely to determine their own course of development andto maintain their national identity is an essential conditionfor the maintenance of peace and stability and for thestrengthening of international cooperation.Blockades  embargoes  sanctions and the impositionof conditions in international relations are relics of the6past. They run counter to the aspirations of peoples and tothe common trend and are contrary to international law.In this connection  we wish to express our deepsympathy with the Cuban people in respect of their currentdifficulties. We demand an end to the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. Wedemand also prompt and effective implementation of therelevant resolutions of the General Assembly. We welcomethe joint communiqué recently signed by the United Statesof America and Cuba on the question of Cuban emigrés.We hope that the two countries will continue their dialoguewith a view to settling other outstanding differencesbetween them.At a time of opportunities and challenges  of hope andfear  the United Nations bears  more than ever  a heavyresponsibility in regard to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. Never before has the United Nationsbeen directly engaged in dealing with so many hotbeds oftension throughout the world. Despite the Organization’sefforts  satisfactory solutions to the conflicts in Bosnia Somalia and Rwanda have yet to be found.The tendency to resort more and more to measures ofenforcement and intervention to try to resolve intra-Stateconflicts has prompted legitimate concern among manycountries. We share the view that United Nationspeace-keeping operations should strictly observe theprinciples of respect for national sovereignty and territorialintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of otherStates. We believe that the best way to secure the peacefulsettlement of conflicts is to persevere with dialogue.Lessons should be learnt from the successes and the failuresof peace-keeping operations in recent times. This wouldhelp the United Nations the better to discharge the tasksthat the Member States as a whole have entrusted to it.The complex world situation and the increasinglyimportant role of the United Nations urgently requirerestructuring of the Organization. In view of the growingdemocratization of international relations  we join thosedelegations that are demanding reform to democratize theUnited Nations system. This would include an increase inthe membership of the Security Council to make it morerepresentative  more in keeping with the changes that havetaken place in the world and more transparent in itsdecision-making processes. Revitalization of the work ofthe General Assembly as the body most representative ofthe interests of Member States is also necessary.Through the convening of international conferences such as the recent International Conference on Populationand Development  the coming World Conference onWomen and the World Summit for Social Development the United Nations has clearly demonstrated itscommitment to the promotion of international cooperationin the resolution of global social issues of vital interest toall nations.I should like to mention in this important forum aparticularly significant coincidence of history. As theUnited Nations prepares to celebrate its fiftiethanniversary  the Vietnamese people are looking forwardenthusiastically to commemorating the fiftieth anniversaryof President Ho Chi Minh’s solemn declaration to theentire world of the birth of an independent  free anddemocratic Viet Nam. Only now  half a century after itsbirth  is Viet Nam able to really concentrate its efforts onsocio-economic development.Located in the most dynamic development zone inthe world  Viet Nam is fully aware of the dangerconstituted by the widening gap between its level ofdevelopment and that of other countries of the region. Ithas therefore set itself the urgent task of rapidlyovercoming its state of poverty and underdevelopment inorder to join the stream of progress and development inthe region and in the world. Viet Nam has embarkedupon the path of reform and renewal in every sphere ofits society’s life. The core of this reform and renewal isthe development of a multi-sector economy operatingthrough a market mechanism and employing Stateregulation at the macro-economic level with a view tomaintaining the country’s socio-economic stability  alongwith the step-by-step establishment of a state of law ofthe people  by the people and for the people.The reform and renewal process has achievedimportant initial results. The average annual growth rateof our gross national product for the three years from1991 to 1993 was 7.3 per cent; for the first six months ofthis year  the rate rose to 8 per cent. Our internationaleconomic cooperation and trade relations and foreigninvestment in our country have grown rapidly. Ourpeople’s living conditions have been improved. Furtherprogress has been made in the cultural  social  educationaland health-care areas  especially regarding the care ofchildren.Along with economic reforms  Viet Nam hasgradually carried out the reform and renewal of itspolitical system in order to build a society in which the7rights of each and every one will be increasingly ensured.We continue to move forward in our efforts to establish astate of law  perfect the legal system and undertake nationaladministrative reform. After the promulgation of the newConstitution in 1992  our National Assembly adopted anumber of important laws  including the civil law  thelabour law  the land law  and the law on the promotion ofdomestic investment.With these achievements  Viet Nam is now shiftingtowards a new stage in its development - that of theindustrialization and modernization of the country. Thislong and arduous process has as its final objective aprosperous people  a strong nation and an equitable andcivilized society.To create a favourable international environment fornational construction and development  Viet Nam has beenpursuing a foreign policy of openness  diversification  andmultilateralization of its relations  while carrying out ourdesire to become the friend of all countries in the interestof peace  independence and development. We are pleasedto note that our policy is developing in complete harmonywith the general trend throughout the world  and especiallyin South-East Asia - that is  the trend towards pursuingpeace and cooperation in the interest of development  afterdecades of war and confrontation. In its implementation ofthis foreign policy  Viet Nam gives first priority toenhancing the relations of friendship and cooperation withneighbouring countries in the region  and to creating peace stability  cooperation and development in South-East Asia.Our bilateral relations with each of the members of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) andwith the Association itself  are experiencing rapid andsatisfactory growth  primarily in the economic andcommercial areas  particularly since Viet Nam became anASEAN observer in 1992. At the ministerial Conferenceof ASEAN held in Bangkok last July  the ASEAN ForeignMinisters unanimously supported Viet Nam’s fullmembership in this Association. With the increased supportof the ASEAN countries  Viet Nam is actively preparing totake all the necessary steps to join this Association as a fullmember. Viet Nam’s accession to ASEAN is in conformitywith the general trend towards responding to the interestsof the countries of the region and reinforcing regionalcooperation  especially in the economic and commercialareas  and at the same time facilitates the expansion of ourrelations with other countries and international organizations.In keeping with the new regional context  all 10countries of South-East Asia recently participated  for thefirst time  in the Conference of foreign ministers ofASEAN; an ASEAN Regional Forum  at which regionalsecurity was discussed  was also held for the first time on25 July last in Bangkok. All this demonstrates thegrowing cooperation in South-East Asia  as well as therobust movement towards the attainment of the commongoals of the region: peace  stability and security.In order to ensure the peace  stability anddevelopment of each country and of the region as awhole  Viet Nam is of the view that the countries of theregion should consolidate existing points of agreement narrow differences and settle disputes  including thoseregarding the Eastern Sea  through bilateral andmultilateral negotiations among those parties directlyconcerned  without resorting to the use or threat of force.While waiting and working for a fundamental and durablesolution  all the parties concerned should restrain fromany act that might further complicate the situation  and atthe same time strictly respect each country’s right ofsovereignty on the continental shelf and in the exclusiveeconomic zones  in keeping with international law andparticularly with the 1982 United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea.With regard to the Kingdom of Cambodia  Viet Namardently wishes to see its neighbour become anindependent  peaceful  neutral  non-aligned country maintaining friendly relations with all countries. It is VietNam’s policy to strengthen good-neighbourly relationswith the Kingdom of Cambodia and to respect theCambodian people’s right to self-determination. Weconsider that all signatories to the Paris Agreement onCambodia are bound to scrupulously observe thatAgreement  to refrain from interfering in that country’sinternal affairs and to actively contribute to the process ofnational reconciliation and the restoration of peace andstability in Cambodia.In the interest of maintaining and strengthening thetraditional friendly relations between Viet Nam andCambodia and of protecting the legitimate rights of theVietnamese residents who have been  for manygenerations  living in Cambodia  we wish to drawattention to the Immigration Law promulgated by theNational Assembly of Cambodia on 26 August 1994.Certain articles of that Law have given rise to someconcern. His Royal Highness King Norodom Sihanoukand the Royal Government of Cambodia share thelegitimate concern of the Government of Viet Nam andhave undertaken to avoid any regrettable consequencesand agreed to begin negotiations with Vietnam soon tosettle this problem.8The lifting by the United States of the embargoimposed upon Viet Nam has opened up new prospects forbuilding and broadening multi-faceted cooperation betweenour two countries in the interests of the two peoples and inthe service of peace  stability  cooperation and developmentin the region and throughout the world.We firmly believe that multilateral relations  especiallywithin the framework of the United Nations  are playing anincreasingly important role in international life. As wemove towards the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of our Organization  we shallbe reviewing all the activities of the past 50 years  drawingthe necessary lessons to enhance the capacity andeffectiveness of the United Nations system and to pursuetasks worthy of the confidence and expectations of thepeoples of the world. For its modest part  Viet Nam willunceasingly strive to make positive contributions to thecommon cause of the United Nations for peace development and social progress throughout the world."
"175",7510,"YEM",49,1994,"At the outset  Sir  please allow me  on behalf ofmy country  my delegation and speaking for myself  to joinprevious speakers in most warmly congratulating you and through you  your country on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. Your excellent qualifications  extensiveexperience  wisdom and detailed knowledge of internationalaffairs  give us confidence in that you will guide thedeliberations at this session to successful conclusions.I should like to take this opportunity also to expressour gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor Mr. Samuel Insanally  for the important role he played inthe forty-eighth session and for his tireless activitythroughout it. Similarly  fairness compels us to express ouradmiration and great appreciation to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his invaluable andunremitting efforts since he took up his post  to increase theimportance of the United Nations  make it more effectiveand maximize its ability to carry out its duties properly  andthereby to increase the confidence of mankind in general and every nation in particular  in the credibility of thisOrganization’s commitment to the purposes and principlesof its Charter. Foremost among those is the maintenanceof peace and security on the basis of justice and equality.It is our hope that he will continue to play his role with thesame enthusiasm and high-mindedness.Having studied the annual report on the work of theOrganization  which we have all received  we can say it iscomprehensive and accurate. The Secretary-Generaldeserves our gratitude and appreciation for the outstandingeffort he has put into drawing up that report  and inpresenting it in such a satisfactory form. However  weshould like to make some remarks on the references madein the report with regard to Yemen.As members are aware  our country  the Republic ofYemen  was earlier this year exposed to bloody sedition asa result of a dangerous conspiracy on the part of a handfulof treacherous mercenary elements who chose to isolatethemselves from the rest of their fellow countrymen  torebel against legitimate institutions  overturn constitutionallegality and trample on the Constitution  law and order with the aim of destroying the unity of the country  buryingit alive and aborting our experiment in democracy based onpolitical and party pluralism  which was successful despitethe shortness of the period during which it has been inplace.First  I should like to point out that history showsthat throughout the ages our country  Yemen  has alwaysbeen a single political unit  with the exception of a fewperiods of varying lengths during which it was subjectedto division or segmentation. Sometimes this was theresult of a power struggle  and sometimes the result oftotal or partial occupation by one or more foreign powers.However  it was never long before Yemen regained itsunity at the hands of its own people  who never lost sightof the fact that they are a single Muslim  Arab  Yemenipeople  and never forgot for one moment that theybelonged to one nation. Throughout the earlier decadesof this century  wherein our people struggled against thedictatorial rule of the Imam in the North and Britishcolonialism in the South  the unity of Yemen was theloftiest ideal of our people and its dearest nationalaspiration. Even after another State was established inthe South once it became independent of the UnitedKingdom on 30 November 1967  and after the revolutionof 26 September 1962 in the North  which swept awaythe reactionary rule of the royalist Imam and replaced itwith a republic  the return to Yemen of unity in the formof a single State remained an all-embracing  popular andinsistent demand. Our people never accepted that theseparation should continue once its national soil had beenliberated from the yoke of occupation. They persisted inrefusing to accept that abnormal situation and in resistingit by every means. Each of the two former YemeniStates adopted a name which emphasized the fact that itbelonged to one State called Yemen. Their rejection ofpartition led each of those States to refer to the other asits “other half”.Awareness of this strength of feeling among all ourpeople in support of the unity of Yemen and of theirrejection of partition made the successive leaders in bothSana’a and Aden spare no effort in vying with each otherand pressuring each other on the question of unity. Thisled to two outbreaks of hostilities between the two parts the first in 1972 and the second in 1979 and  throughout tension and conflict between them persisted and continuedto flare up from time to time.However  developments since the beginning of1986 — starting with the tragic civil strife between thepartners in power in the South and the comrades of theSocialist Party  the sole ruling party  followed by thepolicy changes in the Soviet Union culminating in the fallof regimes in the countries of what used to be called the16socialist  or Eastern  bloc and  finally  the end of the coldwar — all this created the right conditions for re-unitingYemen.Another factor was that the regime in the South  whichhad been tightly linked to the Soviet Union and its socialist-country allies  found itself unable to oppose internal andexternal enemies without strong international backing. Itwas therefore possible to agree to unite the two halves ofthe country on 30 November 1989  during PresidentLieutenant-General Ali Abdullah Saleh’s visit to Aden onthe twenty-second anniversary of the South’s independence and to persuade the then ruling Socialist Party leadership toaccept unification.On 22 May 1990 unity was peacefully and voluntarilyestablished in the form of a single State called the Republicof Yemen  a Republic based on democracy and pluralism.The first general parliamentary elections were scheduled totake place at the end of a period of transition of two and ahalf years  during which time Yemen was to be governedjointly by elements drawn from the leadership of each ofthe previous two “halves” of the country. However  astime passed and the agreed date for the scheduledparliamentary elections drew near  some high Governmentofficials from the leadership of the Socialist Party — theother governing partner at that time — began to createproblems and crises in order to prevent the holding ofelections on the agreed date. As a result  the elections werepostponed from November 1992 to 27 April 1993.The elections  when they finally took place  wereindeed free and fair  as was attested to by all those whotook part in monitoring them. Those monitors includedrepresentatives of States  organizations and institutesconcerned with democracy and the protection of humanrights and freedoms  side by side with journalists andcorrespondents from Arab and non-Arab news agencies. Inan editorial published at the time of the elections  The NewYork Times described them as“a true revolution in the furthest part of the SouthernArabian peninsula”.Despite the fact that the results of the election gavethe General People’s Congress  under the leadership of HisExcellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh  Chairman of thePresidential Council at that time  the sole right to form aGovernment  the President and his party favoured acoalition with the other two important parties: the Islahparty  the Yemeni Alliance for Reform (YAR) and theYemeni Socialist Party. This was inspired by a genuinedesire to strengthen the bonds of national consensus  toguarantee secure foundations and support for thesuccessful establishment of national unity  particularly inits early stages  and to guarantee continuity and survivalfor a democratic experiment which was still in its cradle.They also aimed at preventing conspirators andopportunists from having any leeway to exacerbatedisagreements or provoke armed conflict.Only a few weeks after the formation of thecoalition Government  on 31 May of that year  while thefreely and directly elected Parliament was preparing tocarry out its work and discharge its duties  there began toappear certain indications that a suspect plot was beinghatched. It was clear that elements of the leadership ofthe partner in the governing coalition  the Socialist Party who held important positions in the constitutionalinstitutions and  more precisely  in the PresidentialCouncil and the Cabinet of Ministers  were behind theplan. The prevailing belief was that the matter wasnothing more than an attempt to exert pressure in order toextract more concessions and a bargaining chip they usedto obtain more government posts or  in the very least  tomaintain positions in the Presidential Council when it wasre-elected  if that was decided. Again  it could have beenan attempt to secure the post of Vice-President of theRepublic if the form of the Presidency of the State wasgoing to be changed from a Presidential Council to arepublican presidency. Naturally  the results of thegeneral elections did not suit the ruling elements of theSocialist Party  despite their sharing in power and theimportant leading positions they held. That was perhapsdue to their addiction to being the sole ruling centralizedtotalitarian authority  their love of ruling without partnersand the fact that they lacked belief in the country’s unity and had no deep-rooted confidence in democracy  politicalpluralism or in free direct elections.Suddenly  without any reason or justification  inaccordance with a carefully planned time-table  thoseelements created a political crisis  and matters reached thepoint where an attempt was made to ruin or at least toparalyse the institutions and apparatus of the State and tousurp the constitutional legality derived from the will ofthe people through the ballot box and replace it with alegality derived from decisions taken as result of dialoguebetween different parties. Those conspiring elementswere not satisfied with that  despite the grave risksinvolved. Rather  their arrogance and disregard oflegality were carried to the point of wanting to imposetheir tutelage over the people and to impose anundeclared partition through the continual use of an17iron-fist policy and absolute control over a number ofGovernorates  which they used to rule by force andoppression in the days before unification.Despite all the generous concessions that continued tobe made from time to time by the leadership of themajority  under the direction of His Excellency PresidentAli Abdullah Saleh  who was at that time Chairman of thePresidential Council  the elements bent on separatismstepped up their challenge and their disregard ofconstitutional legality to the point of triggering hostilities inthe hope of bringing Arab or international forces to separatethe combatants and force each side to withdraw beyond theold borders dividing the two halves. Their aim was to putan end to unification  to declare another separate State onpart of the territory of the homeland  and thereby to revertto the situation that existed before 22 May 1990.However  our people stood behind our armed forcesand security forces  whose loyalty set them squarely on theside of legality. Those forces were able to turn the fightingdecisively in favour of unity and democracy  and by sodoing were able to abort the suspect plot and to maintainYemen as the unified single State it has been throughout itslong history.Today  Yemen has regained its stability and ensuredits security  after that ordeal  and has put an end to sedition.A general amnesty has been declared  and nationalreconciliation has been achieved. Those who fell prey todeceit and disinformation have returned to the nation toparticipate in political life  and they benefit from the spiritof tolerance which characterizes the political leadership ofPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh. Here I should like toemphasize to you and to the Secretary-General that no harmhas befallen any of those people and that none of them hasbeen put on trial. Most of them have gone back to theirnormal lives quite naturally. That was not all: the SocialistParty itself spontaneously elected a new leadership whichcontained many elements of the former leadership  andwent back to participating in political activity in completefreedom. Its representatives in parliament participate inparliamentary life just as they did before.Within the framework of the leadership’s attempts toensure the success and continued progress of ourdemocratic experiment  and in order to expand the basis ofpopular power sharing  the elected parliament  on 27September 1994  unanimously passed a number ofconstitutional amendments which provide for theintroduction of a local governmental system based on theprinciple of free and fair elections. They also decided tocreate a consultative council to be established byrepublican decree from experienced and highly qualifiedpersonalities from various regions of Yemen to widen andexpand the basis of representation and opinion.Last Saturday  1 October 1994  the Chamber ofDeputies — again in complete freedom — electedLieutenant General Ali Abdullah Saleh President of theRepublic in accordance with the amendment approved bythe Parliament regarding the organization of the nationalpresidency  which was amongst those constitutionalamendments.Our choice of the democratic option based onpolitical and party pluralism was not the result of pressurefrom any side  rather it was motivated by our convictionthat democracy is the best contemporary method ofgovernment. It represents the path leading todevelopment  progress  security and stability. However the continued success of our democratic experimentremains subject to economic growth. That requires anend to the economic war that continues to be wagedagainst our country. This is a war which takes manydifferent forms  including the closing of markets in othercountries of the region to our agricultural and industrialproducts. We therefore appeal to all our brethren inneighboring countries to lift all the barriers and removeall the obstacles to free trade and the movement of locallyproduced goods as an important step towards thenormalization of relations  and the strengthening ofbrotherly ties and regional cooperation.As an extension of the national reconciliationprocess which we have begun to implement withinYemen  despite all the events which have taken place hand in hand with that and in the same spirit  we callupon all neighboring countries to respond positively toour sincere initiative  to end the causes of dispute andresume normal relations  which will strengthen securityand stability in the Arabian Peninsula region  based ongood-neighborliness  mutual respect and non-interferencein internal affairs. The Republic of Yemen has animportant geographical and strategic position  asrepresented by its control over Bab al-Mandab  and theRed Sea and the Arabian Sea  which meet in its territorialwaters in the Gulf of Aden. The Republic of Yemen isaware of its responsibilities and of the importance of therole it plays in the maintenance of security and stabilityin the Arabian Peninsula region  of the Gulf in particular and the world in general.18In this context  we would like to appeal to the SecurityCouncil to lift the sanctions which are still in place againstIraq after such a long time  as the justifications for suchsanctions no longer exist. The suffering of the Iraqi peoplehas reached intolerable levels. Insistence on maintainingsuch measures will lead to deepening enmity and hatredbetween the States of the region. It is necessary to turn anew leaf and have recourse to dialogue in order to ensurethe security and safety of all sides concerned  in a spirit oflove and fraternity  and on the basis of respect for theindependence and sovereignty and legal rights of everyparty.On the basis of our membership in a wider nation  wefeel impelled to appeal to the Security Council to review itsresolutions against Libya  our sister country  and accept thereasonable solutions put forward by the Arab League which include the trial of the Lockerbie suspects before aninternational court  in accordance with the law of Scotland.With regard to the three islands disputed by the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran  we wouldlike to ask both countries to work towards resolving thisdispute between them through dialogue and mutualunderstanding based on respect for legitimate rights inaccordance with legal evidence.It is very important indeed that cooperation andcoordination between the United Nations and the League ofArab States should be strengthened  in the interests of theArab world in particular  and of the rest of the world ingeneral.The Middle East peace process has so far achieved anagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organizationand Israel on the one hand  and Jordan and Israel on theother. However  a just  comprehensive and lasting peace inthe region remains linked to the withdrawal of Israeli forcesfrom the Golan Heights and South Lebanon  therenunciation of the logic of power by the Tel Avivgovernment  and its acceptance of an independentPalestinian State in Gaza and the West Bank  includingHoly Al Quds.We cannot forget our beloved brotherly Sudan. Weunderscore the need to respect and safeguard its unity andcall for commitment to help it maintain that unity both onthe territorial and the human levels.The fact that our sister country Somalia remains in thegrip of fragmentation  anarchy and fighting  is deeplydistressing to us and makes our hearts bleed. We will doall we can to help our neighbour and its fraternal  Arab Muslim people to emerge from its terrible trial  byparticipating with other fraternal countries in theCommittee which it was decided to form by the lastsession of the Arab Foreign Ministers which was held inCairo. We hope this Committee will receive thecooperation of the United Nations.It is also a cause of deep sorrow that the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina remains a target of terribleaggression and continuous shelling by the Serbaggressors  while the world does nothing but makestatements and threaten to take measures which have yetto materialize. Perhaps the least that could be done as afirst step towards showing some determination in the faceof Serb persistent disregard for peace and security in thatimportant region  their trampling of the resolutions ofinternational legality  would be to immediately lift thearms embargo and to begin to supply arms to the peopleof Bosnia and Herzegovina  to enable them to defendthemselves against aggression.We have become ever more convinced that right willtriumph over injustice  the same as the people of SouthAfrica have done by eliminating apartheid and racialdiscrimination following such a long arduous struggle.We would like to express our happiness at seeing thisnew African State among us. We should also like toexpress to the pioneer of freedom fighters  PresidentNelson Mandela  our appreciation and respect. May wewish him all success and progress in leading his country particularly after leading his people a phase of strugglewith courage  resistance and steadfastness.It is important to mention here before concluding mystatement  that the accusations against Islam and judgingIslam from the point of view of certain acts of terrorismtaking place here or there because there are others whoare not Muslims who perpetuate acts of terrorism invarious parts of the world without having any accusationslevelled against their religions or their creeds. Wetherefore believe that we should all stand against anyattempt to distort the concept and image of Islam andagainst any allegations against it because Islam is areligion which rejects violence and terrorism  a religionthat calls for love  coexistence and peace.In order to show its respect and appreciation for theUnited Nations  the Republic of Yemen has formed anational committee to organize celebrations for the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of this international19Organization. We want our celebrations on this occasionto reflect the importance we attach to it.We should not miss the opportunity to refer also to theimportance of working to enlarge the representative base ofthe Security Council  so as to take into consideration theinternational changes that have taken place since theestablishment of the United Nations. One of the mostimportant of these is the emergence of two major economicpowers - Japan and Germany. They should join theSecurity Council as permanent members. There should alsobe just  permanent representation of regional groupings including the Arab region.Finally  we hope that the fiftieth anniversary of thisOrganization will be an incentive for renewing the vitalityand effectiveness of the United Nations  and anintensification of its role  in order to achieve the aims ofthe Charter in the light of the needs and requirements of thenew international changes."
"176",7576,"ZAF",49,1994,"It surely must be one of thegreat ironies of our age that this Assembly is beingaddressed  for the first time in its 49 years’ history  by aSouth African Head of State drawn from among theAfrican majority of what is an African country.Future generations will find it strange in the extremethat it was only so late in the twentieth century that it waspossible for our delegation to take its seat in theAssembly  recognized both by our people and by thenations of the world as the legitimate representative of thepeople of our country.It is indeed most welcome that the Organization willmark its fiftieth anniversary next year with the apartheidsystem vanquished and consigned to the past. Thathistoric change has come about not least because of thegreat efforts in which the United Nations engaged toensure the suppression of the apartheid crime againsthumanity. Even as it was still in the process ofestablishing its institutions  the United Nations wasconfronted by the challenge of the accession to power ofthe party of apartheid domination in our country.Everything that that system stood for represented the veryopposite of all the noble purposes for which theOrganization was established. Because apartheid reducedand undermined the credibility of the United Nations asan effective international instrument to end racism andsecure the fundamental human rights of all peoples  theestablishment and consolidation of apartheid constituteda brazen challenge to the very existence of theOrganization.6General Assembly 14th meetingForty-ninth session 3 October 1994The United Nations was born out of the titanicstruggle against nazism and fascism  with their perniciousdoctrines and practices of racial superiority and genocide.It therefore could not stand by while  in South Africa  asimilar system was being established by a Governmentwhich also had the temerity to claim representation withinthe United Nations.We believe that it was indeed of great importance tothe universal efficacy of  and respect for  the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the United NationsCharter that the United Nations should have spurned thepleas of the apartheid regime that the gross violation ofhuman rights in South Africa was a domestic matter of nolegal or legitimate concern to the world body.We stand here today to salute the United Nations andits Member States  both singly and collectively  for joiningforces with the masses of our people in a common strugglethat has brought about our emancipation and pushed backthe frontiers of racism.The millions of our people say ""Thank you"" and""Thank you again  because the respect for your own dignityas human beings inspired you to act to ensure therestoration of our dignity as well"".We have together traversed a course which we areconvinced has strengthened human solidarity in general andreinforced the bonds of friendship between our peoples andthe nations of the world. This dates back to the early dayswhen India put the question of racism in South Africa onthe Assembly’s agenda  to the moment when the worldcommunity  as represented here  could adopt consensusresolutions against apartheid with none dissenting.It was therefore with great joy that at our inaugurationas President of our Republic we received  among others such high and distinguished officials of the Organization asthe Secretary-General  the President of the GeneralAssembly and the Chairman of the Special Committeeagainst Apartheid. Their presence reaffirmed theincontrovertible truth that the victory over apartheid  thesuccess of the cause of democracy  non-racialism and non-sexism in our country belongs as much to our people as itdoes the United Nations.And so we have embarked on the road to the remakingof our country  basing ourselves both on the democraticConstitution  which came into force on 27 April this year and on the Reconstruction and Development Programme which has become the property of all our people.Clearly  these documents would have no life unlessthe people gave them life. The words printed in themmust inspire common ownership by all our people andtheir common allegiance to the process and the resultswhich these documents intend. For this to happen  as wepropagate the vision these documents contain we must atthe same time engage in a historic effort of redefinitionof ourselves as a new nation.Our watchwords must be justice  peace reconciliation and nation-building in the pursuit of ademocratic  non-racial and non-sexist country. In all thatwe do we have to ensure the healing of the woundsinflicted on all our people across the great dividing lineimposed on our society by centuries of colonialism andapartheid.We must ensure that colour  race and gender becomeonly a God-given gift to each one of us  and not anindelible mark or attribute that accords a special status toany.We must work for the day when we as SouthAfricans see one another and interact with one another asequal human beings and as part of one nation united rather than torn asunder  by its diversity.The road we shall have to travel to reach thisdestination will by no means be easy. All of us knowhow stubbornly racism can cling to the mind and howdeeply it can infect the human soul. Where it is sustainedby the racial ordering of the material world  as is the casein our country  that stubbornness can multiply ahundredfold.And yet  however hard this battle may be  we willnot surrender. Whatever the time it may take  we will nottire. The very fact that racism degrades both theperpetrator and the victim commands that  if we are trueto our commitment to protect human dignity  we fight onuntil victory is achieved.We firmly believe that we who have particularexperience of the destructive and anti-human force ofracism owe it to ourselves to centre our transformation onthe creation of a truly non-racial society. Because weknow racism so intimately  we must stand a good chanceof developing and nurturing its opposite.It will perhaps come to be that we who haveharboured in our country the worst example of racismsince the defeat of nazism will make a contribution to7General Assembly 14th meetingForty-ninth session 3 October 1994human civilization by ordering our affairs in such a mannerthat we strike an effective and lasting blow against racismeverywhere.Some of the steps that we have already taken -including the establishment of a Government of NationalUnity  the orderly transformation of the institutions of Stateand the cultivation of a national consensus on the majorissues of the day - have started us off on a correct footingwith regard to continuing the processes leading to thecreation of the just society we have been speaking of.Our political emancipation has also brought into sharpfocus the urgent need to engage in the struggle to secureour people’s freedom from want  from hunger and fromignorance. We have written this on our banners: that thesociety we seek to create must be a people-centred society;all its institutions and its resources must be dedicated to thepursuit of a better life for all our citizens. That better lifemust mean an end to poverty  joblessness  homelessnessand the despair that comes of deprivation. This is an endin itself because the happiness of the human being must  inany society  be an end in itself.At the same time  we are intensely conscious of thefact that the stability of the democratic settlement itself andthe possibility actually to create a non-racial and non-sexistsociety depend on our ability to change the materialconditions of life of our people so that they not only havethe vote but have bread and work as well.We therefore return to the United Nations to make thecommitment that  as we undertook never to rest until thesystem of apartheid was defeated  so do we now undertakethat we cannot rest while millions of our people suffer thepain and indignity of poverty in all its forms.At the same time  we turn once more to this worldbody to say ""We are going to need your continued supportto achieve the goal of the betterment of the conditions oflife of our people."" We are pleased and inspired that boththe Secretary-General and the specialized agencies of theUnited Nations have taken up the development challenge inSouth Africa with the enthusiasm that they have shown.We believe that it is in the common interest that wesustain the common victory that we have scored in SouthAfrica  and take it further by achieving success not only inpolitics but also in the socio-economic sphere.It is perhaps common cause among us that everywhereon our globe there is an unmistakable process leading to theentrenchment of democratic systems of government. Theempowerment of the ordinary people of our world freelyto determine their destiny  unhindered by tyrants anddictators  is at the very heart of the reason for theexistence of this Organization.But it is equally true that hundreds of millions ofthese politically empowered masses are caught in thedeathly trap of poverty  unable to live life in its fullness.Out of all this are born social conflicts whichproduce insecurity and instability  civil and other warsthat claim many lives  millions of desperate refugees andthe destruction of the little wealth that poor countries areable to accumulate. Out of this cauldron are also borntyrants  dictators and demagogues who not only take awayor restrict the rights of the people but also make itimpossible to do the things that must be done to bringlasting prosperity to the people.At the same time  the reality can no longer beignored that we live in an interdependent world which isbound together to a common destiny. The very responseof the international community to the challenge ofapartheid confirmed this very point that we allunderstood - that so long as apartheid existed in SouthAfrica  so long would the whole of humanity feeldemeaned and degraded.The United Nations understood very well that racismin our country could not but feed racism in other parts ofthe world as well. The universal struggle againstapartheid was therefore not an act of charity arising outof pity for our people  but an affirmation of our commonhumanity. We believe that that act of affirmation requiresthat this Organization should once more turn its focusedand sustained attention to the basics of everything thatmakes for a better world for all humanity.The elaboration of a new world order must  ofnecessity  centre on this world body. In it we should findthe appropriate forum in which we can all participate tohelp determine the shape of the new world.The four elements that will need to be knit togetherin fashioning that new universal reality are the issues ofdemocracy  peace  prosperity and interdependence.The great challenge of our age to the United Nationsis to answer the question ""Given the interdependence ofthe nations of the world  what is it that we can and must8General Assembly 14th meetingForty-ninth session 3 October 1994do to ensure that democracy  peace and prosperity prevaileverywhere?""We are aware of the fact that the United Nations isaddressing these questions in many ways; yet there can beno gainsaying the fact that such progress as we have madehas been made more by stealth than in the bold anddetermined fashion that the world crisis demands today.Perhaps a new and forceful initiative is required. Suchan initiative should inspire all of humanity because of theseriousness of its intent. It should also have a chance tosucceed because it will have been underwritten by thecommitment of the masses of the people in each membercountry to join hands with other nations  to address togetherthe related issues of democracy  peace and prosperity in aninterdependent world.We are aware of the fact that the dictates of realpolitikmilitate against the speedy realization of such an initiative.But we do believe that the reality of life and the realism ofpolicy will  at some point  bring to the fore the fact that thedelay we impose on ourselves today will serve only toincrease the pressure on all of us to incorporate  withinwhat we consider possible  a sustainable vision of acommon world that will rise or fall together.Undoubtedly  to inspire greater confidence in itselfamong all the member nations and to reflect better theimpulse towards the democratization of internationalrelations  the United Nations will have to continue lookingat itself to determine what restructuring of itself it shouldeffect. This process must naturally affect  among others the structure and functioning of the Security Council andthe peacemaking and peace-keeping issues raised by theSecretary-General in ""An Agenda for Peace"".Democratic South Africa rejoins the world communityof nations determined to play its role in helping tostrengthen the United Nations and to contribute what it canto the furtherance of its purposes. Among other things  wehave this morning acceded to the covenants andconventions adopted by this Organization  which addressvarious matters such as economic  social and cultural rights civil and political rights  and the elimination of all forms ofracial discrimination  to say nothing of our irrevocablecommitment to the realization of the objectives containedin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We are determined to play our full part in allprocesses that address the important question of thenon-proliferation and elimination of weapons of massdestruction. Our Government has also decided to becomea signatory to the Convention on prohibition andrestrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons.In a similar vein  we shall not be found wanting inthe quest for sustainable development that is in keepingwith the Rio de Janeiro Declaration on Environment andDevelopment as well as with Agenda 21.Equally  our own national interest dictates that wejoin forces with the United Nations and all its MemberStates in the common struggle to contain and end thetraffic in narcotics.Even in constitutional terms  we are committed tothe advancement of the objective of the emancipation ofwomen through the creation of a non-sexist society.Apart from anything else  we are therefore activelyengaged in the preparations for what we are convincedwill be a successful Beijing Conference.We are part of the region of southern Africa and thecontinent of Africa. As members of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  and an equal partner with other MemberStates  we will play our role in the struggles of theseorganizations to build a continent and a region that willhelp to create for themselves and all humanity a commonworld of peace and prosperity.Ours must become a continent free of such tragediesas those that have afflicted our own country as well asRwanda  Somalia  Angola  Mozambique  the Sudan andLiberia. Happily  the OAU is actively addressing theissues of peace and stability on our continent.We are greatly encouraged that the countries of ourregion  faced with a crisis in Lesotho  acted togetherspeedily and  with the cooperation of the Government andthe people of that country  succeeded in demonstratingthat together we have the will to defend democracy  peaceand national reconciliation.Furthermore  as members of the Non-AlignedMovement and the Group of 77  we are committedespecially to the promotion of South-South cooperationand to the strengthening of the voice of the poor anddisadvantaged in the ordering of world affairs.We would like to take this opportunity to expressour appreciation to the members of the General Assemblyfor the speed and readiness with which they accepted the9General Assembly 14th meetingForty-ninth session 3 October 1994credentials of democratic South Africa  enabling us toparticipate in the work of the last General Assembly. Weare pleased to note that this same spirit characterized theapproach of other international organizations towards ournew democracy  including the Commonwealth and theEuropean Union.We would like to close by congratulating you  Mr.President  on your election to your high post  and weexpress our confidence that you will guide the work of theAssembly with the wisdom and sense of purpose for whichwe admire you.The millions across our globe who stand expectant atthe gates of hope look to this Organization to bring thempeace  to bring them life  to bring them a life worth living.We pray that the new South Africa  which the GeneralAssembly helped bring into being and so warmly welcomedamong the community of nations  will  in its own and in thewider interest  make its own contribution  however small to the realization of those hopes.Our common humanity and the urgency of the knockon the door of this great edifice demand that we mustattempt even the impossible."
"177",7619,"ZMB",49,1994,"Let me join therepresentatives who have spoken before me incongratulating you  Sir  on your unanimous election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninthsession. You represent a country  Côte d’Ivoire  whichhas played and continues to play an active role in theframework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)and in the United Nations. You bring to the presidencyvast experience in the area of international relations aswell as diplomatic skill and acumen  which puts you in13good stead to steer the deliberations of the GeneralAssembly to a successful conclusion. You can count onmy delegation’s unqualified support and cooperation.I also wish to express my delegation’s sincereappreciation to your predecessor  His ExcellencyAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  who presidedover the work of the forty-eighth session with greatdistinction and rare personal attributes.Our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  has continued to provide outstandingleadership in the discharge of his duties. Zambia isparticularly grateful to the Secretary-General for hisuntiring efforts in pursuit of world peace and security development and international cooperation.The past year has been one of mixed blessings on theinternational scene  a year of notable achievements andfailures. In the view of Zambia  the most positivedevelopment of the year was the achievement of majorityrule in the Republic of South Africa. My delegation isreally delighted to see in our midst the delegation of ademocratic and non-racial South Africa  led by PresidentNelson Mandela. President Mandela was the symbol of theliberation struggle in South Africa and it is thereforebefitting that he  an icon of the liberation struggle  shouldbecome the first President of a new South Africa.The return of South Africa to the family of the UnitedNations is without a doubt due to the tenacity uncompromising commitment and dedication of ourbrothers and sisters in South Africa who bore the brunt ofthe evil system of apartheid. At the same time  it cannot bedenied that South Africa’s victory over apartheid and itsrejoining the United Nations is a concrete manifestation ofthe seminal role played by this Organization.In order to consolidate the democracy achieved inSouth Africa and address the negative social and economiclegacy of apartheid  substantial international assistance isimperative. In this regard  Zambia endorses the appealmade by President Nelson Mandela for international supportto South Africa to enable the effective implementation ofits reconstruction and development programme.A democratic  peaceful and prosperous South Africawill no doubt have a positive impact on southern Africa andthe African continent as a whole. Indeed  South Africa’scontribution as a member of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community has already begun to be felt andappreciated. It has  together with Botswana andZimbabwe  also played a highly commendable role in thepeaceful resolution of the constitutional problem inLesotho. We have every confidence  therefore  that SouthAfrica will contribute positively to the work of the UnitedNations.Africa has had a few other bright spots. We aredelighted with the peaceful resolution of the territorialdispute between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.The positive developments in Burundi towards a peacefulresolution of the long-standing conflict are commendable.However  the situation remains volatile. There istherefore a need to sustain international engagement.With regard to Angola  it is indeed gratifying thatthe talks between the Government of Angola and NationalUnion for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which have been taking place in Lusaka  Zambia  for thepast eleven months under the chairmanship of the UnitedNations Secretary-General’s Special Representative Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye  have made tremendousprogress. We therefore look forward to a successfulconclusion of the talks by the end of October  culminatingin the signing of a peace agreement  by the middle ofNovember 1994  on the basis of the Bicesse Accords  andthe pertinent resolutions of the Security Council.In this regard  we take this opportunity to commendboth the Angolan Government and the UNITA delegationfor their seriousness and commitment to the task offinding a peaceful solution to their country’s fratricidalwar. We also thank the observers to these talks  namelythe United States  the Russian Federation and Portugal.Sustained international assistance to Angola will benecessary in the post-agreement era and Zambia willcontinue to assist the people of Angola during this period.In Mozambique  we look forward to the holding ofthe first multiparty elections  scheduled to take place on27 and 28 October. We commend the MozambicanGovernment and RENAMO for committing themselves tothe United Nations peace initiative and to the RomeAgreement. We applaud the role that the United Nationshas played through its peace-keeping efforts and inhelping to prepare the people of Mozambique for theforthcoming elections. As a gesture of solidarity with thepeople of Mozambique  Zambia has made a modestcontribution to the United Nations peace-keepingoperation.14In Malawi  we welcome the recent peaceful anddemocratic transition to a multiparty system of government.We endorse the appeal made by President Bakili Muluzi forinternational assistance to consolidate democracy and toassist in the reconstruction of the country. My Governmentalso commends the technical and advisory services providedby the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat of theUnited Nations.Zambia welcomes the positive trend towardsdemocratization on the African continent. Why shouldAfrica democratize? Africa should democratize because itis our firm belief that democratic systems of governmentpromote good governance  transparency and accountabilityin the administration of public affairs  independence of thejudiciary  and respect for human rights and the rule of law.These qualities lay a firm basis for peace and stability andare thus conducive to sustainable development. We wouldtherefore urge all of our development partners to takeaccount of all these positive developments in theformulation of their development policies towards Africa.They should also endeavour to explain to their taxpayersthe significance of these democratic changes and theircorrelation to sustainable development. The electorates ofthe North must be made to appreciate that it is in theirenlightened self-interest to support developing countries.There is now much hope in Africa. Indeed  Africa  in thelong run  holds the promise of a positive and prosperousfuture.In the Middle East  we welcome the positivedevelopments in Palestine following the agreements anddeclarations between the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO) and Israel  as well as between Jordan and Israel. Itis our sincere hope that progress can also be achieved inthe negotiations with the Syrian Arab Republic andLebanon. International assistance is urgently required forthe reconstruction  rehabilitation and other essential needsof the Palestinians.We commend the efforts deployed by the leadershipof the PLO and of Israel  their tenacity and theirdetermination to work for peace. We also commend thecrucial catalytic roles played by the United States ofAmerica and the Russian Federation as co-sponsors of thetalks. The Kingdom of Norway also deserves our gratitudefor its contribution to the peace talks. The sustainedsupport and commitment of the Arab League to the peaceprocess also merit special mention.On the other hand  negative developments abound inAfrica and elsewhere on the international scene. Theseconflict situations continue to defy durable solutionsthrough dialogue  reconciliation and negotiation  in starkcontrast with the exemplary cases I have just cited.Thus  in our region  the civil wars in Liberia Rwanda  Somalia and the Sudan torment us all because ofour aversion to fratricidal and ethnic violence and theserious humanitarian crises they have engendered. In thisconnection  Zambia also strongly condemns ethnicviolence wherever it occurs  including in Bosnia andHerzegovina.We deplore the further deterioration of the situationin Liberia. We regret the lack of progress towardsdisarmament  demobilization and general elections. Weappeal to all the parties to commit themselves to theCotonou and Akosombo Peace Agreements. We alsowish to stress the need to maintain the Military ObserverGroup of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOMOG) in Liberia and to provide it with therequisite logistical support.As for Rwanda  we and the entire world communityhave been deeply shocked by the genocide and the mostdehumanizing spectre of violence in that country resulting in one of the worst humanitarian and refugeecrises in the history of mankind. Zambia has expressedits strong condemnation of the genocide and mindlessviolence in Rwanda. We strongly feel that thoseresponsible for the massacres must be brought to trialthrough an international tribunal. Conditions of peace security  stability and confidence should be created inRwanda in order to facilitate the repatriation of refugeesfrom overburdened neighbouring countries. We hope thatthe new Government will commit itself to carrying out itsdeclared intention to work for reconciliation  rehabilitationand reconstruction in Rwanda. Substantial assistance forhumanitarian  rehabilitation and reconstruction purposesis thus crucial. The neighbouring asylum countries alsoneed assistance.The role and efforts of the United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in creatingconditions of stability and security in the country arecrucial. We therefore deeply regret the delay in thedeployment of UNAMIR troops to the level of 5 500 inaccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.In this regard  African countries have been ready andwilling to send sufficient troops. However  the majorconstraint has been inadequate logistical support.15As a token measure  Zambia has contributed apeace-keeping contingent of civilian and military personnelto the UNAMIR operation  thanks to the generous logisticalsupport  in materiel  from the Netherlands. Furthermore the Zambian Peace Corps  a non-governmental organization has organized activities to raise funds to purchasemedicines  food and other humanitarian requirements forthe displaced people in Rwanda.We remain concerned by the continuing crisis inSomalia and by the lack of progress. We note  however the genuine efforts being deployed to resolve the crisis.Notwithstanding the difficulties  we strongly believe thatthe continued presence of the United Nations in Somalia iscritical.In Sudan  the continuing civil war and factionalfighting in the south and the deteriorating human rightssituation nationwide are a cause of serious concern to us inZambia. We urge the parties to reach a negotiatedsettlement.As to Haiti  Zambia reaffirms its support for theefforts of the Organization of American States and theUnited Nations to restore democracy and respect for humanrights there  in accordance with the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.With regard to Cuba  we reaffirm our belief that thetime has come for the economic  commercial and financialembargo against Cuba to be lifted. We hope that our twofriends the United States and Cuba will resolve theirdifferences peacefully. In this regard  we are encouragedby the recent dialogue between the two countries.Zambia attaches great importance to the role ofregional organizations in addressing conflict situations. Inthis respect we note with satisfaction the increasingly activerole played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) including at regional and subregional levels  to address theroot causes of conflicts and to prevent  manage and resolvethem.In particular  in June of last year the OAU establisheda mechanism for the prevention  management and resolutionof conflicts in order for Africa to deal effectively withconflict situations on its own. For too long and too often Africa has relied on external assistance to resolve itsconflicts. The time has come for Africa to handle thesesituations resolutely. Conflicts continue to sap Africa’senergies  to waste its scarce resources and to retard itsdevelopment. They must be eliminated in order to createan environment conducive to economic and socialdevelopment.Zambia therefore appeals to the internationalcommunity to contribute generously to the OAU Fundestablished to sustain the Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution. Internationalsupport is critical to the effective implementation of thisimportant initiative. It is warranted by the fact that theUnited Nations  through the Security Council  exercisesprimary responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security.It is now evident that peace and development notonly are interrelated but are indivisible. This has beenbrought into prominence by the comprehensive reports ofthe Secretary-General entitled ""Agenda for Peace"" and""Agenda for Development"". Indeed  in a number ofconflict situations poverty and deprivation have been theunderlying causes. There is  therefore  a compelling caseto bring development and related issues to the centrestage of the United Nations  in order to promote the causeof peace in its most comprehensive perspective.We therefore welcome the Secretary-General’spreliminary report on the ""Agenda for Development"". Mydelegation fully supports the views of the Group of 77 onthis subject  as reflected in its Ministerial Declaration of30 September 1994. In particular  an Agenda forDevelopment must be action-oriented and focus on theeconomic growth and development of the developingcountries  especially the least developed amongst them.The Agenda for Development must strengthen the role ofthe United Nations in the area of international economicpolicy-making and coordination.Africa is in economic crisis. It continues to facegrave economic difficulties. Africa therefore needs afavourable international economic environment for thepromotion of investment flows  increased officialdevelopment assistance  technological transfer  improvedtrade opportunities and better terms of trade. Africafurther needs a viable and comprehensive solution for itshuge debt burden. Such a debt strategy should includedebt cancellation. In this regard  we fully support thepositions of the Group of 77 and the Non-AlignedMovement.Zambia welcomes the conclusion of the UruguayRound and the Agreement to establish the World TradeOrganization (WTO) with effect from January of nextyear. It is our expectation that the World Trade16Organization will promote a non-discriminatory andpredictable trading system and protect the rights andinterests of the developing countries.In view of the increasing economic disparity betweenthe developed and the developing countries  the WTO willnot start on a level playing field. In this connection  it isthe strong view of my delegation that the implementationof the Uruguay Round must be monitored constantly toensure that the interests of developing countries areadequately protected. Compensation should be provided tothose developing countries that are facing difficulties particularly the least developed.Let me now address Zambia’s economic and politicalsituation. On the economic front  we have followed resolutely  a credible macro-economic reform programmewhose main objective is to promote growth with stabilitybased on an equitable allocation of resources. The mainpolicy thrusts of the programme include strict control of themoney supply and credit  with the aim of keeping inflationto minimal levels; liberalization of the economy withgreater reliance on market forces; and implementation ofthe privatization programme  through which previouslyState-owned enterprises are to be turned into privateconcerns in order to reduce direct Government participationin the economy.Although these measures are expected to yield positiveresults in the long run  they have had some short-termnegative effects  such as a drastic reduction in employmentlevels in the formal sector  a decline in income level  anda marked increase in both the level and the intensity ofpoverty  especially in the rural areas and among thevulnerable segments of the population. To cushion the poorfrom these adverse effects of economic adjustment  a socialsafety net has been created to assist those who lose theirjobs or who are unable to meet their basic needs or obtainsocial services. It is going to be a long haul  but theZambian Government is determined to rise above thesechallenges.I should be remiss if I did not express gratitude to allour development partners for the economic  financial andtechnical support rendered to our country. The supportprovided Zambia by our development partners will serve tounderpin our structural adjustment programme  to which ourGovernment remains committed. More importantly  suchassistance will help to consolidate our democratizationprocess  which we initiated in 1991 with the reintroductionof plural politics. In this regard  my delegation is pleasedto assure the international community that Zambia’sdemocratization process remains firmly on course.There is a strong connection between the plan ofaction adopted at the Cairo Conference on Population  theWorld Summit for Social Development  to be held inCopenhagen early next year  and the World Conferenceon Women  to be held in Beijing  next September. TheWorld Summit on Social Development will be anopportunity for the international community to renew itscommitment and political will to effectively address anumber of social and economic problems.The contribution made by women to developmentefforts is very clear  although it is often underestimated.We therefore look forward to Beijing’s programme ofaction  which we trust will ensure the full and equalparticipation of women at all levels of human activity.With regard to the environment  the internationalcommunity is faced with the major challenge of givingpractical effect to the concept of sustainable developmentas reflected in Agenda 21. To do this  effectiveinternational cooperation is vital. In particular  practicalsteps must be taken to provide access to appropriatetechnologies and to mobilize new and additional financialresources for the countries in need: the developingcountries. My delegation therefore calls on the developedcountries to fulfil the solemn commitments undertaken atthe Rio Earth Summit. At the same time  the task at handis global and must thus be shared globally. It involvesindividuals  community groups  non-governmentalorganizations  Governments and financial institutions. Inthe language of the Earth Summit  ""common butdifferentiated responsibilities"" (A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I)Principle 7) is now imperative.Zambia attaches high priority to environmentalissues. As a reflection of our commitment  we haveformulated a National Environmental Action Plan aimedat integrating environmental concerns into oursocio-economic development plans. We have takendeliberate measures to increase the level of publicawareness of environmental issues  particularly throughthe active involvement of non-governmental organizationsand community groups.My Government is firmly committed to thepromotion and protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms. We believe that it is the duty andresponsibility of all Governments to do so  regardless oftheir political  economic or cultural systems.17In the aftermath of the Vienna World Conference onHuman Rights  we should work to implement its importantrecommendations. Accordingly  my delegation will supportgenuine efforts in this direction during the current session.My delegation welcomes the establishment of the Office ofthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and theappointment of Mr. José Ayala Lasso to this high office.Mr. Lasso has already proven his suitability for theappointment  and we commend his important initiativesconcerning human rights situations in Africa and elsewhere.My delegation also supports the strengthening of the UnitedNations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.My Government has also established a Human RightsCommission  which is responsible for investigating allegedhuman rights violations in Zambia  including thosecommitted prior to the reintroduction of plural politics in1991. In the spirit of our policy of transparency  theGovernment will publish the Commission’s findings in areport to be made available to the general public. Zambiais thus firmly committed to the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and to other relevant international covenantsand instruments.In the area of disarmament and arms control  mydelegation strongly supports efforts to accelerate theelimination of nuclear weapons and to conclude acomprehensive test-ban treaty. We also fully support thereview and extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty(NPT)  which is scheduled to take place next year.However  we share the view that any extension of the NPTshould be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament and tothe conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.Zambia welcomes the significant progress achieved inthe Geneva negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.We further support the case for a convention onconventional weapons and welcome the introduction of theUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms with a viewto promoting transparency and confidence-building.Zambia welcomes the successful conclusion during theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly  of theagreement relating to the implementation of part XI of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  whichopened the way for the universal acceptance of theConvention and its provisions.Let me now turn to the United Nations itself. As wemeet in this session on the threshold of the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of the United Nations  we haveto recognize that the fundamental meaning of the UnitedNations Charter has remained unchanged; that the UnitedNations has undergone periods of both triumph anddisillusionment; that the United Nations is still aninternational organization for the people as well as of thepeople and it is therefore supposed to be a democraticinstitution. It is now time to reflect on a United Nationsthat will serve mankind for another 50 years after 1995.It will have to be a new United Nations  one which willsuit the exigencies of the twenty-first century. It will benecessary to sharpen the mechanisms that wereestablished to give effect to the declared principles andpurposes of the Charter. It is only by going through thismetamorphosis that our Organization will be able to adaptto a changed and changing environment  to new demands new opportunities and new challenges.In this connection  my delegation is of theconsidered view that expansion of the membership of theSecurity Council is extremely important. Regions of theworld  such as Africa  that are not represented at the levelof permanent membership should be so represented. Itwill  therefore  be incumbent upon those regions to agreeon which country or countries should represent them aspermanent members.Apart from dealing with the Security Council  wemust fashion the United Nations in such a way as toaccord a central role to issues of the development of thedeveloping countries. The Economic and Social Councilshould therefore be attuned to meeting this challenge. Wewould like to see a stronger Economic and Social Councilwith a mandate adequate to coordinate the policies of alldevelopment programmes and activities  as well as theactivities of the specialized agencies  including theBretton Woods institutions  for the promotion of sustainedeconomic growth and development.We now live in a world in which there has been amajor recasting of international relations ranging frompolitical to economic  environmental to humanitarianissues. In this new atmosphere  the United Nations is thelinchpin of our collective security  the repository of ourhope for progress and prosperity. In this atmosphere  theUnited Nations has no greater contribution to make in theservice of its ideals than to help the world find its wayfrom the era of fear from which we are emerging into atime of hope and progress for all mankind.We wish this great creation more success for thebetterment of the entire world."
"178",7655,"ZWE",49,1994,"My delegationcongratulates you personally  Sir  as well as your country Côte d’Ivoire  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election istestimony to the role you and your country have played ininternational relations. We are confident that the UnitedNations will benefit from the term of your presidency.Allow me also to congratulate your predecessor  HisExcellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana  on hisoutstanding stewardship of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. His conduct of the many complex andvital issues before that session was indeed praiseworthy.Our tribute also goes to our Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his sterling leadership of ourOrganization during the past year  a year in which it hascontinued to face ever-increasing challenges. We areespecially grateful to him for his continued efforts tofurther the objectives of the United Nations in Africa andelsewhere  and for his tireless drive to enhance theOrganization’s role in maintaining international peace andsecurity and addressing development issues.My delegation would like  at the outset  to welcomethe delegation of South Africa in our midst. Itsreadmission into the community of nations signifies victoryin its long and difficult struggle for justice and equality.For the African continent  it marks the closing chapter inthe total decolonization of the continent; and for the UnitedNations  it concludes an extraordinary collective struggleagainst the policy of apartheid.In this context  I must add that the recent decision bythe General Conference of the International Atomic EnergyAgency to redesignate South Africa as Africa’srepresentative on the Agency’s board was indeedappropriate and welcome.However  in welcoming South Africa back to ourinternational Organization  we should also heed the wordsof President Nelson Mandela - uttered from this rostrumonly a week ago - that his country needs massivefinancial and material aid to cope with the problem of themillions of poor and unemployed people in his country.While the triumph of democratic forces in SouthAfrica is cause for celebration  the tragic situation inAngola continues to be a source of major concern to mydelegation. We are gravely concerned at the continuedconflict in that country. If the peace accord negotiated inLusaka is not signed by the end of October  the SecurityCouncil should immediately impose economic sanctionson UNITA  as agreed in resolution 864 (1993). Wecannot continue delaying and postponing action whilewaiting for a peace that does not come. However  if thepeace accord is signed  the United Nations  for its part should stand ready to deploy a greatly increasedpeace-keeping force to supervise the cease-fire.In Mozambique  despite delays in theimplementation of the General Peace Agreement  we arehopeful that peace and stability will soon be realized.The forthcoming national elections  planned for 27 and 28October  should produce results acceptable to allMozambicans so that they can live in peace and harmony.The international community and the United Nationsshould continue to provide the material assistance that isneeded to realize that peace in Mozambique.Members are aware of the crisis situation that hadbeen developing in the Kingdom of Lesotho since thebeginning of the year  which culminated in the attemptedunseating of the democratically elected Government. Wehave just heard a statement by the Prime Minister ofLesotho himself  Mr. Mokhehle  describing to us theevents that took place in his country. Consistent with theOrganization of African Unity mechanism for theprevention  management and resolution of conflicts  theSouthern African Development Community (SADC)charged Botswana  South Africa and Zimbabwe withundertaking a regional initiative to resolve the crisis inLesotho.We are happy to report that this joint mediation hasresulted in the restoration of constitutionality andconstitutional Government in that country. Prime MinisterMokhehle has adequately described that situation  and Ineed add nothing more.In Rwanda  the horrendous acts of genocide we havewitnessed will surely haunt every one of us for a long timeto come  both those among us who had the means to actbut did not do so and the many who  while desiring to help lacked the means. We call for the strengthening of theUnited Nations presence under the United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)  as an essentialconfidence-building measure to provide the displacedpeople of Rwanda with tangible assurances that they cansafely return to their homes. A few days ago we heard astatement by the President of Rwanda  Mr. PasteurBizimungu  inviting an increase in the size of UNAMIR inorder to achieve precisely what we are asking for:confidence-building.In both Rwanda and Burundi  the tensions are still tooclose to the surface for anyone’s comfort. In Somalia  thedeterioration of the security situation and the resurgence ofinter-clan fighting  banditry and lawlessness are still asource of great concern to my delegation. The people ofSomalia should take full advantage of United Nationspeace-keeping efforts and of the OAU mediation effort ledby President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia  and forge apolitical settlement based on sharing the power among theSomali nation as a whole. Zimbabwe has contributed twobattalions to peace-keeping in Somalia. As we startgradually withdrawing those battalions  we hope they willnot be called back to a Somalia where law and order havebroken down again.We are glad that the Identification Commission of theUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in WesternSahara (MINURSO)  has begun its work  and we urge bothparties speedily to resolve any outstanding impediments tothe holding of the referendum in that country - and weknow from debates in this Hall that there have been manyimpediments. The quest for self-determination in WesternSahara has taken too long  and has remained on ourinternational agenda for a long time. It should therefore notbe delayed any further.My delegation also welcomes the recent majordevelopments in the Middle East peace process which havebrought the people of Palestine closer to their inalienableright to self-determination. While we fully support thatpeace process  we believe that it should proceed on thebasis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1975)  and that the internationalcommunity should continue to monitor developments inthat region closely so as to generate and maintain themomentum for change. The people of Palestine still needand deserve our continued support until they reach thegoal of nationhood in a Palestinian State with its capitalin Jerusalem.We from the African region are particularly mindfulof the inextricable link between peace  security andstability on the one hand and socio-economicdevelopment on the other. There can be no economicdevelopment without peace and stability. Central to thesefundamental concerns about peace and stability are thebasic issues of protecting human rights and democraticgovernance. We believe that high priority must be givento these issues in our national policies. Consequently dictatorial and non-democratic regimes should be shunnedand isolated by all of us and by the internationalcommunity at large  as well as by regional organizations.The curtailment of people’s participation indecision-making processes undermines the capacity ofcountries to provide all their people with even the basicnecessities of life including food  water and shelter andbasic social services such as education and health.Zimbabwe believes that international efforts topromote peace  stability and security where these do notexist or are threatened can largely be facilitated throughregional organizations and good neighbours. We inAfrica have taken concrete measures in this regard byestablishing a permanent mechanism of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) for the prevention  managementand resolution of conflict. It is in keeping with the spiritof regional arrangements that the countries belonging tothe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) joined hands in addressing the situation inLiberia - work that still continues - and that we in theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) tookthe initiative in Lesotho to which I have already referred.In our view  such arrangements could also be devised toaddress situations elsewhere in our continent  for examplein Rwanda  Burundi and Somalia. What we are urging isthe involvement of regional organizations  subregionalorganizations and neighbourly countries in conflictresolution and conflict management  because they knowthe problems and they know the issues.For such regional arrangements to becomesustainable it is essential that other regional organizationsand the United Nations extend a helping hand by8providing financial and other material assistance. Forindeed  what are initially regarded as internal or localconflicts have the potential  if left unattended  to grow intotrouble spots threatening international peace and securityitself.This is an auspicious time for the family of nations tofurther the goal and achieve the objective that the foundingfathers of our Organization had foremost in their minds: -that of disarmament. In this context  my delegation is ofthe view that the extension and review Conference of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)scheduled to be held in March 1995 is a unique opportunityfor practical steps to be taken to ensure the total eliminationof nuclear weapons. Clearly  the treaty itself isdiscriminatory and the nuclear-weapon States have not fullyimplemented their obligations under article VI of theTreaty. Several speakers today have referred to theinadequacies of the Treaty. We will not support anyindefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT in itspresent form. The nuclear-weapon States must undertaketo reduce and eliminate their nuclear arsenals within anestablished and binding timetable. As a demonstration oftheir good faith they must also stop impeding the earlyconclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Only thenwill a nuclear non-proliferation regime be meaningful.Last year the Non-Aligned Movement submitted adraft resolution asking the Assembly to request an advisoryopinion from the International Court of Justice on thelegality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.This was in pursuance of a long-standing position of theNon-Aligned Movement favouring complete disarmament.Regrettably  that draft resolution was not brought to thevote. We are  however  glad that the Non-AlignedMovement has this year decided to submit the draftresolution once more  and to press it to the vote in theAssembly. This initiative is deserving of the strongestsupport of all members. In recent years nucleardisarmament has become a bilateral issue; yet theinternational community has a right to play a central role inensuring that the nuclear threat  which affects all mankind is removed forever. If the Assembly were to request anadvisory opinion from the International Court of Justice nuclear disarmament would be brought back into themultilateral forum where it belongs  so critical issuesrelated to nuclear proliferation and nuclear controls couldbe discussed openly and commented upon in the GeneralAssembly. It would also be consistent with the Secretary-General’s recommendation on resort to International Courtof Justice advisory opinions in his report entitled ""AnAgenda for Peace"" and would give impetus to the processof nuclear disarmament  which has begun to flag in thepost-cold-war era. The Non-Aligned Movement is to becongratulated for having taken this initiative this year; wehope it will gain the support of the Assembly.We all agree that there have been so many changeson the international scene that the present Charter andmethods of operation of the United Nations should berevised to meet the challenges and aspirations of a newand changing world order.In this regard  my delegation has already put forwardsome very specific proposals  which I will not recapitulatein any detail here. Those proposals are now part of theAfrican common position paper which refers to thepowers of the Security Council  the General Assemblyand the relationship of those bodies to the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and to the specialized agencies. This subjecthas been referred to by a number of speakers from thisrostrum; indeed  the speakers from Africa have repeatedthe African common position.It is quite clear that the present arrangement  whereAfrica and the Latin American region are not representedat all amongst the veto-wielding permanent members ofthe Security Council  should not be allowed to continue.The underrepresentation of these two regions is bothundemocratic and unfair  and I hope that the matter willbe addressed at the appropriate time in terms of theAfrican common position.Furthermore  any exercise in the revitalization of theUnited Nations should envisage coordination of theactivities of the Bretton Woods institutions to which Ihave already referred.We are pleased that world-wide socio-economicproblems of equitable utilization and distribution ofresources are going to be fully addressed at the Far SocialDevelopment World Summit in Copenhagen next year.Several important conferences have recently been heldwithin the framework of the United Nations: the RioConference on Environment and Development and theInternational Conference on Population and Developmentheld in Cairo in Cairo. We are now looking forward tothe World Summit for Social Development  to be held inCopenhagen next year  and the Fourth World Conferenceon Women  to take place in Beijing later next year.These conferences all address matters that are vitalto the South and/or to the third-world countries as awhole  and we hope that the social development Summit9will focus on growing poverty in the world and how toattack it. The rapid development of science and technologyis taking place in the middle of increasing poverty anddisease amongst large population groups  especially in thethird world. It is time we took enormous steps to eradicateworld poverty and to create full employment. We hope thatthe combined efforts of the environment and populationConferences  to which I have already referred  and thesocial development Summit and the Beijing Conference willmobilize the international community for a final andsustained attack on world poverty.Zimbabwe believes that at the national level it isimperative that development put people first by promotingsocial development through employment-creationopportunities and other poverty- eradication programmes.In our view  the provision of adequate food  water andshelter as well as such basic social services as education training and health is an absolute imperative. In thepromotion of opportunities for increased popularparticipation  the enhancement of the role and status ofwomen requires paramount attention.Employment creationrequires greater private initiative and increased investment.Thus domestic policies have to be pursued with the aim ofcreating a favourable environment for investment.The critical economic situation in Africa - the leastdeveloped and most marginalized of all the regions of theworld - has to be addressed if global economic growth andinterdependence are to have any meaning at all. With 90per cent of all poverty stricken people in developingcountries  the eradication of poverty remains a majorconcern at both the national and the international levels.Yet neither the economic reform measures which we arecarrying out nor our efforts to alleviate and eradicatepoverty can be expected to succeed without the provisionof adequate financial resources on a predictable  assuredand continuous basis  and we appeal to those countries thathave surplus resources to increase their support and aid tothe developing countries.For most developing countries the issue of resourceflows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debtproblem  a problem that has also been addressed in manystatements to the Assembly. Figures available clearlyindicate that the overall debt of the developing countries isstill on the increase - from some $800 billion in 1982 to$l.4 trillion in 1992 - and it continues to rise. Combinedwith the interest rates  the figures are constantly growing indeed becoming staggering. We believe that new comprehensive and coordinated approaches to the debt anddebt- servicing problems have to be adopted  includingoutright cancellation or at least the application of themeasures proposed under the Trinidad terms for low-income developing countries.Zimbabwe believes that the expansion ofinternational trade is essential to economic growth and isindeed an integral part of development. We thereforeconsider the conclusion of the Uruguay Round ofmultilateral trade negotiations to be an importantachievement which deserves to be welcomed bydeveloping and developed countries alike. We alsowelcome the landmark agreement to create the new WorldTrade Organization  which we hope will reinforce themultilateral trading system. We welcome the meetingsthat have been arranged both in Africa and elsewhere tostudy the impact of the Uruguay Round agreement andthe World Trade Organization on our economies.We reiterate the hope that these developments willimprove the access of developing countries’ exports tomarkets in developed countries  and that the newconditionalities or new forms of protectionism under theguise of social or environmental clauses will be avoided.Particular attention has also to be paid to the critical needfor the diversification of the African economies. In thatregard  we once again reiterate the need for theinternational community to support our proposal for thecreation of a diversification facility for the developmentof the African commodity sector.Finally we would urge the big Powers - andespecially the United States - to adopt a policy ofdialogue rather than confrontation in resolving disputeswith smaller Powers around the globe. In particular  wewould urge full-scale discussion and dialogue with Cubaaimed at normalizing relations with a small neighbouringcountry in the American region  dialogue with Libya inorder to get a fair and just trial for those suspected ofcausing the Lockerbie air disaster  and the continuation ofthe meetings with the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea in order to resolve the issues related to nuclear-weapons development and  hopefully  pave the way forthe reunification or North and South Korea.With the end of the cold war  global peace - somuch coveted -is now within our reach. A concertedeffort by regional organizations and the internationalcommunity can get us to the promised land ofinternational peace. We should try and try again  but theattainment of peace is not the task of internationalorganizations alone: it is also the task of nationalGovernments and national leaders.10In this context we would like to appeal to the leadersin the Gulf to pursue the path of peace that has beencharted for them by the United Nations in severalresolutions  and to assure them that any attempt atoccupying other countries in the Gulf  such as the one wewitnessed in 1991  will not be accepted by the Assembly orby the international community as a whole."
